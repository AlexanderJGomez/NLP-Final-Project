Vice President Joe Biden emphasized the issue of income inequality to a gathering of major donors and activists Friday night, telling them Democrats will work to address it to help working people, an attendee at the event told CNN.
The vice president said key Democratic policies and philosophies resonate among Americans.
He got emotional, according to the participant, when he recounted how his father could not get a loan for him to attend an Ivy League university -- and he said people in such situations need the country's help.
Biden did not talk about whether he'd run for president, something that he has been openly considering.
