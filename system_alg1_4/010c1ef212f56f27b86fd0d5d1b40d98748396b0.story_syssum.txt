It was a Friday evening in February when Adrian Vasquez, an 18-year-old from the town of Rio Hato, Panama, accepted an invitation from two friends to accompany them on what was proposed as an overnight fishing expedition.
Arnaldo Vasquez, the teen's father and a hotel worker, asked fishermen to search for them along the shore from which they had departed, and his mother prayed at home with relatives and friends.
"After 28 days of anguish, after praying to God that he be found alive ... this is indeed a miracle," de la Cruz said.
She said her son told her the fishing trip had started out well.
De la Cruz said they ate raw fish and drank rainwater.
Reached Wednesday by phone, de la Cruz said her son "has been sleeping a lot.
De la Cruz said her son is "a very loving and hardworking young man" who enjoys spending time with his brothers and loves soccer.
"For us, this is an opportunity to get closer as a family, to be more understanding and loving," she said.
