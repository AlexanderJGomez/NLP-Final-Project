But how is it that Rosol, ranked 100th in the world and having won just 17 ATP Tour matches prior to Thursday, can rise to the occasion and defeat an 11-time grand slam winner such as Nadal?
"Truly believe and, as a result, you give yourself a real chance of both playing well and achieving victory in the moment.
"In tennis, when any highly-ranked player is taken to five sets, or three in the women's game, the lower-ranked player drops their level.
But Rosol did not drop his level.
"He played to win, backed himself and held his line at the critical time.
Would be shocked if Rosol can get anywhere near that form again."
"Who cares, sport is about on the day, on your merit, and Rosol took his chance, he had a go and backed himself on the day and was rewarded.
