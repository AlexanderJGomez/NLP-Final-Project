Oceanside, New York (CNN) -- Deployed to a volatile outpost in southern Afghanistan where U.S. Marines routinely face a mix of skirmishes and hidden explosives, Greg Buckley Jr. sensed that an attack was imminent.
"The guy turned around and said to Greg, 'We don't want you here.
"Greg said, 'I thought I was going to lose my mind,'" his father said.
"One of his superiors came over and had Greg apologize to the guy," said the elder Buckley.
About a month later, Greg phoned his father again.
Greg also asked his father to prepare to tell his mother and his two younger brothers that he'd be killed.
"It was only two days he had left there in Afghanistan," his father told CNN.
The killings have prompted suspensions of training new recruits while eroding the trust between NATO and its Afghan allies.
"It's not really day-by-day," said Greg's mother, Marina Buckley.
Back in Oceanside, the Buckley family on Friday attended the town's first home football game, where their fallen son had intended to watch his youngest brother play varsity for the first time.
After crossing into the end zone, Justin raised his hand to salute -- honoring his fallen brother.
