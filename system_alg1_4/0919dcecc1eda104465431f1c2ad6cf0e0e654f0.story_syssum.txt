The House of Lords, Britain's highest court, ruled in her favor on Thursday, ordering the country's director of public prosecutions to spell out the criteria under which it will seek to prosecute someone who helps another person commit suicide.
This decision means that I can make an informed choice, with Omar (Puente, her husband), about whether he travels abroad with me to end my life."
Purdy had been suing to force the British authorities to specify exactly when someone would be prosecuted for helping another person commit suicide.
The law doesn't make clear at what point a person has broken it -- whether it is illegal to sit with a person on the plane to the clinic, open the door of the car to the airport, or even help them arrange the trip.
Purdy had spent more than two years fighting the case through Britain's courts, arguing that the lack of clarity in the law violated her human rights.
Purdy has said she wants to die next to her husband.
British and European courts refused to guarantee that the husband of Diane Pretty would not be prosecuted for helping her to travel abroad to end her life.
