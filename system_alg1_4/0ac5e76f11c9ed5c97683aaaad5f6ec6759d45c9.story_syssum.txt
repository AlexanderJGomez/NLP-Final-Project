WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Former Republican Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska has been "cleared" by the Justice Department's request to dismiss his federal corruption convictions and drop all charges against him, his lawyer said Wednesday.
Sullivan said the Justice Department was forced to request the dismissal because of "extraordinary evidence of government corruption."
In a statement issued Wednesday morning, Stevens thanked the Justice Department and Attorney General Eric Holder for requesting that the charges be dropped.
Sullivan, who is not related to Stevens' lawyer, excoriated prosecutors during the trial and held the prosecution in contempt at one point.
In the motion it filed Wednesday, the Justice Department acknowledged that Stevens was not given access to notes taken by prosecutors during an April 2008 interview with Allen, the former chairman of an oilfield services company at the center of a corruption probe in Alaska.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, also commented on the Justice Department's request, saying, "Ted Stevens is 85 years old.
Sarah Palin said that Stevens "deserves to be very happy today.
Senator Stevens ... never gave up hope.
The Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility will review the prosecution team's conduct in Stevens' case, Holder said.
Many of the allegedly free services were given as part of the renovation of Stevens' Alaska home, prosecutors said.
