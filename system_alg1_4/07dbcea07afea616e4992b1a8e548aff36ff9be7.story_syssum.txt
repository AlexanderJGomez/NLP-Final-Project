It's called "Smile Pinki," and it's up for an Oscar, too -- nominated for best short documentary, which it won on Sunday.
Like millions of other children born with the lip deformity in developing countries, Pinki simply had to live with it and suffer the social consequences.
"Pinki was a depressed, sad, lonely, shy, young little girl, growing up on the periphery of the society in a little village," said Satish Kalra, director of Smile Train's South Asian region, after meeting with Pinki.
Pinki is now a real pistol, full of energy and confidence, and she has a fantastic smile too -- thanks to the Smile Train charity.
"She has absolutely and totally changed," said Pinki's surgeon, Dr. Subodh Kumar.
For Pinki and her dad, being able to see the film's director win an Oscar would be a thrill.
