Public polling in the run-up to Election Day showed that the electorate was going to skew toward Republicans by around 10%.
We saw a Republican win in a district that is traditionally held by Republicans -- by a significantly lower margin than in the past 60 years.
That wasn't enough to change the advantage Republicans held going into Election Day, but we came really close.
Yes, Republicans pumped money into this race.
What, then, was it about?
Republicans accused Democrats of $716 billion in Medicare cuts.
It's ironic because, by a strong majority, independents sided with the Democrat who was committed to fixing and improving Obamacare over the Republican who wants to repeal it.
But the "be afraid" message works well for Republicans, in part because the Democrats don't counter it.
Let's face it, more Republican voters filed and submitted absentee ballots than Democrats, and more turned out on Election Day.
Democrats believe that when more people vote, it's not just good for our party, it's good for democracy.
Many of our voters require information and must be contacted way ahead of Election Day -- and reminded of what's at stake.
After all, the Republican in charge of electing Republicans to Congress said before the election, "special elections aren't too predictive for either side going forward."
