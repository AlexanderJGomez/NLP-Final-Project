(CNN) -- Venezuelan opposition leader Henrique Capriles has announced that he will run in next month's presidential election to replace the late Hugo Chavez.
Capriles, 40, ran against Chavez last year and lost.
"His aim is to provoke the Venezuelan people," Maduro said.
The sharp exchange gave a potential preview of what the campaign period might look like -- angry, bitter and deeply divided.
I will follow his orders, but I need the help of the people," Maduro said, according to VTV.
"The people will decide."
