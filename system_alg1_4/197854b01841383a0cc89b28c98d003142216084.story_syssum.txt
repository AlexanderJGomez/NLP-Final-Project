Blockbusters like "Finding Nemo" and Dreamworks' franchise "Shrek" have turned animation into a multi-billion-dollar industry, and a market once dominated by Disney is becoming crowded with competition.
And when Pixar merged with Disney he became one of the most powerful players in the movie business.
He told CNN, "I think that one of the nice things about Pixar is that they don't feel like they have discovered the secret formula to making a good movie.
But while Pixar and Disney may be the giants of animation they face formidable competition from another box-office monster -- Shrek.
Everything is inverted.
The success of the Shrek franchise, supported by other big budget features such as "Madagascar," has cemented Dreamworks' position as a major force in the animated world.
"The Simpsons Movie" is the world's longest-running animated television series, and fans have eagerly awaited its move to the big screen.
"Happy Feet" is a Warner Bros. film; Warner Bros., like CNN, is a unit of Time Warner.
