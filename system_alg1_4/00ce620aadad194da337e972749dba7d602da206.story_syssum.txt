(CNN) -- So we thought Asian kids did great in school.
But more surprising was the high level of racial bias against Asians and Indians -- professors were likeliest to ignore e-mails from these students.
... A lot of people think of Asians as a model minority group.
Seems to me Asians have done all right."
Whether due to bias or mere lack of interest, the professors in the study treated Asian and Indian students differently despite their reputation for academic achievement.
Some people definitely think so.
And at one of my very first legal job interviews, one judge put it succinctly: "I've always thought your people were very bright."
Why?
But it would be incredibly helpful and transformative for the gatekeepers -- in academia, the corporate world, public service, media, entertainment and the arts, whatever path talented young people might choose -- to recognize the subtle, unconscious biases that sometimes prevent Asians from achieving their true potential.
Maybe then Asians in America can be recognized for bringing more to the table than just being good at school.
