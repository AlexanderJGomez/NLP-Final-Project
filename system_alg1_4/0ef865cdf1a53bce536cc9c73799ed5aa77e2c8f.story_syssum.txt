"Now is not the time for violence and retribution," Banda said.
I wish him well in his years as president," Banda said Friday, according to a statement on his party's website.
"There is an atmosphere of peace now that the election is over," said Nanty Nkwachi, a resident of the second-largest city of Kitwe.
"I hope other African nations can learn from Banda," said Mutheliso Phiri, 36 .
The new president, a veteran politician who narrowly lost to Banda in 2008, is nicknamed "King Cobra" for his fiery tongue.
Analysts said despite Sata's stance, the new leader will not jeopardize ties with his nation's major investor.
It has a lot of young, poor but very educated youth with university degrees who feel disenfranchised and need the jobs the Chinese are providing."
Johnson said Chinese companies are "shrewd and diplomatic investors" and will ensure they accommodate the new government to tap into its resources and expand investments.
He has enjoyed popularity in the nation, but most young voters wanted him out to validate the fact that Zambia is a democracy, according to Phiri.
The United States looks forward to working with the new president and building on the partnership between the two nations, Obama said in a statement.
