Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- South Africans in the emerging middle class are becoming savvy consumers, now concerned with brands.
It's a phrase coined by South African marketing agency The Creative Counsel, describing individuals who live, breathe and promote a brand in specific zones of South Africa.
The Creative Counsel is a $50 million company helping multinationals to reach these million consumers; through doing so they are pioneering African marketing solutions.
Zonal champions will inform and educate members of the emerging middle class in South Africa on what to buy, and why they should buy it.
And to make sure the product will fulfill their needs, these consumers ask a trusted member of the community -- a zonal champion.
Vodacom is one of The Creative Counsel's clients; it too utilizes zonal champions to spread its marketing message to consumers who are hard to reach.
She says that this type of marketing is effective because it's in a language that consumers understand.
For the community, a big multinational such as Vodacom now has a face and a voice and can give one-on-one advice on a daily basis.
Neu-Ner says that they found a niche: "We found that there's a whole lot of people uneducated and previously probably unemployable, so to speak, and we found a methodology of training and managing these people so we can actually give them a job as a zonal champion or a brand champion, as someone who can drive a message into their communities.
"It means that if you're a brand that needs to support me in the community, create employment opportunities, gives me real product information, I will support you and buy your product -- one hand washes the other.
