But five years later, local officials say the city is much safer, and plans are underway to lure foreign tourists and investors back to Juarez.
U.S. Rep. Robert "Beto" O'Rourke of Texas was one of those on a leg of the Juarez tour.
"As a region, El Paso and Juarez represent 20% of all U.S-Mexico trade.
Juarez was at one time the deadliest city in the world."
It wasn't that long ago, O'Rourke says, that he thought twice about crossing the bridge into Juarez.
More than 3,000 people were killed in the city just four years ago, but so far this year there have been 89 killings, according to Castaneda -- a dramatic decrease in the violence.
"Undoubtedly, the work we did here in the past year with the police institutions, and specifically the local police, helped.
He cites the "30 million lawful crosses from El Paso into Juarez" last year as a symbolic step.
"For Juarez to be considered a safe city, there's a long way to go," says Sergio Meza, executive director for Plan Estrategico de Juarez, an independent organization that works to improve the city's quality of life.
But we're still very sick," Meza told CNN from his office in Juarez.
With more than 40% of Juarez living below the poverty line, according to Plan Estrategico de Juarez, the future of the city will depend on "the people's participation in public matters."
American companies Delphi, Honeywell, Flextronics and Lear are among those that ramped up hiring and investment in Juarez over the last year.
But with the average salary at $20 per week for local workers in the maquiladores, or factories, along the U.S.-Mexico border in Juarez, Meza says more needs to be done.
Longtime residents of Juarez and neighboring El Paso may be reluctant to say the wounds of the violent past have altogether healed.

"To go through what Juarez went through, you see life there again.
