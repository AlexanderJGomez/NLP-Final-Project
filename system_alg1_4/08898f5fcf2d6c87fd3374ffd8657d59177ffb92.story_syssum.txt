"It's very difficult to generate any kind of danger when you don't touch the ball," said Uruguay striker Luis Suarez, who scored a superb late consolation with a curling free-kick that matched the one by Italy's Andrea Pirlo against Mexico earlier in the day.
They are a candidate to win the World Cup," Suarez added.
With Spain in control, Uruguay's frustrations grew -- and the team which finished fourth at the 2010 World Cup and won the South American title the following year could have gone 3-0 down as Fabregas hit the inside of the post.
Veteran Juventus midfielder Pirlo celebrated his 100th international appearance with the opening goal in the 27th minute, curling a superb right-foot shot past goalkeeper Jose Corona.
He's the epitome of football and an example to everyone.
Mexico coach Manuel de la Torre said his players had hoped to play a cautious game and wear down the four-time World Cup winners.
