(CNN) -- Pakistan's much-awaited military offensive in North Waziristan was launched more than a week ago, and followed an attack on Karachi airport that left at least 36 people dead.
As of Wednesday, the government had registered over 450,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) who have been fleeing the area in view of the aerial bombardments and warnings by military authorities.
Beyond North Waziristan, the Pakhtun population follows the age-old custom of accepting and looking after "guests."
While local Pakhtuns and civic groups have been engaged, the response of the government authorities has been slow.
The government has established one camp in Bannu, but many more facilities are needed, especially during the hot summer season.
Pakistan's ethnic politics also impedes free movement of IDPs.
The people of North Waziristan -- and the tribal region FATA -- have been stranded between the military and the militants for more than a decade.
According to government officials, Pakistan has reported 65 polio cases from FATA this year of which 50 alone pertained to North Waziristan.
But, it is the local authorities that need more funds and broader mandates.
There is also an opportunity to rebuild FATA, which has been governed since the British times as a remote outpost of the Empire with little or no rights for the local population.
Local governments and courts are needed for the area.
For now, the country must tackle the growing numbers of homeless and avoid another catastrophe in the making.
