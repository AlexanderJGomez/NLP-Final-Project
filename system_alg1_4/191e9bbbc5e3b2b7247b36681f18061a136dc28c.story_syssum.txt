(Tribune Media Services) -- Be forewarned, Ireland is seductive.
As you explore the lush Dingle Peninsula, you'll see how the Emerald Isle got its name.
The Dingle Peninsula -- green, rugged, and untouched -- is my favorite Gaeltacht.
For 30 years my Irish dreams have been set here, on this sparse but lush peninsula where locals are fond of saying, "The next parish is Boston."
The Dingle Peninsula is worth exploring by bike or car.
While only tiny villages lie west of Dingle Town, the peninsula is home to 500,000 sheep.
Near the playground, students hide out in circular remains of a late Stone Age ring fort.
In 500 B.C.
Built without mortar by seventh-century monks, these huts take you back.
To give you an idea of their importance, Charlemagne, who ruled much of Europe in the year 800, imported Irish monks to be his scribes.
Because its endearing people have endured so much, Ireland is called "The Terrible Beauty."
From the Oratory, continue up the rugged one-lane road to the crest of the hill and then coast back to Dingle Town -- hungry, thirsty, and ready for a pint.
