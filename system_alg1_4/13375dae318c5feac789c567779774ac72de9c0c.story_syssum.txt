The trade in four conflict minerals -- tin, tantalum, tungsten (the 3Ts), as well as gold -- fuels the war in eastern Congo today.
We regularly travel to eastern Congo, and on our last trip, we traced the minerals from the mines.
By requiring that publicly listed manufacturers who use these minerals conduct independent audits of their supply chains, this legislation will help curb the conflict minerals trade.
Some minerals trading companies have also argued that Congress and the conflict minerals movement will force them to pull out of Congo, creating an embargo and hurting miners.
Companies now have an opportunity to achieve this goal and help Congolese communities through three key steps:
The reality is that the bill will accelerate this supply chain reform, and Intel and Motorola are already starting a forward-looking audit process to purchase tantalum from legitimate mines, including those in Congo.
Some companies may choose to temporarily stop buying minerals from Congo while they reform their supply chains.
Congress has taken the first step, but we still have a long way to go in ending the conflict minerals trade and the war in Congo.
