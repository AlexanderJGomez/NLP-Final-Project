New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Seventy-two police officers were killed in an attack early Tuesday by suspected Maoists in eastern India, authorities said.
There was no immediate report of casualties on the Maoist side, Kangale added.
Some 200 suspected rebels were also slain as forces moved into areas under insurgent control, he said.
"It is a matter of concern that, despite our efforts, the level of violence in the affected states continues to rise."
In 2008, 1,591 Maoist rebel attacks killed 721 people, according to government officials.
