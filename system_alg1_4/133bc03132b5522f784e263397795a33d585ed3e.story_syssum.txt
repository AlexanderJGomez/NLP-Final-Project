Like many women in the towns along the Afghan border, the 38-year-old Zari has only a grade-school education.
"They kept on making promises and never fulfilled them," she said.
That's a dangerous position in a region where the Taliban shot and grievously wounded a 15-year-old girl who pushed for sending girls to school.
"The village elders did not like the fact that I walked through the town to get to school," she said.
"I am now 38 years old, and I do not want any other little girls to be kept from going to school just because society doesn't think it is right or proper."
"I have promised her that I will do whatever she wants me to do in support of her."
