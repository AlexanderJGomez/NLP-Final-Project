Stores will open at 9 p.m. on Thanksgiving this year, reflecting a wider shift in the retail industry toward getting a head start on the biggest shopping day of the year.
Many other chains are open Thanksgiving Day, but their Black Friday sales don't start until midnight or Friday morning.
"It's one of few days retail employees get to spend with their families, but at this point there's no time to see family," St. Clair said in a phone interview.
"My issue is that Target and other retailers have done something they have never done before in opening on Thanksgiving.
More than 40 petitions have been launched on Change.org asking retailers including Sears, Target, Walmart and Kohl's to "give Thanksgiving back to families."
Seeing this happen year after year to the employees of Target irks me, and makes me want to ... take my money elsewhere," one user said.
Other comments in petitions against Target and other retailers focused on the importance of letting employees spend time with family.
Give these people the day off that they deserve," said another person who signed the petition "Wal-Mart: Move Black Friday Start Back to Friday."
"Family has always been important to me and Thanksgiving is all about family," Jennifer Ann said in her petition, "Target: Don't take away Thanksgiving."
This year, he's going to miss dinner altogether, she said.
Target and other big-box retailers say they're responding to consumer demands as best they can -- with employees in mind.
All hourly employees who work on a national holiday, including Thanksgiving, receive pay equal to time and a half their hourly pay rate, she said.
Most of our stores are open 24 hours and, historically, much of our Black Friday preparations have been done on Thanksgiving, which is not unusual in the retail industry."
Target, Sears, Kmart and others are all doing what they need to do maximize sales and profits," he said.
Black Friday alone last year led to almost $12 billion in sales, so you can understand the employers stance on this issue," he said.
"I would suggest they are much less at risk because most of the shopping we see at Thanksgiving is in anticipation of Christmas.
Until then, St. Clair plans to be in the electronics section Thanksgiving night through the morning hours of Black Friday.
