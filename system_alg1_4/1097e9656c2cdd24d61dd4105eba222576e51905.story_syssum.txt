Chicago workers resurface alleys with permeable concrete that cleans rainwater before it runs into Lake Michigan.
They also make up about 3,500 acres of impermeable surface, which has created a big problem.
The alleys are being resurfaced with concrete, asphalt or paving stones that are permeable -- that is, water runs through them like a sieve to the dirt beneath.
That's a big deal, Attarian explained, because the city takes about a billion gallons of water out of Lake Michigan every year.
Additionally, green alleys feature pavement that's high in albedo, or the ability to reflect light.
How green are those alleys?
