Chicago received more than 6 inches of rain Saturday, breaking a 1987 record.
By 4:30 a.m. CT on Sunday, emergency management and law enforcement officials were reporting widespread flooding across much of northern Illinois and extreme northwest Indiana, with rainfall totals of 4 to 7 inches in certain areas, the weather service said.
Commissioner John Spatz of Chicago's Department of Water Management said the north branch of the Chicago River "rose quickly and began to flow down the 5000 block of North Monticello," causing flooding northward and southward.
City officials said that, in general, things were under control.
But on Sunday, as the remnants of Ike -- by then a tropical depression -- worked their way farther into the country's heartland, heavy rain was expected over much of the region, including Illinois.
