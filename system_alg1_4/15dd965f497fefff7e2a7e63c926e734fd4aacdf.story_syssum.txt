Thank you.
Here's what I did, with what I learned at the clinic in South Africa, and my mother, Yasmin's help.
Stuff I could eat: Brown rice or wild rice, plain chicken or lamb, honey, apple, melon, banana, leafy green salads (no dressing), plain low-fat yogurt, celery, spinach, broccoli, corn, sweet potato pear, papaya, apricot, grilled fish, turkey, wholegrain muffin or bagel, bran, almonds, low-fat milk, wholegrain pasta.
Breakfast: Lemon in hot water, high fiber cereals/bran and milk, papaya, low fat yogurt, chamomile tea, occasional eggs.
Grilled lamb with salt, pepper and honey -- white sauce over it, (made with wholewheat flour, milk and seasoning).
Drinks: Diluted apple juice, melon juice, low fat milk, and water.
Meditation: At the clinic in South Africa, I learned how to do deep relaxation and creative visualization.
I imagined making a deal with my psoriasis, I would maintain the diet, and it, in turn would go away.
The clinic is now closed.
There is clearly a place for medication like this in healing, but my experience with diet forces me to believe that is a longer term, side effect-free solution.
For more information on psoriasis, Verjee suggests visiting the National Psoriasis Foundation (U.S), Psoriasis Association (UK) or Africa Psoriasis Organization (Kenya).
