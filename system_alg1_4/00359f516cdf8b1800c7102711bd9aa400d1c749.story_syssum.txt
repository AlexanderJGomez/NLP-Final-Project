Raymond Soeoth, pictured here with his wife, says he was injected with drugs by ICE agents against his will.
Two immigrants, Raymond Soeoth of Indonesia and Amadou Diouf of Senegal in West Africa, told CNN they were injected with the drugs against their will.
"The information the committee has received from ICE regarding the forced drugging of immigration detainees is extremely troubling, particularly since it appears ICE may have violated its own detention standards," Lieberman spokeswoman Leslie Phillips told CNN in an e-mail.
Responding to Lieberman's written questions, Myers said 1,073 immigration detainees had "medical escorts" for deportation since 2003.
"First, I am aware of, and deeply concerned about reports that past practices may not have conformed to ICE detention standards," Myers said.

In the records, the government says he was injected with the drug after he said he would kill himself if deported -- a remark Soeoth denies ever making.
"Department of Homeland Security law enforcement personnel may not and do not prescribe or administer medication to detainees," the ICE statement said.
He said he even had a federal stay of his deportation -- and the paperwork to prove it -- but his U.S. government escorts wouldn't let him show it to the pilot of the plane preparing to fly him out of the country.
Soeoth says he's traumatized by what happened.
