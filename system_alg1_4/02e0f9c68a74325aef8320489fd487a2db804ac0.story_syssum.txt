"Well jeez," Jobs said, struggling to get the spanking new iPhone 4 to do much of anything without a connection to a Wi-Fi network.
Many tech bloggers and writers have called for Apple to open the iPhone to other networks, including Verizon Wireless.
Any AT&T customer eligible for a phone upgrade this year can get the iPhone 4 on its debut date at those subsidized prices, Jobs said.
In a recent interview, for instance, Kevin Tofel, a blogger in the GigaOm network, said it is smartest for consumers to pick a wireless carrier first, rather than get the coolest phone.
Analysts said Jobs was having trouble connecting to a Wi-Fi network during his presentation, not AT&T's troubled 3G network.
Van Baker, research vice-president for Gartner, said the "Verizon!"
Some 570 Wi-Fi stations were clogging up the connection he needed to complete the presentation, he said.
