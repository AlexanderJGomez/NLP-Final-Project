(CNN) -- It's the height of summer in Paris, and the director of the most famous art museum in the world is queuing like any other tourist.
Why?
"I hope it will be more welcoming, which means that when you arrive at the museum there are less queues, that the people of foreign origin find reference points in their language, that with the help of Wi-Fi and apps you understand what you see," he said.
But then, Martinez isn't like previous directors.
A former archeology and art history professor, Martinez was head of the Louvre's Greek, Etruscan and Roman Antiquities department before taking over from 12-year director Henri Loyrette -- himself the son of a business lawyer.
How?
That's where Louvre Lens comes in -- a â‚¬150 million ($200 million) sister gallery in a former mining town in northern France.
"No," says Martinez.
With Martinez at the helm, it's also the beginning of a brave new era for the beloved institution.
