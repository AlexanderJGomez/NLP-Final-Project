(AOL Autos)  -- At the 2009 Detroit Auto Show, Chrysler, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota and MINI showed the world what electric vehicles of the future will look like.
This is it ...
Three of the four electric vehicles Chrysler showed in Detroit, Michigan, were shown at other events and even to Washington bureaucrats.

This generator automatically turns on after the vehicle's initial batter charge has been spent (usually within a range of 40 miles), supplying extra voltage that give these three vehicles an estimated range of approximately 400 miles.
The Dodge Circuit carries a larger battery pack and no generator, so its range on the charge it carries is approximately 150-200 miles.
Mercedes-Benz used the 2009 Detroit Auto Show to showcase their Concept BlueZERO vehicles.
All three Concept BlueZERO vehicles include electric drive and batteries.
The fuel cell produces electricity to recharge the battery pack that extends cruising range to 240 miles.

Important to this story, Toyota also committed to selling a battery powered electric car in 2012 for the U.S. market.
While standard MINI models like the Cooper are comparatively easy on gas compared to larger cars, under the ownership of parent company BMW, MINI is testing the limits of how green a MINI can be.
The "charged" MINI E can run up to 150 miles on a full battery pack.
BMW will produce only 500 MINI Es for the United States (if it were easy to make electric MINIs, they'd make more).
This scenario mimics what General Motors did with their EV1 electric vehicle about a decade ago.
