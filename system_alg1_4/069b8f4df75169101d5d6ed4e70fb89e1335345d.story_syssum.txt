(CNN) -- Peru's president arrived Tuesday night at a mine in southern Peru, where he was expected to lead an operation to reach nine trapped miners.
Engineers were working to make sure the mine was secure "so there are no victims," he said.
Earlier Tuesday, one of the mining engineers in charge of the rescue declined to give a specific time frame for the operation.
The miners have been getting oxygen, food and water through a tube, which has also allowed them to stay in contact with people above ground, Andina reported.
We won't abandon them," Merino said.
The ordeal stirred memories of a 2010 Chilean mine collapse in which 33 men were trapped underground for 69 days.
