(CNN) -- Lake Urmia in Iran used to be a site to reckon with.
Decades of poor water management, aggressive agricultural policies and drought have rendered it almost completely dried up (according to the United Nations Development Program, the lake has shrunk by two-thirds since 1997).
"If the lake dries up, this kind of threat will not be comparable to any other threat," he said in a public statement in January.
"In the year 1956, the per capita water available in Iran was 7,000 cubic meters.
In the year 2020, it is likely to be only 1,300 cubic meters," says Lewis.
Lewis worries that as water shortages become the norm, not only will Iran face repercussions to the economy and public health, but that it will start to have a knock-on effect on the Middle East as a whole.
"When Rouhani took power, in the first government meeting, he ordered the formation of a special group to save Urmia and the other dying wetlands," recalls Naser Agh, a professor at the Artemia and Aquatic Animals Research Institute at Urmia University, and a member of the steering committee of the Lake Urmia restoration program.
"No single measure can help the lake.
They also approved a large amount of money, so it can really help save the lake."
