Washington (CNN) -- Jeb Bush might not be announcing his candidacy for president in 2016 any time soon, but he is sharing his vision of the future with Iowan Republicans.
Bush raises money for his education work throughout the year and the letter is not related to any decision about his political future," she said.
The Des Moines Register said that Iowans had told them that they had never received anything from Bush or his foundation before.
In an interview with the New York Times, Jeb Bush Jr. said that people and donors are "getting fired up" about the idea of his father running for president.
