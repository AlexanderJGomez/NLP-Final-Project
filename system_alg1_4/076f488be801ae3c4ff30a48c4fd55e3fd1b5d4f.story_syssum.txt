Austin, Texas (CNN) -- The man who flew an airplane into a building housing an Internal Revenue Service office may have replaced some of its seats with a drum of fuel to cause maximum damage, a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation said Friday.
Though the remains found in the IRS building have been identified, their identities will not be revealed until after a forensic examination, Diaz said Friday.
"It truly worked," she said.
"We found only two persons," he said.
"Some folks saw it coming and sounded the alarm yesterday, and some folks started running away from that side of the building," he said.
Police said Sheryl Stack spent Wednesday night in an Austin-area hotel but did not say why.
"I saw it written once that the definition of insanity is repeating the same process over and over and expecting the outcome to suddenly be different," the online message says.
That is why definitely I did not use it yesterday and I'm not using it today."
IRS investigator James L. Neff said that Ross is not under investigation; officials just wanted to make sure he was OK. "We didn't know if he was alive or dead," Neff said.
Friends and former colleagues said Friday they had no inkling of the rage apparently building inside Stack.
"We liked him," said Furley.
An IRS spokesman said federal law prohibits the agency from releasing information about any interactions the agency may have had with Stack.
