New York City Criminal Court Judge ShawnDya L. Simpson ruled Wednesday that there was no evidence that former New York Supreme Court Judge Frank Barbaro acted with bias toward the defendant when the verdict was rendered.
"The evidence demonstrates that Justice Barbaro applied considerable effort in his deliberations and issued a written decision," Simpson said in the decision.
Barbaro, now 86, said in an exclusive interview with CNN this year, "I couldn't get out of my mind the look on the lawyer's face when I said I found him guilty.
Judge Simpson didn't give any credence to the fact that I said I made a mistake, and that's very disappointing.
Kagan's lawyer, Richard Mischel, said he plans to appeal Simpson's decision.
