Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reflected that tension this week when she urged Islamist parties in Egypt to "embrace democratic norms and rules" by creating a government that respects the full range of human rights.
"Transitions require fair and inclusive elections, but they also demand that those who are elected embrace democratic norms and rules," Clinton said Tuesday in a speech to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, meeting in Lithuania.
"I don't think any Western government is happy about the result of the elections," said Marina Ottaway, a Middle East analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace.
"The old formula is not going to work and if we want to be in a position to influence, it will depend on our credibility and the strength of our support for the processes of change," said Steven Heydemann, senior adviser for Middle East Initiatives for the United States Institute of Peace, an independent conflict management think tank created and funded by the U.S. Congress.
Criticisms such as Shaath's show how little influence the United States has over what's happening in Egypt, and how little it has to gain even if it supports democratic movements there, Ottaway said.
Should the United States pull back from its support for democratization in the region, it will lose all credibility among the Egyptian people, Ottaway said.
The best course, analysts say, is for the United States to continue to support democratic movements while setting out expectations, much like Clinton did Tuesday in Lithuania.
But the only way these parties can retain their popularity once in power is to govern effectively, he said.
But it won't be a quick process, Heydemann said.
"We're kind of stuck in a way."
