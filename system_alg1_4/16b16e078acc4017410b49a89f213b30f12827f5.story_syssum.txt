ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- For more than a year, the criminal justice students jotted details of Chandra Levy's final movements onto a huge timeline taped to a classroom wall, culled the Internet and public records for scraps of information, and pored over the model skeleton laid out on a table in their lab at Bauder College in Atlanta, Georgia.
They never heard back.
"It completely validates 15 months of work," their teacher, Sheryl McCollum, said that Saturday morning.
"I got a call from the Washington police department, just to give me a heads up that there's a warrant out for the arrest," said Susan Levy, the victim's mother.
For the Bauder College students, the break in the case was no cause for self-congratulations.
There were big smiles and, in more reflective moments, small tears.
Antonio Wilson and Jennifer Gosdin, two students who last year shared logs of their progress with CNN, said they hoped Levy's mother, father and brother can now find some comfort and peace.
For Naomi Barkley and La-Shawn Bates, the case got personal when they met Susan Levy.
Yes, Levy said, it's true, adding that she was grateful to the students for keeping people focused on her daughter's case, McCollum recalled.
It's a fancy name for a campus crime club.
Many of the 850 students at Bauder College juggle full-time jobs and families with their course work.
Students found the Williams case solvable, but Shakur's slaying was ruled "undetermined."
"The students became completely dedicated once they met the family members of the victims," McCollum said.
"The victims are real people, the cases are real cases, and the research is real investigative work."
