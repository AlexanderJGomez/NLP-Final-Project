Washington (CNN) -- Mitt Romney on Tuesday didn't back away from remarks he made in a secretly recorded video casting supporters of President Barack Obama as dependent on welfare, and instead said the comments that generated more problems for him in a tight race were an honest reflection of his campaign's message.
"The president's view is one of larger government," Romney said.
I disagree.
"There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what," Romney says in one clip first posted on Monday afternoon.
In an interview taped for the "Late Show with David Letterman" in New York, Obama said he didn't know what Romney was referring to in the video but was quick to add, "One of the things I learned as president is you represent the entire country.
At the time, Republicans quickly pounced on the comment and now Romney's running mate, Congressman Paul Ryan, uses the quote against the president on the campaign trail.
However, other conservatives supported Romney for highlighting what they call the increasing dependency of American society on government programs.
But it wasn't an entire lost day for Romney.
And a Washington Post poll released Tuesday showed Obama continuing to lead Romney in Virginia, one of the vital battleground states of 2012.
"I'm torn by two perspectives in this regard," Romney is shown saying.
