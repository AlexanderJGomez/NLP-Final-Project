Janet Napolitano surprised the nation and many of her friends with last week's announcement that she was being nominated for appointment as the 20th president of the University of California.
Her new job will be another first in Napolitano's career: She was the first woman valedictorian at the University of Santa Clara; the first woman to be elected governor of Arizona by popular vote; first woman to head the mammoth, sprawling and unwieldy Department of Homeland Security.
Her great success in both jobs was to know how to play to their strengths to achieve common goals.
In the process, she has overseen the maturation of that department's "one-size-fits-all" security approach to one that matches the strategy to the threat: intelligence-driven and risk-based.
Napolitano is not a limelight-seeker.
It was to focus on getting rid of criminals and threats to national security, while understanding that immigrants -- like her own Italian family -- have contributed much to this nation's prosperity and security.
Janet Napolitano is also one of the warmest and most caring individuals I know.
One example among many: A longtime mutual friend who served as director of constituent services in her Arizona office was unexpectedly stricken with illness.
Napolitano has done exemplary work at the Department of Homeland Security, most of it away from the spotlight.
I suspect that as the administration looks to replace her, it will begin to grasp how much it will miss her.
