Jamie Hein has asked the commission to reverse its initial ruling that found she violated the Ohio Civil Rights Act by putting up a sign that read "Public Swimming Pool, White Only" at her Cincinnati duplex.
Hein said she received the sign from a friend and posted it in early May, the summary says.
She said the sign, which was dated 1931 and from Alabama, was a gift from a friend.
It's a historical sign," she told ABC.
He said he never confronted Hein about the matter, but has no doubt that the sign was intended for his daughter.
