Sean and Carolyn Savage with daughter Mary Kate (now 18 months) and sons Ryan, left, and Andrew.
"We were waiting and waiting and the call seemed like it would never come," Savage said.
In a tragic mix-up, the Savages say the fertility clinic where Carolyn underwent in vitro fertilization implanted another couple's embryos into Carolyn's uterus.
"He walked in and was as white as a sheet," Carolyn said.
At the time, Carolyn was 39 and her chances of having a child naturally after this one were waning.
Their second child, born almost three years later in 1997, was 10 weeks premature after Carolyn developed life-threatening complications.
"That was a scary time for us," said Carolyn.
Eventually, Carolyn became pregnant with the couple's third child, resulting in another difficult pregnancy and premature birth.
"There are well in excess of 100,000 embryo transfers every year in this country," said Adamson.
"They didn't choose this path either," Carolyn Savage said of the DNA parents, who declined to speak with media.
The Savages are not releasing the name of the clinic where they underwent the IVF procedure, but provided CNN with proof of their reproductive predicament, including results of amniocentesis, a genetic test, indicating the baby Carolyn is carrying is not  theirs.
"As the process has gone along, it has been exceptionally difficult imagining this playing out," Sean Savage said.
Still, even if a surrogate can eventually help them expand their family, the Savages say that the memory of the child they gave up will always linger.
"I know that tug will be there every day wondering if the baby's happy, healthy and OK," said Carolyn.
