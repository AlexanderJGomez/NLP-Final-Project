(CNN) -- Up to 30 million people are facing "a humanitarian disaster" as one of Africa's biggest lakes shrinks, a United Nations agency warned Thursday.
Once one of the biggest bodies of water in the world, it could disappear entirely in about 20 years, the FAO said, citing forecasts from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
Two rivers which feed the lake, the Chari and Logone, have been significantly reduced in the past 40 years, the agency said.
The organization will unveil the results of a study into the diversion of the Oubangui river in an effort to help Lake Chad at a conference, "Saving Lake Chad," in Rome, Italy, on Friday.
Lake Chad is only one of many inland bodies of water which are drying up.
Similar warnings have been issued about lakes in Mexico, Russia and elsewhere.
