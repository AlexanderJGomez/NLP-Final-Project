How green is your website?
Wissner-Gross estimates every second someone spends browsing a simple web site generates roughly 20 milligrams of C02.
As millions more go online each year some researchers say the need to create a green Internet ecosystem is not only imperative but also urgent.
"Most people don't appreciate that the computer on your desk is contributing to global warming and that if its electricity comes from a coal power plant it produces as much C02 as a sports utility vehicle," said Bill St. Arnaud of Canarie, a Canada-based internet development organization.
Calculating the carbon footprint of the entire web however is not as easy as measuring the greenhouse gas emissions of a car.
The manufacturing, transport and use of personal computers and laptops also has what some say is the most significant impact, producing roughly 200 million tons of emissions in 2002.
As millions of people buy new laptops and computers every year, this figure could triple by the end of the next decade, according to the Climate Group report.
Citing competitive reasons, Teetzel declined to divulge Google's annual power bill, yet he said the internet company has been taking steps to make its main six, five megawatt server farms green as well as the other, smaller data centers it has around the world.
Netherlands-based Cleanbits lobbies web sites to go green by either by purchasing carbon offsets or switching to green hosting providers, like AISO.net, a solar-powered data center based in California.
And, like Google, Yahoo also incorporates renewable power and other efficiency measures in its data centers.
It is actually a paradigm change."
