"I was crying watching the news," said Penaflorida, the 2009 CNN Hero of the Year.
So he reached halfway around the world to Doc Hendley, a North Carolina clean-water activist who had also been honored as a top 10 CNN Hero in 2009.
Hendley, who has responded to humanitarian crises in Darfur, Haiti and Syria, had just started assessing how his nonprofit, Wine to Water, might help the Philippines when he received Penaflorida's e-mail.
"That was a long trip from the U.S. to the Philippines ... and he has put out his own money and resources to help us," Penaflorida said.
Hendley said it's hard to communicate the scope of the disaster.
"When we got to the communities, they were asking for help," he said.
Hendley said they will have distributed 2,000 filters by the end of the week.
Penaflorida returned home Wednesday to focus on a new project: bringing his pushcart classrooms to the devastated areas to help educate children while the communities rebuild.
Other CNN Heroes are also responding to help those affected by the typhoon.
Hendley now plans to provide water filters to Lim so she can distribute them to the women and children she is helping.
Evans Wadongo, a Top 10 CNN Hero in 2010, is also hoping to partner with Penaflorida.
This outpouring of help has greatly touched Penaflorida.
