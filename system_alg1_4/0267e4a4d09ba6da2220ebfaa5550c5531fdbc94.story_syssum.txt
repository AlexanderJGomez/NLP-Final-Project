Ovell Smith Krell has spent the better part of her 84 years wondering how her brother died at a Florida reform school in 1940, and where he may be buried.
"We know they're there and once they start digging, then maybe we can find remains and I hope one of them is my brother," she told CNN.
For years, stories and allegations of beatings, torture and murder have surrounded the century-old school.
Investigators now say there's evidence that 98 boys died at the school, and some of them may be buried in the 50 graves that forensic investigators have recently found on school grounds.
The mystery surrounding the graves first made headlines in 2008 when Florida's then-governor, Charlie Crist, ordered an investigation after a group of men, known as "the White House Boys," came forward with stories of how they were beaten with leather straps by school administrators inside a small, white building on school property.
At the time, the law enforcement agency said it could not determine where another 50 boys -- who it said died at the school as a result of illnesses or accidents -- were buried, blaming poorly kept school records.
Ovell Krell said her family was told that her brother Owen ran away from the reform school, got pneumonia, and died underneath a house in town.
"I believe to this day that they shot my brother that night, and I think they probably killed him and brought him back to the school and buried him," she said.
"My mom never got a good night's sleep the rest of her life after Owen went missing," she said.
