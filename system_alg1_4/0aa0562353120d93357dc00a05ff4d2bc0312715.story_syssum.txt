"Chinese brothers and sisters, I assure you I have no desire to seek Tibet's separation.
In his statement, the Dalai Lama complained the Chinese state-run media's coverage "of the recent events in Tibet, using deceit and distorted images, could sow the seeds of racial tension with unpredictable long-term consequences.
The article offered a link to a site in which Chinese bloggers criticize CNN's coverage.
In a statement, CNN said, "We have provided comprehensive coverage of all sides of this story," adding that the network's "reputation is based on reporting global news accurately and impartially."
