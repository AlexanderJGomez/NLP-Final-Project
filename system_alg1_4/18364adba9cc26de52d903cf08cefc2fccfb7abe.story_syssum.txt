(CNN) -- Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will begin chemotherapy in the coming days to treat a malignant tumor in his larynx, a hospital official said Saturday.
She added that the tumor has not metastasized, a characteristic of most cancerous cells.
"He is a fighter," Mantega told reporters, adding he expected Lula will leave the hospital later Saturday.
Raul Cutait, one of the doctors treating the former president told Rede Record TV that Lula appears well.
"I am sure the same thing will happen to President Lula."
Presidents, however, are barred from running for a third consecutive term.
"But I hope to give to all of you a tiny bite."
