Scotia, New York (CNN) -- Christina Powell folds the red, white and blue quilt before it is packed up and sent to Andrews Air Force Base, some 400 miles away in Maryland.
The quilt is one of several that Powell and her fellow members of QUILTS -- Quilters United in Learning Together, Schenectady -- have made as part of the Quilts for Injured Soldiers project.
The quilt Powell recently made for the project is a large bed quilt.
"I've probably made 20 to 30 bed quilts, more than 100 baby quilts for another charity event, and innumerable amounts of wall hangings that I make and give away," she says.
Finished quilts for soldiers are boxed up and sent to Maryland, where the Quilts for Injured Soldiers project began in 2003.
As the number of wounded soldiers increased, so did the need for more quilts.
You don't necessarily want to give an Army guy a Marine-themed quilt," Baker says, laughing.
A letter is attached to each quilt telling soldiers about the project and thanking them for their service, Baker says.
"When I was passing through all the hospitals and medical centers on my way home, I noticed all these quilts on pretty much all of the hospital beds," Winker says.
On the back edge of Winker's quilt is a patch sewn in by Powell that reads: "Thank you for your service to our country.
