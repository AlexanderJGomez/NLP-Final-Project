The court was shown cell phone footage filmed by a witness in which a man who prosecutors said was Adebolajo, holding a bloody cleaver in his hands, spoke into the camera.
Remove your governments -- they don't care about you," he said, referring also to British Prime Minister David Cameron.
Leave our lands and you will live in peace."
Describing the events of that day, the prosecutor said the two suspects drove at Rigby in a car traveling at 30 to 40 miles per hour.
Whittam, the prosecutor, said the defendants were armed with a meat cleaver, knives and a revolver when they got out of the car.
One woman stroked Rigby's body in a gesture of comfort, he said, while another engaged Adebolajo in conversation despite the fact that he was still holding the meat cleaver in his blood-covered hands.
When police arrived at the scene, the two men moved toward their vehicle, Whittam said.
While the gun carried by Adebowale was not loaded, he also had on him the bloodstained knife he'd used to attack Rigby, the prosecutor said.
The prosecutor also told the court how the firearms officers had to react within moments as they arrived at the scene.
I did it for my God.
Jurors were also shown pictures of the bloodied weapons allegedly used by the two men.
Friends and relatives of Rigby were in court for the opening of the trial.
The jury also saw CCTV footage of the suspects' movements in the two days before they allegedly launched their attack.
