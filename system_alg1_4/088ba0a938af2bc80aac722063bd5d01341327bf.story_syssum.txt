There have been days of prayers and protests for Jahi McMath.
Doctors and a judge have declared her brain dead and said there's no chance Jahi will come back to life.
"This child was sitting on death row," said family attorney Christopher Dolan.
Earlier, the girl's family told reporters it had located a facility in New York willing to take Jahi.
Attorneys for the family are filing a new complaint in federal court requesting a temporary restraining order and an injunction to prevent the hospital from disconnecting Jahi from life support, he said.
Family members say the 8th grader was alert and talking after doctors removed her tonsils, adenoids and extra sinus tissue in a surgery earlier this month.
Before the surgery, Jahi said she was worried that she would never wake up, according to her uncle.
According to family members, Jahi went into cardiac arrest.
But Jahi's family members maintain that they're hoping for a miracle and want to transfer the girl from Children's Hospital Oakland to another facility.
When asked about the girl's possible movement, the hospital spokesman, citing privacy laws, said he would not comment directly on any claims the family makes.
The attorney representing Jahi's family did not respond to requests from CNN for comment on the matter.
The case is "giving the impression that dead people can come back to life," Arthur Caplan, director of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center, told CNN last week
Jahi's family has criticized the hospital's handling of the matter, accusing doctors of pressuring them to disconnect life support.
"We wish to acknowledge that Jahi's case, and our stance regarding her right to life, and her mother's right to make decisions regarding her child, has stirred a vibrant, sometimes polarizing, national debate.
