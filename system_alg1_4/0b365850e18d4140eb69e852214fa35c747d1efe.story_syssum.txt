Former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist says it's good that Obama and Biden are members of the Senate.
And how it is approached may well turn on the often overlooked fact that both the president-elect and the vice president-elect are products of the U. S. Senate.
The wounds of the campaign are not as deep or angry as the media portray.
Having served in the U.S. Senate, I am proud that that body, historically avoided as a source of presidential leadership, produced three of the four candidates and now the president and vice president.
That unique Senate legislative experience of the president- and vice-president-elect -- with the understanding it brings both to lead on principle but govern with compromise and to respect uniquely the minority's participation -- stations them ideally for a time when the American people expect their government to work together to aggressively attack the problems that face us.
Times are tough, but the people have rallied to your call.
Be straight with them, and don't over-promise.
Ever-rising health costs drive people to the ranks of uninsured.
Don't let it slip to the back burner.
