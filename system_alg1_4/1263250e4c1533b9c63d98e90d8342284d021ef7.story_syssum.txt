In addition, about half of Pakistanis (51%) said they think the May 2 raid on bin Laden's home in Abbottabad will adversely affect their country's relations with the United States.
Only 12% of respondents said they had a positive view of the United States and 8% said they were confident that U.S. President Barack Obama would do the right thing in world affairs.
In a poll taken after bin Laden's death, more than two-thirds (69%) said they think of the United States as more of an enemy.
Asked whether they believe the Pakistani government authorized the raid, 29% said it did, 23% said it did not and nearly half said they did not know.
Yet extremist groups are still unpopular, with just 12% of Pakistanis expressing a positive view of al Qaeda, down from 18% last year.
Approval of Lashkar-e-Taiba was higher, with 27% expressing support for the Kashmir-based group that has carried out attacks in neighboring India.
The pollsters said there were few differences between the first and second surveys, implying that bin Laden's killing had little impact on public opinion in Pakistan about the United States or other issues covered by the survey.
His prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, attracted a positive rating from 37% of those surveyed, down from 59% last year.
Perhaps that's because only about a third (37%) of Pakistanis said they followed closely reports about the raid that killed bin Laden.
But just 27% said they had heard a lot about the attacks, up from 14% last year.
More than half (61%) said they are unnecessary and 89% said they think they kill too many innocent people.
