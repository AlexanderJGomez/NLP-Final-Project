(CNN) -- Things are looking horrible for President Barack Obama.
What will happen next: Will our hero prevail like John McClane in "Die Hard," or will he fail like William Wallace in "Braveheart"?
Simply put: Obama is not the protagonist driving his own story.
Obama's main antagonist, of course, is the hyper-partisan Congress that refuses to agree on the most basic issues, such as raising the debt ceiling, which Congress has done more than 40 times since 1980.
Perhaps the worst thing about the problems with the Obamacare website is that they occurred at a time when things were finally looking politically brighter for Obama.
Is this Obama's metaphoric fate?
This may be exciting to watch, but not great for the character, who has no idea what will happen next.
First, Obama should announce that retaking control of the House in 2014 is a top priority.
Unseating some tea party House members has become newly possible after the shutdown mess.
Sure, the Republicans will push back -- they will say Obama is behaving like a "king" or "tyrant" and complain about him nightly on Fox News.
Will the President's agenda continue to be dictated by others, making him nothing more than a lame duck, caretaker President?
Obama is the star of this movie.
