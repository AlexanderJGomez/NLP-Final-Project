The Reverend J. Peyton leads the Big Damn Band in playing the blues.
"The writing's been on the wall for a long time," says The Rev.
The Reverend Peyton's Big Damn Band, made up of The Rev, his wife Breezy on washboard and his brother Jayme on drums, has been touring the country almost nonstop for several years, and they've had a chance to see the harsh realities of the American dream up close.
"We don't take it lightly," The Rev says.
The Rev says on the band's Web site, "I feel like I got to directly be involved in a song.
The band gets its ideas from personal experience, says The Rev.
The Big Damn Band is also the cover story in the April/May issue of Blues Review magazine.
It's simple, heartfelt country blues at its best, played by a family that revels in its blood ties.
You know, those are the things that I think get you by."
