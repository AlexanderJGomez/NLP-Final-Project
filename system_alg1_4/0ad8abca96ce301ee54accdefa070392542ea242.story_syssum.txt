Colombian World Cup star James Rodriguez became the latest footballer to tackle branded underwear, launching his J10 collection for Bronzini last month and posing semi-naked to show off the goods on offer.
"Underwear is an every day purchase and wearing the right underwear has seen it become something of a lifestyle item.
Martin helps manage the branding and marketing for Ronaldo's CR7 range, which he says is available in almost 100 countries -- its main markets are in southern Europe, Asia and South America -- as well as online.
The aesthetic allure of Ronaldo, Rodriguez and Beckham is an undeniable factor in why their underwear packs a punch.
Beckham stopped traffic as an underwear model for Emporio Armani before collaborating with H&M while the perfectly manicured Ronaldo oozes style on and off the pitch.
The pioneer of the celebrity underwear market was, however, not a footballer but Swedish tennis ace Bjorn Borg.
Borg's dashing good looks, like those of Beckham, Ronaldo and Rodriguez, certainly helped him cut a dash in the underwear market but sustaining a successful brand over 30 years relies on more than superficial appeal.
Sports stars arguably make natural underwear manufacturers because they understand more than most about the importance of comfort on the go.
We put out underwear that makes people feel more active and attractive."
Stevenson agrees that true sporting icons stand a better chance of successfully creating a product line that is not directly connected to their core business -- but that even then there could be pit falls.
