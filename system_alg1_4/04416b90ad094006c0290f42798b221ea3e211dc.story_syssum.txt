The Thai army declared martial law throughout the country Tuesday in a surprise move that an aide to the embattled Prime Minister said the government didn't know about beforehand.
Declaring martial law is not a coup d'etat."
Martial law went into effect at 3 a.m. on Tuesday, the ticker said.
It's too soon to tell whether the military's declaration of martial law will ease tensions or heighten them, analysts said.
"If it's seen as favoring one side or the other side, then we could see more violence and turmoil against the military," he said.
"The military is taking a step by step, gentle approach to see if they can get things to improve," Quaglia said.
Nipat said the precise restrictions of martial law were being worked out.
"That being said, martial law will not solve the political problems that continue to haunt this country," he said.
