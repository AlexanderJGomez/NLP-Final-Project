Marco Rubio, R-Florida, and Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey.
The good news is that there was bipartisan support; the last time it was put to a vote, in December 2010, a slew of Senate Democrats voted for it, but so did three Senate Republicans -- Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Richard Lugar of Indiana and Bob Bennett of Utah.
The Cuban-American GOP rock star and potential GOP vice presidential nominee is floating the idea of a modified DREAM Act that would keep undocumented immigrant students from being deported by giving them legal status in the form of a student visa followed by a work visa.
The idea was originally shared with me about five months ago by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who, along with her colleague, Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, was eager to find a way to break the stalemate over the DREAM Act and help get these young people out of legal limbo and on with their lives.
Democrats, who are salivating over the prospect of perhaps hundreds of thousands of new voters with a grudge against Republicans.
Democrats may think these kids are adorable, but they don't want to adopt them and become known as the "illegal immigrant party."
Rubio might have enough leverage within his party to persuade some Republicans who voted against the old DREAM Act to support DREAM Act 2.0.
So what?
There are no good guys and bad guys, just both parties pushing their own interests without caring about what happens to a bunch of undocumented students.
What Rubio has in mind might not be perfect, but it's the only entree on the menu.
A Republican like Rubio has a cultural connection to Democrats like Gutierrez, Menendez and Gonzales.
These guys might argue when they talk politics, but at least they can argue in Spanish.
