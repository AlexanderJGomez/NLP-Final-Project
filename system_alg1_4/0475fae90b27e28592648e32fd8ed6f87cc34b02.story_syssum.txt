The president expressed dismay and anger over the bonuses to executives at AIG, which has received $173 billion in U.S. government bailouts over the past six months.
But he said the impropriety of the bonuses goes beyond economics.
Watch Obama say he's outraged by bonuses Â»
Obama said he would work with Congress to change the laws so that such a situation cannot happen again.
Under pressure from the Treasury, AIG scaled back the bonus plans and pledged to reduce 2009 bonuses -- or "retention payments" -- by at least 30 percent.
"There's no reason why those at AIG shouldn't do the same," he said.
You could write a tax provision that's narrowly crafted only to the people receiving bonuses.
They're also investigating possible legal avenues Congress can take to force the company to return money used for bonuses, a House Democratic leadership aide and a House Financial Services Committee aide said Monday.
Both aides said it is unclear what authority Congress might have to force AIG to take back the bonuses.
The actions of AIG do just the opposite, and every American is justified in their outrage at this breach of public trust," he said.
"Previously, AIG had agreed at our request to make no payments out of its $600 million Financial Products deferred compensation pool," he said.
"Finally, we demand an immediate status report as to whether the payments under the retention plan have been made," he said.
