LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Holly Williams is one of the only artists in country music male or female who doesn't have a stylist.
Holly's father is Bocephus -- the legendary hellraiser and three-time CMA Entertainer of the Year otherwise known as Hank Williams Jr.
Williams just released her sophomore album, "Here With Me" (Mercury Nashville).
Williams spoke with CNN about her new album and her family's legacy.
Holly Williams: It wasn't planned at all.
And it's just so random, because out of the 52 weeks of the year, it just happened.
Williams: Well, my mom raised my sister and me.
Williams: Oh, she doesn't at all.
CNN: What was it like for you going into the music industry?
Williams: The songwriting hit me at a very young age.
Williams: I do.
I remember just telling my mom, "Just please call the publishing company.
Williams: I'm sure there was never any response.
Williams: Growing up in my house, you would assume I was growing up around country music with my dad being Hank Williams Jr.
So I was really left to my own devices to find music on my own.
And when I heard Hank Williams Sr.'s name mentioned from those people -- from Leonard Cohen to Bruce Springsteen -- that's what really brought me back around to learning more about my grandfather.
...
I would love to play in arenas -- but what I really want to build is a core fanbase, and just hopefully build a place in the Williams family.
