"I have been in the market for this card for a long time," Walton told CNN.
Walton paid $262,900, Heritage said, with $220,000 of that going to the School Sisters of Notre Dame.
Only 50 to 60 T206 Wagner cards are believed to exist.
It's an authentic T206 Honus Wagner card.
Walton, managing partner of Walton Sports Cards and Collectibles, said he's tried three previous times to buy a Wagner card, but was outbid.
About 75 percent of his pursuit of the T206 card was emotion, he said.
