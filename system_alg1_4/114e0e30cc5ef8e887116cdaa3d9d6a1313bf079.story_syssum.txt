Five men face charges in the alleged attack, police said Thursday.
Cebeci was able to get inside the station, but Yavuz said he was beaten badly.
Cebeci was treated for broken fingers, Yavuz said.
The men were arraigned on Wednesday, and November court appearances have been set, the district attorney's office said.
A surveillance video from the gas station is in the hands of prosecutors, officials said.
