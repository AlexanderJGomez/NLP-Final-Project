Los Angeles (CNN) -- Heavy rains prompted the emergency evacuation Monday of nearly 2,000 residents of a flooding Southern California town and the temporary closure of at least two highways because of mudslides.
The National Weather Service said additional rain is expected in the area through Tuesday.
Mudslides forced officials to close a portion of State Route 1, also known as the Pacific Coast Highway, in Ventura County from just north of the Los Angeles County line to Oxnard, according to the California Department of Transportation.
The rain was expected to diminish Monday but intensify once again Tuesday night and Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service.
"Storm totals of 5 to 10 feet above 7,000 feet are likely," the weather service said, and periods of heavy snow will continue through Monday.
High winds are also forecast for the region, which received several feet of snow over the weekend.
"The decks have a good 5 feet of snow on them," and there's flooding at the end of the neighborhood, she said.
