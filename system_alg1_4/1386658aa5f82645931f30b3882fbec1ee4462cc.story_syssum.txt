(CNN) -- If body language is a good gauge of political standing, Li Keqiang is looking very much like China's premier-in-waiting.
As the current executive vice premier, Li already oversees important portfolios, such macro economic planning, health care, energy and housing.
When he visited Hong Kong University last year, he delivered part of his speech in English -- a gesture that prompted debate in the mainland.
Li is considered a carbon copy of President Hu Jintao, his mentor and benefactor, because of similarities in background, priorities and style.
The son of a minor county official in Anhui, a poor province where Hu was also born, Li was a teenager when the decade-long Cultural Revolution interrupted his schooling.
"Like everyone in our generation Li Keqiang was keen for new ideas," recalls Yang Baihui, an international politics major.
Li collaborated with Yang and another student in translating "The Due Process of Law," a book on constitutional law by the noted British judge Lord Alfred Denning.
After graduation, Li decided to work for the Communist Youth League (CYL), a training ground for party and government officials.
Li rose through the ranks of CYL while completing a master's degree in law and then an economics doctorate under Li Yining, the guru of market reforms in China.
Wang has been in exile in the United States since 1994 and is now co-chair of the China Democratic Party, which advocates radical change in China.
In 1998, Li at 43 became Henan's provincial governor, the youngest in China.
As China's executive vice premier, Li remains a stalwart supporter of Hu's "seek a harmonious society" dictum.
Like his mentor Hu, Li has risen to his high position more by avoiding big mistakes than through bold ideas and major accomplishments.
