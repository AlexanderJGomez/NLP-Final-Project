(CNN) -- As an NBA executive, I'm always looking for untapped potential.
Not long ago, soccer in Africa was almost the same way.
Kids in Africa start kicking a ball when they are six or seven years old, if not younger.
As a result, nearly every major soccer team has a lot of African players.
Most kids in Africa don't start playing basketball until they are 13 or 14 years old.
Every year, we conduct the Giants of Africa camp, sponsored by NestlÃ© Milo and Nike, as well as the NBA Basketball Without Borders Africa elite camp.
These guys are great examples for young people in Africa.
On a continent with more than a billion people, we still have a lot more ground to cover, and we need help from sponsors in Africa.
That's what we use for my Giants of Africa camp.
As you can probably tell, the push to develop talent in Africa is personal.
It is going to be prominent in tapping basketball talent.
