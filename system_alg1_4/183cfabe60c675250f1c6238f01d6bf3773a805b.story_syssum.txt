(CNN) -- Ed Koch, the brash former New York City mayor who typically greeted constituents with a "How'm I doin'?"
New York City has lost "an irrepressible icon," Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a statement.
Koch told New York magazine in 1998: "I think my personality was helpful in this job.
And I did."
In his later years, Koch became politically motivated again.
In his anger, Koch crossed party lines to support Republican Bob Turner in his bid to represent perhaps the most Jewish district in the country, which covers parts of Queens and Brooklyn.
I helped get him elected," Koch said at Turner's election night party.
"I congratulated him on his speech to the United Nations in which he acknowledged Israel's presence in a difficult neighborhood," Koch said, referring to a party he attended that was hosted by Obama and his wife, Michelle, in New York.
The New York Times said in a 2011 retrospective that Koch seemed an unlikely candidate for mayor in 1977.
Koch was a popular mayor -- winning a second term with 75% of the vote and a third with 78% -- but as the Times put it: "With New Yorkers wearying of his in-your-face shtick and seeking a balm to racial polarization, Mr. Koch was defeated for the Democratic nomination by Manhattan Borough President David N.
Race relations in New York were also fractured at the time, especially after a 1986 incident in Howard Beach when white teenagers attacked three black men, killing one.
Koch, who never married, was often criticized by playwright, novelist and LGBT rights advocate Larry Kramer for not doing more to stop the spread of AIDS in New York.
"He was a closeted gay man, and he did not want in any way to be associated with this," Kramer declared to New York magazine.
he told New York magazine.
