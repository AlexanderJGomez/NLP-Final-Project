(CNN)The photo shows a young man, his hair short and his eyes looking at the ground as he walks out of a car.
But at least for a brief period two years ago, Nowsch seemingly had no qualms about putting himself out there on social media.
It's not clear how any of his past led to Nowsch's arrest Thursday, one week after his neighbor Tammy Meyers was shot.
"We knew how bad he was," Robert Meyers told reporters.
It was unclear Thursday night whether Nowsch had an attorney; court documents detailing his charges didn't list a lawyer.
But they believe it was Nowsch who shot Tammy Meyers soon after she'd gotten out of her car outside her Las Vegas home, about a block from his own home.
Robert Meyers told HLN's Nancy Grace that the man threatened to kill his wife and daughter.
The son told police that he and his mother were fired upon, and he shot back.
That was the extent of what authorities knew about the back-and-forth between Nowsch and Tammy Meyers until Thursday, according to Las Vegas police Capt.
It was then that Robert Meyers first told reporters that Nowsch and his wife had known each other for some time.
"She told him to pull his pants up and to be a man," Robert Meyers added.
