A man shot four men with whom he had worked -- two of them fatally -- in northern Florida on Saturday before shooting and killing himself, the Union County sheriff said.
Pritchett's death will have a "terrible impact on the community," Whitehead said.
The Union County Sheriff's Office said Allen went to a Lake Butler farm owned by Pritchett, where he fatally shot Gonzalez-Delgado.
A short distance away, Allen shot and killed Pritchett, authorities said.
Allen traveled to Pritchett Trucking Inc. and shot a third co-worker, 44-year old David Griffis, in the stomach, officials said.
The company employs "well over 400 people and is apportioned in all 48 states and Canada."
