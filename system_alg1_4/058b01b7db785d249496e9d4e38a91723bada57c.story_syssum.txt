He said his department will also search on an area of the Whitewater River, in southern Kansas, on Saturday near where Adam Herrman was last seen.
Wichita attorney Warner Eisenbise, who is representing Adam's adoptive parents, said the couple believed Adam had run away and didn't report him missing.
The Herrmans told Eisenbise that Adam ran away frequently, the attorney said, and they believed he was either with his biological parents or homeless.
The couple never reported Adam missing, Valerie Herrman told the paper, because they feared authorities would take Adam and his siblings away because of the spanking.
The couple said they searched the mobile home park and other areas for two days after Adam left.
Adam had been placed in the Herrmans' care when he was about 2, Murphy said Monday.
"If he was still in my custody, this would have never happened."
