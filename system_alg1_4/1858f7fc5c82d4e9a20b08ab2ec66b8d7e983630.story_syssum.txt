Fink said she didn't go public with the incident at the time because she was trying to build her political career.
"I had to work and do my job in an atmosphere where women were viewed by Mayor Filner as sexual objects or stupid idiots," Jackson said.
Fink told KPBS on Tuesday that the incident happened as she was escorting Filner from table to table at a fundraising dinner.
At one point, she said, someone at the event told Filner that Fink had "worked her ass off" for him.

Filner said last week that he believes he will be vindicated by "a full presentation of the facts."
Jackson said she decided to resign after Filner's deputy chief of staff resigned in June.
Filner "laughed it off," she said.
