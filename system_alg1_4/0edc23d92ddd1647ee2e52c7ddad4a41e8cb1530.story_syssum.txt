Washington (CNN) -- Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan took a pragmatic approach to the issue of late-term abortion when working as a top lawyer in the Clinton White House, documents released Friday show.
In a February 27, 1997 memo to top White House staff, Kagan notes a leading abortion rights supporter had just admitted late-term abortions were being "performed more frequently than pro-choice groups have acknowledged, and often perfonned [sic - performed] on healthy women with healthy fetuses," repeating a claim conservatives at the time had long made.
The documents reveal another person heavily involved in the abortion issue: Rahm Emanuel, then a senior adviser in the Clinton White House.
Some 160,000 pages of documents are being reviewed from Kagan's four-years in the Clinton White House from 1995-1999, during which she also served as deputy associate counsel.
Kagan also was heavily involved in negotiations to clamp down on the tobacco industry.
Kagan, then 37, also noted proposals from within the administration might go too far and later be declared unconstitutional by the federal courts.
Until she she stepped down last month, Kagan was the administration's solicitor general, which argues federal government cases before the Supreme Court.
At the time, the Clinton administration had to decide whether to continue the legal challenge in federal courts.
Kagan supported that view, but she and others in the Clinton White House also wanted to clarify that race-based decisions were sometimes justified in the name of diversity -- "to mend (without ending) affirmative action."
