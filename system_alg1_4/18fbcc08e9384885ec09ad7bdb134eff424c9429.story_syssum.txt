Cairo (CNN) -- When Azza Hilal Suleiman saw Egyptian military pummel the veiled woman, she stepped in to help and got kicked and clubbed by security forces, a beating that was captured in a video that went viral around the world and also showed live gunfire and the violent removal of a Muslim woman's clothing.
Suleiman was seen in a red coat in the same video that showed the veiled woman's beating.
Suleiman is one of three people in the video interviewed by CNN, with one of them saying he was shot.
The military has denied the use of live ammunition.
The woman has not been identified.
More than a thousand people gathered in Tahrir Square for a "Million Woman" march Tuesday.
The ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces has since expressed "great regret" over the mistreatment of women protesters, but it has not apologized for the assaults, a fact that enrages demonstrators.
Others came to Suleiman's aid, such as businessman Ehab Hanna, who was also beaten up and shot after he tried to help the woman with the veil.
I tried to walk but fell to the ground, so they started beating me and Azza relentlessly," he told CNN.
I did not imagine they would fire live ammo at their people."
He told CNN that he is filing a complaint against military leaders because they "dragged, stripped and beat" women and journalists.
"I tried to help her get up, but the soldiers were brutal even when I told them I was a journalist.
Askar questioned why the woman has not come forward to identify herself.
Where is she?"
"If she comes from a military family then she reserved the right to be transferred to a military hospital even if her father is deceased," said Col. Islam Jaffar of the military's morals department.
