Howard, who premiered the follow-up in Rome, Italy, this week, said there was "residual antagonism from 'The Da Vinci Code,' " but Vatican officials ignored the movie by not responding to suggestions that the church was offended.
"To be honest, I don't think that anyone at the Vatican is paying much attention to the premier of the 'Angels & Demons,' " Father John Wauck said.
"
The new movie is not as offensive, Wauck said.
"I think there's some residual antagonism from 'The Da Vinci Code,' " Howard said.
Howard said he tried to reach out to the Catholic Church.
"Probably a little more has been made of that," he said.
"As a general rule, no commercial films are filmed in churches in Rome, and no exception was made for 'Angels & Demons,' " Wauck said.
"I wanted to represent for the audience that with as much detail as I did going to the moon with 'Apollo 13,' " he said, referring to his 1995 movie about the aborted space mission.
"There are so many reasons to do it, and when I really looked at 'Angels & Demons' and realized that it was going to feel different," he said.
Howard said he will wait to decide whether he will make a movie based on Brown's third Langdon novel.
"While I haven't read Dan's next installment of the Robert Langdon adventures, I'm dying to," he said.
