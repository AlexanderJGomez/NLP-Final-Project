The Prince islands are, for most Istanbul residents, the ultimate weekend getaway, offering an escape where, crucially for anyone who's ever endured they city's motoring snarl-ups, cars are banned.
To make the best of Buyukada, the largest of the islands, it's best to escape the town square -- almost permanently inhabited by a flock of dazed-looking tourists -- and head by foot or cycle to more peaceful areas.
Those not into cycling or walking can take a ride on the island's most popular mode of transport: a small horse-drawn carriage known as a fayton.
The reward comes in the form of a magnificent sea view of distant Istanbul, and also the historic Greek church's beautiful interior.
Walkers might glimpse sewing thread stretching from the path's beginning to end -- the remnants of a ritual believed to grant wishes that is performed annually on April 23 by the faithful.

There are bike rentals (5TL an hour and 15TL for the day) and fayton rides, but walking around the island is a rewarding experience, with little cafes, shops, flower sellers, lounging street cats, and remarkable architecture all waiting to be discovered.
Next door, the vintage styled Luz Cafe has a menu of homemade Turkish favorites and baked goods, and a small shop of handicrafts and organic soaps.
Across the street, Ya Da sells handmade notebooks, items made from deformed gramophone records, birds made from pine cones, and many other unique items.
From the Asian side, the boats push off from either the Bostancı or Kadıkoy ports almost hourly and make stops at Buyukada and Heybeliada plus the smaller islands of Burgazada, Kınaliada.
A faster option is Mavi Marmara, a smaller boat that goes directly from either Kabatas or Bostanci to each of the islands separately on an hourly basis.
