(CNN) -- The Florida case of a trooper ticketing a Miami police officer in his squad car for driving 120 miles per hour "is a simple misunderstanding that has been blown out of proportion," the officer's attorney said Friday.
Watts on a seven-minute, nearly 12-mile chase in the predawn darkness of October 11, a highway patrol report said.
"Officer Fausto LÃ³pez is a good police officer who has worked as a uniform patrol officer on the streets of Miami for nearly six years, protecting the citizens of Miami," Matthewman said separately in a statement.
"I don't know what agency he is.
Watts was driving on the turnpike when the white marked Miami police car blew by and "crossed over all lanes of traffic," according to the state highway patrol report.
At one point, the Miami officer slowed to 78 miles an hour, but sped up again, the highway patrol said.
On the Florida Highway Patrol offense report, the document lists Lopez' occupation as "police officer" whose employer is "City of Miami Police Departmen(t)" and lists the style of automobile as "police car," a white 2008 Crown Victoria.
