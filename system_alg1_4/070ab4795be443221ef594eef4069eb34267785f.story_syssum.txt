Assured by his wife that there was nothing he could do to help, the Swede remained in the Netherlands and pulled off an emotional victory with a sensational shot at the final hole of the KLM Open on Sunday.
"It's always a nice feeling, but especially this week with how things have been with my son being a little bit ill," said Hanson, who will play for Europe against the U.S. at the Ryder Cup this month.
"I had a little gap between the two trees and I needed to hit it through that with a bit of draw.
Ramsay birdied three of the last four holes to match Hanson's final-round score of 67, but was just short of repeating his victory at last week's European Masters in Switzerland.
"On the last hole I was thinking I could hole my eagle putt and have a little run around the green but he got in first," he said after taking home $200,000 to go 17th in the money list with almost $1.2 million this season.
It's nice to see hard work paying off."
