A woman filed the robbery complaint against Bieber on May 13, a day after the alleged incident happened and hours after she reported it to the celebrity website TMZ, the document said.
The accuser told Los Angeles Police Department robbery/homicide detectives that the incident began after she used her iPhone to take a photo of Bieber at the batting cages in the Sherman Oaks Castle Park.
Bieber and the woman "tussled over it for a moment," she said.
The daughter later told investigators she was already crying from the excitement of being near Justin Bieber.
A source who's close to Bieber and is familiar with the situation played down the incident.
