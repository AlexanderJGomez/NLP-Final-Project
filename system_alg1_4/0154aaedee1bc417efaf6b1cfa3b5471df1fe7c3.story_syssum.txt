(CNN)Debra Milke spent 22 years on death row, convicted of conspiring with two other men to kill her son allegedly for an insurance payout.
Key to the case's dismissal was prosecutorial misconduct, mainly that of a detective, Armando Saldate, who said Milke confessed to the crime to him -- even though there was no witness or recording.
Milke's roomate, James Styers, took the boy; then called Milke saying Christopher had disappeared.
The detective, Saldate, said Scott told him that Milke was involved in a plot to kill her son.
Ultimately, the jury believed the detective and convicted Milke of murder.
What prosecutors didn't tell the court was the detective's long history of lying under oath and misconduct.
In 2013, after more than 20 years in jail, an appeals court overturned Milke's conviction.

And Milke left the court room, sobbing in relief.
Debra Milke is finally a free woman.
