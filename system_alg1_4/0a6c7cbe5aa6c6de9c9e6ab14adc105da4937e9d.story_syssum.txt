(CNN) -- The airline operating an Airbus A310-300 jet that crashed in the Indian Ocean on Tuesday with 153 people aboard was being monitored by EU authorities, according to France's transport minister.
"The plane had not since then reappeared in our country," he added.
Yemenia Air had used the jet since 1999, on about 17,300 flights, Airbus officials said.
It is the second crash involving an Airbus jet in a month.
In the wake of the Air France crash on June 1, United States accident investigators have been probing two recent failures of airspeed and altitude indications aboard Airbus A330s.
