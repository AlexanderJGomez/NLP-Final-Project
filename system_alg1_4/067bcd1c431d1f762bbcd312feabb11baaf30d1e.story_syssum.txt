Sean Penn plays San Francisco City Supervisor Harvey Milk in "Milk," directed by Gus Van Sant.
An audiotape Milk records "just in case" is screenwriter Dustin Lance Black's convenient structuring device, foregrounding the story's tragic outcome and allowing Milk to narrate his own life story.
Civic elections might seem like small beer, but the persecution that compelled Milk to run for office is no trivial matter.
Ironically, the devoutly "normal" White is the one who is truly messed up.
The strategy is sound; the execution, nearly flawless.
Penn is studied and thoughtful, impassioned and immediately sympathetic as Milk.
"Milk" may be a little too homogenized for some tastes.
In that respect, it evokes the best aspirations of the country -- and, for that matter, of filmmaking.
