(CNN) -- A Florida jury awarded a 92-year-old man $1.9 million in compensatory damages for the death of his wife, a former two-pack-a-day Marlboro smoker who started when she was 16 and died in her 70s, attorneys said Thursday.
Philip Morris announced that it plans to appeal the case, one of thousands of "Engle progeny" cases, named after a 2006 Florida Supreme Court decision that decertified a class-action lawsuit against the tobacco industry.
The Florida Supreme Court also allowed some factual findings about smoking causing disease be taken from Engle case and applied to the progeny cases "so plaintiff's attorneys don't have to start from square one in each of these cases," said Ed Sweda, a lawyer for the Tobacco Products Liability Project in Boston, Massachusetts.
Gdanski said his firm has more than 150 Engle cases.
"We're more than happy to keep trying them," he said.
