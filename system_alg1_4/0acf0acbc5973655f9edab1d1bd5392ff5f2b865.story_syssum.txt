The National Transportation Safety Board recommended on Tuesday that all 50 states adopt a blood-alcohol content (BAC) cutoff of 0.05 compared to the 0.08 standard on the books today and used by law enforcement and the courts to prosecute drunk driving.
Hersman said progress has been made over the years to reduce drunk driving, including a range of federal and state policies, tougher law enforcement, and stronger advocacy.
What will be our legacy 30 years from now?"
Lowering the rate to 0.05 would save about 500 to 800 lives annually, the safety board  said.
States set their own BAC standards.
In the early 1980s, when grass-roots safety groups brought attention to drunk driving, many states required a 0.15 BAC rate to demonstrated intoxication.
In recent years, about 31 percent of all fatal highway accidents were attributed to alcohol impairment, the NTSB said.
Many of the recommendations "are going to be unpopular," Sumwalt said.
Currently, more than 100 countries on six continents have BAC limits set at 0.05 or lower, the safety board said.
The group said it based that conclusion on a chart it said was used by auto safety regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
At Tuesday's meeting, the safety board also championed laws allowing police to confiscate a motorist's license at the time of arrest if the driver exceeds a BAC limit, or refuses to take the BAC test.
If the sensor alerts, it is grounds for more thorough testing.
The NTSB recommended last December that states require ignition interlocks for all DUI offenders and said states should improve interlock compliance.
