(CNN) -- Costume designer Mark Bridges can create eras with fabric.
With "The Artist," a black-and-white silent film, Bridges brings back that golden Hollywood age -- both the peak of its glamour and pit of its shabbiness.
Mark Bridges: Ever since I was young.
Bridges: Without the color to communicate the language of telling the story, I was trying to tell the story through textures, whether it be lamÃ©, sequins and beads for Hollywood, or very flat rough textured wools to communicate down-on-your-heels, or the elegance of satin lapels for evening wear, or the shimmer of a beautiful nightgown.
CNN: Actors say that it's getting into costume that allows them to become another person.
Bridges: I was always involved in theater and drama.
As a child, I loved movies, I always drew, I always loved fabric, I loved clothes, I loved color, I loved telling a story.
