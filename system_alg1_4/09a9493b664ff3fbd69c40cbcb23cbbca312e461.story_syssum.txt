"My great, great grandparents, their offspring and others were split up in the Commonwealth of Virginia & sold into slavery," Democratic strategist and CNN political contributor Donna Brazile said on Twitter.
McDonnell is the first Virginia governor in eight years to issue a proclamation declaring April as Confederate History Month in the state, a move that drew criticism from Democrats and a civil rights group.
