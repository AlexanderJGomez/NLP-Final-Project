Taking a cue from some of its competitors, Apple on Tuesday announced a smaller version of its popular iPad tablet -- the iPad Mini.
The iPad Mini's display will be nearly an inch bigger than those of competitors like Amazon's Kindle Fire and Google's Nexus 7.
Pre-orders for the devices begin Friday, and the Wi-Fi only iPad Mini will go on sale in stores November 2.
It also will have the "lightning" connector that came new on the iPhone 5 and new iPods.
"This isn't just a shrunken-down iPad," Schiller said.
"You knew there would be something called 'mini' in this presentation, didn't you?"
Schiller opened by unveiling the new version of Apple's top-selling MacBook, the 13-inch MacBook Pro.
Both the Mac Mini and the new MacBook Pro begin shipping today.
The Kindle Fire is great for buying books, movies and shows from Amazon, and the Nexus 7 has Google's well-stocked Play store for media and apps.
The smaller iPad's screen is expected to have the same aspect ratio, so those apps would work the same on the new device.
"Fully half the time they're using tablets, they don't leave the couch or the bed," said Forrester analyst Sarah Rotman Epps.
"If you can do everything on the smaller iPad you can on the larger iPad -- that plus the added convenience of being able to take it with you more places could take the wind out of the sales of Amazon."
