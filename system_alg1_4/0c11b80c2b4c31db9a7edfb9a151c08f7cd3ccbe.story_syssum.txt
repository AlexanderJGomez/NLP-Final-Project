From the Swat Valley in the north to Sindh province in the south, as many as 15 million Pakistanis have been affected by torrential monsoon rains that have washed away villages and bloated rivers, authorities said Wednesday.
It said 1,588 people have been injured and 352,291 people have been rescued.
For many parts of southern Pakistan, the worst is yet to come.
And Pakistanis will be forced to endure the consequences of damaged infrastructure and crops lost to flooding for months.
He said he has lost more than $1,000 in business, a huge amount in this town in northwestern Pakistan, where the CIA World Factbook estimated the average annual income at $2,600.
He has already lost work and money is tight, but with the cost of food soaring, he said he and his family will simply have to eat less.
"The death toll has so far been relatively low compared to other major natural disasters, but the numbers affected are extraordinarily high," Holmes said.
Holmes said thousands of villages and at least 288,000 homes have been destroyed.
Millions of hectares of crops have been washed away in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province (KPK), Punjab and Sindh, and seed stocks have been destroyed, "severely compromising the possibility to plant staple food crops in September for hundreds of thousands of farmers," Holmes said.
"Millions more are expected to suffer from the combined impact of continuing torrential rains and unprecedented water levels in the rivers," Holmes said.
The U.N. reports $99.5 million has been pledged, and donors have committed or contributed $47.8 million to the U.N. emergency response in Pakistan, but $300 million more is needed.
Gates said the Pakistanis will decide the speed of distribution.
Also Wednesday, Germany said it was increasing aid for flood victims to about $12.8 million.
"Whatever amount the U.S. will give as donation, we will give the government of Pakistan more."
Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari has taken much of the heat.
