But she never gave up, and she continuously reminded herself to keep going.
Dumig met Sahra through a photo workshop at Refugio, a shelter in Munich, Germany, for refugees and torture victims.
One of the reasons Dumig decided to photograph Sahra is because growing up in Germany made Dumig realize that she lived a fortunate lifestyle.
"Apart Together" serves not only as a documentation of Sahra, but as a far-reaching story about people from all backgrounds.
"Every one of these (refugees) have strong stories, and in the bureaucratic system, they are just a number or a document," Dumig said.
Dumig describes Sahra as someone living through an unresolved situation.
There is no certain and clear way in which to arrange the pieces, because they are a representation of the fragmented nature of Sahra's life.
That's up to the viewer," Dumig said.
"Apart Together" allowed Dumig to share various special moments with Sahra, and they were both able to learn from each other.
