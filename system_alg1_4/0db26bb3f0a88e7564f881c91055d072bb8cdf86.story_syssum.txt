This should be the day Nigeria steps into the spotlight and basks in the glow of hosting the World Economic Forum in Africa.
But Nigeria does have a couple of obvious economic black-eyes, most notably an inability to close the wealth gap between the North and South, which in turn has given fuel to the Boko Haram movement and, by extension, radical Islam.
Let's start in the financial capital of Lagos and work our way North.
But if one heads North to Borno -- the birthplace of Boko Haram -- per capita income is just $1,631.
In Borno, alarmingly, 60% of the population lives in extreme poverty, according to the Nigeria Security Tracker.
After re-basing its economy in early April to take in services growth, Nigeria zoomed ahead of South Africa as the continent's biggest economy.
South Africa also struggles with less than a third of Nigeria's growth.
It is a nice recipe for growth, but the rule of law and rooting out corruption rank high on the foreign investor check list.
