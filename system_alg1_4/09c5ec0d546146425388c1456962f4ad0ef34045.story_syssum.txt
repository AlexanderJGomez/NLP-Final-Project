That cycle of death played out again Tuesday when mourners gathered to grieve a man who dared speak out against the Syrian government.
Word spread quickly Tuesday that a Damascus hospital had a collection of unidentified bodies.
"It was a car bomb parked next to the mosque where the people were gathered.
The explosion killed at least 13 people and wounded over a hundred," Al-Muadami said.
The Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha begins Friday.
CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the videos or reports of violence, as the Syrian government has restricted access to international journalists.
On Tuesday alone, at least 100 people were killed in Damascus and its suburbs; 50 were from Muadamiyet al-Sham, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said.
