(CNN)  -- Actor Wendell Pierce's biggest role today is running the Pontchartrain Park Community Development Corp., which is hard at work trying to rebuild the New Orleans neighborhood devastated by Hurricane Katrina.
WENDELL PIERCE: Pontchartrain Park started in 1952 as a result of the civil rights movement.
...
PIERCE: It was devastation.
I put out a call to action to people in my generation.
PIERCE: It's going great.
We have 200 people in line to purchase homes, and that's before any marketing.
We have the properties, the homes; we have people qualified with the bank, and we are still trying to access the money.
That's because the state is hostile to the city and is trying to reappropriate the money to other parts of the state and not to the city of New Orleans.
PIERCE: Right now in New Orleans, it's worse than the week of the storm.
Because it's a concerted effort to reappropriate the money and keep the poor and black people out.
The only large-scale thing they did was to destroy public housing and get rid of a large population of minority people and the poor.
There is a concerted effort to redistrict the city, a concerted effort to keep thousands of people out, change the demographics of the city and hope people give up on a mass scale.
PIERCE: We have everyone imaginable; we have elderly, we have young couples trying to get in, we have 80-year-olds trying to get back into their properties.
CNN: The government's not rebuilding New Orleans.
This is happening all over the city.
What surprised me the most [when I began this] was the lack of skill and competence on the government's part to know how to put this together, and how strong the effort to stop people from moving back to New Orleans is.
Our goal is 7,000 in the city, about 550 in the Park.
PIERCE: Yes, I do play the trombone, but I play very poorly, so they turn my mic off, and my sound double plays.
But I learned every song, and I'm getting better!
