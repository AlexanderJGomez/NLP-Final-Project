A week later Cosby allegedly plied them with drinks at a tennis club, after which the lawsuit states that Cosby took her to the Playboy Mansion.
A demurrer essentially says the complaint is so defective as written, that it should be dismissed His attorneys have also gone on the offensive, asking the court to impose sanctions against the attorneys who filed this lawsuit.
In real court, however, the rules are different.
Huth filed her complaint long after the time permitted by the statute of limitations.
While limitations periods are arbitrary, the public policy is not: defendants deserve protection of the law too.
Accordingly, some jurisdictions have special rules extending the time to file in cases of childhood sexual abuse.
Cosby's attorneys correctly point out that Huth failed to file the requisite certificates, which exposes the complaint itself to attack.
Huth was 15 years old in 1974 when the alleged abuse took place, and at least 55 years old when she filed this lawsuit.
That's why a plaintiff is prohibited under the rules from identifying the defendant by name until the court gives permission.
She didn't.
Plaintiff already identified Cosby in the complaint prior to obtaining court permission.
The court of public opinion will likely ignore these violations as technicalities, and continue to judge, and condemn Cosby.
But, under the rules of the Superior Court of California, this complaint should be dismissed.
