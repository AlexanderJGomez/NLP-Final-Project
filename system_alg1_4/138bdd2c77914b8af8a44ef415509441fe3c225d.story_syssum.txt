After debuting at number two with $19.5 million, Warner Bros.' Oscar contender dropped by just 16 percent last weekend to $16.4 million.
("The Town," which opened higher "Argo" with $23.8 million, fell 38 percent to $9.7 million in its third weekend.)
With $130.4 million total, Hotel is already Sony Pictures Animation's highest grossing film ever, above Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, which grossed $124.9 million in 2009.
Audiences, which were 77 percent above the age of 25, issued the film a "C+" CinemaScore.
Another loser?
After ten days, Paramount's $5 million found footage sequel has earned $42.6 million, which is still $10 million less than PA3 grossed in its first weekend.
"Taken 2" took fifth place, sliding 40 percent to $8.0 million, which gives Fox's $45 million action thriller a $117.4 million total.
Argo -- $12.4 million
Paranormal Activity 4 -- $8.7 million
Taken 2 -- $8.0 million
The original "Silent Hill" surprised analysts with a strong $20.2 million debut in 2006, but it clearly didn't leave enough of an impression on audiences for them to show up for a sequel six years later.
The $14 million film garnered a "B" CinemaScore grade from crowds, which were 67 percent female and 61 percent below the age of 18.
The film grossed $77.7 million from 25 territories, including $32.4 million from the U.K. (where the film set a new attendance record on Saturday), $9.1 million from France, and $8.6 million from Russia.
