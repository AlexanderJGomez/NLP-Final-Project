(CNN) -- People were "thrown to the roof as if they were dolls" and some feared for their lives when a Continental Airlines flight ran into turbulence, shaken passengers said.
Continental said seven passengers were transported to hospitals, and about 28 other passengers were treated at the scene.
That's when the plane really fell," Fabio Ottolini of Houston, who with his wife and daughter was returning from a visit with family in Brazil, told affiliate KTRK-TV in Houston.
"I felt like I was on a roller coaster," he told WSVN-TV.
He couldn't see because the cabin lights had gone out and "it was pitch black outside," Frederick Bright told the Houston Chronicle.
Most of those who were injured had not been wearing seat belts, passengers said.
"People that weren't seatbelted in flew up and hit the ceiling, so their heads and their faces hit the plastics all up at the top," John Norwood of Houston told WSVN-TV.
Watch passengers describe the terror Â»
It was terrible."
"It seemed like the back of the plane got it the worst, though, probably because there's more people in the back and a lot of people didn't have their seat belts on," Sharp told the Chronicle.
One of those was 13-year-old Thiago Candido, who was traveling unaccompanied.
"I thought the plane was falling, just like a big earthquake, but in the air," he said.
It just happened."
