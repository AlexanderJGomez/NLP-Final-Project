Andrew, still fifth in line to the British throne and Queen Elizabeth II's second son, carefully and wisely avoided mentioning the name Virginia Roberts (Jane Doe 3 in filed U.S. court papers) -- the woman at the center of the sordid claims.
She says she was 17-years old at the time of her first encounter with Prince Andrew, which is under the legal age of consent in Florida.
Since his association with convicted sex offender financier Epstein forced the Duke to accept a downgrading of his role as a UK trade envoy in 2011, he has been busy trying to carve out a new role for himself.
His work focuses on supporting entrepreneurs.
Two of the important initiatives he has inspired are the Digital Enterprise Awards -- referred to as "iDEA" -- which he is working with the Nominet Trust to deliver.
In 2014 the Duke launched Pitch@Palace, and held two competitive pitch events at St James's Palace, worked with 76 entrepreneurs from across the UK.
Essentially, his new role is all about assisting the economic success of, and the creation of skilled jobs in, the UK.
Entrepreneurship is his second core focus -- encouraging entrepreneurship in the UK, supporting current start-ups and efforts to develop a culture of enterprise.
He has also been key in showcasing the work of the UK Technology Industry and Innovators.
Why?
However, it is important to remember the prince is not facing legal proceedings over the U.S. claims.
The only way, perhaps, Andrew can hope to move on is by giving a detailed rebuttal of all the allegations that have been made against him in a sworn affidavit.
