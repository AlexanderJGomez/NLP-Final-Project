According to the IATA (International Air Transport Association)  2013 is expected to be another profitless year for the European airline industry.
According to the Association of European Airlines, the sector is expected to lose $1.5 billion this year.
Tyler argues this disparity is in part down to sluggish economic growth in Europe; crucially, however, it can also be impacted by what he calls "onerous" EU regulation and legislation.
Despite cutting legacy costs through mergers, consolidation and restructuring, European carriers are still facing the heavy hand of regulation and government, adds Tyler.
Tyler is referring to battle between IAG (International Airlines Group) and the Spanish government.
But in a time of great economic crisis in Europe, where each country is facing their own internal struggle, backing off may just be too painful for government.
