(CNN)Jami Smith Lane clearly remembers saying goodbye to her 14-year-old daughter, Sierra Wilder, for the last time.
And I said, 'I love you,'" Lane recalled.
The small plane carrying Sierra back home from vacation crashed Friday in western Kentucky.
"This town and this world is just going to be so different without them," said Lane.
"Sierra was so kind to everybody, and she looked at the positive in everything," she told CNN.
"We're helping each other out and leaning on each other," Lane said.
The other family members who died in the plane crash were Sierra's uncle and aunt, Marty and Kimberly Gutzler, and Piper, their 9-year-old daughter.
Marty Gutzler, 48, owned a furniture store in Nashville and loved flying, boating and spending time with his family, his obituary said.
And everyone knew him," Collins told CNN affiliate KFVS.
Kimberly Gutzler, 46, "loved her animals, traveling, painting and spending time with her family," according to her obituary.
"We're so saddened by the loss and are grieving the loss of Marty and Kim and Piper and Sierra."
