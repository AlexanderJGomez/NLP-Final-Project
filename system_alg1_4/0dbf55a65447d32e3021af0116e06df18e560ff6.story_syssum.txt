(CNN) -- Theodore Wafer said he was sorry from the bottom of his heart Wednesday for gunning down an unarmed young woman on the front porch of his Michigan home, but a judge said "mistake" was the wrong word to describe a murder and sentenced him to 15 to 30 years in prison.
"To the parents family and friends of Renisha McBride, I apologize from the bottom of my heart and I am truly sorry for your loss," Wafer said.
Hathaway said she was confident Wafer was remorseful and would likely never commit another crime in his life, but that McBride came to his doorstep seeking help and lost her life.
But Hathaway said the sentencing guidelines were reasonable for the crime, giving him 15 to 30 years for second-degree murder and two additional years for possessing a firearm while committing the felony.
McBride's sister, Jasmine, said: "Losing my sister was one of the most devastating times of my life.
I didn't want to be a victim in my own house," he said.
Some three hours later, she lay dead on Wafer's porch.
After the incident, Wafer told police he was angry and "full of piss and vinegar" when he opened the door that night, according to prosecutors.
