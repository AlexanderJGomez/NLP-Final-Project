Zenani Mandela, 13, was buried in a private ceremony earlier in the day, Mandela's office said, after she was killed in a car crash June 11.
Zenani was returning from the World Cup soccer tournament's kickoff concert when she was killed.
Her uncle, Prince Zinhle Dlamini, told mourners that she had met Portuguese soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo on her birthday.
Zenani was one of Mandela's nine great-grandchildren.
Mandela, who is 91, has limited his public appearances recently, although he did meet the South Africa soccer squad before the World Cup began.
