SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (CNN) -- Richard Holbrooke first visited Bosnia in 1992 as a private citizen.
In the ethnically mixed capital, Sarajevo, Holbrooke saw Bosnian Serb forces laying siege to the city to drive out Muslims.
"I thought I'm seeing a color remake of the black and white scenes we'd seen in World War II of Jews signing away their property at the point of a gun and then being shipped off to who knows where," Holbrooke said.

Holbrooke, who had served President Jimmy Carter as an assistant secretary of state, offered his recommendation to Bill Clinton's advisers during the 1992 presidential campaign: Direct use of force against the Bosnian Serbs.
"I took a stand that I believed was correct," Holbrooke said.
Holbrooke wanted to handle Bosnia for the Clinton administration.
"We tried to convince them.
Under mounting criticism in the press, Clinton asked Holbrooke in May 1994 to leave his post in Germany and return to the White House to help with Bosnia.
He was now ready to lead, with or without approval from other nations.
"What I said to the Europeans was, 'We're going to do this.
"I don't like to advocate the use of force, [because] I know people will get killed," Holbrooke said.
