Iglesias' renowned voice has made him a superstar worldwide but his first foray into the spotlight wasn't through his voice, it was his feet.
Iglesias humbly admits he was never a real football talent but he had the discipline which would see him play with the biggest names of that generation.

I believe people come into your life for a reason."
For Iglesias, that belief was crystallized in that devastating moment, and those challenging two years changed his life.

I disciplined my life.
Discipline woke up my life again."
"Since that time I understood that music, and the passion for music, was my life ...
The life came back to my eyes and I became a singer."
