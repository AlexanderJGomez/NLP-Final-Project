At the hearing, lawyers for the Patriots said the team would not pay Hernandez the $3.25 million that the NFL Players Association has said the player is owed.
Hernandez, 24, has pleaded not guilty to a charge of first-degree murder in the June shooting of his friend Lloyd, 27, a Boston-area semipro football player who was dating the sister of Hernandez's girlfriend.
CNN's calls to Hernandez's attorney were not immediately returned.
Police have said that the homicide may be linked to Hernandez, according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation.
