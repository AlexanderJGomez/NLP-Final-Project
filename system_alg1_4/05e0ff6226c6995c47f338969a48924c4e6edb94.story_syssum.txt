(CNN)A Saudi-led coalition Tuesday ended its "Operation Decisive Storm" -- its nearly monthlong airstrike campaign in Yemen -- and a new initiative is underway.
This month, Saudi officials said airstrikes have degraded Houthi-controlled military infrastructure, including key buildings in the capital Sanaa.
Former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh and his family will leave Yemen and never return for a position in politics, the source said.
But beyond the military campaign, the Saudis and their allies have said they want to find a political solution for the violence-plagued nation.
"We promise to restructure the Yemen military to ensure that it serves the people of Yemen," Hadi said, calling on the Houthis to withdraw, and saying that he would return to Yemen at "the right time" to rebuild the country.
