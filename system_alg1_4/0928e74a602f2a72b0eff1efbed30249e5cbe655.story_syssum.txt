But since the contracts have been hammered out -- with some of the leading cast members now earning a reported $1 million per episode -- "The Big Bang Theory" is moving forward with what sounds like a season full of changes.
Penny (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting) and Leonard may have ended the seventh season with an engagement, but executive producer Steve Molaro told TV Guide they're not rushing the couple to the altar.
Besides, Molaro added, he's just not ready to see Leonard and Sheldon cease being roommates.
The new gig has the potential to rock the boat in Penny's new engagement.
Along with Penny, Sheldon's also carving a new path at work.
"He's playing too many roles for my character to feel comfortable with," Simon Helberg, who plays Howard, says of the new season.
It's Leonard that Sheldon calls when he gets into trouble, and when Amy shows up with Leonard at the police station, a surprised Sheldon asks, "Why did you come?"
The couple is still together as season 8 begins, and Molaro promises that we'll learn more about Emily as the season progresses.
ET until October 30, when it will shift back to its usual timeslot of Thursdays at 8 p.m.
