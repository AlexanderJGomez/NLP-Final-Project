(CNN) -- European leaders meeting in Brussels Thursday need to send Russia an unmistakeable signal that its military intervention in Ukraine will not be tolerated.
An important starting point is for EU policy makers to understand that Russia acted out of weakness rather than strength.
Putin wants to rebuild his influence over Ukraine as a whole and recognizes that the occupation of Crimea is more likely to unite the country against him.
Little progress has been made in modernizing and diversifying the economy despite years of talking about it.
One important focus of attention should be on political and economic reform in Ukraine itself.
Assistance should also be given to help Ukraine realize its goal of energy independence from Russia.
The EU should be willing to talk to Russia about its interests in the region and the creation of a common economic space provided Russia ends its military intervention, restores friendly ties with Kiev and doesn't assume a right of veto over Ukraine's future.
Targeted measures aimed at the financial and personal interests of the Russian elite will also help to focus minds.
In addition to concerns about Kaliningrad and eastern Siberia, Moscow faces open revolt in the northern Caucasus.
So far the measures European leaders have been prepared to discuss fall far short of what is required get Russia's attention.
Only a direct challenge to Russia's material and geopolitical interests is likely to have an impact on Putin's calculations.
