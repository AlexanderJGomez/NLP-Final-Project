(CNN) -- Once investigators looking for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 decide to shift from listening for pings emanating from the floor of the Indian Ocean to poring over its terrain, they will begin drawing from a whole new set of tools.
Once the debris field is found, then other equipment -- such as remotely operated vehicles -- would be brought in to recover the black boxes, Earle said.
"Having the human presence there can make a big difference," she said.
The time to move from listening for pings to looking for debris is fast approaching, said Alan Diehl, a former Air Force accident investigator.
"They spent weeks looking for debris in the wrong area," he said.
If that was the case, it could complicate the effort to retrieve the black boxes, since they were stored inside the tail of the plane.
