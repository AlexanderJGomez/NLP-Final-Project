Lt. Timothy Breen flies missions close to Iranian air space almost every day in his U.S. Navy F-18 Hornet, often encountering Iranian military aircraft over the strategic waters of the Strait of Hormuz.
"We've heard the rhetoric about them possibly closing the Strait of Hormuz and we just remain vigilant as we come through," said Rear Admiral Troy Shoemaker, who led a carrier strike group that this week escorted the Abraham Lincoln as the carrier on its second passage through the Strait this year.
Shoemaker says his crew takes care not to provoke Iran through its maneuvering, but at the same is prepared to answer any military escalation by Iran's navy.
And aboard the Abraham Lincoln, the crew works round the clock to ensure the carrier is always capable of launching its aircraft.
Shooters are also responsible for monitoring the pressure of the massive steam-powered catapults that propel the planes from 0-160 miles an hour in about 2 seconds.
"We can launch four aircraft in about a minute, then we takes a few minutes to re load the catapults and get next batch of aircraft into position," said Lt. Cmdr.
The U.S. Navy speaks of scenarios in which Iran could launch sudden, almost insurgent style attacks on larger, better-equipped U.S. warships.
The carrier is now on its way to new mission to support NATO forces in Afghanistan, but as international concerns over Iran persist, America's presence in the Persian Gulf will remain.
