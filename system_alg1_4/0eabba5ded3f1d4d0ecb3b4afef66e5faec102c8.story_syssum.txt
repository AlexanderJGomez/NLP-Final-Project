However this is great news for women in tech.
African women can be key power players and the continent's tech scene is a burning star but there are very few women at the forefront of that supernova.
Marieme Jamme, the founder of a great initiative called Africa Gathering is another -- she works to pioneer growth on the continent as well as inspire young African women to tech involve in the technology space.
I think it's time women in Africa stop looking at technology as something that men do.
Women like Rapelang Rabana, co-founder of Yeigo Communications, a mobile VoIP company that was integrated into the Telfree group.
She was also called a tech pioneer by South Africa's Minister of communication at a conference aimed at promoting technology in Africa.
It's not just a world of founders and entrepreneurs.
Before that she was the Business Development Manager for Google's Africa.
Main One is a communications company that provides "open access international connectivity and broadband capacity to countries in West Africa."
