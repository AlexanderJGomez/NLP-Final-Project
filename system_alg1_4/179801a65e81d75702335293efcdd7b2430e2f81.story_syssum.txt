(CNN) -- Police charged an 18-year-old with murder in the case of a University of Florida student last seen eight days ago, a police spokesman said Friday.
The 18-year-old Aguilar was last seen about 6 p.m. September 20, according to a police statement.
Police told Aguilar's family about the murder charge -- and, with it, the presumption the college student was dead -- about an hour before the public announcement, Tobias said.
Bravo then left Aguilar in a parking lot in the central Florida city, prompting police to warn that Aguilar may be disoriented and/or seriously injured.
Bravo's family initially volunteered to help in the search, only to be politely turned down by Aguilar's family, Kozlowski said.
