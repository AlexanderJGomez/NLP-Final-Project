"He's going to be part of the history," Addahoumi said about his son, Sammi, who is in the rebel hub of Benghazi.
Addahoumi spoke to CNN from his home in Columbia, South Carolina, where he said he was glued to news about Libya.
"I wish I could be part of this history," he said.
"Everyone is expecting Tripoli to fall."
He said he has spent time off and on in Libya since 2005.
"This is the best thing that could have happened to us," Addahoumi said.
"Libya is going to be a new nation."
