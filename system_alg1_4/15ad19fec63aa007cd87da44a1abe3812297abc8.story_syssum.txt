London (CNN) -- Jacintha Saldanha should never have become a household name.
She spent her time off duty in the family home in the southwestern city of Bristol, according to UK media reports.
But for her classmates and colleagues back home in India, she was a deeply religious, benevolent and bold young woman.
"She would share her bread, coffee and sweets with the patients," Mathias said as she reminisced about her time with her old friend.
Both of us will pray together for the patients," Mathias said.
Last year, Saldanha visited her alma mater and donated money for the needy receiving treatment at the hospital, the nursing chief said.
"She was a forward-looking girl.
And she was an active participant in several activities of the college," Mathias said.
She was not that type who would do that," she said.
She was always ready to face any kind of a situation," Martis said of her friend.

A family acquaintance, Ivan D'Souza, also considered her a "confident" person.
Others back in Britain also praised her as a professional and caring person.
For now, D'Souza said, much of Saldanha's family is in her birthplace, waiting for her body to arrive.
(Heart) Jacintha saldanha."
