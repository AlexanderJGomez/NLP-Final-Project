OP to RS: Angel please don't say a thing to anyone.
RS to OP: There are a lot of things that could make us both feel like s**t.
OP to RS: I know.
RS to OP: It's like I see rabbit things in your house and when we go places you take pics of them everywhere.
RS to OP: I certainly have never been a prude and I've had fun but all innocent and without harmful repercussions.
I feel sick that you suggested that and that you made a scene at the table and made us leave early.
You really have dated a lot of people yet you get upset if I mention ONE funny story with a long term boyfriend.
I do everything to make you happy and to not say anything to rock the boat with u.
SO upset.
I'm the girl who fell in love with u and wanted to tell u this weekend.
Do this don't do that.
From the outside I think it looks like we are a struggle and maybe that's what we are.
Cos right now I know u aren't happy and I am certainly very unhappy and sad.
OP to RS: I want to talk to you.
And when I spoke up you introduced me which you could've done but when I left you just kept on chatting to him when clearly I was upset.
I'm sorry I wanted to go but I was hungry and upset and although you knew it, it wasn't like you came to chat to me when I left the table.
I'm sorry I asked you to stop tapping my neck yesterday, I know you were just trying to show me love.
I also knew people there tonight and whilst you were having one or two pics taken I was saying goodbye to the people in my industry and Fitz wanted a photo with me.
I'm a person too and I appreciate that you invited me out tonight and I realize that you get harassed but I am trying my best to make you happy and I feel as though you sometimes never are, no matter the effort I put in.
I can't be attacked by outsiders for dating you and be attacked by you -- the one person I deserve protection from.
