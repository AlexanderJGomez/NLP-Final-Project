(CNN) -- A congressional hearing Thursday on aviation security will be missing its chief witness, who declined to testify.
"No representative from TSA will be present," Pistole said in a statement posted on the agency's website.
The committee insisted it has legislative jurisdiction when it comes to the airline industry and its passengers, who help finance TSA operations through security fees.
Pistole said TSA would continue to work with "committees of jurisdiction" on agency matters.
Industry representatives will also appear.
