The striker has been tempted away from Italian giants AC Milan to ply his trade in the French league, signing on a three-year contract for a reputed fee of $24.5 million.
"I want to thank Paris Saint-Germain and (sporting director) Leonardo for the great work they've done," Ibrahimovic told a press conference at the club's Parc des Princes stadium.
In my mind I was very clear, and I knew what I wanted.
"I want to be part of this club's history and I'm pretty sure we will make history.
Ibrahimovic left after falling out with former coach Josep Guardiola and returned to Italy to play for AC Milan.
I was very happy to be at Milan.
They made it easy for me to come to PSG so I thank them and I wish them all the best."
PSG also announced the signing of 19-year-old midfielder Marco Verratti from Serie A club Pescara and the club's sporting director Leonardo said that their transfer business had now been completed.
