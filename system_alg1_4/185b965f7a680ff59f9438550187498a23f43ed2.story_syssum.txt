(CNN) -- A vaccine not licensed for use in the United States will be offered to thousands of Princeton University students beginning Monday, after a string of meningitis B cases at the college this year.
Additionally, around half a dozen people with conditions that fall under the recommendation would also be affected, although there may be more who have not yet disclosed their conditions, he said.
Princeton will cover the cost of the vaccine.
Meningitis is caused by inflammation of the membranes that cover the brain and the spinal cord, known as the meninges.
