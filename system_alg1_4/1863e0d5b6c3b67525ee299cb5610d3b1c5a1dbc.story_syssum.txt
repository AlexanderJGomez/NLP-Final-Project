I love to come to New York and any time I got a chance, when Les Paul was still alive, I would always try to schedule to see him play.
At one point, Sir Paul got up on stage with Les Paul and started clowning around with him, saying how much the Beatles loved him and stole his songs but had never been able to give him any credit.
There were only about sixty people in the club, it's a very small room, so Sir Paul gave everyone at the Les Paul performance a very special experience.
I'm a musician myself, I play bass guitar with a little band in Atlanta, where I live.
