(Rolling Stone) -- On July 25th, 1965, Bob Dylan walked onstage at the Newport Folk Festival, plugged in his 1964 sunburst Fender Stratocaster and tore through a scorching three-song set.
"After one flight, my father saw there were three guitars left on the plane," she says.
In fact, Dylan says that's not what happened.
But experts make a strong case that the guitar in question is the same one Dylan played at the festival in 1965.
'A vast percentage of the stuff I get shown isn't real,' he says.
'By nature, I'm a defeatist.
"In one of these manuscripts, Dylan had written 'six flying horses,' and then above 'flying' he'd written 'white' and 'the.'
"It's his guitar until he makes an affirmative act to give it to someone else or sell it," says lawyer Josh Grier, who represents artists including Wilco.
In 2005, Peterson wrote to Bob Dylan's management and requested that he waive any claim to the guitar.
"Things have crossed my mind."
