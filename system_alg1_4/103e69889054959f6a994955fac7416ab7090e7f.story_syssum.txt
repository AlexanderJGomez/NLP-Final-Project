Perhaps now -- after becoming the first British man to win Wimbledon for what seemed an eternity, Andy Murray will finally feel loved.
"It feels slightly different to last year," Murray told fans on Centre Court.
"My head was everywhere in that last game, he was hitting some unbelievable shots and I think that is why at the end of the match I almost didn't know what had happened.
That defeat in the final to Roger Federer was a turning point -- not just in Murray's career, but in his relationship with British tennis fans.
A straight sets victory over World No.1 Djokovic is an astonishing achievement -- more so given the level of pressure heaped on Murray around this time of year.
Murray is all too aware of the history.
But whereas last year he had yet to win a grand slam tournament before taking on Roger Federer in last year's final, that is no longer the case.
He's been very patient with me.
So when Djokovic led 4-1 in the second set, there were few brave enough to write Murray off, even against one of the finest players of his generation.
With just one set separating him from sporting immortality, Murray began in fine style, breaking Djokovic to take a 2-0 lead.
Backed by vociferous following, he fought his way back to level before breaking Djokovic to lead 5-4 and ensure he would serve for the match.
Djokovic staved off three Championship points before having the audacity to force Murray to save three break points.
The rocky road to love might have been a long one but this love affair between Murray and the British public could be just beginning.
