"It is a sacred thing to create a face," says Wallace Chan, 58, the Chinese artisan jeweler that produced the piece.
"It's like a ghost appearing in the gem as you work.
It's not the first time that Chan has "created" a human face in a jewel.
"When you work from the back of the jewel, right is left, top is bottom and deep becomes shallow.
When he started using the tool, he quickly realized that the heat generated would damage the gemstone -- a major problem with material that is this expensive.
This is a painstaking process, but for Chan it is also a meditative one.
"My mind is one with the work, and my physical self is removed from the gemstone," he explains.
After being commissioned by a Taiwanese art collector to make a jeweled "stupa", or Buddhist reliquary, Chan's focus shifted from sculpture to jewelery and he began to explore innovative techniques.
In the Eighties he began to practice, using cheap crystals.
The rest is history.
Chan was the first Asian artist to exhibit his work at the prestigious Bienalle des Antiquaires in Paris.
These pieces of jewelry carry such an aura of exclusivity that it is rare to find a Chan piece on the open market.
"Each piece can take me thousands of hours," he says.
