Obama and McCain both promise a government that will watch over us ... "I don't like that," says Penn Jillette.
Not me.
But I'm stupider than all the stupid in both of them put together.
He's more ambitious than I; he's going to be the next president of the United States, and I couldn't even get to week three of "Dancing with the Stars."
But I don't think our next president being a great leader is a good thing.
We need someone stupid enough to understand that the president of the United States can't solve many problems without taking away freedom and therefore shouldn't try.
I don't want anyone as president who promises to take care of me.
You gotta be smarter than me to do all that, but you don't have to be as smart as Obama, and you sure don't have to be a great leader.
It's really hard to find someone who trusts Americans to take care of themselves and each other without government force.
People won't even hear someone suggesting that our president should do less and individual citizens should do more for themselves.
If we could find a lazier, less charismatic, stupider person than me to be president, I'd be all for it.
