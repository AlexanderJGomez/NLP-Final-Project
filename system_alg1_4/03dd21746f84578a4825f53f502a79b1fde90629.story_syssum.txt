Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- At least three people were killed and 174 injured during clashes in Egypt on Sunday, officials said, exactly one year after the country's first democratically elected president came to power.
Two others were killed in Asuit, he said.
Anti-Morsy protesters have a wide range of views on why Morsy should go and how to eject him from office.
Morsy's opponents stood their ground in the square, where protests two years ago helped topple Mubarak's 29-year rule.
A sit-in that started on Friday continued in Rabaa Al-Adawiya Square, where thousands of supporters gathered in support of Morsy.
Protests also erupted Sunday in Suez, Sharqia, El Monofia and Gharbiya, the state-run Ahram news agency said.
Before the death reported Sunday, clashes had already claimed at least eight lives, including associates of the Muslim Brotherhood whose offices came under attack.
An Egyptian man died from a gunshot wound to the head, the health ministry said.
On Sunday, a spokesman for the group said that its headquarters in Cairo fell under attack from between 100 and 150 "thugs."
"Peace is our weapon," Sabahy said in a video message posted Saturday.
Although Morsy gave a speech highlighting his achievements during his first year in office, opposition members said he did not address his shortcomings and called for snap presidential polls, a new government and constitutional amendments.
But Morsy is not Mubarak.
The United States has approved the departure of embassy and consulate employees and their dependents because of the unrest, a senior State Department official said.
