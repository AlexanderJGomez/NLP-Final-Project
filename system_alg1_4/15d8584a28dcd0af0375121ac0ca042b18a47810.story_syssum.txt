Zlitan, Libya (CNN) -- Firefighters battled a blaze caused by NATO airstrikes at a food-storage complex Monday in Zlitan, increasingly a front-line city in the conflict between Libyan government troops and rebels fighting to oust longtime ruler Moammar Gadhafi.
No one was hurt in Monday's attack, Amar said.
And another attack two days ago demolished what he described as a military base several hundred yards up the road, killing at least two people, he said.
The NATO alliance says it has been hitting targets it describes as tanks, "military storage facilities" and artillery pieces in the vicinity of Zlitan on a daily basis for the past week.
"People here call NATO the crazy one which lost its sanity," said Ramadan Mohamad Ramadan, an official from the local city government.
Government officials said they were looking for the bodies of three people believed to be buried underneath, and said the bodies of eight people had been pulled out earlier in the day.
Responding to the Libyan government's claims to journalists that a health clinic and food-storage facility had been hit, NATO had found no evidence to support the allegations, a NATO representative said.
NATO forces had hit a number of targets near Zlitan that were "military in nature" Monday, the representative said.
In the afternoon, government minders brought journalists to the ruins of a mosque and school located in an all-but-deserted residential neighborhood several kilometers to the east of Zlitan's city center.
A four-door sedan, caked with mud and carrying several men wearing camouflage and carrying Kalashnikov rifles, drove past, also headed away from the direction of the front lines as the cloud from a second apparent air strike billowed in the distance.
Monday's government tour of Zlitan was over, but the fighting there appeared to have barely begun.
