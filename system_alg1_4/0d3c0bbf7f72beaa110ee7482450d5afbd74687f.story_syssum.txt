To be fair, Psaki described the U.S. peace talks with the Taliban -- which Afghan President Hamid Karzai opposes -- as the preliminary step toward long healing process in war-torn Afghanistan and creating "reconciliation" within the country.
"The important thing here is that we've long said that moving toward a reconciliation process, of which they are a key part -- the president has said this, the secretary (of state) has said this -- is an important part of moving towards a more stable Afghanistan.
What has influenced U.S. leaders is the Taliban's announcement that they oppose "the use of Afghan soil to threaten other countries" such as the United States and they support an Afghan peace process, Psaki said.
Karzai was referring to how, during Tuesday's ribbon-cutting in Qatar, a Taliban spokesman said the group would continue its military campaign while at the same time renouncing international terrorism.
"We've long said that this conflict will likely not be won on the battlefield, and that is why we support this office," Psaki said.
The ability to open a formal line of communication with the Taliban is important to reaching an "end goal" of disassociating the Taliban from al Qaeda and bringing peace to Afghanistan, Psaki said.
This is a first step in the process.
"This is just the first step in the process.
That U.S. withdrawal raises the stakes for Afghanistan to govern itself in peace.
