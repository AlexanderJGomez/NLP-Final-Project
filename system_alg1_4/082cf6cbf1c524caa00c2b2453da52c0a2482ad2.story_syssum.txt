(CNN)The nurse in Texas seemed to have taken all the precautions needed to protect herself from Ebola.
She is in critical condition and being treated by 50 health care workers, Spanish authorities said Monday.
Or could there be more to it?
The nurse who tested positive for the virus worked at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas.
The workers are supposed to double their gloves in some situations, she said.
"It is possible in the coming days that we will see additional cases of Ebola," Frieden said.
The official who has direct knowledge of the Texas case told CNN that health authorities will make daily visits to dozens of Dallas health care workers who treated Duncan between September 28 and October 8 at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital.
The CDC is still compiling a list of health care workers who came into contact with Duncan, the official said.
When a passenger on a flight from New York to Los Angeles fell ill Sunday, the biggest concern was Ebola.
"There are too many unknowns at this point, and it is absurd to transport potentially hazardous Ebola waste across state lines," Caldwell said Sunday.
"They have the management, the processes, the implementation in place that if an Ebola patient comes in, just right away they know what to do," said Gavin MacGregor-Skinner, who teaches public health preparedness at Penn State University.
Of them, 76% said their hospital hasn't communicated any policy about how to admit Ebola-infected patients.
And 85% said their hospital hasn't provided education on Ebola where the nurses can interact and ask questions.
