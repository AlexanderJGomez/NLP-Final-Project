JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN)  -- Indonesia is no stranger to bombings such as the one that rocked two luxury hotels in Jakarta on Friday.
More than 300 people -- many of them young Australians on vacation -- were wounded by the massive blasts in the town of Kuta.
Many of those convicted in the plot were sentenced to death or life in prison.
Despite the string of bombings, presidential spokesman Dino Patti Djalal said Indonesia has made strides in addressing terrorist groups.
And we have not had an attack since the Bali bombing several years ago.
But this is a blow.
