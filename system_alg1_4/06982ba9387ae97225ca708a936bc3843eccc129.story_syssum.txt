Hamid Dabashi says protesters in Iran would be harmed by U.S. aid to "promote democracy" in that nation.
(CNN) -- On a number of occasions and in perfectly pitched and calibrated statements, President Obama has expressed his unequivocal support for the civil rights movement in Iran without appearing to interfere in Iranian domestic affairs.
As the whole world is now a witness to it, the civil rights movement in Iran is a nonviolent demand to exercise people's constitutional rights to participate in the democratic aspirations of their homeland, turned bloody only by the custodians of an Islamic republic who seem to be too conscious of their own illegitimacy.
The only thing it needs is the moral voice of the American civil rights movement to come to its aid.
If I were the president, I would reallocate that budget and spend it on enriching inner city public schools, enabling them to develop courses on modern Iranian and Islamic history.
Not just one but four swords of Damocles are now hanging over the Iranian civil rights movement.
But the other three swords are held over this movement from outside Iran, in fact from the United States government.
Whatever the fate of the Islamic republic, the noble cause of civil liberties will remain constant in Iran and will emerge as a model for the region.
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hamid Dabashi.
