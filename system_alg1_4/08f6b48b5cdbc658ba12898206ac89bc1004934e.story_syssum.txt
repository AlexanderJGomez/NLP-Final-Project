Last week's federal indictment against Mufid Elfgeeh provides a reminder of the potential for acts of violence by Americans inspired by al Qaeda's ideology that the new recording by ISIS seeks to exploit.
While al Qaeda and its affiliates have failed to conduct any successful attacks in the United States since 9/11, they have sought to encourage action from militant American citizens, who might be more capable of carrying out terrorist operations in the States than foreign operatives given the stringent security measures now in place.
According to the New America Foundation's research, an astonishing quarter of the 247 jihadist extremists charged since 9/11 either possessed copies of al-Awlaki's propaganda materials, cited him as an influence or were in communication with him.
So far, nine Americans have been charged with attempting to support or supporting ISIS or Nusra, according to a count by New America.
Of the 51 plots to conduct an attack inside the United States since 9/11, nearly half were initiated while the suspects were under surveillance by informants, according to a count by New America.
Today, there are more than 40,000.
In 2014, all of these new institutions make it much harder for terrorists to operate in the United States.
In addition, greater public awareness of the danger posed by terrorism has also made the United States a much harder target.
