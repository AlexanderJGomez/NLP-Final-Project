New York (CNN) -- On the eve of the 12th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly is questioning why none of the city's mayoral candidates has requested a briefing from the NYPD about its counterterrorism program, strategies or tactics.
"What is their understanding of the terrorist threat to New York City and its immediacy?
A spokesman for Bill de Blasio, the mayoral front-runner garnering 39% of Democratic primary voters, according to a Quinnipiac poll released Monday, told CNN that de Blasio requested a counterterrorism briefing on August 29.
"Bill de Blasio believes there is nothing more important than protecting New York City from the threat of terror and keeping New Yorkers safe.
"Christine Quinn is the speaker of the City Council, and as part of her day-to-day job helping run this city, she has conversations and briefings regularly with the NYPD on everything from crime to counterterrorism," Mike Morey, a spokesman for Quinn, said Monday.
"The public should demand detailed answers from the candidates about their plans to protect New York.
We've come too far and we've sacrificed too much to leave ourselves vulnerable."
