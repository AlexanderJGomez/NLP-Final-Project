Her's is an inspiring story of a young woman who fought odds that were heavily stacked against her to achieve her dreams.
With her story still ringing in my head, I set off to a small village near Chandrapur in India's Maharashtra state on International Youth Day at the behest of UNICEF to visit a new generation of strong young Indian women with some very inspiring stories.
We need to urgently invest in their future and help them realize their potential and I am determined to help make that happen.
In Maharashtra, like many other states in India, girls are held back by not completing education, early marriage, ignorance around health issues, and lacking financial understanding and a voice for decision making.
If we can educate more girls, provide them with employment opportunities and give them the right life skills, their world will open up!
I was truly inspired.
How can we make sure that "all girls and boys can make their own name and fate and be independent," as one girl told me.
Walking along a path in this quiet village in the middle of nowhere, it is easy to see how a girl can get lost -- lost for life.
The girls were not expected to have a future.
Her father was paralyzed and was not able to take care of the family and that's where his young daughter stepped in.
With programs like Building Young Futures, these positive stories and messages will only grow in number.
