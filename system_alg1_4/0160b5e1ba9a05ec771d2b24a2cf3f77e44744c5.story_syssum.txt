We asked Bob to share some of his favorites.
Mix the sauce ingredients together and set aside so that it has a chance to come to room temperature while you are preparing the spinach and eggs.
Top the toasted English muffin with the spinach and eggs; delicately spoon the sauce on top.
Replace the fatty butter and sugary jam you used to pile on your toast with this abundance of natural flavors, good fats and protein, and you will have a well-balanced meal to kick-start your day!
In a small bowl, mash and mix the avocado, paprika and lemon juice.
Avocado toast is one I just have to have several times a week!
In a medium bowl, mix the tuna, capers, shallot and olives.

Thinly sliced zucchini will work in any recipe that calls for pasta.
Toss the "noodles" with the sauce and the cubed chicken and serve.
"If you have a mandoline, use that to slice the zucchini thinly (but watch your fingertips!).
Chimichurri is an Argentinean sauce similar to pesto.
Cook for 5 minutes, then add the tomatoes and spinach.
Drizzle the chimichurri sauce over the steak.
And chimichurri isn't only for steak; you can use this as a marinade for any protein, as a sauce for lunch pasta, as a topping on eggs or as a dressing."
