(CNN) -- Police recently seized a cab owned by Jesse Matthew, the last person seen with missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham and who also has been linked to another college student's death in 2009, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN.
Yet, late last month, DNA evidence linked Matthew to Harrington's death, a law enforcement source told CNN.
Meanwhile, authorities say they don't know where Graham is.
It's certainly a legitimate question," Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo told reporters last month.
