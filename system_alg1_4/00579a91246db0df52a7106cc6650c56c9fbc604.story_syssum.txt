Police were hunting for Ryan Alexander Jenkins after the death of Jasmine Fiore.
Walker said a woman, about 20 to 25 years old, dropped off Jenkins at the motel on Friday in a silver Chrysler PT Cruiser with Alberta tags.
The nude body of Jenkins' wife, former swimsuit model Jasmine Fiore, was found last weekend in Orange County, California.
Fiore lived in Los Angeles and was last seen alive in San Diego at a poker game with Jenkins, the night before the body was found.
Jenkins reported Fiore missing last Saturday night to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, authorities said.
And in 2007, Jenkins pleaded guilty in Calgary, Alberta, Canada to assault in a separate case.
51 Minds is investigating what went wrong and taking steps to ensure that this sort of lapse never occurs again."
