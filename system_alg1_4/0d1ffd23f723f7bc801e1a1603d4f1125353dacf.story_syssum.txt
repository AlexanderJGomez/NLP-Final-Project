Pyongyang, North Korea (CNN) -- The last thing Thomas Hudner said to mortally wounded pilot Jesse Brown was that he would come back for him.
On December 4, 1950, Hudner, now 88, was part of a six-plane formation providing air support for U.S. Marines on the ground fighting Chinese troops during the Korean War.
Hudner refused to leave him.
"The Marine pilot pulled me aside," Hudner told CNN, "and said dusk was approaching and he couldn't fly the helicopter in the dark and the mountainous terrain, so he had to leave.
If the Chinese troops didn't claim Hudner, the Korean winter would.
In a rare show of cooperation with a country it often calls the imperialistic enemy, North Korea has given permission for Hudner to return to Chosin Reservoir.
Arms and medical supplies also froze in subzero temperatures.
Hudner told CNN he didn't think the trip would ever happen.
"We're very grateful to him (leader Kim Jong Un) and to the North Korean government that after all these years we've been given permission to look for Jesse's airplane," he said.
The group is not planning on attending the commemoration.
The timing of the invitation to the U.S. veterans is likely intentional, but for Hudner, the focus is bringing closure to his Korean War experiences and to Brown's family.
