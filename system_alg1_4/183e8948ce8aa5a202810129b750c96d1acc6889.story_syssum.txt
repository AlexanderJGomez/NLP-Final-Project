(CNN) -- When makers of one of the most anticipated video games of the year invited users to help design part of the game, the gamers jumped at the chance to create animated characters.
The game, a joint venture from "Sims" creator Will Wright and Electronic Arts, allows users to create a unique creature and then control its evolution from a single cell into a complex cultural civilization.
For EA, the developer of "Spore," it's the downside to tapping into the booming user-generated content arena, which has made sites like YouTube, Flickr, MySpace, Facebook and Second Life so popular.
Despite its "Sporn" issues, "Spore" is poised to become one of the most popular games because of its ability to let people tell their own story, rather than one mapped out for them, Bradshaw said.
"Rather than putting players in the shoes of Luke Skywalker or Frodo Baggins, we're giving them the opportunity to be George Lucas or Peter Jackson, as they create their own universe from scratch," she said.
"It came up simply as something silly and juvenile to do," he said.
Players who repeatedly upload "offensive content" are warned, suspended and eventually banned, Bradshaw said.
"It was a totally ridiculous overreaction," the 37-year-old Web developer said.
He said many other creators of Sporn have told him that they too were only joking around.
EA plans to make sure nobody sees the content if they don't want to, Bradshaw said.
"User-created content gives players total control over their game experience and empowers them to express their creativity in ways that they never thought possible," Bradshaw said.
"My initial reaction to discovering it in my final game would be to ban it so it wouldn't show up again and then blow it to pieces for the sheer satisfaction of it," Moffit said.
