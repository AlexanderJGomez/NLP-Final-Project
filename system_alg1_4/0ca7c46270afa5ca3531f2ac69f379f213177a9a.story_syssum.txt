Western education is a sin in the eyes of the terror group --- and nowhere has that message more clearly hit home than in their recent horrific attack on Chibok Girls Secondary School.
Daniel Muvia, a resident of Chibok who witnessed the attack on his village, says he is too scared to take his daughters to school.
"I'm not feeling good that they're at home and I'm not feeling good to send them to school because of the attacks."
In an article on his website "Education for All" Gordon Brown, the U.N. Special Envoy for Global Education, says 10.5 million children in Nigeria are yet to go to school and that the high levels of illiteracy are now an economic problem, as well as a social disaster, for the country.
"If in Chibok, I'll never go again," she says.
All the people in Chibok seem to have left is hope.
