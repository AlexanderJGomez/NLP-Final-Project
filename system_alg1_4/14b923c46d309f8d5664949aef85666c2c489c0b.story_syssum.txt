The horror that followed Tuesday at the Army Public School and Degree College in Peshawar, Pakistan, has shocked the world: 145 people dead, most of them children.
Mohammed Bilal, 13, said he was taking a math test when the gunfire started.
The ninth-grader told CNN that after a bullet hit his left shoulder, he lay under one of the benches in the room.
Muhammad Anas, 15, said that students in the auditorium were initially told that the sounds of bullets might be firecrackers.
He said that was when he got shot in his right shoulder.
Khan said he felt burning pain in both his legs as he was shot just below the knees.
"The man with big boots kept on looking for students and pumping bullets into their bodies," he told AFP.
I saw the dead body of our office assistant on fire," he said.
"I told the children to get off their school benches and go under the benches.
"Some children got up and then they were shot, after which the attackers left the room," he said.
The exams and the lecture in the auditorium meant students were grouped in different parts of the school, he said.
"I am thankful to God for giving him a second life," he said.
"My son was my dream," Ali told The Associated Press.
She was throwing herself against an ambulance at the Lady Reading Hospital, AFP said, one of many inconsolable parents.
