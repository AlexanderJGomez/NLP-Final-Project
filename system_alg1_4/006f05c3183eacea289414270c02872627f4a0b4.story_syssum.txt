The sources said that as the pilot approached Tripoli International Airport, he took the plane off auto-pilot hoping to manually land the aircraft.
But the effort was too late and the plane slammed violently into the ground, explaining the condition of the wreckage and damage to the plane's tail at the crash site, the sources said.
The family, which will raise Ruben, said the boy knows that his parents and brother were killed.
"He has drunk a little, and has seen the flowers and cuddly toys."
More than two-thirds of the passengers killed in the plane crash were Dutch, the ministry said.
The Dutch foreign ministry said Friday it is sending more experts to Tripoli to help Libyan authorities and Dutch colleagues identify the victims.
