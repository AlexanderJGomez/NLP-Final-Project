What is less obvious is that the stakes are sky-high for Barack Obama, too: This debate could have a powerful impact upon his ability to govern in a second term.
But for Romney, the problem is that as the polls go up and down each week, there is one constant: As Real Clear Politics demonstrates in its averaging process, Obama stays ahead and has been for nearly a year.
Can Romney pull off a debate victory?
And all the while, he will have to fend off jabs from Obama, who can draw from a rich trove of Romney mistakes in the past.
But on closer examination, Obama ought to be pressing for a victory, too.
Looking beyond November, what really matters to Obama is whether he can effectively govern in a second term.
Republicans will have a much harder time challenging his mandate if he wins big.
Obama campaign advisers have been building a powerful ground game for months; they have far more offices in battleground states than Romney.
Members of his team may talk as if they have less at stake than their opponent, but in their hearts, they know that if Obama can put Romney away in their first debate, he could well have some lightning at his command in a second term.
