Try telling that to Refilwe Modiselle -- she's breaking all the rules while sashaying down the catwalk as Africa's first albino model.
This is a different representation of what African beauty is,'" Modiselle tells CNN.
In 1999, Modiselle was just 13 years old when she was first approached to do a five-page shoot for a youth magazine aiming to showcase how the African fashion landscape would change with the turn of the millennium.
I'm basically saying 'OK, let's teach our kids a different definition of beauty, or a definition that's always been there but has just always been disregarded."
But Modiselle doesn't just have to live with the unspoken threat of discrimination hanging in the air.
You are a girl who is born in a black society: the township.
Participation in the show allows Modiselle to reveal more of her personality to the country, and to show she's more than just a clothes horse.
(My) plan for the future is just to grow myself as a brand and as an entity: to touch the world in different places and to be able to be a huge representative for Africa."
