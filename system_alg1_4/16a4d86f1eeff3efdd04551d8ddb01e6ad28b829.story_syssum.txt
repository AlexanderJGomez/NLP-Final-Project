That's what those fighting with Kyle called him.
Of course, he wasn't the only sniper engaged in those epic battles of the Iraq War, but the legend of Kyle resonates with a wide American audience.
After completing four tours of duty in Iraq with at least 160 confirmed sniper kills, Kyle said he never had regrets about plying his deadly trade.
"It was my duty to shoot and I don't regret it," Kyle wrote in his book.
Kyle, they say, was one of tens of thousands of troops who served heroically in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"You remove Chris Kyle from the story, there's 20,000 other heroes that you can put in there," said CNN global affairs analyst James Reese, who runs Tiger Swan, a security consulting firm founded by ex-members of the U.S. Army's elite Delta Force.
But there is a side to Kyle that's overlooked.
Ventura said the incident never happened and sued Kyle for defamation.
It is just one story in a collection of outlandish tales that Kyle reportedly repeated often.
And then there's the story Kyle told of how he killed two men who tried to carjack him while he was stopped at a gas station along a rural highway southwest of Dallas.
He spoke with state and local law enforcement officials in three counties.
He was the most celebrated war hero of our time," Mooney said.
At Kyle's funeral, which, befitting the grandeur of his legend, was held in the Dallas Cowboys' massive football stadium, Taya Kyle did not shy away from her husband's darker side.
Despite his well-reported shortcomings, it's difficult to overlook his life after the Navy and how he touched and inspired so many people.
"War one day; peace the next," Kyle wrote in his book.
The sense of duty to protect fellow troops is a feeling that Kyle struggled to let go.
"We're trained to go out and kill people," Chris Kyle wrote in his autobiography.
Correction: Earlier versions of this report incorrectly described the military background of Chad Littlefield, who was killed with Chris Kyle.
