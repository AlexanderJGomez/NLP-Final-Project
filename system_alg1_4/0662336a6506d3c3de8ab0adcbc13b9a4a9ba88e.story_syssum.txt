Natalie Cole received a kidney transplant Tuesday in Los Angeles.
"Having heard of Ms. Cole's need for a kidney, the family asked that one of their loved one's kidneys be transplanted to Ms. Cole if they were a match," Mone said.
"I'm on a very long list, which is why we are looking to donors," said Cole, the daughter of legendary crooner Nat King Cole.
Cole said she underwent chemotherapy in an aggressive way to fight the virus.
Since then Cole has been on dialysis three days a week and has been searching for a kidney, she told King in one of the first public interviews about the issue.
It's -- it's amazing," Cole said.
During King's show, dozens of people sent e-mails to CNN telling Cole that they would get tested to see if their kidney could be donated.
That's all I can say," Cole said.
