Isa Saharkhiz and his son Mehdi haven't seen each other in nearly a decade.
"He told me that 'you are released now,'" Saharkhiz said.
Since 2009, the younger Saharkhiz has led a one-man digital campaign from his home in New Jersey aimed at liberating his father.
Iranian security forces first arrested Isa Saharkhiz, 59, during the summer of 2009.
Iranian authorities justified the 2009 crackdown by frequently accusing opposition leaders of being part of a foreign conspiracy aimed at overthrowing the government.
"In January, in the winter, they sent me on the roof of the jail for two hours when the weather was very cold," Saharkhiz said.
Experts say Iranian authorities reserved especially harsh treatment of well-known intellectuals such as Saharkhiz because he was a former regime insider, who had risen to prominence after the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
As the elder Saharkhiz languished in prison in 2009, his son Mehdi became an opposition activist from the relative safety of exile in New Jersey.
His father was stationed in New York for several years in the 1990s while working for IRNA, the official Iranian news agency.
Four years after his arrest, the elder Saharkhiz said there was no formal reason given for his release.
Last month, he called for a negotiated end to Tehran's long feud with Washington over its nuclear program.
It was the first direct contact between American and Iranian presidents in more than 30 years.
"There's a lot of hope from what Rouhani did in the U.S. and there's a lot of good response from the people," Mehdi said.
"Maybe in a few years I will be able to go back, but it's a really big risk," he said.
"I will support freedom in Iran, and maybe criticize the leadership in Iran," he said.
"It will be a very emotional time," Isa Saharkhiz said.
