He has a point -- gun policy is a back burner debate these days, largely because Democrats who had pushed for tighter gun laws concluded it's bad politics.
Democratic strategists said they believe Gore and other Democrats lost critical votes in rural America by pushing for stricter gun laws.
"Democrats finally figured out that this was an issue that they were getting walloped on in many Western, Southern states and many swing states," Manley said.
"For many Democrats, it's smart politics not to get into the gun control debate," he said.
But Senate Democrats wouldn't hold a vote, and Giffords' Republican colleagues in the House said at the time new laws were useless.
Why?
In the wake of the Colorado movie massacre, the NRA issued a statement steering clear of gun politics.
But the NRA is still active and not afraid to throw its weight around on topics that even tangentially involve gun policy.
That's why the president is trying to heed the lesson of Gore and not go there when it comes to gun control.
"You'll have us to blame for your defeat in November," he said, rallying the crowd.
