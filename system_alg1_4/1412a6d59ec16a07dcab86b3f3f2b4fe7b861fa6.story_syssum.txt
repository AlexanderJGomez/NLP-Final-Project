Allegations against the Japanese camera and medical equipment maker came to light after the October dismissal of former President Michael Woodford -- a rare foreign chief executive in corporate Japan -- after he questioned ex-board members about dubious transactions at the center of the case.
A special audit of Olympus in December, led by a former Japanese Supreme Court judge, detailed $1.7 billion of hidden losses from failed investments in the 1990s by the company.
The new management includes Yasuyuki Kimoto, a former director of Sumitomo Mitsui Bank, who becomes chairman, while Hiroyuki Sasa, an Olympus executive officer, is promoted to president.
Woodford also questioned Sasa's experience to lead Olympus out from under the shadow of the scandal.
Woodford is is suing Olympus for wrongful termination.
Meeting with the press yesterday in Tokyo, Woodford said he wanted to shine light on corporate governance in Japan.
Olympus shares lost nearly 80% of its market value in the weeks after Woodford went public with his allegations.
The Olympus saga started with a five-page expose in Japanese magazine FACTA -- a small circulation magazine that has only nine people on staff -- on July 20 that raised questions over advisory fees of $687 million paid in 2008 for the purchase of Gyrus, a UK medical instruments firm.
