(CNN) -- A California educator who authorities say is the person accused in a YouTube video of sexual abuse by a former student was charged Monday with 16 felony counts of child sex abuse, the Riverside County District Attorney's Office said.
He added, "Fortunately, our justice system requires more than a YouTube video to determine the facts of a case.
But John Hall, a spokesman for the district attorney's office, said there is no statute of limitations on the most serious charge -- aggravated sexual assault on a child under 14.
The video features the alleged victim on camera and what is said to be the teacher's voice on a phone conversation.
The first alleged victim said the abuse took place "off and on" for her between the ages of 12 and 18.
The alleged victim said she didn't want a physical relationship, but she said the teacher threatened her multiple times.
And I believed that," the alleged victim said.
