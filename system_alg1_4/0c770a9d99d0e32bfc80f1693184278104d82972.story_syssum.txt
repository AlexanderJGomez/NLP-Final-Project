Sony Pictures Television, the studio behind the original series, is said to be shopping a pitch for a spinoff series centered on David Faustino's girl-crazy Bud Bundy.
It also isn't known if any other characters from the original series would be part of the spinoff, or if any of the original cast members are attached.
"Married ... with Children" premiered in 1987 and went on to have 11 seasons, becoming the first prime-time series to air on Fox and one of the network's first breakout hits.
Katey Sagal has gone on to lead roles in TV hits such as "Futurama" and "8 Simple Rules," and currently stars in the FX drama "Sons Of Anarchy," which kicked off its seventh and final season earlier this month, to record ratings.
And last month, TV Guide reported that a "Full House" reboot is in the works with some of the original actors reprising their roles.
