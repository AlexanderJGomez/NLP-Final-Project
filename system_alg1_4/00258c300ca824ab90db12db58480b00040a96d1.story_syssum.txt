Hong Kong (CNN) -- Thousands of people filled Hong Kong's Victoria Park on Saturday to mark the 22nd anniversary of the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square.
Saturday's protest is an annual event organized by the Hong Kong Alliance, a pro-democracy group.
The April 15 memorial quickly turned into a pro-democracy movement, and students held talks with the government and later a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square to press their cause.
Along the way, they met fierce resistance from students and city residents who barricaded the streets, so they fired at them.
