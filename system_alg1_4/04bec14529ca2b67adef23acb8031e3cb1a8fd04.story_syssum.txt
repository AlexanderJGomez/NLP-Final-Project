(CNN) -- George Zimmerman should only be prosecuted if, after an exhaustive investigation and an honest assessment of Florida's "stand your ground" law, special prosecutor Angela Corey concludes that there is a strong possibility of proving his guilt at trial for the killing of Trayvon Martin.
That said, good prosecutors should vigorously pursue cases when justice demands, even and maybe especially, when there are legal impediments.
This means arguing at trial, and on appeal, that someone like Zimmerman can be brought to justice notwithstanding Florida's strong self defense law, or that the law should be construed less favorably to those who resort to deadly force.
Florida authorizes deadly force "if the danger could be avoided only" by using it, but does not require a threatened person to try first to flee.
Thus, a major challenge for the prosecution team in the Martin case may be the version of events that Zimmerman offers.
Even though the state has a lode of evidence, including vitally important 911 tapes that can offer a unique window into the motives of Zimmerman on that fateful night, it needs to be mindful of the narrative of fear that will be told by the defense counsel.
To convict Zimmerman, a jury would have to find that there is no reasonable view of the evidence that would justify his lethal actions.
