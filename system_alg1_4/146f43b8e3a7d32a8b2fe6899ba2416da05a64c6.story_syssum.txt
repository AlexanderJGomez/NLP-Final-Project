(CNN) -- U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia downplayed reports of personal and ideological rifts stemming from the recent landmark health care reform ruling, telling CNN in an exclusive interview "it offends me" to hear criticism of his colleagues over how they ruled.
Scalia would not specifically address the health care decision or other recent or current case issues, such as immigration enforcement, affirmative action or gay marriage.
But Scalia said it was wrong to question Roberts or other court members personally for their legal conclusions.
"We are not a political institution," Scalia said.
"If you don't like the death penalty, fine, change the law," he said.
"Get over it," he said about supporters of Al Gore, many of whom are still convinced the case was wrongly decided in favor of the Republican.
In his new book, Scalia argues interpreting laws and the Constitution properly requires a strict approach to look at the actual text of the law itself.
President Ronald Reagan named Scalia to the high court in 1986 after previous jobs as an appeals court judge, a government and private lawyer, and a law professor.
On two issues that left Scalia on the losing side -- health care and immigration enforcement -- he displayed the fierce rhetoric that has become his trademark.
Many legal scholars say Scalia ultimately failed to sway his colleagues on the really big constitutional issues, and court sources say he has grown somewhat frustrated over the years being on the losing side of many cases, or not being able to write more majority opinions.
They instilled a love of learning and the confidence to exercise his intellectual muscles.
He said he hoped he has moved his colleagues toward a more textured view of the law.
And he has no plans to step down anytime soon.
