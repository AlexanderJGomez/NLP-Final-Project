Outside one mosque -- mixing with other men desperate for a day's worth of casual manual labor -- are five men who months ago had one valuable skill NATO depended upon: they speak English.
"My family is still living in the provinces," one of the men tells me.
I am living in a market, in one of the empty shops."
One road, forever pot-holed in the past decade, is now being covered over by Afghans who, it seems, are finally reclaiming that street.
One shopkeeper says it could be the embassy security warnings that are keeping people away now.
Drive out east -- past the women in burqas who sit on road bumps, holding their children, hoping drivers will slow enough to throw them change -- and you see roads lined with the detritus of America's war here.
Further down the road too are more winners-turned-losers of the NATO presence here.
Now the bases are gone, and the trucks that once supplied millions sit still.
Along one stretch of road their endless, multiplying lights throb.
The question many surely ask here -- as the last American troops prepare to retreat inside the U.S. Embassy by the end of next year -- is how much longer the lights will continue to glow.
