But the world, Greek brothers Thomas and George Douzis realized, did not.
So, in 2007, the Douzis brothers developed a plan to take Greek produce to the global stage.
Take Greek olive oil's reputation around the world.
"The perception abroad is that Greek oil is the cheap one.
The brothers chose the brand Ergon -- the Greek word for project -- and set out to find the country's best produce.
The caliber was so high the area had been granted special status from the European Union.
As the Douzis brothers developed their business plans, the country's finances were beginning to unravel.
But by 2010, Ergon was an established brand, selling five lines of traditional products including spreads, canned fish, beans, mushrooms and wild truffles.
In London, Reload Greece is typical of this change.
Like many of his compatriots, his Greek bloodlines run strong and he set up Reload, in his words, to "let people do whatever they do, and find ways to connect them to Greece and help Greek communities."
"Greece used to be a country with lots of entertainment, tourist sector, big summers... now it is much more stressed environment," Douzis says.
Working for clients based around the world, Sifakis had a network of customers by the time he finished his service, and started working full-time.
"Truthfully, if I didn't have Greece, I wouldn't be in business," Sifakis says.
I have people there who have been working for me for many years."
Ergon, born as Greece's economy collapsed, now has a network of 150 producers who support seven stores and delis in Greece, one in London and another being prepped for Brussels.
"Greece was wealthy back then, so we had to convince them that these two young brothers from Thessaloniki can do that job, that we can help them sell their products," he says.
Now, thanks to Ergon and despite the country's devastating crisis, their products are being enjoyed at a trendy restaurant just off Oxford Street, the main shopping hub in the heart of London.
