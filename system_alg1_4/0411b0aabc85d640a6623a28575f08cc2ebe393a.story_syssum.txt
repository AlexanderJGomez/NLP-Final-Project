Stuck in a foot of snow on a road somewhere outside Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, the couple from Wisconsin pulled all the clothes out of their suitcases and wore them, trying to keep warm in their car with temperatures dipping below zero.
Their route took them on Beartooth Highway, but they said they didn't see any signs warning that the road was closed.
In fact, the highway was shut down in mid-September due to heavy snow, with signs posted saying so, the Park County Sheriff's Department said.
"I decided about 9 o'clock that it was too late to go out," Barnett told CNN.
Then he got on the snowmobile and minutes later, found the couple just about where he thought they'd be.
Inside the car, the couple heard something.
"We saw him coming up the road and I was just crying."
Barnett loaded Mark and Kristine on his snowmobile and drove back to his truck.
Barnett said it's not the first time he's helped someone in that area.
"It's really rural up here, we're just up in the mountains."
