(CNN) -- Chuck Klosterman's seventh book and second novel, "The Visible Man" (Scribner), is out Tuesday.
CNN spoke with Klosterman about the inspiration for the book, writing about and participating in the interview process, and how no one is going to relate to the two main characters in his new novel.
I was living in Germany at the time, teaching for the University of Leipzig, so I got it through Amazon Europe or whatever, and it was an edition of the book that was "The Time Machine" and "The Invisible Man."
He was just this kind of egocentric, weird person.
So those two things together sort of ended up becoming this book.
CNN: You like to talk about interviewing while being interviewed.
I can't imagine that, as I grow older, I'm going to reverse my thinking and start believing the interviewing process is more valuable than I think now.
Klosterman: What else would I do?
Maybe he charms you, maybe you see something in him, maybe you don't like him.
To me, if someone had never written a book before and was now attempting to write a book based on the fact that they had one metaphysical encounter, that would be their fear.
That's one of the weird things about this book.
I can't imagine someone reading this and going, "I really relate to this man or this woman."
I'm just thinking about it constantly.
I mean, it's kind of a cliche thing; it seems like something you worry about when you're 17, but I've never stopped worrying about it.
Klosterman: Both.
Like, "Am I really writing a book?"
and I know that I only have one sentence to tell them, I would say, "Well, it's how it would be to be the invisible man's therapist."
I think that, in general, when I write nonfiction, I want it to seem like hyperreality, for it to feel like you're reading fiction.
But when I write fiction, I want it to seem like journalism.
