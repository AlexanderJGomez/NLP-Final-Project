(CNN) -- In practical terms, it might seem that the recent arrests of key Taliban members and the success of the U.S. offensive in southern Afghanistan might indicate a new phase in the war against the Taliban.
Having interviewed Taliban fighters and leaders, including two who are close to Omar, it seems likely that the Taliban themselves do not know the answer to this question.
According to the Taliban members I interviewed over the past two years, Omar and his top followers retreated to Quetta, a Pakistani border city, after the initial American victory in Afghanistan at the end of 2001.
It was not until a Taliban deputy recounted a dream, in the spring of 2002, in which he saw Omar's "beard turn a blinding white -- for it was now made of the threads of the holy prophet's very cloak" that Omar decided to lead the fight again against the Americans inside Afghanistan.
"The prophet's cloak can be opened only when touched by a true leader of the faithful," another Taliban official told me.
"And we know," the Taliban official told me, "that whoever sees Allah in a dream surely has seen Him, since Satan cannot impersonate Him in a true dream."
Ultimately, it may simply be that unless Omar has another dream that tells him to sever his alliance with bin Laden, the Taliban will remain al Qaeda's steadfast ally and never surrender or negotiate.
