"It was almost two years since the Lara Logan incident," she said, referring to the harrowing sexual attack on the CBS correspondent by a mob in Tahrir Square.
In a recent mass demonstration on January 25, for example, 25 sexual assaults were reported on women in the square.
While the group consisted of men and women, Bahgat said it was generally men who intervened when an assault was detected, to prevent women bodyguards from being sexually assaulted themselves.
He became involved in the group after being haunted by the memory of witnessing men in the crowd assaulting a woman in the square in November.
At first I thought they were catching a thief or there was a fight," he told CNN.
The group has quickly learned what works in breaking up the assaults, he said.
Recounting a recent intervention by his group, he said the woman was too traumatized and disoriented by what was occurring to register the group's presence.
Sexual harassment is a longstanding problem in Egypt, said Bahgat.
But Bahgat said her focus was not speculating on the causes of the attacks, but stopping them.
Many Egyptians were worried the assaults were casting their country in a bad light, she said.
"But the ones behind these attacks are not the true Egyptians," she said.
