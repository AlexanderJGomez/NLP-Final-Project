"There are neither facts nor information that secret CIA detention centers existed in Lithuania," the ministry said in a statement, contradicting Amnesty International statements a day earlier based on a report by Lithuanian lawmakers.
In 2004, a former riding school outside the capital, Vilnius, was converted to hold up to eight detainees, according to the Lithuanian parliamentary report, Amnesty International said.
A CIA spokesman declined to confirm or deny the Lithuanian lawmakers' report.
Amnesty International said it was not important whether the allegation was new or not.
Other European states, like Poland and Romania, have also been accused by human rights groups -- and even the European Parliament and the Council of Europe -- of housing secret CIA prisons and colluding in extraordinary renditions.
But there are lingering doubts about aspects of the report by the Lithuanian parliamentary Committee on National Security and Defense.
"The Lithuanian government should have known what its own agencies were doing and is ultimately responsible for the secret prison and any human rights violations that may have taken place there," the advocacy group said.
