Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Sandiaga Uno is without doubt one of Indonesia's richest men.
But his dream of working overseas came to an abrupt end when the company he was working for collapsed, putting Uno out of a job.
"I knew when Asia came out of the crisis energy would be in high demand.
Indonesia is going through an enormous economic boom thanks partly to its valuable natural resources.
Despite all this success, Uno believes the country's wealth is not being evenly distributed.
Uno is extremely passionate about the future of Indonesia and while he will talk up the country as the next place to invest along side China and India, he's acutely aware and critical of its pitfalls.
But the speed and pace is not satisfactory, I think people want to see more," he said.
"The money is there, we just need the government to sort out the land acquisition problem among other things which will require changes in the law and then we can start building the infrastructure Indonesia so desperately needs," he said.
Uno says his wealth brings power -- he regularly has the ear of his president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono -- but insists it's not about money or the people you brush shoulders with.
"We are so rich in resources but we can't even produce.
I think in the next four to five years Indonesia must be able to generate that expertise."
