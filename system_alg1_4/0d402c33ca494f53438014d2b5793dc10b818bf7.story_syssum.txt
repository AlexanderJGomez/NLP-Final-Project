Australia beat Serbia 2-1 in Nelspruit but the effort was in vain as Ghana go through as the second qualifier on goal difference.
In the first half, Andre Ayew looked set to score as he burst into the Germany penalty area, but he took one touch too many, then Ozil was one-on-one with Richard Kingson, but was denied.
"I told him in the half-time break -- you've still got a goal in you," he told AFP.
But Serbian substitute Marko Pantelic pulled one back with six minutes left, had another ruled off for offside -- the second of the match for his unfortunatle team -- then shot over the bar with the goal at his mercy.
We have to go back home now."
Milos Krasic missed two great scoring chances in the first half and also had an effort ruled out of offside as Serbia dominated, but Australia improved after the break with Cahill outjumping Nemanja Vidic for their opener.
