TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (CNN)  -- The de facto president of Honduras denied Wednesday that his government turned off the power at the embassy where deposed President Jose Manual Zelaya surprisingly reappeared this week, and said that the people inside were free to come and go.
As of Wednesday, power was restored to the building, Micheletti said.
Zelaya's announced return has re-ignited a stand-off between the two disputed leaders of Honduras.
In another development, Micheletti said he is willing to meet anywhere with ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya as long as Zelaya agrees to abide by presidential elections scheduled for November 29.
On Tuesday, he had said in an interview with local network Televicentro that Zelaya's sudden appearance would not revive negotiations to have him return to power.
Micheletti said that other nations have not given his government a fair hearing of its position.
Despite increasing political, diplomatic and economic isolation, Micheletti has steadfastly resisted pressure to allow Zelaya to return to power and Micheletti thwarted two very public attempts by Zelaya to return to his homeland.
Many were there to denounce what they said were police abuse while breaking up the demonstration outside the Brazilian Embassy, the rights group said.
"The situation in Honduras can only be described as alarming," said Susan Lee, Americas director at Amnesty International.
