(Mental Floss) -- Major League Baseball's umpires are all over the news after a spate of, er, questionable calls throughout this postseason.
After some spotty officiating in the NFL last fall, we did some digging on the officials in the four major sports.
A National Football League ref can make anywhere from $25,000 to $70,000 a season, although since most of the games are on Sundays, they can also have other jobs during the week.
• Baseball.
Working a full postseason can tack on an extra $20,000, plus expenses.
• Basketball.
• Hockey.
Since NFL refs only work one day each week, they can have "real" jobs to supplement what they earn on any given Sunday.
• Mike Carey, my personal favorite ref, is an entrepreneur and inventor who holds eight patents for snow sports apparel.
• Tony Corrente is probably used to dealing with unruly crowds of guys from his day job as a high-school social studies teacher.
• Ron Winter's not just a ref, he's also an associate professor in Western Michigan University's phys.
• And when Ed Hochuli isn't officiating a game (or working out), you might find him in a courtroom.
Most of these guys have humble beginnings as officials.
Eventually, he became an NFL side judge in 1990 and received a promotion to NFL referee, the pinnacle of football officiating, in 1995.
In a recent op-ed in The New York Times, former baseball commissioner Fay Vincent cited the paltry salaries for minor-league umps: just $9500 for a five-month season for junior umpires, and only $20,000 a season for guys who have risen all the way to Triple A ball.
