And while the criminal case against Hosni Mubarak -- accused of involvement in the deaths of protesters calling for his ouster -- remains alive, news that a court has ordered him released pending retrial naturally has some asking whether Egypt's Arab Spring moment was all for naught.
"It may not play as big there as it does here," she said.
The court ordered Mubarak's release because he has been held past the maximum time he can be detained before being convicted.
Egypt's general prosecutor has said he will not appeal to keep Mubarak in custody, state media reported, clearing the way for him to be released.
Mubarak's impending release comes at a time of turmoil in Egypt, where an interim military government has been in charge since Mubarak's successor, Mohamed Morsy of the Muslim Brotherhood, was ousted as president last month.
Despite the release, there's no possibility of his return to power, Wright said.
"For many Egyptians, Mubarak's release will be met with a shrug.
As for the timing of the court's ruling, some Egyptians may see a conspiracy behind it in which the old regime seeks to reassert power following Morsy's ouster, Trager said.
The group called for a retrial of the former president, with new evidence before the court, and for Morsy to be put on trial as well.
