The sellers were beaten up by four other Muslim shop owners, police said.
The death toll from the violence has risen to 10, said Win Htein, a member of parliament for the area.
When police took two Muslim shop owners to court Thursday, a group of several hundred Buddhists tried to attack them and threw rocks, he said.
The U.S. ambassador to Myanmar, Derek Mitchell, said he was "deeply concerned" about the reports of violence in Meiktila this week.
Win Htein, the local lawmaker, said that about 30% of the township's 100,000 residents are Muslim.
