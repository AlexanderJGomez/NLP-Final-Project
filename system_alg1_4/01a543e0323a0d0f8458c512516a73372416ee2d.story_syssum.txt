For many Egyptians the flat, round bread is also becoming a symbol of the country's inequalities.
The Middle East's most populous country is not alone in these problems.
But for many Egyptians, these moves are too little too late.
The doubling of prices over the past year and an acute shortage of government subsidized bread has acted as a catalyst to the population's smoldering discontent.
As unsubsidized bread -- which can sell at 10 to 12 times the cost of government bread -- becomes unaffordable for a portion of the population the demand for government bread is growing.
People have no choice but to wait in line to buy government bread.
There are fears the unrest could emulate the 1997 bread riots in which 70 people were killed after the government raised the price of bread and other subsidized foods.
Egypt's Finance Minister, Youssef Boutros Ghali says this is what is causing all the problems: "The price rise is being driven by what is happening in the international markets.
For the 77 million to feel it we need at least five, six, seven years plus of growth," he said.
