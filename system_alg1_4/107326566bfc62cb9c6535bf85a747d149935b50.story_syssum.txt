The ousted President was convicted on charges of violence and inciting violence and sentenced to 20 years in prison for the torture of protesters outside the presidential palace in December 2012.
He stood trial with 14 co-defendants, including some of his presidential staff.
"Coup leaders have sentenced Mohamed Morsi to decades in prison for nothing more than championing the democratic will of the people."
This case is a manifestation of this," she said.
It's not about Morsy only, but it also applies to (former Egyptian President Hosni) Mubarak and others.
Nasrallah called for a "fair trial," criticizing the fact that seven men killed during the December 2012 clashes were not included in this case, because they were affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood, and that the involvement of other sides, including police, wasn't investigated.
At various points in the trial, Morsy said that he was still the President of Egypt and refused to recognize the court as legal.
"Before the case reached the court, it was dominated by politics more than the law, and I said this in my argument at the court.
Early in the trial, Morsy and his co-defendants were held in a metal cage in court.
He is also standing trial in three other cases, including two on charges of espionage.
In May, Morsy is scheduled to start a fifth trial -- this one on charges of insulting the judiciary.
