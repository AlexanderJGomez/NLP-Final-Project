Burning coal contributes half of the excess carbon dioxide (CO2) polluting the earth's atmosphere, a statistic not lost on the hundreds of climate change protesters camping in a grassy field near Kingsnorth power station in Kent, England this week.
The International Energy Agency estimates CCS could reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by more than 85 percent.
More research would have to be done on other alternatives including deep saline aquifers and deep coal seams.
That's actually very common worldwide."
The problem is that while the different processes needed to capture and store carbon dioxide have been around for years, no one has brought them together on a large enough scale to cope with the volume of emissions from a typical power plant.

Aside from government subsidies and investment by companies and private parties, an obvious way to fund the change is through cap and trading schemes.
"The problem is that the price of maybe €35 ($54) or €40 ($62) per ton of carbon dioxide will not be enough to fund the gap in the extra estimated cost of these new power plants," explains Professor Haszeldine.
The theory is that as CCS techniques become more efficient, the cost of capturing carbon will come down so that from around 2020 it will become cheaper for companies to store carbon than to emit it.
Environmentalists are wary.
Professor Haszeldine says the environmental cost of not doing it could be catastrophic.
"The risk of not doing it is that the world continues to put carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels whether it's coal or gas or oil.
