On Sunday, Europe inflicted an identical comeback on Davis Love III's Americans as Martin Kaymer held his nerve to hole the most dramatic of putts and ensure a 14 1/2 - 13 1/2 point victory for Jose Maria Olazabal's team.
"When I saw we had a chance this afternoon coming down the stretch, I was very emotional, I started thinking about the possibility of winning.
While the U.S. had dominated the first two days of the competition, they simply had no answer to a European team determined to honor Ballesteros' memory.
"Ollie said to us at the start of the week, Ryder Cup is what memories and dreams are made of, and he's been awesome," explained an emotional Poulter.
We were all square.
Scotland's Paul Lawrie, playing in the Ryder Cup for the first time since Brookline 13 years ago, claimed Europe's second point of the day, thrashing FedEx Cup playoff winner Brandt Snedeker 5&3.
Big-hitter Dustin Johnson got the first point of the day for the U.S. following a 3&2 win over the equally powerful Nicolas Colsaerts of Belgium.
1 Lee Westwood holed his putt on the 16th hole to secure a 3&2 win over Matt Kuchar and round off a difficult week on a high note.
That left Europe on 14 points and Italian Francesco Molinari secured the half point needed to win the cup outright after finishing level with 14-time major winner Tiger Woods.
"They played very, very well," said U.S. captain Love III.
We had a lot of guys who got beat today, I don't know if they played badly but they didn't win.
It's not good for us, but it's good for golf this Ryder Cup."
