"My heartfelt and deepest sympathies go out to the family and loved ones, and to all of those who were involved or injured in this terrible accident," Jenner said in a statement released Sunday by his publicist, Alan Nierob.
"That is a very regular occurrence, and (there is) no indication at this time it was a contributing factor of the crash," Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Lt. John Lecrivain said.
Jenner first catapulted to fame after winning the 1976 Olympic decathlon and now draws the celebrity spotlight for his role on the "Keeping Up With the Kardashians" reality show.
Jenner's Escalade was towing a trailer with an all-terrain vehicle on it when it ran into the Lexus from behind, Brooks said.
Jenner, 65, was not injured in the crash, publicist Alan Nierob said.
The wreck took place shortly after noon on Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, the Sheriff's Department said.
The Sheriff's Department said on its Facebook page that the surviving drivers were cooperating with investigators.
Mike Parker of the Sheriff's Department tweeted.
He quickly capitalized on his success with Wheaties commercials, appearances and other ventures.
said Jenner was not shooting for "Keeping Up with the Kardashians" on the day of the accident.
