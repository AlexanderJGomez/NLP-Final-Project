Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- As he stood before the delegates of the 1964 Republican Convention in San Francisco, California, Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater, the party's presidential nominee, said, "I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice.
Many of Goldwater's supporters were determined to push their party toward the right wing of the political spectrum.
They published pamphlets and books and threw their support behind local candidates.
Since Miller, a New York congressman, was known for his close ties to the right, Democrats could charge that Republicans had not balanced their ticket.
The ads played on statements by the candidates and extremist organizations.
Always nervous about being tagged by Republicans in a conservative era as too close to socialism, Democrats in Congress and in the White House since the 1960s have tended to distance themselves from fringe elements of the left.
Now Republicans are facing the danger of being associated with extremism once again.
In the short-term, the Tea Party movement has helped to revitalize the Republican Party.
This kind of rhetoric will not produce long-term gains for the Republican Party.
Local Tea Party organizers have also stepped forward with words of condemnation.
They must also avoid contradictory messages, such as the statement of House Minority Whip Eric Cantor, who accused Democrats of "fanning the flames" by using the incidents as a "political weapon."
Now Republicans are facing the Goldwater threat once again.
