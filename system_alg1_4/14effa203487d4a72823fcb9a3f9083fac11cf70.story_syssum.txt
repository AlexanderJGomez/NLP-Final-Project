Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said Wednesday that the 12 suspects in custody would be detained for an additional 24 hours.
The premises where the alleged explosives components were found are used by the same person at whose address a list of Jewish organizations was found by police Saturday, Molins said.
Given the nature of the discoveries made by police and the need to find all the members of the presumed terror cell, it was vital to extend the detention of the suspects by an additional 24 hours, Molins said.
"We are clearly and objectively facing a terrorist cell of an extreme dangerousness," Molins said.
French intelligence operatives had been monitoring him since spring -- well before the Sarcelles attack -- but he had not been questioned by authorities, Molins said.
"He appeared (to be) a delinquent converted to radical Islam," Molins said.
