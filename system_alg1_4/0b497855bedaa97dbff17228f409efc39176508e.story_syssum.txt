For someone who knows that even restoring some of the basic functions of government is going to be a challenge, the idea that a new president will be able to change the weather was a form of black humor.
The thing that might just make this possible is the prevailing mood of weariness among voters and the realization that the main beneficiaries of continued uncertainty would be Vladimir Putin and those working to break the country apart.
This is thought likely if second place goes to Serhiy Tihipko, the former Yanukovych ally expected to do well in the south and east.
It may take a painful split within the democratic bloc followed by a major realignment and new parliamentary elections in the autumn before Poroshenko gets the government he wants.
Another major challenge will be to find a way of reaching out to the east.
None of the efforts to promote greater national cohesion will get very far unless Poroshenko can find a way to turn around an economy projected to shrink by 5% this year.
That is why coming to some kind of understanding with Russia will be another urgent priority for president Poroshenko.
But they are likely to cover things like Russian access to Ukraine's military-industrial facilities, new gas transit arrangements, the status of Crimea and perhaps an agreement that Ukraine will remain non-aligned.
Perhaps the greatest challenge for the new president lies in meeting the expectations for change raised by the Maidan.
Whether he can go far enough to satisfy the Maidan movement, while securing the cooperation of Ukraine's power elite in meeting the other difficult challenges he has to face is the question that will probably define his presidency.
