MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- One of two men charged with killing the crew of the Joe Cool charter fishing boat last year has agreed to plead guilty to first-degree murder, a victim's relative said.
None of the victims' bodies has been found, and authorities have said it is unlikely they will be.
Zarabozo and Archer were found a few hours later, about 10 miles away on a life raft.
This spring, Zarabozo said in court documents that Archer killed the crew, using Zarabozo's gun.
"They said he was going to plead guilty," he said of Archer.
Jeff Branam said the government's case against the two appears strong but said he's glad a jury won't decide Archer's fate.
Archer befriended Zarabozo, 20, who left Cuba with his family.
He maintains his not guilty plea, and he plans to proceed to trial."
Jake and Kelly Branam are survived by their children: a girl who was 2 at the time of their deaths and a boy who was 4 months old.
