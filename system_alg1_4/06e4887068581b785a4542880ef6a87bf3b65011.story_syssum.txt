On Flag Day in 1923, a group of organizations headed by the American Legion outlined the National Flag Code as a set of advisory rules for displaying the flag.
You don't have to.
Section 6 of the flag code states, "The flag should be displayed on all days."
The flag code thought of that one, too.
The flag code is quite a bit more realistic about this situation.
While the code states, "The flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or merchandise," there's no rule saying that a flag that slips has to immediately be burned.
Section 7 of the flag code provides one major exception: the flag of the United Nations can be flown in the position of honor or prominence at the U.N. headquarters in New York.
As part of the United States Code, the flag code is technically federal law.
Basically, the flag code is a set of advisory rules for Americans who want to know the proper and respectful way to display their flag.
In 2006 the Freedom to Display the American Flag Act of 2005 officially became law.
How does one handle the sticky situation of a flag that physically can't be flown at half-staff?
Should we ever pick up a 51st state, Section 2 of the flag code stipulates that the state will get a new star on the flag.
