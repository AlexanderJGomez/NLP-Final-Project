As chief executive of Keroche Breweries, Tabitha Karanja has paved the way for many other female entrepreneurs in Kenya, a country where women are traditionally scarce in the boardrooms, and even rarer in million-dollar startups.
"People thought it was not possible to break the monopoly of the existing company that was there, because it has been there for 80 years," says Karanja, who launched her company's first beer product, called Summit, in 2008.
But instead of bowing out of the industry, Karanja came up with a new product.
And that is how we came up with ready-to-drink vodka.
"The support of the Kenyans has kept me going all this time because I think that without their support it would have been very hard for anybody to continue doing the business," adds Karanja.
Karanja, a mother of four, says that startups are common in Kenya, but few survive the harsh business environment.
"Even for a young girl all she thinks is to get married, get children take care of the husband," she says.
"I thought it would motivate the people, the Kenyans, and show them that even if you work very hard, struggle, meet all those challenges, at the end of it there'll be somebody who will recognize you."
