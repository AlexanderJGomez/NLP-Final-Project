This week, Jolie -- a special envoy for the U.N.'s refugee agency -- traveled to the world's second-largest refugee camp, where she spoke to Syrian refugees and documented their stories in a video for CNN.
Jordan's Za'atri refugee camp, which Jolie visited to mark Thursday's World Refugee Day, was built to house 20,000 refugees but now has more than 120,000.
"I tried to stay," said the mother, Mouna Ahmed.
Giving a voice to refugees is arguably the most difficult role Jolie accepted when she agreed to become the U.N.'s special envoy for refugees last year.
Some analysts have warned that Syria's quagmire will trigger the world's worst refugee crisis if it is not addressed.
One woman at the Za'atri camp told Jolie how her life was transformed when her neighbor in Syria showed up at her door, missing a foot.
Umm Mohammed wants to return to her home in Syria, but the safety of her family keeps her away.
There have been promises to help from the international community to end the conflict in Syria, but the reality is that nothing changes, she said.
They all say they want to support us, but nothing is being done.
