(CNN) -- The small plane had crashed in an extremely remote part of Alaska, miles from the tiny village of St. Mary's.
Had it not been for her going for help, more victims might have died, said Clifford Dalton, a paramedic for LifeMed Alaska.
"The fact that she could make it out to an identifiable landmark really helped to expedite the aid that the rest of the patients were able to receive," Dalton said.
Dalton said he and his partner, Paul Garnet, helped treat the patients at the site.
It left Bethel at 5:40 p.m. and went down about four miles from the St. Mary's airport.
Four of those injured were hospitalized in fair condition, officials said.
A spokeswoman for the the Alaska Native Medical Center said Melanie Coffee was in fair condition and wasn't giving interviews.
