The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday declined to hear an emergency application for a stay filed by a Florida deep-sea salvage company that wanted to maintain possession of a half billion dollars worth of gold and silver coins until a final decision is made about who owns them.
Melinda MacConnel, Odyssey's vice president and general counsel, expressed disappointment, but said she recognized that the court "rarely grants" such motions.
Goold said it was unlikely that the Supreme Court would review the case.
Spain filed suit in a federal court in Tampa, Florida, also claiming the treasure.
The appeals court is expected to send the case back to the court in Tampa, which would establish and supervise the procedures for sending the coins to Spain, Goold said last week.
He said the coins would be exhibited at Spanish museums, and perhaps elsewhere.
The treasure includes fabled "pieces of eight," some minted in 1803 in Lima, Peru, Spanish officials have said.
