MOGADISHU, Somalia (CNN) -- Fresh fighting between Ethiopian-backed government forces and Islamic insurgents in Somalia's capital city of Mogadishu reportedly killed at least 10 people Sunday, eyewitnesses said.
The market, a rebel stronghold, has been the site of numerous clashes since early last year.
The presence of Ethiopian troops trying to help defend a transitional government's hold on Mogadishu has united Islamic militant groups seeking to gain control of the city.
Since then, insurgent groups have been trying to destabilize the government.
He was the 10th reporter killed in the war-torn nation since last year.
Farah, 36, was gunned down on his way home from work in the southern city of Kismayu, according to the National Union of Somali Journalists.
