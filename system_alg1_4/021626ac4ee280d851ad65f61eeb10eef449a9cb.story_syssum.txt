Of 2,501 tests carried out on beef products across the industry by noon Friday, 2,472 found no horse meat content above 1%, the UK Food Standards Agency said.
Fifteen of the positive tests were for the lasagna products sold by frozen food giant Findus that first triggered the horse meat alert last week.
Investigations are ongoing, but authorities cannot rule out the possibility of arrests, it said.
Authorities across Europe have been scrambling to get a grip on the crisis over rogue horse meat in beef products.
LSG Sky Chefs said it has contacted all its meat suppliers in Europe and has asked for written confirmation that their products do not contain horse meat.
Whitbread said it was removing a meat lasagna and a beef burger from its menus and would work with the Food Standards Agency to implement a robust future testing regime.
"The analysis tells us that the lasagnas contained 60% or more horse meat," a spokeswoman said.
The other firm, Spanghero, should have known that the meat it labeled as beef was actually horse, French Consumer Affairs Minister Benoit Hamon said.
Spanghero was the first company to label the meat as beef, the minister said, adding that 750 tons of horse meat were involved over a period of at least six months.
"The company has never ordered horse meat and we never knowingly sold horse meat," the representative said.
UK and French authorities are working to trace the horse meat, the Food Standards Agency said.
