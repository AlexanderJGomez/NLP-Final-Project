(CNN) -- African-Americans deserve reparations.
Others, particularly in the Twittersphere, reacted viscerally to the headline and to reactions to the headline.
And it suggests that before America could ever actually do reparations, America would have to first be able to imagine the necessity of reparations.
But as Coates reminds us, white supremacy was not just about measures of outright racial subjugation; it was also baked into measures intended to create wealth and opportunity, like parts of the New Deal, which contained many devil's bargains with conservative Southern Democrats to exempt African-Americans.
But his article is in some ways mistitled.
Coates is not quite making a case for reparations.
To listen to the difference between Americanness and whiteness, and to notice the manifold ways that whiteness was (and is) an identity fabricated from the myth of blackness.
To be sure, every ethnic group that's not called white has experienced suffering in American life.
How to allocate reparations?
How to decide who decides?
And the point of a hearing on reparations -- and making it a civic experience as profound and prismatic as the Watergate hearing -- is not to get the American public to "how."
But if more of us in reaction to reparations simply say, "I do not know -- but I wish to understand," then we will be making true progress.
