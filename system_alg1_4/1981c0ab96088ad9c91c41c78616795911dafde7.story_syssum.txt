(CNN) -- Ray Harryhausen, the stop-motion animation and special-effects master whose work influenced such directors as Steven Spielberg, Peter Jackson and George Lucas, has died, according to the Facebook page of the Ray and Diana Harryhausen Foundation.
and "Clash of the Titans" (1981) was widely praised for its ability to blend stop-motion effects -- models filmed one frame at a time -- and live action.
As a teenager he built dioramas featuring prehistoric creatures and filmed them with a 16-millimeter camera, gently hitting the "run" button to move the film one frame at a time, according to his biography on rayharryhausen.com.
By the time he was in his early 20s he was friends with Forrest Ackerman and Ray Bradbury, two men who shared Harryhausen's fondness for storytelling and animation.
"Stop-motion is a medium that welcomes fantasy, hence the number of recent productions," Harryhausen told CNN in 2012.
But that will, I think, re-emerge.
