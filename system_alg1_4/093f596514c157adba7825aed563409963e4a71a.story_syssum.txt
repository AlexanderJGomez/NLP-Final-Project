(CNN) -- ISON, the most closely watched comet in recent years, may be falling apart as it nears its close encounter with the sun.
When ISON was first discovered, hopes were high that it might become visible to the naked eye, meaning everyone might be able see it, not just those with good telescopes who took the trouble to find it.
But other observers say images taken by NASA's STEREO spacecraft are "encouraging evidence that the comet still exists," Padma Yanamandra-Fisher with the ISON campaign told reporters on the campaign's Facebook page.
Whatever its final fate, she said, ISON has "provided a wonderful window into the world of comets.
Confusion about its fate isn't new for ISON watchers.
The glare of the sun has blocked most ground-based observations, but NASA has a fleet of spacecraft watching as ISON plunges toward the sun.
"I am excited at marking the progress of this comet that has captivated the world from its discovery and the possibility of it being a Great Comet," Yanamandra-Fisher told CNN.com.
"I am glad that I was able to be part of its journey."
