San Diego, California, will be the first stop on Sunday for poet Javier Sicilia and 70 other members of Mexico's Movement for Peace with Justice and Dignity on their trek through more than 20 cities in the United States.
"We want citizens to confront the blindness of politicians and their interests as much in the United States as in Mexico," says Sicilia, who became one of Mexico's most prominent activists after his son's slaying in March 2011.
For the mystical poet, who has become a key player criticizing Mexican President Felipe Calderon's strategy to fight organized crime, the caravan through the United States is the latest leg of a journey that began after his son's slaying.
After his son's death, Sicilia said he would no longer write poetry.
The movement he leads surged to national prominence after thousands joined a three-day protest march culminating in Mexico City's central square in May 2011.
They are human beings,' " Sicilia says.
They are seeds that are going to produce fruits at another moment," Sicilia says.
Members of the movement protesting violence in Mexico have also become victims.
After these cumulative experiences, Sicilia says he feels deceived.
The war does not exist," Sicilia says.
Now, after more than a year of protests, Sicilia says this caravan could be his last.
