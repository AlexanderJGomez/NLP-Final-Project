Today, unfortunately, many of our students are failing to learn American history, including our founding principles and values.
Among the survey's most frightening findings is our students' lack of knowledge in U.S. history.
Just 20% of fourth-graders, 17% of eighth-graders and 12% of 12th-graders were at grade-level proficiency in American history in the 2010 exams.
As the author of three children's books on American history, I've visited many classrooms across the country to share the adventures of Ellis the Elephant, my time-traveling pachyderm, with children ages 4 to 8.
In writing "Yankee Doodle Dandy" (published this week, in which Ellis the Elephant discovers the American Revolution), I was reminded that the brave men and women who fought to win our freedom were surprisingly young.
James Madison was 25.
With education surveys showing dismal results, we must find creative ways to teach our children American history.
Yet we are for the first time in our history beginning to lose sight of our founders' sacrifice and wisdom.
