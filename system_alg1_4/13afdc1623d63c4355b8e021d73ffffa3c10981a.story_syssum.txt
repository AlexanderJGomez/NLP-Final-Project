(CNN) -- The mother of a 25-year-old woman killed in a Boston hotel more than a week ago said Friday that she will remain haunted by her daughter's death for the rest of her life.
Police have said that Brisman, a model from New York, advertised as a masseuse on the online classifieds Web site Craigslist.
Prosecutors say Brisman sustained blunt head trauma, and said she was shot three times at close range.
I have not received any document or report or piece of evidence other than what I heard in the courtroom.
She was held at gunpoint and bound, prosecutors said.
McAllister said Markoff "is the wrong man" and "was set up."
In executing a search warrant at Markoff's home, police found a firearm, along with restraints and duct tape, he said.
He said the incident "may be related to similar crimes occurring in the Boston area" but that had not been determined.
