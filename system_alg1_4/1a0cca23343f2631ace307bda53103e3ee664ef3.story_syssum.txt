Kathleen Sebelius was sworn in Tuesday night as secretary of Health and Human Services.
The timely vote puts Sebelius in office as the Obama administration is up against its first public health outbreak.
There are still no appointees in place for any of the department's 18 key positions.
Sebelius met several obstacles during her confirmation hearings.
Sebelius, 60, is the daughter of former Ohio Gov.
A number of leading social conservatives have criticized Sebelius for her record on abortion, citing, among other things, her veto as governor of legislation that would have tightened abortion regulations in Kansas.
Former Senate GOP leader Bob Dole, also from Kansas, testified on Sebelius' behalf in March, arguing that her record had proven her ability to work in a bipartisan manner.
