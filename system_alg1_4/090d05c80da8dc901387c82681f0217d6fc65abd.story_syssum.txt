The Department of Energy's Blue Ribbon Commission has been given the task of finding an alternative to the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada, which President Obama has vowed to close.
It is highly likely that the 15-member commission will abandon the option to store nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain.
Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Washington, said the resolution calls on the Department of Energy to follow the will of Congress.
The Hanford facility is one of more than 100 nuclear sites across the country where about 70,000 tons of radioactive waste are stored.
If the blue-ribbon commission decides to abandon Yucca Mountain as a nuclear storage facility, there are concerns in southern Nevada over what will be done with the site.
The search for future uses of Yucca only came into question, according to Voegele and others, when the Department of Energy filed a petition to withdraw its Nuclear Regulatory Commission license application for Yucca Mountain earlier this month, effectively killing the project.
Those alternatives include national security activities and renewable energy research.
