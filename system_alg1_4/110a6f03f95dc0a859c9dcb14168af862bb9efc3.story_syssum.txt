Dr. Justin Schechter, a Stamford, Connecticut, forensic and clinical psychiatrist, said that Hayes exhibited signs of depression after his 2007 arrest, but told him, "I would rather they kill me" -- reflecting Hayes' apparent hope that he'd be executed for his role in in the deaths of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters, 17-year-old Hayley Petit and 11-year-old Michaela Petit.
Hayes believed that a doctor was "manipulating" his food and wouldn't eat it, said Schechter, though he did eat food from the prison commissary.
Prosecutors allege that Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky invaded the Petit home in Cheshire, beat Jennifer Hawke-Petit's husband bloody, strangled Hawke-Petit, set the house afire and tried to flee.
But in his opinion, he said, Hayes was "making decisions that were rational, given his situation" when he said he wanted to receive the death penalty.
"I don't know," the doctor said.
Prosecutors said Hayes took her to the bank while Komisarjevsky stayed behind.
Inside the home, authorities said, Hawke-Petit, 48, was found raped and strangled.
