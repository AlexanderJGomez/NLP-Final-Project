A truck driver sees a vehicle that the suspected kidnapper is driving and calls police, who find the kids inside, under blankets and pillows.
May 22: A car with a 1-year-old girl inside is stolen near a Georgia day care.
The man is arrested and the kid is safe.
And though these cases didn't get the same national attention as the search for San Diego teenager Hannah Anderson, they are among hundreds that demonstrate why the program is critical to saving children's lives, said Robert Hoever, a director of special operations for the center.
It could be that a case, once investigated, is determined to be falsely reported to police.
But it's also very important because it was just textbook how this program should be used," Hoever said.
The children's father, who gave television interviews in the hope of keeping his daughter's case in the spotlight, would later describe DiMaggio as a onetime family friend.
When authorities heard that DiMaggio might be heading into Nevada, the alerts were expanded to that state, Hoever said.
"The wireless program was also used in five states at one time," Hoever said.
But when they got home, they saw Hannah's Amber Alert on television.
Hannah was rescued.
Amber stands for "America's Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response," but its namesake was Amber Hagerman, a 9-year-old Texas girl who was last seen alive riding her bike in a parking lot in January 1996, according to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.
The first success of the program came after a November 1998 kidnapping, Hoever said.
The police tracked down the vehicle and rescued the baby.
