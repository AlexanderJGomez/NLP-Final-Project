One top climatologist recently tweeted: "If even a small fraction of Arctic sea floor carbon is released to the atmosphere, we're f'd."
The voice of global concern for action on climate change is back, and this time it's no longer an environmental issue, it's an everybody issue.
The world is rushing towards a series of potentially catastrophic feedback loops and tipping points in the climate system, which could see the support system of life itself irrecoverably disrupted.
One quarter of the carbon dioxide in our atmosphere came from our industries.
We need to shift our societies and economies off dirty energy and on to 100% clean, sustainable energy, within a generation.
Getting to 100% clean will require a massive battle against the oil and coal industry and their pocket politicians whose subsidies, profits and influence are all at stake.
Even China, the world's biggest carbon emitter, is rolling out renewables faster than anywhere else on Earth.
And that is why the People's Climate March is so critical.
Saving ourselves by shifting our societies to 100% clean energy will require one of the largest, most diverse, and most sustained movements we've ever seen.
Climate change has gone beyond environmentalism, it's now about the economy, jobs, justice, family, security.
If we learned one thing from the 2009 Copenhagen summit, it's that one global summit will never be a panacea.
But our civilization is the first truly global one, with the power to end human life.
