(CNN) -- In the hills of Burundi, farmers tend their coffee crop.
Chantal Ka-Hor-Rury, a coffee trader and head of a collective that helps farmers bring their crop to market, is committed to helping Burundi expand its coffee industry.
Today, Burundi's coffee producers are trying to transform the country's fortunes, with farmers harboring ambitions to process coffee domestically.
Mauricio Galindo, head of operations at the International Coffee Organization, said that Brazil and Colombia are the only coffee-growing countries that have successfully managed to export roasted coffee, but even then with great difficulty.
"Coffee comes from Africa so it should be able to produce the best coffee in terms of the characteristics of the bean," he said.
And Galindo believes more needs to be done to increase revenues for Africa's coffee producers.
