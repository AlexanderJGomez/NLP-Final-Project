Amy Stokes: They will talk about being very happy as children and growing up with two parents until they were grade school level.
They will move where they can be in a community that helps support them and then they'll lose the other parent.
That gogo is spending all of her time just trying to feed everybody, much less being able to help them prepare for their future.
However, they are the most hopeful children you will ever meet.
They are resilient, resourceful; they are joyful; they are very ambitious.
When they get connected with their mentors, the mentors make sure that no one is ever truly alone.
