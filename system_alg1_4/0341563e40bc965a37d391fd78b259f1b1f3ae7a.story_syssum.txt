"Termination of cease-fire is our response to terrorists, insurgents, marauders ... and (those who) deprive people of normal peaceful life," Poroshenko said.
He said the armed forces and the State Border Service of Ukraine regained control over the checkpoint and combat engineers removed mines from the checkpoint and adjacent roads.
On its website, the Donetsk regional state administration said Ukrainian forces attacked the central part of Kramatorsk from the air and ground.
The fragile cease-fire expired at midnight Monday, hours after Poroshenko spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande.
Poroshenko also talked on the phone with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry.
Putin, addressing Russian diplomats in Moscow, said he regretted the decision to end the cease-fire.
"Our relationship with the United States is not the best at the moment," he said.
Russia's ambassador to the European Union, Vladimir Chizhov, said Tuesday that the refusal to extend the cease-fire is a "negative sign," the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Twitter.
"We need only military actions," a priest named Valentyn said in a Reuters interview.
After Monday's phone call, Poroshenko said his goal was peace but insisted it takes the participation of all parties to maintain stability, noting violations of the cease-fire by pro-Russia separatists.
"There is definitely no need for an extension of the truce," he said.
A statement from Putin's press office about the call said the Russian President "stressed the need to extend the cease-fire and also establish a reliable mechanism for monitoring" it.
