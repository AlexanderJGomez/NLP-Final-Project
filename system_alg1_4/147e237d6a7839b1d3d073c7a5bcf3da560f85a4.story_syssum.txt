Havana, Cuba -- Alejandro Robaina, considered a legend among Cuban tobacco growers, died Saturday, according to Cuban cigar company Habanos S.A., which produced cigars named for him.
His deeply wrinkled face smiled out from billboards, T-shirts and boxes of Vegas Robaina cigars, among Cuba's finest.
Under Robaina, business flourished, and the plantation had some of the best yields in the region, producing highly-prized wrapper leaves used for the outer layer of cigars.
"I had a very strong conversation with Fidel 18 or 20 years ago," Robaina said in 2008.
Because in the big cooperatives, everyone's the boss, nobody worries as much as the grower."
Robaina said he'd been smoking cigars since he was 10 years old.
Robaina said in 2008 he hoped that policy would end during his lifetime.
Robaina will be buried Sunday, said Candia.
