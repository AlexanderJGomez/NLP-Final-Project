Massive flooding has caused more than $1.5 billion in property damage in the Nashville area, city officials said Friday.
The flooding damaged at least 1,952 residential properties, city officials said in a statement.
The same storm system killed six people in Mississippi and four in Kentucky, emergency management officials said.
The death toll could rise as rescue crews continue to search for several people who have been reported missing, including two kayakers in Kentucky and several people in Tennessee, officials said.
