With the brightest of spotlights on the NFL -- and its handling of domestic violence issues threatening to tarnish the shield that represents the most profitable and popular sports league in the country -- you'd think the nation's pro football players would be on their best behavior.
It was the latest public relations debacle for the NFL, as Dwyer brought the total number of players facing domestic violence or child abuse charges to six, after July incidents in which police say he broke his wife's nose with a head butt and punched her in the face.
One of the top players in the NFL, he left the Minnesota Vikings on Wednesday to deal with child abuse accusations in Texas.
Peterson then took a leave of absence and Goodell placed him on the exempt list, which gives the team the opportunity to continue to pay him while he deals with his legal issues.
Hardy played one game then was deactivated as the outrage against the NFL grew over how it was dealing with domestic violence issues.
Sgt.
Crump said neighbors reported two incidents in July.
The running back without a team is appealing his indefinite suspension by the league.
The players' union has complained that Rice didn't receive due process from Goodell, who suspended him in June to a two-game ban, then increased the penalty to an indefinite suspension.
On August 31, three days after Goodell created an NFL policy against domestic violence, San Francisco 49ers defensive tackle Ray McDonald was arrested on an accusation of felony domestic violence.
He pleaded not guilty, ESPN said, adding that the player was still practicing with the team.
