"Live every week like it's Shark Week."
"Jacques Cousteau changed the way ocean exploration was done," said Eric Stackpole, who along with partner David Lang is behind a submersible robotic watercraft -- sort of an underwater drone -- that could open a whole new world of undersea exploration.
"R-O-V stands for remotely operated vehicle" Stackpole said.
The OpenROV sells for $849.
This affordability is how Stackpole and Lang hope to bring OpenROV to the masses, turning average people into Cousteau-like undersea adventurers.
"When we first met almost three years ago ... within 10 minutes Eric told me a story about this underwater cave," Lang said.

Even though the project is growing, Stackpole and Lang are sticking with their do-it-yourself ethos.
"We have people from well over 50 countries in our community who can all contribute to how to make the design better and how to use it better," Stackpole said.
"OpenROV is an open-source community," Stackpole said.
We want to come up with new designs and revolutionize how underwater exploration is done rather than committing to one design," said Stackpole.
And our answer certainly is, 'both,' " Stackpole said.
