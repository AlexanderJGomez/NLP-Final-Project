It's a variant, aka an optional cover, which tends to grab the attention of collectors but won't be the main cover seen in most stores.
The cover recalls Barbara "Batgirl" Gordon's encounter with the Joker in the classic story "The Killing Joke."
DC Comics (owned by Time Warner, which also owns CNN) said in a statement late Monday that artist Rafael Albuquerque's cover was going to be pulled.
I respect these opinions and, despite whether the discussion is right or wrong, no opinion should be discredited.
For that reason, I have recommended to DC that the variant cover be pulled.
The cover was not seen or approved by anyone on Team Batgirl and was completely at odds with what we are doing with the comic.
1 variant cover caused an uproar for being "over-sexualized."
(The company later said there was no connection between the two events.)
