Jeffs, scheduled to go to trial this year on sexual assault and bigamy charges, is running the affairs of the church from his jail cell in Texas, the sources said.
Sources within the church tell CNN that the man who replaced Jeffs as business head of the church, Wendell Nielsen, has been removed and that Jeffs has signed documents retaking control of FLDS.
Critics of the FLDS say underage girls are forced into "spiritual" plural marriages with older men and are sexually abused.
While some of the men at the ranch were charged with sexual abuse, most of the children were later returned to their families.
He was arraigned on the Texas charges in December in Tom Green County.
