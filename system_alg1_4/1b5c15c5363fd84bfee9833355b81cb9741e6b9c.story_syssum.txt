Hannah was born with the neuromuscular disease arthrogryposis, which makes her joints curve and muscles extremely weak.
Jennifer explains: "When we saw my pediatrician ... for one of her first visits, she said even if her legs don't work well enough for her to walk, the biggest thing that we need to work on is making sure that her hands and arms are working to the fullest extent, because if she has use of her hands and arms, she will be able to care for herself.
She began using a device the hospital designed, called the "WREX" -- robotic arms made from 3-D printing.
"Most of the kids that we deal with have neuromuscular issues that affect their ability to raise their arms.
"We can print a full set of plastic parts for one pair of WREXs for one patient overnight, and by the end of the next work day we can clean the parts and have the WREX fully assembled," says Sample, adding that metal components must also be made by traditional methods prior to assembly.
The dupont Hospital for Children says it sees a little more than 30 new cases each year.
We don't know quite how might it be controlled, but we see that that is the future of the WREX."
"Her elbows are typically stuck at her sides and that's where she's been limited to raising her arms and reaching for things.
"My hope is that she grows up to be as independent as she can," says Jennifer.
As sassy as she is and as much as she likes to be in charge, she might run for president someday -- who knows?
