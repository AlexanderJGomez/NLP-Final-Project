Less than one year out of high school, Akira Ioane made an impressive debut at the HSBC Wellington Sevens last month as his native New Zealand romped to tournament victory.
"Jonah has done great things for New Zealand and the All Blacks sevens and I don't really like being compared to him," Ione told CNN's Rugby Sevens Worldwide show.
He was turning out as a back-row forward for New Zealand's school select XV as recently as last year before proving his worth for the Auckland side at the New Zealand National Sevens and World Club Sevens.
'Tietj' has made me work hard," Ioane said.
Ioane's strong debut showing in Wellington was followed up with another solid performance at the Tokyo Sevens this past weekend (where New Zealand finished fourth behind England, South Africa and tournament winners Fiji) and he has been selected for this weekend's prestigious Hong Kong Sevens.
Ioane's father also played internationally for Western Samoa at the 1991 Rugby World Cup, reaching the semifinal stage after a famous victory over Wales.
"They're proud but they also want me to have an education outside of rugby, balancing sport and study and just making sure that I don't fall behind in classes and things like that," said Ioane.
"I've enjoyed it, even though it's hard and I've struggled sometimes, it's what you have to do to be a professional rugby player," he said.
