O'Bannon argued athletes in the top tier of college basketball and football should be allowed to profit from their schools' use of their likenesses.
"Before the court in this case is only whether the NCAA violates antitrust law by agreeing with its member schools to restrain their ability to compensate Division I men's basketball and FBS football players any more than the current association rules allow," Wilken wrote.
NCAA chief legal officer Donald Remy said: "We disagree with the court's decision that NCAA rules violate antitrust laws.
Ramogi Huma, president of the National College Players Association, said the ruling was "a big win" that signaled "the time for college athletes to get their due," though he was critical of the $5,000 compensation cap.
"The ruling says the NCAA was operating illegally and college athletes do have rights," said Huma, who helped find players to join the case.
Vacarro called the decision his most important career accomplishment.
The judge wrote that the injunction will not affect student-athletes who enroll in college before July 1, 2016.
Legal appeals could delay a final outcome for years but the decision is in a position to be the first major NCAA reform effort to take hold.
The NCAA's argument in both the ongoing O'Bannon suit and another one filed by former quarterback Sam Keller, also in federal court in Oakland, is that it is trying to protect the amateur model of college sports.
