(CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of marriage equality this week.
In 2013, the vast majority of Americans have moved beyond prejudice toward gays and lesbians.
What many public figures have known to be true about gay people in their personal lives has been -- until recently -- unacceptable to acknowledge openly in the political realm.
Four out of five young voters, of all faiths and political parties, support marriage equality, and even those who continue to oppose marriage rights for same-sex couples can see that it is inevitable.
The court found DOMA to be unconstitutional -- and it also allowed marriage rights for same-sex couples to return to California.
Importantly, the court also strengthened the foundation upon which advocates and officials will one day achieve marriage equality nationwide.
