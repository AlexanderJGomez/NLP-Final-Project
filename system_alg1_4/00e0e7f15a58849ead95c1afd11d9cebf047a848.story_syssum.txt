Lately it seems we've been inundated with bad news: The nation's report card is crummy; schools are broke and failing; graduates can't find jobs.
Pressure to know the right answer (or, more precisely, to appear to know) isn't limited to the classroom.
Hopeful because it means there's something every one of us can do about it.
For most of us, the fear of not knowing -- of looking dumb -- gets ingrained when we're small and reinforced throughout life in ways both subtle and overt.
How many times have I found myself nodding in feigned recognition when someone makes reference to a person or book they assume I know?
Politicians routinely face shame if they confess to not knowing.
Guess what?
For starters, talk about it.
My friend Lori, during her years as a high school history teacher, constantly encouraged her students to play in the wide-open spaces of uncertainty.
One way she did this was by sharing her own gaps in knowledge.
She'd have them read one of the plays, then ask: "Who's more powerful in this scene?"
If her students protested, she'd say simply, "That's all I know."
Perhaps filling in the ovals with number two pencils is important for helping us understand how far we are from achieving equity in schools across the nation.
But we won't ever achieve equity -- let alone excellence -- if we don't also work to make our schools places where we all feel safe saying "I don't know."
