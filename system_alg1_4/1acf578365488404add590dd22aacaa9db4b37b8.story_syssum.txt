(CNN) -- Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, who is overseeing the federal response to the BP oil spill, said Sunday that he is "satisfied" with the amount of dispersants that have been used to clean up the disaster, saying crews have used them only when needed.
"BP carpet bombed the ocean with these chemicals, and the Coast Guard allowed them to do it," Markey said in a statement Saturday.
"I'm satisfied that we only use them [dispersants] when they're needed," he said.
Dispersants are "a toxic stew of chemicals, oil and gas, with impacts that are not well understood," Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said in the letter to Allen.
Doug Suttles, BP's chief operating officer, said Sunday that the oil company is funding research into the long-term effects of the spill, including the use of dispersants.
BP's use of disperants peaked at 70,000 gallons on May 24, the EPA said.
"While EPA may not have concurred with every individual waiver granted by the federal on-scene coordinator, the agency believes dispersant use has been an essential tool in mitigating this spill's impact, preventing millions of gallons of oil from doing even more damage to sensitive marshes, wetlands and beaches and the economy of the Gulf coast," Gilfillan said.
On other occasions, BP used more than the amount approved by the Coast Guard, Markey said in his letter.
Suttles said that the more likely start for the static kill will be Tuesday.
That will be followed by a final "bottom kill" after a relief well intercepts the crippled well -- a step that Allen estimated Sunday to begin a minimum of five to seven days after the static kill is complete.
