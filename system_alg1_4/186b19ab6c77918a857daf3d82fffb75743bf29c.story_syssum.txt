Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN)  -- High in the hills above the Haitian capital, artist Levoy Exil paints at his terrace studio.
It's now apparent that among the earthquake's widespread destruction were museums, galleries and other places that contained Haiti's artistic treasures, including Exil's work.
"There is no art museum run by the government of Haiti," said Georges Nader Jr., who runs a gallery near the Nader museum opened by his father.
What will happen now?
The significance of art in Haiti may be hard for outsiders to understand.
They're recording their history," said Camille Scully, executive director of Iowa's Waterloo Center for the Arts and co-president of the Haitian Art Society.
Haiti has a long enough history of not conserving its art, Alexis said from his Quebec City, Quebec, home.
Haiti's art "will tell future generations who they are and where they come from," Alexis said.
In Port-au-Prince, Nader has been frantically trying to rescue the thousands of pieces his father lovingly collected over four decades.
Some of the artworks housed in the Centre d'Arts, which was in a wooden structure, will be more repairable, he said.
"This?
The cultural loss can hardly compare.
"This is like a hospital for paintings," he said, watching his staff strip off frames and backings.
So far, Nader has rescued about 1,000 pieces; 70 percent need restoration.
And, perhaps it will fuel a new wave of art that reveals the resilience of people here.
Now, he said, he will paint people screaming, piles of bodies and tents blanketing the city's open spaces.
High above the misery, Exil, too, said he will paint again.
He will rely on the lush, undulating landscape before him.
For the future of Haiti.
