It has provided an ideal case study for disaster relief, and an Oxfam report, published today, examines the lessons that have been learned, as well as areas that the humanitarian relief sector still needs to improve upon.
Oxfam says the response to the humanitarian catastrophe was the "largest-ever privately funded response," with private donations making up 40% of all money raised -- an impressive $5.4 billion, which came close to matching government donations of $6.4 billion.
Oxfam itself raised $294m for the tsunami relief effort, with over 90% of its funds coming from private donors.
The scale and effectiveness of the relief operation meant many of the countries were able to return to some semblance of normality a few short months after the disaster had such a widespread impact.
Pooled funds, Cocking says, allow agencies like Oxfam to use donations for humanitarian crises which are equally important, but perhaps not as high impact.
"Having donations spread out enables impartiality -- people in South Sudan have as much right to aid as a person in the tsunami.
In the 1990s [humanitarian crisis survivors] depended on organizations like Oxfam to get the word out, but not so much any more.
The charity says that, in the aftermath of the tsunami, it learned a great deal about inequalities exacerbated by the onset of natural disasters.
Having experienced the full brunt of a disaster of this magnitude, the affected countries have been urged to "build back better," enhancing their own preparedness to lessen the impact of future events.
