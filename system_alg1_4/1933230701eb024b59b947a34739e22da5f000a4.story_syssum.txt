(Budget Travel) -- Last October, more than 40 people followed signs depicting a skull and crossbones, with a knife and fork in place of the bones, to a secluded Bavarian-style hunting lodge 30 minutes north of St. Louis.
Getting a reservation requires a little detective work, but once in, you may never go back to eating out the old-school way again.

Jimihatt now has a little friendly competition from an Atlanta cook named Lady Rogue.
To keep operations simple, its mastermind, Chef Todd, hosts the six-course dinners in his own apartment, hence the name.
And unlike most supper clubs, 12B cooks only for groups of friends (up to 12 at a time).
But as Chef Todd will attest, these clubs are less about saving and more about spending a night eating exceptionally well in the unlikeliest of places, whether a cozy lodge straight out of a fairy tale or a humble living room.
Please be sure to confirm all rates and details directly with the companies in question before planning your trip.
