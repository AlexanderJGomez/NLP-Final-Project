One of his first acts was to pull the troops out of Mesopotamia, modern-day Iraq, a fact that is sure to resonate with visitors to the British Museum"s superb exhibition "Hadrian: Empire and Conflict" which opens on 24 July under the imposing classical dome of the Reading Room.
One of the greatest of Rome's emperors, he consolidated imperial power, was a patron of architecture and travelled extensively across his lands.
"A year ago, this was still lying buried in the ground," says Opper.
"It"s proof that Roman history isn't done and dusted; that we are still able to rethink the past and evaluate it."
Many of the most delicate objects are also those that give the most dramatic insight into Hadrian's reign.
Some of the insurgents took refuge in a cave in the desert, called the cave of letters, in which they were trapped by Roman troops.
And there are still many refugees now who still have keys to the homes they once lived in.
"The wall was a ruthlessly efficient symbol of oppression and in the end it broke the back of the local tribes," says Opper.
In one an officer, presumably writing to a colleague who is taking over his post, derides the locals as the "little British," not worthy of worrying about very much - brief, battered and faded the letter may be, but as an example of high-handed imperialism it is hard to beat.
