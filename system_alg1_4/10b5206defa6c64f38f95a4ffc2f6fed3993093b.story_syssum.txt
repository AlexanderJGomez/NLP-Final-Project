The word was Ruzzle.
So, just to be sure, I Googled this strange new word and discovered that Ruzzle was actually a popular game app for your mobile device.
I don't generally care on Sundays.
After downloading the app and opening a game account (for which I was denied the user name "RealGilbertGottfried") I soon learned that Ruzzle consists of three two-minute rounds in which you and your opponent each get 16 letters placed in four rows of four that can be linked together to create words by gliding your finger over the screen at any connecting angle.
Like Boggle.
Obviously, it's a game of high stakes.
What's that?
OK, so the player with the most points actually just wins.
The ensuing e-mail conversation went like this:
Constantly getting beat by your mom.
The maker of the game, Stockholm-based MAG Interactive, boasts that it now has more than 9 million players in over 100 countries.
Then you'll stop loosing [sic] in Ruzzle."
For him.
That last one might not actually be a game.
Plus, I just keep "loosing" to my mom.
