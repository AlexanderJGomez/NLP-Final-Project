AT&T announced a March 6 release deadline for the Atrix 4G, a Motorola Mobility "transformer" phone that grabbed the spotlight at the Consumer Electronics Show last month.
At $200 with a two-year contract, the Atrix will be among the first to run on AT&T's faster data network and carry the "4G" branding.
On the same day, AT&T will begin selling another so-called 4G phone.
The new device will be the inaugural smartphone to offer AT&T's Mobile Hotspot service.
Since releasing that version, Google launched another called Gingerbread, which powers a Samsung-made phone called the Nexus S. Google held a news conference on Wednesday to say developers are close to releasing the first device that will run the next Android, called Honeycomb, this month.
