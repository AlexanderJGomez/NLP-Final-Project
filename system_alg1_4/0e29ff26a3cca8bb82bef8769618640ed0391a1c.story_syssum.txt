(CNN) -- The reaction to the death of 23-year-old baseball player Christopher Lane has been swift and far-reaching, stretching from America's heartland to his home in Australia.
"Chris exemplified what a student-athlete is all about," said East Central University President John R. Hargrave in a statement Wednesday.
That range of emotion is palpable on a website created to raise money for Christopher's family to fly to the United States and take his body back to Australia.
"I pray for your family, and Christopher, in the hopes that you may find peace after this tragedy.
An Australian, Moylan tweeted: "Tonight I continued my dream of playing pro baseball, a dream that was stolen from Chris Lane by 3 cowards."
"The first thing that you would notice about Chris was his strong Australian accent, which would just draw people toward him, especially in Oklahoma where most people have never heard it other than in the movies," he said in a statement.
You wanted to talk to him because he was the kind of guy who you could tell anything, one of those people you just loved to be around.
Chris was a charming guy, a genuinely good person, with great character and had a love for life," he said.
