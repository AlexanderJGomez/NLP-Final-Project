Many of you met her at Dodge City so you understand what a special person she is," Arness wrote.
I was at Anzio during WWII and it makes you realize how very precious life is," Arness wrote.
Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on May 26, 1923, Arness later served in the Army and was sent in 1944 to Anzio, the Italian beach that the Army said was the setting for the largest and most violent armed conflict in the history of mankind.
Arness also acted in the 1951 sci-fi classic "The Thing," and his 6-foot-7 height made the creature more believable, according to his website.
In addition to his wife, Arness is survived by two sons and six grandchildren.
