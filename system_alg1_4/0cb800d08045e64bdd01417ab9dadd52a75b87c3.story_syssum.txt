Astronomers used a Very Large Telescope -- the instrument's official name -- to detect the most massive star discovered to date.
R136a1, found in the RMC 136a cluster, is 10 million times brighter than the sun and is the heaviest star ever found, Crowther said Wednesday, with a mass that is roughly 265 times more than the sun.
Its home is more than 165,000 light years away from Earth's Milky Way galaxy.
As such, said Crowther, it is not visible to the naked eye, nor with a rooftop telescope.
At over a million years old, the star is already middle-aged, Crowther said, and could easily be a poster child for WeightWatchers, having shed a fifth of its initial mass over time because of powerful winds.
Billy, in turn, wanted dad to name the monster star after him.
That might have sounded a whole lot better than R136a1, but nonetheless, a star is born.
