Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- The death toll from heavy floods and mudslides in Mexico increased Tuesday to 41, a government agency announced.
Leonel Godoy said Tuesday.
More than 3,500 Michoacan residents are homeless, the state government said on its Web site.
On Sunday, Mexican President Felipe Calderon toured Valle de Chalco, another city in Mexico state on the eastern outskirts of the Mexico City metro area.
Officials also built two dikes to contain the sewage but were unable to use them out of concern that they would burst under the intense pressure from the floodwaters, Luege said.
Mexico state is bordered on the west by Michoacan and adjoins Mexico City on three sides -- north, east and west.
