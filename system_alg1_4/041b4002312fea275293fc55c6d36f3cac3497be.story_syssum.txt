Just before Prime Minister Gordon Brown presented him with the award, Glass squirted superglue in the palm of his left hand.
"I've just superglued myself to your arm," Glass said he told Brown.
Glass is affiliated with the group Plane Stupid, which campaigns against airport expansion and climate change.
The prime minister managed to free himself in about 30 seconds, Glass said.
Glass said he was allowed to remain at the prime minister's residence for about 40 minutes after the event.
The group -- which describes itself as non-partisan --is funded primarily by donations from individuals and organizations.
