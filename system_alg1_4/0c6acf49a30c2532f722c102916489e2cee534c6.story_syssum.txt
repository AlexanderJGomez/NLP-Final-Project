(CNN) -- Coast Guard aircraft have found no sign of a spill from a Royal Dutch Shell oil drilling barge that ran aground off a southern Alaska island during a fierce winter storm, authorities reported Tuesday.
The rig -- a key part in Shell's controversial Arctic oil exploration project -- ran aground off uninhabited Sitkalidak Island, about 200 miles south of Anchorage, on Monday night.
Monday night, tug crews had to cut the rig loose during a storm that whipped up 24-foot waves, leading to its grounding.
The rig was aground in an area of Ocean Bay, where water depth is 32 feet to 48 feet.
As of Tuesday, "we have no indications of environmental or wildlife impact," Russell said.
Our people rely on our food," she said.
And the shrinking of the region's sea ice -- which hit record lows in 2012 -- has created new opportunities for energy exploration in the region.
