Police also arrested a third man wanted by authorities for belonging to the same clan, but not directly linked to the killings.
The arrests were part of a large police operation aimed at cracking down on organized crime in the Campania region and in particular the powerful Casalesi clan belonging to the Neapolitan mafia known as Camorra.
Two weeks ago, the Italian interior minister announced the deployment of 400 additional police officers in the area.
Authorities also arrested dozens of other people, including the wife of Francesco Schiavone, aka "Sandokan," the head of the Casalesi clan who was arrested a decade ago and is serving a life-time prison sentence.
As part of the same operation, Italian financial police confiscated 43 companies and 134 apartments spread throughout central and southern Italy belonging to the Casalesi clan, worth more than 100 million euros ($144 million).
