Washington (CNN) -- The fire that crippled the Carnival cruise ship Triumph started with a leak in a fuel-oil return line running from one of the ship's engines, the U.S. Coast Guard said Monday.
The Coast Guard said it has conducted 21 interviews with passengers and crew members since Thursday, when investigators boarded the ship while it was still at sea.
Gulliksen also said the cruise line agreed with the Coast Guard's determination of the origin of the fire.
Stranded on the crippled ship, passengers and crew lived with worsening conditions, as toilets stopped working, and waste spilled onto floors and into hallways.
Patrick Cuty, a senior marine investigator for the Coast Guard, told CNN Sunday that investigators had located the area where flames erupted in the engine room.
Three other generators are in a second engine room that wasn't involved in the fire, Cuty said.
Passengers have praised the crew for its response during the ordeal.
It appears that the fire suppression worked as designed, Cuty said Friday.
