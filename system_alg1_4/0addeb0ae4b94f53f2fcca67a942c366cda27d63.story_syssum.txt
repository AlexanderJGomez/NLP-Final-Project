NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- A stampede at a hilltop temple in western India killed more than 147 people and wounded 55 others who had gathered to celebrate the start of a religious holiday on Tuesday, police said.
Bains rejected as "baseless" reports that it was triggered by rumors of a bomb.
For nine nights and 10 days, Hindus worship the various forms of a Hindu goddess.
Temple stampedes are not uncommon in India during religious festivals.
That stampede, which occurred on the second day of a nine-day religious festival at the Naina Devi Temple in Himachal Pradesh state, apparently was triggered by a false rumor of a landslide on the hill above the crowd.
