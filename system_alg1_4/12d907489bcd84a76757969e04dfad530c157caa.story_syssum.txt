This was readily apparent when CNN solicited handwriting samples from iReporters as part of the cultural census.
In the opinion of Arnie Sanders, associate professor of English at Goucher College in Baltimore, the history of handwriting is a perfect encapsulation of how the collision between the secular and the sacred has informed our literary traditions.
"It's impossible to say how many different styles of handwriting there were," he said.
"The leaders of the scriptorium were looking for people who cared enough about books and writing to dedicate their entire lives to the process," he said.
"The real purpose of writing was to propagate the word of God, and to regulate the worship of God," Sanders said.
"That's what kept handwriting alive, and why it was taught as a vocation."
"That was the scriptorium of the modern era.
"In the early era, while scribes were still working to produce books, before the printing press, you just hired a scribe if you were rich," he continued.
Only specialists could decode the then-standard Gothic script style, because only specialists needed to do so.
Their ultimate goal was the "wider distribution of their manuscript works about the pagan classics as well as to challenge Medieval religious orthodoxy," Sanders said.
"After that last burst of clarity, once literacy spreads beyond professional scribes to ordinary readers like you and me, manuscript writing becomes distorted and stretched out by the very difficult-to-read early modern cursive script of the 15th to 17th century," he said.
"People's interest in this debate about cursive handwriting, typing, texting and other incarnations of the language -- this is proof that these things still have the power to move us.
