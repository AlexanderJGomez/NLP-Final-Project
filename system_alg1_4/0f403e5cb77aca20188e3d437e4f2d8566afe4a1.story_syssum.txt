They are both necessary for the construction of The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), intended as the successor to the Hubble instrument that has been operating in space for 25 years.
NASA spokesperson Lynn Chandler told CNN that the mission was like opening up the curtains on the universe and peering inside.
Hubble is about the size of a school bus but JWST is as big as a tennis court.
NASA says that to see these objects the telescope will have to detect objects which are 10 to 100 times fainter than Hubble can currently see.
Scientists hope the telescope will be able to tell us more about objects that formed 13 billion years ago -- about 700-800 million years after the Big Bang.
NASA says JWST should be able to operate for between five and 10 years, restricted only by the amount of fuel it has to maintain orbit and the ability of the electronics to stand up to the harsh space environment.
