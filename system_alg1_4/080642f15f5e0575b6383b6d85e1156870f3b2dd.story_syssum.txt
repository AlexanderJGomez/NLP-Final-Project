Now, eight months later, her family is mourning again because they can't keep two SpongeBob Squarepants memorials at her gravesite.
"The funeral home actually bought the pillow of SpongeBob and we asked if they could put it in her casket," Deborah Walker said.
Before the family ordered the SpongeBob memorials, it got the go-ahead from a cemetery representative, Deborah Walker said.
"The family chose a design with the guidance of a Spring Grove employee who unfortunately made an error in judgment," the cemetery's president told CNN.
"It was just heartbreaking," Deborah Walker said.
Spring Grove said it is working with the Walkers to design a solution at the cemetery's expense "that will properly memorialize Kimberly."
