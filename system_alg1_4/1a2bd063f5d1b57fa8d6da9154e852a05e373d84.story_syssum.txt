(CNN) -- The Seattle artist Moxie makes sculptures out of felted wool that are, like her, desperately playful and mad.
Their work is featured in magazines like "Make" and "Craft" and the documentary "Handmade Nation."
Even before her creative career took off, Moxie simplified her life and identity by changing her name to her nickname.
"Each poke, you are deciding what the piece will be and mean," she said.
Moxie: Talk about a clash of wealth and status.
I did an embroidery piece from the perspective of being behind a crowded street with a lot of people.
You never stop missing your parents.
I don't think it's to say yes to people who want us to do the wrong things.
What was that about?
That's when I know my piece is working.
...
Moxie: Wool, like every animal hair, has scales up and down each fiber.
When I poke it into the wool, the needle opens and shuts the scales so they lock like Velcro.
Everyone has a context, a history that no one can know like you know your own.
I just believe in the potential of people.
Moxie: More than anything else, I've mastered the ability to ignore the voice in my head that tells me I don't know how to do anything.
Moxie: I can't watch films that are important to me, like any cinematography.
A relatively new one, "Back to Work," is about productivity and creative process.
Moxie published an instructional book, "I Felt Awesome" (North Light Books) in 2010.
