The announcement that Russia's prime minister, Vladimir Putin, will run for president in next March's election and will, if elected, appoint the current president, Dmitri Medvedev, as his prime minister brings to mind one of the most famous lines of Italian literature.
Putin and company have made clear for years that they do not intend to leave the scene quietly in 2012 when Medvedev's presidential term expires.
Yet the reality is that Putin's return to the Kremlin will not, in itself, change much.
Unless Western leaders seek to punish Putin for his return, there is no reason to think it will undermine the "reset" of recent years.
Seventy-three percent see Medvedev as having continued Putin's policies rather than introducing new ones of his own.
Putin's priority has been to keep mainstream Russians loyal.
Although the economy shrank by 8% in 2009, government spending grew from 34 to 41% of GDP.
Although Putin's -- and Medvedev's -- approval ratings have fallen in the last two years, the decline has been relatively slow.
Barring a sudden collapse, this should be enough to get Putin comfortably through next March's election, even without the predictable electoral irregularities.
As prime minister, Medvedev will be plunged into the operational details of managing the economy at an unusually tricky moment.
Medvedev's first task will probably be implementing unpopular cuts to rein in public spending.
Yet there is also the chance that he will survive for long enough to see reforms bear fruit -- and claim a share of the credit.
How effective he proves in this new role -- and how much leeway Putin allows him -- remain to be seen.
