(CNN) -- Pakistan wrapped up a first series whitewash over top-ranked England on Monday by winning the third and final Test in Dubai by 71 runs, making history in the process.
However, the batsmen continued their poor tour and collapsed to 252 all out as in-form spinner Saeed Ajmal and fast bowler Umar Gul took four wickets each.
England captain Andrew Strauss said the defeat should serve as a warning ahead of a two-match series with Sri Lanka, which starts at the end of March.
We've got a lot of cricket coming up.
I've got to try be ready for the Sri Lanka series."
Ajmal, who was the series' top wicket-taker with 24, denied Cook a half century before Gul tore into England's middle order.
A miserable series for England concluded when Rehman dismissed last man Monty Panesar for eight.
