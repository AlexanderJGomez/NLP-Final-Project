That's the message from Eric Post, lead scientist of a new report into the effects of climate change on life in the Arctic.
With the decline in sea ice and snow, animals usually seen at lower latitudes are being found in more northerly regions, including red foxes that have been displacing native Arctic foxes.
The report found that some native Arctic species have also benefited from climate change, including wild reindeer on the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard.
With the decline in caribou comes a knock-on effect to native Inuit hunters, according to the report's authors.
Iconic Arctic animals dependent sea ice, including Pacific walrus, ringed seal, hooded seal, ivory gull, narwhal and polar bear, are faring especially badly, said the report.
