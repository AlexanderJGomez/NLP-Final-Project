The election pitted Komorowski, the parliament speaker who has been acting president since the crash, against Kaczynski's twin brother, Jaroslaw Kaczynski.
The two were among 10 candidates in the election originally planned for the autumn but brought forward after Kaczynski died.
"Poland has to be a strong country, otherwise it will not exist," he said recently.
"We have been on this road for 21 years together and we have been right," Komorowski said on the campaign trail.
Though the president in Poland is primarily a ceremonial figure, he has the power to veto laws, thus helping to shape politics.
