(CNN) -- President Barack Obama unveiled a new college affordability plan Friday, proposing to further expand student financial aid while providing more assistance to schools that hold tuition down and cutting aid to those that do not.
"We want a country where everybody has a chance," Obama declared while visiting the University of Michigan campus in Ann Arbor.
Obama also proposed establishing a $55 million competition to spur new college strategies encouraging greater educational productivity and student outcomes.
"We can't keep subsidizing (skyrocketing) tuition," he said.
College affordability has been a recurring theme for Obama.
At the same time, he also discussed plans to sell off oil and gas leases on 38 million acres of the Gulf of Mexico seafloor as part of a sweeping new domestic energy push.
Obama mentioned the planned lease sales in his remarks at Buckley Air Force Base in Aurora, Colorado, which has a 1-megawatt solar array and last year test-piloted jets that run on advanced biofuels.
Obama said the administration is working to develop up to five highway natural gas corridors, and he announced a new competition to encourage the development of breakthroughs for natural gas vehicles.
