Los Angeles (CNN) -- Additional police officers were patrolling Los Angeles International Airport and two other airports Wednesday after a former Transportation Security Administration employee was accused of making a false threat against LAX, authorities said.
Nna Alpha Onuoha, a former Transportation Security Administration employee, made his initial appearance in a federal court in Los Angeles on Wednesday afternoon to face a count of making a false threat and a count of making threats against interstate commerce, said Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office.
Onuoha, 29, of Inglewood, California, is a former screener with the TSA at LAX, FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said.
After his resignation Tuesday, Onuoha allegedly left a package at TSA's LAX headquarters addressed to a TSA employee, the FBI said.
Police cleared the terminals, but no threats were found, the FBI said.
FEAR!
After waiving his Miranda rights, Onuoha told the FBI that the note referred to how he intended to start preaching in the streets on September 11, 2013, court papers said.
Onuoha was arrested outside Los Angeles, in Riverside, California, by task force members assisted by Riverside police, authorities said.
