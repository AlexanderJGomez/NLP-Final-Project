(CNN) -- Sitting in the first lady's box listening to the President Barack Obama push for movement on immigration reform, Cristian Avila no longer had to keep his head down and live in fear of being deported.
The recipients have become one of the most visible groups advocating for immigration reform.
Avila caught the attention of the Obama administration during his 22-day fast on the National Mall in support of immigration reform last November.
We revived the conversation," Avila said.
So let's get immigration reform done this year," he said.
Avila and his siblings no longer live in fear of being deported but his parents face that threat every time they leave their homes for work.
My mom would always tell me to put my head down," Avila said.
Still, Avila remains optimistic that immigration reform will happen in 2014.
