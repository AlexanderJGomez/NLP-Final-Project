When Beckham announced his decision to retire from football Thursday, there was one man who had already anticipated such an event.
"The impression from the very first time we met was that he was a devoted dad," Clement told CNN.
In an exclusive interview with CNN last month, Beckham spoke of the difficulty of being away from his family.
"That's the sacrifice I have to make as a father and as a husband: being away from my family," Beckham said.
"The kids have moved across the world and I think he wanted them to have some stability," added Clement.
"It was great to have him around and talk, but I've got my family here and that's been so good for me.
It was a period of great difficulty for Clement on a personal level and for all of those at the club.
"For me, it was great that he was there just after Nick died because that was an awful time.
Despite his advancing years, Beckham appeared to be in peak condition, showing a level of fitness which would embarrass some of the younger players in the PSG squad.
But he might have been a bit-part player next season or had to move to another club and I think he wanted to go out at the very top.
While Beckham will curtail his time in Paris at the end of the season, Clement hopes to remain to continue his work alongside manager Carlo Ancelotti.
"It's nice to work with good players," said Clement.
