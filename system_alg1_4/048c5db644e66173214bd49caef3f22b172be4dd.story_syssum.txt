Ralph Steinman, a biologist with Rockefeller University, was named a winner Monday of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.
"The events that have occurred are unique and, to the best of our knowledge, are unprecedented in the history of the Nobel Prize," the Nobel Assembly said in a statement, announcing that Steinman will remain a Nobel laureate.
In its statement Monday, the Nobel Assembly said it interpreted "the purpose of the rule" as making sure no one is "deliberately" awarded the prize posthumously.
In 1996, William Vickrey died days after the announcement that he had won the Nobel Prize in economics.
"Bruce Beutler and Jules Hoffmann discovered receptor proteins that can recognize such microorganisms and activate innate immunity, the first step in the body's immune response," the committee said in a written statement.
The committee will announce the most anticipated of the annual honors -- the Nobel Peace Prize -- on Friday.
Since 1901, the committee has handed out the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 101 times.
