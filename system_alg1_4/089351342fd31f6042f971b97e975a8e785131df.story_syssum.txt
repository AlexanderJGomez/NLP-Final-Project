I don't know if Hillary Clinton is going to run again.
Elleithee, a strategist who also played key roles in Bill Bradley's 2000 presidential bid, Wesley Clark's 2004 White House campaign, and Senate victories by Tim Kaine and Mark Warner in Virginia and Tom Udall in New Mexico, is confident the Democrats can hold the Senate and make House and gubernatorial pickups in next year's midterm elections.
I think we are well positioned to do that.
A: No.
Q: Let's talk money.
When it comes to money are there concerns that you won't have the cash to do what you need to do and how will you retire that debt?
They will likely have more money that us this cycle, but remember, they had more money than us last cycle.
We are going to have what we need to accomplish our goals this cycle, but we're still working to retire that debt and Democrats can help us out by going to Democrats.Org and giving what they can.
And I think there are a lot of places where we can do that.
There are going to be a lot of competitive races where we can pick up seats, we think.
So we're going to do what we can to support, we have some great Democratic campaign committees out there, at the DGA, the DCCC, the DSCC.
They are doing the heavy lifting and at the DNC we are going to be helping them out however we can, while really helping to do what we can to help the president's agenda.
I don't know if Hillary Clinton is going to run again.
That's why I'm over here.
Right now that's the goal, is to do what I can to help the party do as well as it can in the midterm elections.
