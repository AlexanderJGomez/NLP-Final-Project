Her brother, Jim Wolf, suffers from depression, alcoholism, unresolved grief and chronic homelessness, she says.
Recently, Wolf was featured in a fundraising video created by Rob Bliss for Dégagé Ministries.
Thomas says Wolf has started on that path before.
Thomas says Wolf trained to deploy with an infantry unit but never deployed.
About 13% of the adult homeless population are veterans.
Neither Thomas nor Bliss seemed surprised or anxious when Wolf was arrested shortly after the video was released.
She doesn't take responsibility for Wolf or make excuses for him.
Since the video was posted, people have shown willingness to help in various ways, Bliss and Thomas say.
Wolf was recently interviewed for a spot at a long-term residential treatment facility and received a complete physical, Thomas said.
She also admits that perhaps the video did not give Wolf the "glimpse into the future" that others had hoped.
I think he's hopeless.
Talk to them.
"I may have almost lost hope, but I will never give up."
