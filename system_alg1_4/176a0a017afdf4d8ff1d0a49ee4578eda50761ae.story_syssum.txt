An iPhone app called BeautyMeter was pulled from the app store after a nude photo surfaced.
Funnymals, maker of the BeautyMeter app, which lets users upload and posts photos of people and then rank them based on "hotness," says in a statement on its Web site that it agrees with Apple's decision to yank the phone application from its online store.
"Apple will not distribute applications that contain inappropriate content, such as pornography," an Apple company spokesman said at the time.
But Apple, like any company or Web site that hosts user-submitted content, may be engaged an impossible task by trying to keep all offensive material from the app store.
It would be impossible for Apple or developers to keep all potentially objectionable material out of the app store, since much of the content is submitted by users, he said.
Apple does not tell developers or the public exactly how the decision process works, he said.
The mysterious approval process frustrates app developers and could lead some to turn away from Apple and move on to other phones, said Jared Brown, an app developer.
And an iPhone app that allowed users to shake a digital crying baby to death was yanked from the app store in April.
Apple has said it approves 96 percent of submitted iPhone apps.
"They'd much rather hang onto their image as a family-friendly company" than let offensive material in, he said.
"I think they've really cultivated that."
