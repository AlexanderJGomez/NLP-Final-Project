(CNN) -- Current TV's co-founders, including former Vice President Al Gore, announced Friday that the network has ousted its highest-profile on-air personality, Keith Olbermann.
This marks the second time in 15 months that Olbermann has abruptly left a news network.
The 53-year-old was suspended from MSNBC for two days after the news website Politico revealed that he had made donations to three Democrats.
Besides hosting and producing his new prime-time nightly news and commentary show, Olbermann was named Current Media's chief news officer and had an equity stake in the company.
Eliot Spitzer, Gore and Hyatt announced.
He joins a network -- whose current president, David Bohrman, was CNN's former Washington bureau chief -- that is available via cable or satellite TV in 60 million U.S. households and in an additional 11 million internationally, according to Current's website.
