Now, the designer of "Civilization" is ready to take over a completely new world -- social gaming on the pages of Facebook.
"Players have continued to respond to the game in spite of how far technology has come, in spite of how the world has changed, in spite of how the demographics of game players have changed," Meier said.
While the game primarily has remained a PC game over the years, Meier took his creation to consoles in 2008 with "Civilization Revolution."
It felt like, both in terms of the technology and also where players were, that they would respond to having a strategy type game on their console."
"It's been the most dramatic stretch for the game, I'd have to say, so far," he said.
Meier said there were things that a Facebook game can offer Civ players over a traditional PC game.
Meier points out that a typical "Civilization" multiplayer game can easily span 12 or more continuous hours, whereas a Facebook game will take place in stops and starts over days and week.
Playing at different times in the day, Meier said, "fundamentally changes the mechanics of the game because if you are not there at the same time as other players, there needs to be ways of leaving messages, ways of communicating Things have to happen at a pace where everybody can be included.
Players who succeed will be rewarded, and then another game can start.
The game will also look different from its PC counterparts.
He said designing a Facebook game does give them the ability to update things really quickly because players are essentially downloading the whole game every time they play.
"Games are really taking over the world."
