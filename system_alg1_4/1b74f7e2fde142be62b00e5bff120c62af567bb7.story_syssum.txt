WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A federal appeals court has slammed the reliability of U.S. government intelligence documents, saying just because officials keep repeating their assertions does not make them true.
Hazaifa Parhat is being held by the U.S. military at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba.
The court also ruled the military improperly labeled Parhat as an "enemy combatant," marking the first time a Guantanamo Bay detainee has been given an opportunity in a civilian court to seek his release.
The ruling came 18 days after the Supreme Court concluded that the approximately 270 men held at Guantanamo have a basic constitutional right to challenge their detention in federal courts, another setback for the Bush administration's anti-terror and war policies.
A different panel from the federal appeals court in Washington concluded last July that the U.S. military could not limit what information the courts hear when foreign detainees are challenging their imprisonment.
Hearings known as combatant status review tribunals determine whether a prisoner can be designated an "enemy combatant," and prosecuted by the military.
Many of the men are in their seventh year of detention, and several have already had pretrial hearings before the military tribunal.
The government has promised to comply with the justices' latest ruling, but President Bush said he would still consider proposing further legislation limiting the power of federal courts to oversee appeals from enemy combatants.
The case is Parhat v. Gates (06-1397).
