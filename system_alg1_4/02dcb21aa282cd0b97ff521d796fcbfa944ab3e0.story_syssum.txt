(CNN) -- NATO troops in Afghanistan have been ordered to halt some joint operations with Afghan security forces after a spate of attacks by their local allies and amid fallout from a controversial anti-Islam video.
"In response to an increased threat situation as a result of the 'Innocence of Muslims' video, plus the recent insider attacks, ISAF forces are increasing their vigilance and carefully reviewing all activities and interactions with the local population," Maj. Lori Hodge, a spokeswoman for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, said earlier Tuesday.
The other factor behind the partial joint operations suspension is the number of "green-on-blue" attacks in the country.
"While some partnered operations are temporarily suspended, many continue, and regional commanders have the authority to approve more," Pentagon press secretary George Little said.
British Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, meanwhile, insisted Tuesday that, "There has been no change of policy in Afghanistan" for British forces.
"The change does not mean that where will be no partnering below that level.
That attack killed two U.S. Marines and destroyed six AV-8B Harrier jets, international forces said.
The halt in some joint operations with Afghan forces comes weeks after U.S. Special Operations forces suspended the training of some Afghan Local Police recruits while it double-checks the background of the current police force.
The spate of green-on-blue attacks comes as American and NATO troops are training Afghan soldiers and police to maintain security within the country ahead of the planned end of allied combat operations in 2014.
An earlier Pentagon review that said that about 10% were by Taliban forces that had sneaked into Afghan military and police ranks.
