(CNN) -- A flood of details has emerged in the past 24 hours about the case of Ariel Castro and the three women police say he held for close to a decade inside his modest Cleveland home.
And if not, how could that be?
On Tuesday, however, they said that didn't seem to be the case.
And when Castro and Grimilda Figueroa moved to the house on Seymour Avenue -- where the women were later discovered -- Castro wouldn't even let family members through the front door.
Authorities have searched Castro's home and found no evidence of human remains.
Castro would starve and punch her in the stomach to induce miscarriage, Knight said, according to the document.
Authorities haven't concluded who, if anyone, should get the money, but are discussing it, Tomba said.
A lot of credit and he is the true key to this case," Tomba said.
