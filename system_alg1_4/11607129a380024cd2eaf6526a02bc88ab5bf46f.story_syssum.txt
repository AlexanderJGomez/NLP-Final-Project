Ebola has orphaned thousands of children in West Africa, and relatives are terrified of taking them in for fear of infection, the United Nations said.
"UNICEF is looking at traditional and new ways to help provide children with the physical and emotional healing they need," the agency said in a statement this week.
In Liberia, the children's aid agency said it is training additional mental health workers to ensure children affected by the deadly virus get the support they need.
The U.N. children's agency said  it has received only 25% of the $200 million it needs for emergency assistance for families affected by Ebola in the region.
"Untold numbers of children are dying anonymously at home or in the streets," Save the Children said.
Meanwhile, Sierra Leone's President Ernest Koroma is missing an Ebola donor conference in London because his British-chartered plane had technical problems, the British Foreign Office said Thursday, an hour before he was due to give a news conference with British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond.
