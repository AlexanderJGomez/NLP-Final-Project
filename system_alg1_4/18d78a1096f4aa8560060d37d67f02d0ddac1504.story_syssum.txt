Addressing the "Apple Community" in a statement, Jobs said his doctors think they have found the reason behind his weight loss: "a hormone imbalance that has been 'robbing' me of the proteins my body needs to be healthy.
However, any diagnosis based on this description and Jobs' cancer history is purely speculative, experts say.
While abnormalities related to those hormones may also lead to weight loss, they are not necessarily associated with pancreatic disease, he said.
"In a patient whom a few years ago had pancreatic cancer, then progressive weight loss, then develops complications from the weight loss, it would be logical to associate his symptoms now with the previous cancer," he said.
Jobs, who co-founded Apple Inc., first learned he had pancreatic cancer in October 2003.
If Jobs had a recurrence of this tumor, and it was a functional neuroendocrine tumor, which produces problem-causing hormones, that would be one speculative explanation, Lowy said.
He's saying that's not what he has, and so, I have to take him at his word.
