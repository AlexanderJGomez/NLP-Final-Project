A Cleveland police officer shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice about two seconds after the officer and a partner pulled up in a car to investigate reports that someone was brandishing a gun at a park, surveillance video that police released Wednesday shows.
Police previously said it wasn't clear if the responding officers received the information about the suspect's age or the gun possibly being fake.

"It is our belief that this situation could have been avoided and that Tamir should still be here with us," the family said.
The video shows Tamir walking along a sidewalk and eventually sitting on a picnic table bench under a gazebo Saturday afternoon, sometimes pointing what appears to be a handgun.
"(The officer's) door was open as they pulled up," Tomba said.
Police have said Tamir reached into his waistband and pulled out the weapon.
Chief Calvin Williams said that four minutes after Tamir was shot a detective and FBI agent were on the scene.
Investigators determined that Tamir's weapon was an air gun, and that an orange tip that is meant to indicate that it's not a real firearm had been removed, police said.
