The scene of his victories in 1958, 1960, 1962 and 1964, Augusta was also where Palmer played plenty of golf with Dwight Eisenhower, the U.S. President of 1953-1961.
No mention of Eisenhower and Augusta can of course be made without recalling the loblolly pine that became one of the most famous trees in golf history.
While Augusta officials described the tree's loss as "difficult news to accept" and have begun deliberations as to how best replace it, Palmer believes Eisenhower, who died in 1969 aged 78, would have had a different viewpoint.
Palmer himself actually hit the famous tree en route to winning one of his Masters titles, but there may be no such trouble in future for one of his grandchildren.
"He's a young man and he's certainly getting some experience on playing professional golf," says his grandfather, who followed him around the course in a buggy.
