(CNN) -- Hostilities were resumed in the oldest international rivalry in football Wednesday and although billed as a friendly England and Scotland served up a fiercely competitive encounter at Wembley settled by a dream winner from debutant Rickie Lambert.
The thousands of fanatical Scottish fans, who drowned out the home support at times, were celebrating first when James Morrison put them ahead with a dipping shot which deceived England goalkeeper Joe Hart.
Lambert might have added to his tally as a later effort thumped the post, but it sent the England fans home happy ahead of crucial World Cup qualification matches next month.
Miguel Samudio put them ahead for the final time until Lars Bender salvaged a draw for Germany with a 75th minute equalizer.
2014 World Cup hosts Brazil crashed to a 1-0 defeat in Switzerland, a 48th minute own goal from Dani Alves sinking Luiz Felipe Scolari's men in Basel.
Martin Paterson scored the only goal to sink the Fabio Capello's men, who remain two points behind Portugal but with a game in hand.
