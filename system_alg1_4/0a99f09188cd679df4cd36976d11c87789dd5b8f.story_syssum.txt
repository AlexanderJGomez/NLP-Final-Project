Russell is familiar with how women are portrayed in the media.
To celebrate Interrupt magazine's launch, she's inviting the public to an art lab called "You Are a Genius" on New York's Lower East Side through Monday.
Cameron Russell: I had been thinking about an online participatory magazine for a while.
Critical voices from women and people of color are missing from many important conversations.
We knew it's crazy to start another media platform, but we came across many authentic voices online and offline that we felt we can bring together and showcase.
But it's not just girls.
These girls liked their bodies because they functioned well!
It's refreshing.
Russell: Our first print issue is a mock tabloid.
Russell: Actually, I think working on the offline Genius Lab.
We wanted to build a space where people felt comfortable and genius in their identity.
Many of these people spent over an hour here, took pictures, wrote pieces for the next issue and hung out.
Russell: The first several hundred submissions came from people who found out about the project online, mostly through Twitter.
Russell: Every time someone who isn't a "media maker" creates something that goes viral, every time someone whose perspective is left out of mainstream media proves to make an impact, every time a contributor collaborates with someone new to make better work, we improve the media landscape a little bit.
When I was a kid, I was obsessed with politics.
Russell: I'm inspired by the people I work with.
And then there's the graffiti artist and muralist known as miss163.
