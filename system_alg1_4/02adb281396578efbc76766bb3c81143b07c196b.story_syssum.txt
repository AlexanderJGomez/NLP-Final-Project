(CNN) -- Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky is giving people whiplash.
But we must hold him accountable for his past statements that private businesses had the right to deny service to anyone they wanted, something the Civil Rights Act specifically forbids.
He has since engaged in pretzel-like messaging maneuvers trying to rewrite history to fit reality -- one where a Republican candidate perceived as even the slightest bit anti-Israel can kiss any chance of the Republican presidential nomination good-bye.
Frankly, this is one instance on which I have given Paul props for being on the right side of history, the American people and the long-term viability of his party with at least a glimmer of hope and an opening to start a conversation with Latino voters.
Or maybe, he didn't have the guts to reconcile his hypocritical pro-immigration reform statements with his support of someone like King.
That must explain why Paul, in another rewrite of his record, said he didn't think anyone there wanted to ban birth control.
Paul also supported the Blunt Amendment, which would have given employers an excuse to deny contraceptive health care coverage based on their conscience.
This last one underscores how nervous Republicans are that even in the midterms, the ever-growing gender gap might be big enough to deny the "Republican wave" the party is dreaming about--and that would include taking over the Senate.
I can read.
Paul does not get to rewrite history and pretend he is not doing so.
