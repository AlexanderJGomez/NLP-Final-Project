(Tribune Media Services) -- When Eileen Mather lands in Mexico City on her way to Tapachula, Mexico, she learns her airline ticket isn't valid.
So I had to buy new tickets.
After I returned home, I faxed all of my documents to a supervisor at Cheapoair.
A: You shouldn't have to pay twice for your airline tickets.
Reservations can be lost, paper tickets and boarding passes can be misread.
The online agency shouldn't have kept you in a holding pattern for more than six months.
You could have avoided a lengthy dance with Cheapoair by taking this up with Aviacsa either when you were flying to Tapachula or returning home.
I contacted Cheapoair on your behalf.
An airline representative told Cheapoair it would have to speak to the agent who was working at the ticket counter when you checked in, which was impossible.
