(CNN) -- For Gen. Martin Dempsey, Thursday's move to open combat units in the U.S. military to women had its roots nearly a decade ago, on the streets of Baghdad.
And I said, 'Ah, OK,' " Dempsey told reporters at the Pentagon.
Panetta said the move is a bow to reality on the battlefield, where women in what are technically non-combat units already find themselves fighting alongside their male comrades.
The Pentagon loosened some of those restrictions in 2012, and Panetta said the result "has been very positive."
Dempsey said Thursday's announcement would be implemented "over time and with careful analysis," but he added that the service chiefs were unanimous in their support for the move.
The plaintiffs, who include women awarded Purple Hearts, also say the exclusion places them at a disadvantage for promotion.
"The first two women who earned Silver Stars since World War II, one was a military police sergeant.

" Cone said.
Dempsey said the services can still recommend closing a particular specialty or unit to women -- but "They have to explain why, and I think there will be the right amount of scrutiny on that."
But Gabbard said there will be women who qualify for combat units under today's standards -- such as a friend of hers from MP school.
Panetta is setting the goal of January 2016 for all assessments to be complete and women to be integrated as much as possible, a senior defense official said Wednesday.
It was instead done all at once, across the board.
