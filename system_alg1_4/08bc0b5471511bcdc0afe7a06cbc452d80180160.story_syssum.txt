New York (CNN) -- For Angel Rojas, the daily bus ride through the streets of Brooklyn provided a respite from a hardscrabble existence juggling two low-paying jobs.
A young man boarded the bus, police said.
"Pretty big gun for a pretty small man," Police Commissioner William Bratton said of the suspected gunman.
"Just as everyone in New York probably feels terrible about it, we feel terrible about it too," Anderson's lawyer, Frederic Pratt, told reporters, according to CNN affiliate WCBS.
Anderson allegedly belonged to Stack Money Goons and targeted a rival from another group known as TWAN Family, police said.
The couple has two children: a 12-year-old son, Saury, and 8-year-old daughter, April.
Guerrero said, "He was just sitting on a bus.
"He was a hard worker and a family man devoted to giving his family a better life," Guerrero said.
His laughter and his presence stayed with you."
