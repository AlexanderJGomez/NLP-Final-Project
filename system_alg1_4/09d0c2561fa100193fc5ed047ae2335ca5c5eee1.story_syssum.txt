Istanbul (CNN) -- Thousands of mourners gathered Thursday for the second mass funeral in two days after a 22-year-old Turkish man died from a gunshot wound.
But the violence took place amid clashes in nearby streets between riot police and mourners who had attended the funeral of 15-year-old Berkin Elvan on Wednesday.
The boy's death triggered a massive outpouring of grief and discontent, as demonstrators in several Turkish cities blamed the death on the Turkish government and excessive police force.
He went on to criticize Erdogan for refusing to discuss the death of his son or of six Turkish men who have died since anti-government protests erupted in May 2013.
Turkey's Prime Minister has not discussed Berkin's death in lengthy television interviews and at daily political rallies.
What are the people expressing sorrow yesterday going to say about this child of ours?"
Erdogan said, according to the semiofficial Anadolu news agency.
