ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Suspected Taliban militants blew up a government-run school Monday in Pakistan's violence-plagued Swat Valley, bringing to 183 the number of schools destroyed since fighting began in the area six months ago, officials said.
Swat Valley, located in North West Frontier Province, was once Pakistan's biggest tourist destination.
The central government has long exerted little control in the area, but it launched an intense military offensive in late July to flush out militants.
Elsewhere in the North West Frontier Province, a blast killed five people and wounded 15 others Monday morning, officials said.
