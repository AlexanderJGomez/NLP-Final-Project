The investigations into the death of Moammar Gadhafi after his capture last year could also be completed soon, Fawzy Abdilal said.
He did not name those who were being tried, but said "even civilians who had guns and fought under the Gadhafi regime" would be tried before military courts.
Human Rights Watch said after visiting Saif al-Islam in custody last year that he should have a lawyer, but Abdilal implied he had not asked for one.
Abdilal said the circumstances of his death were complicated.
