Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- The central business district of Bangkok dodged severe flooding Saturday afternoon, but surrounding areas of the bustling capital faced further inundation at the next high tide.
Massive runoff was flowing south to the sea through Bangkok, as high tides pushed the water in the opposite direction.
Bangkok residents plodded through murky waters without knowing what lurked within, the risk of infection and communicable disease worrying health officials.
As floodwater entered homes, some Bangkok residents still in the city made plans to leave.
The Bangkok Post reported that government buses had evacuated a number of elderly residents from the northern and eastern suburbs, and would pick up residents of the capital on Saturday and take them out of Bangkok.
Panic buying has led to a shortage of food and bottled water in the capital, residents said.
The remaining 240 patients will be taken to hospitals in other provinces by Sunday, it said, citing Permanent-Secretary for Health Paichit Varachit.
In all, 1,356 people were under observation by health officials, the minister said, according to MCOT.
