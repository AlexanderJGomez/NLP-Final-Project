The German team and the sport's tire supplier Pirelli have been summoned to explain an alleged illegal tire test to the FIA's disciplinary body.
After gathering evidence from the Italian tire manufacturer, Mercedes and the other 10 teams, the FIA has decided that Mercedes has a case to answer -- though a date has not yet been set for the hearing before a 12-man panel.
Mercedes released a statement in response to the news that read: "We welcome the opportunity to explain the full facts of the Pirelli test in an open and transparent manner at the International Tribunal.
"Pirelli did not ask in any way that a 2013 car be used: not of Mercedes nor FIA nor the teams which, during the year, were offered the opportunity of participating in tests for the development of tires for 2014.
In light of this, Pirelli stressed that the recent tire testing had focused on developing tires for 2014 when significant rule changes governing engines will be introduced.
Pirelli is trialling a new "medium" compound tire at this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal, which it then plans to introduce as the race tire for the rest of this season.
