Miami, Florida (CNN) -- A Miami, Florida, court appearance for Colton Harris-Moore, the so-called "barefoot bandit," has been postponed until Friday, as he did not have a U.S.-based attorney to represent him Wednesday.
Typically in extradition cases, the accused makes a first appearance in the federal court closest to where he was arrested, said Emily Langlie, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Western District of Washington.
In his initial U.S. appearance, he will be told of his rights and read an initial charge of interstate transportation of stolen property, Langlie said.
Federal prosecutors are working with other states to determine the best way to go forward in this case, but the Washington courts will get him first since he was arrested on their warrant, Langlie said.
He faces charges in Washington state in the theft of an aircraft, and police have said they believe he stole a Cessna in Indiana and flew it to the Bahamas, where it was found in the shallows off Abaco Island.
Harris-Moore is called the "barefoot bandit" because he was without shoes when he allegedly broke into houses.
