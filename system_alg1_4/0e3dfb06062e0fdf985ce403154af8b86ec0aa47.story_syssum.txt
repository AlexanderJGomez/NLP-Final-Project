Morgan was interviewing the agent for a documentary titled "Marilyn Monroe: Murder on Fifth Helena Drive," he said.
Morgan said he paid $275,000 for the faded color film because it is "very rare" to find images of the actress' private moments.
Monroe changed her name from Norma Jeane Baker to Marilyn Monroe early in her acting and modeling career.
The film was made in the late 1950s; Gretchen said she could not recall the exact year.
Gretchen retained the copyright, which Morgan is helping her sell through an eBay auction expected to begin Thursday, he said.
