Despite all this, Lilly's heart is really in writing.
Working on that project is what inspired me to start writing [her children's book] "The Squickerwonkers" and get it published.
Lilly: Tauriel was half as daunting as a character from the book.
CNN: Since she is not in the book, we don't know what will become of her.
Is it the dwarf or Legolas?
But there's a lot more emotional material for Tauriel in this film, which is good to see.
Then Titan swept in and said they would publish in 2014.
There's nothing as pleasurable to me as writing.
If this wasn't the right fit -- an amazing job that most people would covet -- I thought that writing would be that.
Lilly: I've been astounded to discover how good to their teams and crew that Marvel are.
This one is very much a heist film.
It has all the fun, tension and drama of a good heist film.
