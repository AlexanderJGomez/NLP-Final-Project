Ekwa said Obama was lifting 25-pound free weights.
He said when he first saw the roughly 10 agents at the gym, he didn't think he would be allowed in.
"On the inside I was very excited.
But said he was glad Obama decided to hit the gym while abroad.
The candid video might have caught Obama off guard, but likely not unaware, former White House videographer Arun Chaudhary said.
"President Obama is somebody who just acts the same on and off camera and has this unique ability just to sort of not care about it," Chaudhary said.
"This is not him strangling a tiger on top of a horse while he's shirtless," Chaudhary said of Obama.
"This is someone doing what they do in a non-glamorous way."
