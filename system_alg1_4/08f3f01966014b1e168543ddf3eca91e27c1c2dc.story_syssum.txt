The differences?
"Overall, the reaction to political events on Twitter reflects a combination of the unique profile of active Twitter users and the extent to which events engage different communities and draw the comments of active users," the report reads.
On Twitter, a full 77% of tweets about his win were positive and only 23% negative.
Pew's research shows that Twitter users are considerably younger than the general public and more likely to lean Democratic.
And 57% of those who posted news on Twitter were either Democrats or leaned Democratic, compared with 46% of the general public.
The reason for such a swing, Pew said, is that on Twitter, unlike in opinion polls, users decide what they think is important enough to mention publicly.
"The overall negativity on Twitter over the course of the campaign stood out," Pew writes.
There were more negative than positive comments about Obama and Romney on Twitter.
In the Pew's 2012 news consumption survey, just 13% of adults said they ever use Twitter or read Twitter messages.
Only 3% said they regularly or sometimes tweet or retweet news or news headlines on Twitter.
