One, named only as Mounia R., told the court in the northern French city of Lille that Strauss-Kahn had "brutal" sexual relations with her and must have known she was being paid.
But my behavior is the same with all women," Strauss-Kahn said.
Jade told the court she had refused to have sex with Strauss-Kahn at the Tantra club, "because it was a butchery."
She later accompanied Strauss-Kahn to his hotel at the request of fellow defendant Fabrice Paszkowski, a businessman friend of the former IMF director, she said.
Strauss-Kahn on Tuesday denied knowing any of the women at the sex parties were prostitutes, saying he was told by Paszkowski that they were "libertines" who liked sex.
Jade later went on a trip to Washington, D.C. as part of a group accompanying Strauss-Kahn, the court heard.
I was told so, otherwise why would I go to DC?
She did not sleep with Strauss-Kahn on that trip, she said.
Marion's testimony said that Estelle had told her that.
The two women had been introduced to Strauss-Kahn as secretaries working for a construction company at which another defendant in the case, businessman David Roquet, was employed.
Unlike other women in this case, Helene and Florence said they didn't perceive any brutality or deviance at the parties.
That comment came after she wondered aloud about the profession of women at a sex party they'd both attended, Ines said in a statement read in court.
Sex workers involved in the parties said they were like orgies.
However, the investigating magistrates did not follow their recommendations.
The trial of Strauss-Kahn, who saw his stellar career plummet to earth after a separate sex scandal that resulted in his arrest in New York in 2011, opened in Lille just over a week ago.
