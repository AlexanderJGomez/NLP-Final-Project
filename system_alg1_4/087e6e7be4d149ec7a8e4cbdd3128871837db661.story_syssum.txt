Kerry will fly to Geneva on Friday "in an effort to help narrow differences in negotiations" with Iran, two senior State Department officials said.
The first step, if agreed upon, would require Iran to halt advances in its nuclear program in return for "very modest relief" from economic sanctions, he said.
Uranium enrichment is the key issue on the table during the talks with Iran over the future of its controversial nuclear program.
The framework has been agreed to, he said.
Zarif said the nuclear program would continue -- in some form.
The concerns of each side have been dealt with, he said.
Two senior U.S. administration officials said a deal on Iran's nuclear program is in the works.
Other sweeteners were also under consideration, they said.
"The main issue is getting to the root of the problem, which is the enrichment issue and all things that lead from that," Michael Mann, spokesman for Ashton, said on the sidelines of negotiations.
The United States and its partners have accused Iran of diverting resources from its civilian nuclear program to try to develop a nuclear bomb.
In its August report, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, estimates that since declaring its nuclear program, Iran has processed 10 metric tons of uranium to 5% purity, the level used for nuclear power plants.
