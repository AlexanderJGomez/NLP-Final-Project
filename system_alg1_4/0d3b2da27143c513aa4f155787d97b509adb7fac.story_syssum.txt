(CNN) -- California Rep. Maxine Waters is pressing the House ethics panel to set her trial date before the midterm elections in November.
According to a House ethics committee report, Waters helped arrange a meeting in September 2008 between Massachusetts-based OneUnited Bank and Treasury Department officials.
Waters' conduct may have violated" House rules, the report concludes.

"All I know is that I have not been charged, that there has been a report that was released that said further investigation," Waters said.
The announcement this week by the ethics committee means Waters, 71, may now face a trial by committee members tasked with determining whether there is "clear and convincing evidence" she broke congressional rules.
It should be fair," Waters said.
The growing likelihood of trials for Waters and Rangel also adds the explosive element of race to the political equation.
