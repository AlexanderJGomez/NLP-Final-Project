Scientists placed the six male volunteers in isolation in 2010 to simulate a mission to Mars, part of the European Space Agency's experiment to determine challenges facing future space travelers.
The simulated trip replicated all aspects of a real spaceflight to Mars, including orbiting the planet, landing and returning to Earth.
Data from the mission will give experts an idea of how the mind and body would cope with a long spaceflight to the Red Planet, according to Suenson.
Extra seclusion will allow them to get reacquainted with their surroundings, including sound and light, Suenson said.
