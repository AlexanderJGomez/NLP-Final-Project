Santa Barbara, California (CNN) -- As Elliot Rodger was carrying out a deadly rampage Friday night around Santa Barbara, his parents were frantically trying to find him, having just received a chilling manifesto from their son.
His mother called Rodger's father, Peter, and said he had to watch the YouTube video.
Lichin Rodger called 911, and the parents set off for Santa Barbara from Los Angeles, according to Astaire.
His mother came across his YouTube videos in April after she hadn't heard from Rodger in a few days, Astaire said.
A woman on the hotline called police to check on him, Astaire said.
In fact, Elliot Rodger himself wrote in the manifesto that he worried that someone had discovered his plan when the police visited.
I would have been thrown in jail, denied of the chance to exact revenge on my enemies.
Brown told reporters that Rodger suffered from an undisclosed mental health issue and was under the care of a variety of health care professionals.
Rodger had been seeing therapists on and off since he was 8, according to Astaire.
But Astaire said Rodger didn't seem to have violent tendencies.
Astaire told CNN that Rodger never expressed any fascination with guns.
The official said nothing had been found in the gun trace to indicate Rodger should have been disqualified.
"(His parents) were conscious and concerned about their son's health," Astaire said.
