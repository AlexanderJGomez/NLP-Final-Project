Earlier Thursday, the Orleans Parish district attorney's office in Louisiana had said Sharper, 38, and Erik Nunez, 26, each face two counts of aggravated rape.
Last week, Sharper pleaded not guilty to the California charges, which included two counts of rape by use of drugs.
Prosecutors in Louisiana said the two alleged rapes occurred on September 23 in a New Orleans apartment.
Police in Tempe, Arizona, say they expect to file charges against Sharper soon.
In addition, a Florida woman last month filed a sexual battery complaint in Miami Beach against Sharper relating to a 2012 incident, a police report said.
Miami Beach police are investigating the case, Miami Beach Detective Vivian Hernandez said last week.
