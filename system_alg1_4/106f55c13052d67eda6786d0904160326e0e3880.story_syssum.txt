At one kilometer (0.6 miles) high, the largest of the two Phoenix Towers planned for Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in central China, will be the tallest in the world if completed on schedule in 2017/2018.
The project is still awaiting government final approval, but if all goes to plan it could steal a march on the Kingdom Tower in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, which is also designed to top out at one kilometer, but not until 2019.
The design is inspired by dualism in Chinese culture -- the traditional Chinese phoenix symbol of the two birds, "Feng" and "Huang," as well as the idea of yin and yang.
Three large spheres containing celestial-themed restaurants accessible via "skywalks" will be suspended between the two towers.
A ground-level commercial center looks set to continue China's current obsession with imitating global architectural styles.
The two towers will cover seven hectares of a 47-hectare site on the island.
