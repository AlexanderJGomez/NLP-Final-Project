A few Americans turned their rage against Muslims who were living in the United States.
In Cleveland, Ohio, a man drove a Ford Mustang right through an Islamic center.
That day, at the Islamic Center in Washington, the president delivered a powerful message about the need to keep America's response to 9/11 from turning into a war against Muslims.
Speaking at an emotionally charged moment, just six days after the attacks, Bush told the audience that it was vital for Americans to understand that the terrorists did not represent the Muslim tradition.
Islam is peace.
America, he said, "counts millions of Muslims amongst our citizens, and Muslims make an incredibly valuable contribution to our country.
While Bush would come under criticism for many aspects of his war on terrorism -- including policies such as the use of interrogation tactics that critics called torture -- he continued to be very clear in his defense of Muslims.
In response to the proposal to build an Islamic center near ground zero in New York City, a heated national debate has unfolded about Muslims in America.
A Florida pastor, Terry Jones, announced he would burn copies of the Quran.
Although the pastor agreed to cancel the Quran burning after a call from Secretary of Defense Robert Gates warning it would put American lives at risk, the incident stoked the fires of hatred.
When Bush spoke at the Islamic Center, he took a pivotal step in defining how he wanted to defend the nation and go about punishing the aggressors who killed thousands of civilians.
