Washington (CNN) -- A federal appeals court ruled Friday the Transportation Security Administration can still use full-body scanners at airports, but said the agency erred in how it deployed the controversial machines.
But they agreed on the second point, saying TSA must now go through proper procedures -- though the court, significantly, did not order the agency to stop using the machines immediately.
TSA plans to have more than 1,000 machines in use at airports nationwide by the end of this year.
But the court said the government must weigh "the degree to which (the search) intrudes upon an individual's privacy and... the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests."
The court also debunked the privacy group's allegation in its lawsuit that TSA had violated the Video Voyeurism Prevention Act.
Rotenberg, meanwhile, called the court's decision important and said it "pins" down TSA to a policy in which body scans are optional.
"I think the court would have had a very different conclusion" had body scans been mandatory, Rotenberg said.
