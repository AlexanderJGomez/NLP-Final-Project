An injured Morgan McCracken has benefited from awareness after Natasha Richardson's death.
"For the next two days, she was perfectly fine," Donald McCracken says.
But after hearing about Richardson's death, the McCrackens wondered if Morgan was really as OK as she seemed.
And by the time I got off the phone with him, Morgan was sobbing, her head hurt so much," McCracken says.
He whisked Morgan into the operating room, pausing for a moment to tell McCracken that his daughter had the same injury as Richardson: an epidural hematoma.
"Dr. Cohen told us that if we hadn't brought her in Thursday night, she never would have woken up," McCracken says.
Now the McCrackens sometimes wonder if they waited too long to get Morgan to a doctor.
In most cases, it's pretty clear when someone needs medical attention after a head injury, says Greg Ayotte, a spokesperson for the Brain Injury Association of America and a cognitive rehabilitation therapist.
In the case of epidural hematomas, the injury Richardson and Morgan had, blood pools in the area between the lining of the brain and the skull.
Here, from Ayotte and other experts, is a list of what to do after someone has suffered a head injury.
If the injured person has these signs, take him or her to an emergency room, says Dr. Jam Ghajar, clinical professor of neurological surgery at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, and president of the Brain Trauma Foundation.
Look for changes in symptoms and behavior
Also, blood thinners can turn a mild bleed into a major bleed, so be especially vigilant if the injured person is taking blood thinners such as warfarin.
He also warns people to be extra vigilant when an elderly person hits his or her head.

The McCrackens say they look back and still can't believe Morgan suffered such a severe injury and didn't show any signs for 48 hours.
"It's always better to err on the side of being conservative," he says.
