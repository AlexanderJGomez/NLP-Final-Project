The co-founder of Twitter and chief executive officer of Square met with CNN's Maggie Lake to share his vision on how mobile payments will change the world of commerce.
"What I think is great about technology, and every technology that exists, [is that] it increases the number of people who can participate, in our case commerce," Dorsey said.
Square is competing in a jammed arena -- mobile payments already exist via Paypal and others -- but Dorsey told CNN its pitch is different.
However, Dorsey said Square is an "entirely new canvas," dealing as it does with commerce rather than communication.
Both ideas are "fundamental to humanity....both are extremely complex and both companies are trying to make each simple."
