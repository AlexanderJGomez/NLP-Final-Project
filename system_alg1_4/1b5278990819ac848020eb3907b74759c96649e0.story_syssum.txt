That's how it looked in 2000, when the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as PRI, lost the presidency to Vicente Fox of the National Action Party, or PAN.
As expected, the top vote getter in Mexico's presidential election on Sunday was PRI candidate Enrique Pe単a Nieto.
The 45-year-old former governor of Mexico's most populous state, the one with the matinee idol good looks and the movie star wife, got about 38% of the vote.
When criticized for being out of touch, he insisted chauvinistically that he wasn't "the woman of the household."
Their cozy relationship was one of the things that, in recent weeks, drove hundreds of thousands of student protesters into the streets to protest the candidate's likely election and the fact that the elites who run Mexico seemed to be ramrodding Pe単a Nieto into office.
Even former President Vicente Fox crossed party lines and endorsed Pe単a Nieto, against the PAN's own candidate, Vazquez Mota.
The party also used this control to thwart reforms pushed by Fox and his successor, Felipe Calderon.
As many Mexicans see it, the PRI was always plotting its retaking of the presidency, even as it overhauled its brand and tried to overcome a legacy of corruption.
But the more common view seems to be that, despite the makeover, the party is as corrupt as ever -- a fact that voters seem willing to overlook if it can steer the country to safer and more tranquil waters.
What started nearly six years ago as an offensive by the government against the drug cartels has now morphed into a messy turf war between rival gangs eager to gobble up the country one city at a time.
My sense is that the PRI couldn't stop the war, even if it wanted to.
Meanwhile, we'll have to wait and see whether the election of Pe単a Nieto turns out to be good news for Mexico.
