Lawson, a 42-year-old administrative assistant, checked out a library book about online dating before creating her profile.
So began Lawson's adventures in online dating where selecting a user name is only the beginning of an often unpredictable journey.
One in six recently married couples met on an online dating site, according to a study commissioned by Match.com in 2009.
Lawson began online dating at the end of 2011 when she realized she wasn't meeting anyone her own age in Gainesville, Florida.
"I probably think about 'Star Wars' more than anyone should," Lawson wrote in her OKCupid profile.
Even though they ordered the same kind of beer, Lawson did not think they were a match made in heaven.
"I'm really not materialistic, but I just didn't think it would work out," she said.
Lawson said her favorite part of the date was when she texted him later to tell him she didn't think it would work out between them.
"Finally just one day on Skype, everybody else had kind of hung up and I said you know, I think I love you," she said.
"We got to know the real us, because we never lied," White wrote in her iReport.
White advised to be protective with personal information because it's easy to lie online.
Within 24 hours of registering on Match.com in 2010, Barbara Hassan had three matches "who by all accounts were intelligent, good looking and well off."
They corresponded online for a few months, until the man asked Hassan to pay for his ticket to the United States.
"He thought he had me hooked but little did he know," she said.
But just when Hassan thought she was done with online dating, she met her husband in 2011.
They bonded over their online dating scammer stories and got married 14 months later.
Whether people are looking to find their soul mate or just to have some fun, Lawson said it helps to go into online dating with a sense of humor.
