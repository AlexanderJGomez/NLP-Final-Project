LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Longtime entertainment columnist Army Archerd, who was one of the first writers to reveal that actor Rock Hudson was being treated for AIDS, has died at age 87, according to the industry publication Daily Variety.
He was a loving, quiet person.
Kazan had provided testimony in 1952 to the House Un-American Activities Committee, admitted past membership in the Communist party and named others from his group.
Archerd was the first journalist honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and won numerous other awards.
In 1953, Daily Variety editor Joe Schoenfeld hired Archerd to replace columnist Sheilah Graham.
Archerd began penning the daily "Just for Variety" column.
Archerd was president and founder of the Hollywood Press Club and received honors from that group and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, as well as Newsman of the Year from the Publicists Association.
