He didn't say a thing, and she didn't know what to say to him.
Appearing on the "Dr. Phil" show, Kirkland told Phil McGraw she was worried how her little boy was going to react the next time she tried to put him on the bus to school.
His mother hasn't asked Ethan what happened when he was there.
Dykes shot bus driver Charles Poland several times before he carried Ethan, who had fainted, off the bus and into an underground bunker Dykes had built on his property.
"The Army came in and shot the bad man," Kirkland said Ethan told her.
Dykes took care of her boy as best he could, she said.
He even fried chicken for the boy.
He's my everything," she said.
"Hey, bug, I sure have missed you," she recounted.
Kirkland told McGraw that it was Poland who helped Ethan conquer his fear of descending the steep school bus steps.
Poland would cheer Ethan on and one day when the child hesitated and the mother went to help, the driver said, "Let him do it."
Ethan hasn't been back to school yet.
"Ethan is a loving, forgiving child," Kirkland said.
That was the boy who went into that bunker.
