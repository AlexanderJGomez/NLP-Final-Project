(CNN) -- Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was placed under formal investigation early Wednesday in connection with suspected corruption and influence peddling, French media said.
"No one is above the law, but it is important to remember that the presumption of innocence applies to everyone," he said.
Prime Minister Valls, in his interview with BFMTV, rejected any suggestion that the investigation was politically motivated, insisting that judges work entirely independently.
Bordeaux Mayor Alain Juppe, a UMP politician who formerly served as prime minister and foreign minister, said via Twitter that he was thinking of Sarkozy in a spirit of friendship.
His defense will demonstrate his innocence, I hope," he posted.
