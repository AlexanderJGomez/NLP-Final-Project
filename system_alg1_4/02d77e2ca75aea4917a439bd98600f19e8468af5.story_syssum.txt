(CNN) -- The thing about North Korea is that once in a while, it does something that sends the international community into a flurry of talk about the hermit nation, even though little is known about what's really going on.
His eldest half brother said in his book that he was concerned Kim Jong Un would fail to satisfy North Koreans.
"It's been an interesting first year but as with most things in North Korea, we simply don't know," he said.
In that sense, the satellite launch was proof of progress and power, said Bill Richardson, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who traveled to North Korea in 2010.
"I think this is very important to Kim Jong Un to build political legitimacy and bolster the spirits of his people," he said.
"Then, it was a major embarrassment," said Han Park, director of the University of Georgia's Center for the Study of Global Issues who was in North Korea at the time of the failed launch.
North Korea's ruling politburo is sure to spin the story as national dreams coming to fruition under the initiative of Kim, Park said.
The rocket launch allows Kim to establish military security for North Korea, said Park, and allows him to move forward with another priority: economic progress.
"Kim Jong Un's primary objective is to improve the economy by participating in the international market," Park said.
"In the big scheme of things, Kim Jong Un must have thought that North Korea would be taken more seriously (after a rocket launch)."
Kim Jong Un staked his personal prestige on economic growth."
Sigal said.
"He's saying to the world, 'Look, I'm back,'" Richardson said about Kim Jong Un.
This is the capability I have."
Sigal said the only way to get what Washington wants on the nuclear front is to come to the table.
