The armed forces also are accused of funneling money from diamond fields to President Robert Mugabe's party.
"Three men in army uniform jumped into my car and asked me to drive them back to the mining area," Chiso said.
Such stories are common, said Georgette Gagnon, director of Human Rights Watch.
The money from blood diamonds can end up funding rebel violence, the Kimberley Process group said.
The government has not been able to verify allegations of deaths and mass graves, Mohadi said.
"The money will not be handled by any party but by the Treasury," he said.
