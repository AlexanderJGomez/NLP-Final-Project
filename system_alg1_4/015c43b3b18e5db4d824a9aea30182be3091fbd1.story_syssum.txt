I say mysterious because the business of yacht building is full of rumors and speculation until the ship is seen leaving the sheds of the family-owned builders, whether in Amsterdam, Hamburg or Bremen.
And since they aren't allowed to talk about those who buy these yachts, they are only to happy to talk all about the business.
Aly said the bigger yacht side of the business is coming back faster than the smaller side.
His famed Lurssen shipyard in Bremen will soon unleash the world's longest mega yacht, codenamed Project Azzam.
We could ask one of the owners, but they tend to like the yacht to do the talking.
Henk de Vries of Feadship built the Venus for Jobs, though he won't confirm that.
And they have his.
We do it all the time," de Vries said, laughing.
This project that will be shown to the world, again I can't say anything, except that it is very large, and it's immensely complex and has everything that is included in that one."
With the business of big yachts coming back, it's possible other builders might want to get in on the action.
At a time that Europe is very worried about jobs, the uptick in interest for mega yachts should be looked at in a positive light, even if news reports will soon be filled with gossip (and jealousy?)
over Project Azzam and the "bells and whistles" yachts to soon sail away from the shores of Europe to the Middle East.
