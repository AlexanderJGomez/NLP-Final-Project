Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli authorities are investigating whether the attack that left an American woman dead and her friend injured was "nationalistic," a police spokesman said Monday, using a term for crimes in which a victim is targeted based on an Arab or Israeli background.
Wilson said she was wearing a Star of David on a necklace when she was attacked, according to the newspaper.
Luken and Wilson both worked for CMJ UK, a Christian ministry based in England.
Luken was an administrator for the group and had recently taken over responsibility for managing the group's tour operations in Israel, Aldridge said.
He said the group's work sharing the Christian faith with the Jewish people in Israel would continue despite the attack.
