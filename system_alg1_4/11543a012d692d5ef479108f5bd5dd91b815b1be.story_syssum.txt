Insurance companies are using the referendum process to try to strike down a new law in Washington state.
"Insurance companies have figured out that they can make more money if they don't pay your claim,'' said Washington state Rep. Steve Kirby.

"The insurance companies stepped in and said, 'Consumers, you get to decide if you want to do this,' '' said Dana Childers, executive director of the Liability Reform Coalition, which is leading the insurance company charge to defeat the new law.
Kreidler said he strongly supports the new law and that if insurance companies act responsibly they have nothing to fear.
