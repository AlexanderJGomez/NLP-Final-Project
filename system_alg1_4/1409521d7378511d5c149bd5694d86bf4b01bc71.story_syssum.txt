But it did -- sort of -- on Monday for a man who boarded a long-delayed Delta Airlines flight from Cleveland to New York to find that all his fellow passengers had been rebooked on other flights.
And he got a flight attendant to snap pictures of him, with rows of empty seats in the background.
"They rebooked everyone but me on another flight to LGA, so I am literally the only person on this plane," he posted.
As it turned out, O'Leary was not the only passenger on the flight.
The two didn't keep each other company, however.
"It was definitely the most memorable flight I've been on in recent memory if only for the sheer lack of passengers to become bothersome," he told ABC News.
