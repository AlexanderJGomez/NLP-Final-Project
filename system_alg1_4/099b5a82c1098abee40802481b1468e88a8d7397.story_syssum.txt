However, the medical journal BMJ reported Tuesday, the examination into how the study was conducted was led by the editor of the Lancet, which published the paper, and involved "no formal investigation" of the allegations.
Following a three-year investigation, Britain's General Medical Council ruled in January 2010 that the way Wakefield conducted his research was dishonest and irresponsible.
"From this point forward, Wakefield encouraged the media and a grassroots network of anti-vaccine advocates to believe that this vaccine may cause autism," the Lancet said.
The journal said the Royal Free Hospital, where Wakefield worked at the time of the publication, conducted the 2004 investigation that led to a partial retraction by the paper's co-authors.
In the United States, more cases of measles were reported in 2008 than in any other year since 1997, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
