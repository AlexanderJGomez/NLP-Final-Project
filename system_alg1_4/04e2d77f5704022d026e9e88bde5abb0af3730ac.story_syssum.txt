More than 525,000 Syrians have already crossed into neighboring countries, the United Nations announced Wednesday, and it estimated that more than a million will flee in the next six months.
That amount, officials believe, will help contribute to aid for an estimated 4 million people inside Syria who urgently need help.
Plans to help Syria have changed much over the past several months, which is "indicative of the rapid developments on the ground and the dramatically deteriorating humanitarian situation in the country," said Radhouane Nouicer, the regional humanitarian coordinator for Syria with the United Nations.
"The camp was supposed to be a safe haven," he said.
He said non-stop shelling on the Yarmouk camp has forced tens of thousands to flee, but Mohammed estimates 100,000 remain.
"The Yarmouk camp was safe business as usual until the last few weeks, when the FSA started shelling the camp from outside," said Hussam Arafat, of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine General Command.
At least 161 people were killed across Syria Wednesday, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a Syria-based opposition activist network.
At least 40 people were killed and dozens were wounded by a car bomb that exploded in Aleppo's Marjeh neighborhood, the LCC said.
