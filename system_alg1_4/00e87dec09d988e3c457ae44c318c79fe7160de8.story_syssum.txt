(CNN) -- The interesting news in the latest CNN/ORC International poll that Bill Clinton is pulling a 66% favorable rating among Americans suggests the 42nd president has the power to help or hurt Barack Obama as the 2012 campaign enters its final five months.
The CNN poll appears at the moment when Clinton has once again been playing an outsize role on the public stage, and many have suggested all sorts of theories and reasons for maneuvering.
That comment led Clinton to apologize.
Clinton is trying to change the debate in the presidential campaign from one about the past to one about the future.
It is easy to forget that Clinton has differed with the White House in the past about how to frame a political race.
Clinton isn't the first president to meddle in presidential politics after his own presidency ended.
But Clinton's grudge isn't personal; it's about how best to mount and run a campaign.
