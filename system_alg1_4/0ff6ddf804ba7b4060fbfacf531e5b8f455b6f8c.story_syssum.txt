A cable dated January 2010 sent by then Charge d'Affaires Todd Chapman at the U.S. Embassy covered allegations about officials enabling drug trafficking by accepting bribes.
"I feel I have been used.
Chapman wrote that his source had told him the country's ruling party, FRELIMO, "brazenly squeezes the business community for kickbacks."
When asked about other things, the source said, "I just told him I didn't know.
The accusations in the Mozambique cable echo comments in several others from the country between July 2009 and January of this year.
The State Department would not comment on the leaked cables that were supposedly authored by Chapman.
In a cable from November 2009, Chapman writes, "The decrease in drug-related arrests at Maputo International Airport is not attributable to improved interdiction efforts but rather increased police and customs involvement in drug smuggling.
Chapman said one prominent businessman, Mohamed Bashir Suleman, was "described by multiple contacts as the largest narcotrafficker in Mozambique" with contacts at senior levels of the government.
A cable from July 2009 said a source within FRELIMO had described a customs official as "the King of Corruption."
Chapman contended that of the more than ten drug seizures during 2009, none had led to prosecutions as of January 2010.
