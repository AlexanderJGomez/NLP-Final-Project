The other casualties included the highly respected leaders of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the University of Illinois and the University of Oregon.
Leaders of public universities in other states face equally strong pressures to go.
Our nation's public universities are the heart and soul of our higher education system, which is the envy of the world.
University leaders are an endangered species because they are wedged between opposing and powerful pressures that are undermining public universities.
Professors and administrators on campus view these reforms as attacks on serious education and research.
Anyone who has taught writing, for example, knows that there is no substitute for the instructor sitting with the student and going line-by-line through each sentence.
It's the same for advanced research.
Without university research of this kind we would not have many of the technologies and medicines we take for granted today.
University leaders are caught in the middle.
Although alumni want their universities to be the best in the world, their support (as generous as it may be) cannot replace government money.
Despite steep decreases in state funding for universities, state and federal agencies provide the largest share of money to public universities for research and related activities.
What we need is an open and participatory process where university boards, state leaders, faculty, students and campus presidents formulate measurable goals for reasonable reforms, cost-savings, and more efficiency.
At present, the attacks on university leaders from all sides are attacks on the very idea of a public university.
That is what they meant by the "public" in university.
Let's start with giving university presidents a fair chance to do their work.
