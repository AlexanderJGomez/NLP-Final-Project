Last year Garris reported a bumper crop of acorns, which scientists say may be one clue to this year's scarcity.
"There are plenty of acorns in most of the state, but zero acorns in some pockets," he said.
Downing said recovery from last year's big crop, combined with a much wetter-than-usual spring, probably accounts for the acorn absence.
"Last year we collected 25,000 pounds of seeds, most from a bumper crop of acorns," said McNamee.
"I had read about the collapse of the bee colonies, and it made me wonder, is something else going on here?
It's also hard to think of acorns without thinking about squirrels.
But Doug Inkley, senior scientist at the National Wildlife Federation, said that wild animals can be resilient when their usual food sources go away.
She suggested that residents leave whole (not crushed) corn, peanuts and sunflowers in the seed as backyard treats.
"Animals are resourceful," he said.
