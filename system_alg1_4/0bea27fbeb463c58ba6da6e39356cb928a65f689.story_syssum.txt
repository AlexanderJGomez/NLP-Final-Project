"My strategy has always been to do what I am going to do and focus on my issues," Begich said in an interview with CNN.
Asked about positions he has taken on oil and drilling or on transportation in the 112th Congress, Begich said, "Sometimes I feel like I look around and I look behind me and there aren't many national Democrats there.
Much has been made of liberal Democrats Elizabeth Warren and Tammy Baldwin elected to the Senate last week and both parties being pulled away from the middle, but Begich points out that moderate Democrats Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Donnelly of Indiana also were elected.
Their votes will be dissected even more closely when they are in cycle," Gonzales said.
Democrats may also be emboldened by the way voters in some states last week supported Democrats in the Senate even while voting for GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney.
Landrieu "has run three times in a state that has always had a Republican lean, and her numbers have gone up every single time," Campbell said.
Begich took the same tack -- listing issues like oil and natural gas, drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and transportation -- as his selling points to Alaskan voters.
You always run hard," Begich said.
"Leader Reid has a difficult task and I think the president is going to be looking to define his legacy," Gonzalez said.
Jim Manley, who used to work as the chief spokesman for Reid, said he expects that the majority leader is going to go out of his way to make sure every Democrat feels comfortable with each vote.
Even so, said a confident Begich, he likes where he is two years out from the election.
"I came in with these positions already because that is who I am."
