"This building is going to break so many records," said Kim, whose company is building the $4 billion tower, scheduled to open later this year.
As the project is metaphoric for the strength of Samsung Construction, the company itself symbolizes the growth of South Korea onto the world stage.
Samsung has cornered the market in giant building construction, building the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur and Taipei 101 in Taiwan -- both previous world-record holders.
"Under construction today is about $10 billion" of the project, said Chris Sausser, executive vice president of Gale International.
"The project we're building has been able to attract multinational companies, investors as well as residents."
"We are going to contribute to the global community by action, not talk."
