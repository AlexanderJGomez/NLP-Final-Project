Why?
Most Americans who don't currently go online have never gone online before -- and no one else in their household uses the Internet.
People with disabilities also are more likely to not use the Internet.
One- quarter of U.S. adults live with a disability that interferes with activities of daily life -- and only 54% of these people are Internet users, Pew found.
Having broadband access at home is one of the best ways to get the most benefits (or at least the most use) from the web -- and Pew found that right now 40% of U.S. adults don't have broadband at home.
Even with these gains, however, minorities are still less likely than whites to have home broadband overall.
"Groups that have traditionally been on the other side of the digital divide in basic internet access are now using wireless connections to go online," said the report.
However, a third of these people don't have home broadband -- and their smartphone is the main way they access the internet.
