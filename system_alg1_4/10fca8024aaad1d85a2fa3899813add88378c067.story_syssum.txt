Angelina Jolie, 36, and Brad Pitt, 48, a Hollywood megastar couple since 2005, are engaged, Pitt's representative said Friday.
Jewelry designer Robert Procop of Beverly Hills, California, designed the diamond engagement ring after a yearlong collaboration with Pitt, his representative said.
The couple has six children, including three biological children together.
Pitt earlier had been married to actress Jennifer Aniston.
Despite ongoing reports that Jolie and Pitt began their love affair during the making of 2005's "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" -- while Pitt was still married to Aniston -- Jolie insisted to the UK's Stylist magazine in 2010 that their relationship began after the film.
