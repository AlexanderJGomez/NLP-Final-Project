Anthony Marshall was convicted of bilking millions of dollars from the estate of his mother, Brooke Astor.
Marshall's former lawyer, Francis Morrissey, was convicted of all five counts against him, including forgery and scheming to defraud Astor.
"These defendants, two morally depraved individuals, preyed on a physically and mentally ill 101-year-old woman to steal millions of dollars -- dollars that she had intended to go to help the lives of ordinary New Yorkers," Seidemann said, echoing his closing argument to the jury.
Marshall, who is free on $100,000 bail, faces a maximum 25 years in prison when he is sentenced on December 8.

"Mrs. Astor stood in New York as a symbol of generosity.

"I hope this brings some consolation and closure for the many people, including my grandmother's loyal staff, caregivers and friends, who helped when she was so vulnerable and so manipulated," Philip Marshall wrote.
