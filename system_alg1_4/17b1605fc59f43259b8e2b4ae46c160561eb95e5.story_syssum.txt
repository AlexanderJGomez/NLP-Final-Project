Authorities confirmed three civilian injuries from a growing blaze known as the Station fire burning through the Angeles National Forest-La Canada Flintridge.
The blaze, which grew to more than 20,100 acres, was 5 percent contained early Sunday, officials said.
The fire threatened about 10,000 homes in Los Angeles County and 900 homes were evacuated, she said.
"Basically, all the homes that back up to the National Forest in the La Canada-Flintridge are in danger from the fire," Jorgensen said, adding that fire officials have told residents to be prepared for possible evacuation orders.
The blaze, called the Cottonwood fire, started Thursday afternoon about 10 miles from the southern California city of Hemet, officials reported.
Another fire in the Angeles National Forest had burned more than 2,100 acres.
That fire was about 85 percent contained Friday evening, officials said.
