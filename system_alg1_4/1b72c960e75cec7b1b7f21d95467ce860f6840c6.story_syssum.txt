"Ike is an extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane" with 135-mph  sustained winds, the center said in its 11 p.m.
"It is too early to determine what, if any, land areas might be affected by Ike," the hurricane center said.
ET Monday, Ike was moving west-northwest through the Atlantic Ocean.
But before Ike can reach into the Caribbean or threaten Florida, Tropical Storm Hanna was getting more organized in the Bahamas, according to the hurricane center.
"A hurricane watch may be required for a portion of the southeastern United States coast early Thursday and interests in this area should monitor the progress of Hanna," the hurricane center said.
Florida could begin seeing rainfall from Hanna on Friday, forecasters said.
Many people were still cut off amid floodwater.
In line behind Ike in the Atlantic is Tropical Storm Josephine, with top winds near 50 mph, the hurricane center said.
