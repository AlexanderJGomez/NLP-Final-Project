(CNN) -- In the current nationwide series of Veterans Administration scandals, the real focus has to be on rethinking the system that is failing to serve our veterans and their families.
No one should believe, however, that simply replacing the secretary with a new person will solve the Veterans Administration's problems.
Deming had a bin full of mixed red and white beads.
Trying to fix the VA by replacing the secretary but not the whole system is like trying to obtain white beads by replacing the person dipping blindly into the bin.
There is no bank teller involved.
More than 314,000 work full time for the VA compared to 202,000 in the Marine Corps (potentially shrinking to 150,000--at which point there would be half as many Marines as VA bureaucrats).
Just the size of the VA training system is enormous.
Over 50 percent of all American physicians have had some training in the VA system.
At VA facilities, veterans wait twice that time on average and that understates the problem in especially mismanaged sites.
This means that one out of four veterans in those sites was experiencing a wait more than 12 times longer than the national average.
Every effort to integrate Department of Defense and VA medical record systems has failed.
The DoD and VA spent $1.3 billion to build a joint electronic medical record system for their health care services before the two secretaries announced in February that they were abandoning the effort.
In other words, even though military health costs are growing rapidly and taking up more and more of the DoD budget, the Department is failing to modernize its system and to integrate it with the VA.
They did such a bad job that fewer than 50,000 veterans were getting help out of more than 200,000 wounded veterans from World War I. Forbes stole hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayer money
Now we have to have the courage to develop a system worthy of our veterans, our active duty military and their families for 2021 and beyond.
