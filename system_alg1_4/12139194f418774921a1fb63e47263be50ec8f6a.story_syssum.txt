Now that his party has apparently won the support of his country's voters, Alexis Tsipras has another fight in front of him: making good on his campaign promise to renegotiate the terms of Greece's bailout.
Tsipras, 40, who could become Greece's next prime minister, also vowed to end austerity measures.
"That is a gamble that people in Greece seem to be prepared to take at this point, simply because the terms of its bailout have been so severe," Greek journalist Elinda Labropoulou told CNN on Sunday.
"People went bankrupt since we entered the bailout, poverty is visible across society, and I believe that hope is coming with Syriza's program, not only for Greece, but for all of Europe," she said ahead of the election.
"I got a country on the verge of ruin.
"Our victory is, at the same time, it's a victory for all the people of Europe that are fighting against austerity that's ruining the common European future," he said.
