A brazen attack on a serving soldier in the British army, brutally hacked to death in broad daylight in the southeast district of Woolwich, has sparked fear, anger and a search for answers -- but also moving tributes to the man who died.
"I live very close to where this happened and wanted to light a candle in remembrance for the soldier," she said.
"I am a British soldier myself (and) I wear my wrist band with pride."
Meanwhile in Woolwich itself, resident Felix Rios captured a poignant image of a black flower placed at Woolwich Arsenal train station Thursday morning.
