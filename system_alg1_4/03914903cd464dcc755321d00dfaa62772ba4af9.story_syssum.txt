ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Chicken nuggets.
Teddy has food allergies that can cause anaphylaxis, a deadly condition that can cut off his breathing.
He has to steer clear of milk, eggs, wheat, peanuts and tree nuts -- even places like baseball stadiums where peanut exposure can't be avoided.

And just because a food item was OK last week doesn't mean the recipe hasn't changed.
Teddy saw the cheese when I was unloading the groceries and asked for a slice -- and then another.
Once we get food into the house, we try to label it.
We set out a bin of "Teddy safe" snacks.
There's no Play-Doh.
Teddy's pre-K teachers are great -- they contact us for alternative suggestions when their lesson plans include food products.
I try to always be the "cupcake mom," because I can make cupcakes without milk, eggs or wheat that still taste good.
When someone else brings cakes, I try to find out in advance so I can make a Teddy-safe alternative.
We just don't often get the chance to use convenience foods.
I know that I could just make rice pasta for everyone.
This is why it's nearly impossible for us to get Teddy food at a restaurant.
We're going to talk with the school nurse and cafeteria manager about strategies to keep Teddy safe.
In the lunchroom, Teddy can be watched so that if peanut butter touches him or milk is spilled on him, he will be decontaminated as quickly as possible.
(If milk touches Teddy, he gets hives -- he doesn't even have to ingest it.
We're comforted by the thought of someone with anaphylaxis experience being close to Teddy.
If we'd been handed a list of Teddy's allergies when he was freshly born at the hospital, I think we'd have been overwhelmed.
