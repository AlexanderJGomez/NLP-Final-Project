The 2007 population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau and the United Nations Population Division set China's current population at around 1.3 billion people, and India's at around 1.1 billion.
"There is a substantial body of evidence that the world population will flatten out in about 30 years," he said.
"Built into that model would be an assumption that more of the world's population will become urban, and as such the population will begin to decline."
But the worst-case scenario for people experiencing overpopulation, according to Lawrence Smith, president of the Population Institute, is a lack of fresh, clean water.

Nine billion is an exceptional amount of people, considering the world's population only reached 1 billion in 1830, according to the Population Institute, a nonprofit organization that works to fund population and family planning programs around the world.
"Huge outbreaks," said Allen.
Smith said that 97 percent of world population growth between now and 2050 will occur in the developing world, where governments face serious economic and social challenges.
Globally, Bernstein said the poorest fifth of people in countries with rapid population growth have twice as many children, on average, as the wealthy people in those same countries.
In addition to the growing demands of developing nations, emerging countries like China and India are rapidly industrializing, said Smith.
Traditionally, rural populations are larger than urban populations, said Smith.
"We have never in the history of the world experienced urban growth rates or metropolitan growth rates at the same level that we are experiencing now," said Allen.
