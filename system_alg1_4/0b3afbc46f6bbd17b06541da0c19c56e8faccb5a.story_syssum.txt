Jan Brewer.
Earlier, Brewer told CNN that her decision will come after she returns this week to Arizona from Washington, where she has been attending National Governors Association meetings.
The bill was sent to Brewer on Monday and she has five days to sign it, veto it, or do nothing and it would become law.
Just over a year into her tenure, Brewer rose to national prominence after signing SB1070 into law, a strict immigration measure also known as the "show me your papers" law that allows law enforcement to ask people for legal documents, which critics say leads to racial profiling of Latinos.
Under her, Arizona became one of three states to allow people to carry concealed weapons without a permit.
But her conservative credentials took a bit of a beating last year when she said Arizona would participate in the controversial expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.
Brewer said the state couldn't afford it, and she defended her decision in court.
Where Brewer has a proven record is in the area of Arizona businesses, cutting regulations and taxes.
And Brewer is well liked in the business community.
"We believe she's done more than any governor nationwide to improve the economic competitiveness in her state," said Garrick Taylor, a spokesman for the Arizona Chamber.
Brewer is also facing growing support for a veto.
And according to the local newspaper in Prescott, state Sen. Steve Pierce, who voted for the measure, is now urging Brewer to pick up her veto pen.
A spokesman for the NFL, which will host Super Bowl XLIX, in Glendale next February, said the league is watching developments in Arizona.
