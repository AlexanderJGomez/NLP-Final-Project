But that's how many Mac users are feeling after the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Orbitz was steering Mac users toward higher-priced hotels than PC users, based on spending habits discovered by one of the site's algorithms.
"What we have found is ... that Mac users are 40% more likely to book four- or five-star hotels than PC users," Harford said.
They argued that what Orbitz is doing is unfair and that it is forcing Mac users to take longer or dig deeper for a deal.
You may see different promoted products on many sites depending on whether you're using a mobile app or a desktop.
Orbitz, on the other hand, says it's trying to provide Mac users with the best hotel recommendations based on what other Mac users are choosing.
We are really excited about the potential to use this wisdom ... to make travel better for consumers," he said.
