(CNN) -- Roger Ebert was seldom at a loss for words.
Ebert lost his battle with cancer Thursday.
Like many of his readers, I didn't always agree with Ebert, but I could understand his viewpoint.
Then, watch out, because he would say what many of us might want to.

Freeman was nominated for an Oscar, with Siskel and Ebert's praise probably playing a key role, since the film came and went quickly.
There had been film critics on TV before Siskel and Ebert -- Judith Crist and Gene Shalit among them -- and film criticism had existed since the dawn of the medium.
And, through their TV show, the two approached film criticism the way movie fans, freshly released from a weekend showing at the cineplex, might talk about what they just saw.
Siskel had great contacts; Ebert had a Pulitzer Prize, the first ever awarded a movie critic.
And as "Opening" turned into "Sneak Previews" turned into "At the Movies" turned into "Siskel & Ebert and the Movies," the two became equal parts knockabout vaudeville team -- frequently guesting on Johnny Carson and David Letterman's late-night shows, where their debates were very obviously unscripted -- and influential movie critics, willing to showcase all variety of new releases in a pre-Internet age when middle America wasn't besieged by all manner of movie minutiae and clips weren't a click away.
Ebert changed with the times.
(Ebert finally left the show in 2008, though guest hosts had been filling in since 2006; it was canceled in 2010.)
Ebert was criticized for reviewing a film he'd only seen a portion of.
These days, when pop culture runs through the very capillaries of the Internet, it's easy to knock film critics.
Ebert, as the top of the heap, probably heard his name associated with these thoughts more than most.
"However you came to know me, I'm glad you did and thank you for being the best readers any film critic could ask for," he wrote in his last column, "A Leave of Presence," published Tuesday.
I'll see you at the movies."
