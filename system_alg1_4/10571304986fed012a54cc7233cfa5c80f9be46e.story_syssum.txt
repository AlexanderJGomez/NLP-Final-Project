Every July, at San Diego Comic-Con, voice actors enjoy major celebrity status along with A-list stars who do on-camera acting.
Following CNN's 2012 interviews with several voice actors, John DiMaggio (best known as Bender on "Futurama" and Jake on "Adventure Time") had been finishing work on a documentary that sought to pay tribute to those unsung famous voices behind animated icons.
John DiMaggio: Larry [Shapiro] and I were in Amsterdam for a thing we've been doing for a long time called "Jam in the 'Dam."
Shapiro: You'd see people enjoy John on one level as an emcee, then he would bust out a voice like Bender and you'd see everyone's jaw drop.
It's just a really good group of people and that's what we wanted to show in the film.
Strong: We all know each other and we see each other wherever we go.
DiMaggio: People are starting to recognize me at these conventions, but as soon as I walk away from the convention, people don't really know who I am, which is great because I love flying under the radar.
I didn't get into this business to be famous; I got into this to work.
Some people say, "I want to get into voice acting because I have an interesting voice," but there's so much more to it than that, bringing characters to life through your acting abilities.
Sure, but in the long run, kids don't really care who's doing the voice as long as it's good.
It's an interesting thing that names are coming out of the woodwork.
It's nice to see (voiceover actors) get more recognition, that's for sure.
