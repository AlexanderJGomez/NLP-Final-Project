Each of the five "tree rooms" making up this hotel deep in Sweden's arboreal forest, just south of the Arctic Circle, is designed by a different Swedish architect, and each is suspended up to six meters from the ground.
Each stylishly furnished room sleeps two to four people and -- this is Sweden, after all -- has access to the site's Treesauna.
It sleeps two people, with a huge bed taking up almost the entire space.
Decked out in simple furnishings, each room sleeps between two and four people -- each also has its own wooden terrace, a transparent roof for star gazing and compost toilet at ground level.

Justino's tree house, Fuentes, Castile-La Mancha, Spain
Situated on a private estate, it sleeps up to four people with two bedrooms, a kitchenette and bathroom.
Sleeping between six and eight people in a cozy mezzanine area, each cabin also has a small kitchen, wood-burning stove and lounge area filled with candles, cushions and books -- there's a balcony outside.
Purportedly Europe's tallest tree house is 22 meters up a 250-year-old oriental plane tree above a small waterfall.
Inside Nid d'Aigle ("Eagle's Nest") is a small, simple bedroom with a double bed -- though you'll probably spend most of your time on the south-facing patio, which has predictably wonderful views of the surrounding countryside.
Accessed via suspended bridges and ladders, each tree house, sleeping between two and four, is beautifully decorated with proper beds, sink-into sofas, candles and paintings.
