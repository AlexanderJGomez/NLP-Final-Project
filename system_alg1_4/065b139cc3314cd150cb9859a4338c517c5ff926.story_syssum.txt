There was little publicity for Seattle's first medical marijuana farmers market held on Sunday.
They gained entrance with a recommendation from a health care provider stating that they need marijuana to treat a medical condition.
"Medical marijuana is not legal in the state of Washington," said state Department of Health spokesman Donn Moyer.
But unlike in California or Colorado where medical marijuana initiatives led to an explosion of dispensaries that provide the drug, in Washington the medical marijuana community has remained, for the most part, underground.
"It's a city by city, county by county situation right now," said Philip Dawdy, a spokesman for the Sunday market and medical marijuana advocate who says there is still "an old West" feel to the medical marijuana community in the state.
"This could be construed as dealing drugs," medical marijuana grower Ken Bell said as a line of customers grew in front of his "Ken's Medicine Bowl" stand.
Market organizers said they are hopeful that a bill working its way through Washington's legislature will provide medical marijuana users and growers in the state surer legal footing to operate on.
