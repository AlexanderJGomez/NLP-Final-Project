When Ted finally finished the story for his kids, they called him on it: His story wasn't all about how he met their mother (she was barely in the story), it was about how much he loved Robin.
Robin, of course, had long ago divorced Barney -- the first big shocker of the night.
And what about the mother, aka Tracy?
Of course, the big Robin twist didn't exactly sit well with everyone online (people such as Rocco Horvath @RoccoRacingAMA, who tweeted, "It took me so long to get over the fact Ted and Robin weren't going to end up together and now this?!
Can't stop thinking about it.
Do you wish Tracy had stayed alive and Ted didn't ultimately end up with Robin?
For that matter, what do you think about Barney and Robin splitting up?
