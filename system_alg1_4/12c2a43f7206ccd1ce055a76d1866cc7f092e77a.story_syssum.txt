ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Four prominent neurologists say they cannot see how Sen. Pete Domenici can continue his work as a U.S. senator given his diagnosis with frontotemporal lobar degeneration, a type of dementia.
Dr. David Knopman, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic, says when his patients learn they have FTLD, he tells them it's best to stop working.
But September tests showed the condition had progressed since a checkup in April, he said.
Dr. Bruce Miller, a neurologist at the University of California-San Francisco, says that of the 500 patients he's treated for FTLD, very few have been able to keep working.
A stockbroker wouldn't be able to make the best investments for their clients," he said.
The doctors said first signs of the disease are often very unusual behavior or a change in personality.
"Someone who's usually very adept and in touch with people might suddenly make inappropriate or caustic comments, like they might refer to someone who's overweight as 'fatty,'" Knopman says.
Treatment consists of managing symptoms with medication and in some cases, speech therapy.
