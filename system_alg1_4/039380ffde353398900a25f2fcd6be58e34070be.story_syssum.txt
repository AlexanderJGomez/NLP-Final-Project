Factory allows small start-ups to work on the same campus as more established tech companies, providing a "playground for entrepreneurs and innovators."
The big and important difference between other work spaces and us is that we're stage agnostic so we have later-stage companies or established companies like Mozilla, local heroes like Soundcloud or Wunderkinder, which are role models for younger founders to look up to.
SS: I think what you should do is look at the individual stages of development of the company.
And so I think not only do the founders of those companies invest and engage with early-stage companies, but also they still have to touch base with what they were like a few years ago.
Because if it works really well, they outgrow the space quickly.
So for anyone who wants to be part of that movement, it would make sense to be here.
