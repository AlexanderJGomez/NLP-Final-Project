Lille, France (CNN) -- Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka each faced questions heading into Switzerland's Davis Cup final in France.
I started to feel better as the match went on.
Also encouraging for Federer and the Swiss, Wawrinka thumped a listless Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-1 3-6 6-3 6-2 to begin the day.
"Definitely one of the top three matches in my life," said Monfils, who squandered two match points against Federer at the U.S. Open.
Wawrinka, meanwhile, sparkled against French No.
"I know how to play those matches," Wawrinka said.
For large parts of the affair he targeted Tsonga's backhand with his own sublime one-handed backhand, easily getting the better of the 2008 Australian Open finalist.
Wawrinka stormed to the first set and when he held a break point to begin the second, it appeared as if the Swiss No.
Tsonga smelled blood when Wawrinka trailed 0-30 on serve, but the latter rallied to close out the set -- and the match, realistically -- despite double faulting on one of his set points.
Tsonga was annoyed with his performance but also with the French fans, who he felt weren't vocal enough.
For the time being, Federer isn't ruling himself out of Saturday's doubles.
"Now I'm coming out of the match without any pain, which is good, too," said Federer.
Wawrinka and Federer both aren't scheduled to play doubles but they can be called upon Saturday.
