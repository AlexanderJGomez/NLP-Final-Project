Airline industry experts insist standards of in-flight food are improving.
Not only was this a complaint letter par excellence, but it hit upon one of the most emotive subjects of long-haul air travel: the in-flight meal.
Miller acknowledges that there have been cut backs on catering across short-haul flights and a decline in spending on food in long-haul economy.
Standards have improved firstly as a result of greater competition between airline catering companies, says Miller.
Austrian catering company DO & CO has transformed the food served onboard Austrian Airlines and Turkish Airlines flights.
Good quality airline food not only depends on the quality of raw ingredients, he says, but also the intangible elements of good cuisine.
Airlines also use food as a marketing tool and improve standards to attract premium customers.
Austrian Airlines has won the Skytrax award for Best Business Class Catering for the last two years.
Airlines worldwide also hire celebrity chefs to add prestige to their culinary efforts.
Miller at SkyTrax is skeptical about the true benefits a celebrity chef can bring to onboard catering.
But he does acknowledge that some chefs have influenced a new style of in-flight cuisine.
But on long-haul flights, airlines are restrained in what they can cut.
