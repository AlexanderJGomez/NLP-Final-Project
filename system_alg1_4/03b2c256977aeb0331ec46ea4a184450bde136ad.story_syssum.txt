The last few years have seen a growing shift in the way men are perceived, under the collective weight of celebrity bad boys, stay-at-home dads, written scholarship on the supposed "end of men," an epidemic of male incarceration, two decade-long wars fought mostly by men and a nascent men's movement that is not about proclaiming male power but male capacity for depth and goodness.
We've gone from "Mad Men" to "Men of a Certain Age" in no more than a couple of TV seasons.
Why?
What we know from working with thousands of men in our community of readers and writers is that men are often ashamed to come forward and say they were raped.
For some victims of male attackers, homosexual rape adds a layer of shame and confusion to the violent trauma itself.
Without acknowledgement that rape of men exists, there is less help and support for them to overcome the trauma.
Clearly, there are still far more women who are raped than men.
For men to be thinking hard about how to be better fathers and husbands can only benefit women, as can the acknowledgment that men are all too often victims of rape.
