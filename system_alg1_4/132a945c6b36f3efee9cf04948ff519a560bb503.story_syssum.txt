(CNN) -- Indianapolis is known for Indy 500 car racing and its playoff-worthy Pacers basketball team.
That's because many colleagues who work for federal agencies like the National Science Foundation and NASA have been told to stay home.
There is less communication between program officers and the scientists who carry out the Science Foundation and NASA missions.
Hundreds of thousands of scientists work in the federal government.
But civil service scientists are at a significant competitive disadvantage, thanks to new travel restrictions.
Science is no different.
Government scientists are evaluated regularly, like most of us, and their scientific stature is measured in part by invitations to give talks at international meetings or to help lead those meetings.
Travel policies that diminish the effectiveness of government scientists are counterproductive.
In many disciplines, 10 proposals for new research projects are rejected for every one that is funded.
Astronomy research experiences for undergraduates -- funded by the National Science Foundation, among others -- are an effective way to retain students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math, or STEM, majors.
My own research students study supermassive black holes billions of light years from Earth -- not exactly an issue in daily life, it's true, but while some of those students have pursued careers as astronomers, many have gone into other areas, including theoretical physics, high school science teaching, oceanography, energy, veterinary school, the financial industry and computing, contributing in important ways to the STEM enterprise.
So our short-sighted policies are preventing government scientists from conducting the best possible research, not to mention losing U.S. leadership in important international efforts.
