(CNN) -- "The sequester is coming, the sequester is coming," cries Chicken Little, speaking of the across-the-board spending reductions set to kick in next Friday.
Here's why:
This year, the sequester would slow the growth in federal spending by just $85 billion, from an expected, pre-sequester budget of $3.64 trillion -- less than a 2.3% reduction.
Because of ongoing contracts and the Byzantine labyrinth of federal budgeting, only $44 billion of that $85 billion will actually be cut from this year's budget.
It is true that the cuts are not spread equally across all types of federal spending.
That would leave domestic discretionary spending, after adjusting for inflation, at roughly the same level as 2009.
In fact, defense spending would really be cut, in the sense of actually spending less, over the next two years.
Keeping all this in perspective, over the entire 10-year period covered by the sequester, defense spending would average roughly $100 billion more each year (after adjusting for inflation) than we spent at the height of the cold war.
If our economy can't survive spending cuts of that size, we truly are Greece.
This will be hard on some communities that depend heavily on government spending, and even harder on those workers directly affected.
Given that the private sector generally puts those resources to a more productive use, it is likely that government spending destroys more jobs over the long run than it creates.
But let's not be distracted by fairy tales about how the sky is falling.
