Gene Seymour says we want to relive Michael Jackson's youth, not the sad and bizarre aspects of his later life.
As with most things you neither expected nor wanted to hear, you thought that there had to be more to it than what was being said.
The commentariat presumed it had a responsibility to poke those embers for clues of something beyond the single, dreadful fact of Jackson's death.
Let us see that transfiguring moment 15 years later at the Motown Anniversary TV special when Jackson seized dominion over the pop firmament with his shattering, moon-walking recital of "Billie Jean."
We wanted the videos -- "Beat It," "Bad," "Thriller," "Black and White" and all that incredible, unearthly dancing.
As surely as he was the King of Pop, Jackson was also a high priest of wish fulfillment.
And Michael Jackson, in the early 1980s, was a pop phenomenon powerful enough to pool together previously polarized audiences -- heavy metal, disco, funk -- and get them all on the same bandwagon.
Jackson's off-stage public diffidence gave the impression that his transformations of both self and society were all happening by off-hand magic.
But time (by far, Jackson's worst and most formidable enemy) couldn't stop even his most devoted admirers from wondering what drove him to change his appearance so drastically over the years.
If he'd been able to stop the clock at 1985 or even 1987 (the year of "Bad"), life would have been so much easier.
However divided (or worse) we may have felt about Michael Jackson at the end, we cherish how he brought out the best in us at the beginning.
