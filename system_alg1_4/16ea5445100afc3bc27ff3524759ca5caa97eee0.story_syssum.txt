(CNN)Kenji Goto had every reason to stay home in Japan.
The experienced journalist explained why in a video shot in October from southern Turkey.
It's enough," the 47-year-old Goto explained.
Al Zaim recalled telling Goto, "It's not safe for you."
I am Japanese," Goto said, according to Al Zaim, "I can go."
Goto covered big news stories for years, hoping that by telling them he could make a difference in the world.
While there, Goto came to know another Japanese man, a 42-year-old aspiring security contractor Haruna Yukawa.
In it, the ISIS militant gives the Japanese government a choice to pay $200 million -- the same amount of money Prime Minister Shinzo Abe recently pledged for those "contending" with ISIS -- to free the Japanese men within 72 hours.
On Saturday, the latest ISIS video showed the masked man blaming Japan's humanitarian support of coalition efforts in Iraq and Syria for Goto's apparent beheading.
Japan's government insisted it did everything within reason that it could to bring Goto home safely.
Now, after working "tirelessly behind the scenes," she went public to "beg the Jordanian and Japanese governments to understand that the fates of both (Goto and  al-Kaseasbeh) are in their hands."

While Goto's decision to go to Syria surprised his mother, his rationale did not.
And now Goto has become a victim in a war, a fact that's tearing Ishido apart.
