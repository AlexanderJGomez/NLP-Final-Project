Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Nine people killed in a military action targeting militants in eastern Afghanistan apparently were members of an insurgent network, a U.S. military official told CNN on Tuesday.
Coalition forces said they killed their targets, he said, but a delegation sent by the governor to investigate reported the civilian casualties.
The United Nations in Afghanistan said on Tuesday that from January to October of this year, 1,404 deaths have been caused by insurgents; 465 have been caused by pro-government forces, such as NATO's International Security Assistance Force; and other causes have led to 165 civilian deaths.
The U.S. military source said it was "a joint operation with Afghan and U.S.
"It is better to miss a target than to cause civilian casualties," he said.
