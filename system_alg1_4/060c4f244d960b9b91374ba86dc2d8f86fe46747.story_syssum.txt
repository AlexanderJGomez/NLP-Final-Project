Naghmeh Abedini said that her husband, Saeed Abedini, went to Iran to build an orphanage but was imprisoned unjustly because of his Christian beliefs.
U.S. President Barack Obama pushed for the release of Abedini and two other detained Americans --  Robert Levinson and Amir Hekmati -- when he spoke on the phone with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in September.
Abedini's case was not brought up at recent negotiations on an interim nuclear deal with Iran.
Naghmeh Abedini told lawmakers Thursday that when U.S. and Iranian officials met to discuss the nuclear deal, the U.S. had a "perfect" opportunity to ask for the pastor's release.
She said that it was a heartbreaking moment to be without her husband and that as Christmas approaches, she is praying for her husband and praying that her government realizes "how far we've fallen" with negotiating with Iran without pushing more to secure her husband's freedom.
His wife said that the orphanage he was in Iran to set up had the approval of the Iranian government.
At that time, Iran was ruled under a different government.
Her father, who is still in Iran, has been able to visit the pastor, it says.
On November 3, the pastor was transferred to Rajai Shahr prison, the statement said, where he has been repeatedly robbed at knifepoint.
Naghmeh Abedini said her father showed her husband pictures of the couple's two children when he visited him in prison.
"Saeed would just stare at the pictures the entire time for the few short minutes they were able to talk," her statement says.
... it will be a very difficult Christmas scene..." she said.
"...it's not just for my husband, it's for my kids.
He has been jailed in Iran since 2011, accused of being a CIA spy.
He finished his service four years later as a decorated combat veteran with tours in Iraq.
