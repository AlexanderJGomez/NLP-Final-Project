For the first time in 25 years, the state of Massachusetts has an open Senate seat.
Massachusetts is essentially a one-party state.
Massachusetts law requires a special election for Kennedy's seat to be held within 160 days.
Just last week, Kennedy urged that the law be changed to allow the governor to appoint a temporary replacement until the special election could be held.
Rep. Ed Markey, a 17-term congressman from north of Boston, ran for Kerry's Senate seat in 1984.
Why?
Rep. Mike Capuano, now in his sixth term from Somerville, currently has the seat once held by President Kennedy and House Speaker Tip O'Neill.
Former Rep. Marty Meehan, now the chancellor of the University of Massachusetts at Lowell, has almost $5 million in contributions at his disposal that could be used for a Senate run.
Massachusetts Democrats might, however, decide it's time to turn the political page by sending a woman to the U.S. Senate.
Former Rep. Joe Kennedy, who held Capuano's seat from 1987 to 1999, may also try to launch a political comeback on the strength of the current wave of emotion and nostalgia.
Massachusetts may be headed for its most hotly contested Senate race in at least a quarter century.
