(CNN) -- A California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) employee who allegedly wrote a letter to a transgender woman and condemned her to hell has resigned, officials said Thursday.
According to Yust and her attorney, the DMV employee used her confidential personal information to send the letter.
George Valverde, director of the DMV, in a statement Thursday said the employee "acted well outside the course and scope of his duties.
The DMV employee went through a discipline process and received sensitivity training and counseling after that incident, Marando said.
It asks for damages in excess of $25,000.
