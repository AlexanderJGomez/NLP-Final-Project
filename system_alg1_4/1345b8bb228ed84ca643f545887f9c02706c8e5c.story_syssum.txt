(CNN) -- Federal prosecutors in California announced a series of actions Friday targeting what they characterized as the "large, for-profit marijuana industry" that has developed since the state legalized medical marijuana for select patients 15 years ago.
Wagner, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of California, told reporters Friday that federal authorities "are not focused on backyard grows with small amounts of marijuana by seriously ill people.
And Birotte, from California's central district, said a chief problem lies in operations that make money not by selling marijuana to the sick, but to relatively healthy people.
"What today's actions did, if nothing else, is to reinforce the terrific disconnect between the federal government and not only the general population, but the 16 states and the District of Columbia that have chosen to get away from the prohibition of medical marijuana," said St. Pierre.
Wagner claimed that people, "often with criminal records, are coming to California to set up marijuana operations taking advantage of the lax enforcement environment in this state."
But he said that all should be "on notice" that their property could be seized under federal law.
St. Pierre said one open question is whether what's happened in California signals that federal authorities will proceed to other states with the intent of cracking down on any who grow or sell medical marijuana.
He argued that some industry and dispensary model was needed, saying it wasn't realistic to force sick people to grow their own marijuana or to limit the places where they can get it.
