One blast occurred at Suvarnabhumi Airport at 5 a.m. (2200 Tuesday GMT), an airport official said.
Three protesters also entered the airport's control tower, demanding the prime minister's flight schedule, The Associated Press quoted Group Capt.
Suvarnabhumi Airport later canceled all flights, AP reported.
On Tuesday thousands of anti-government protesters partially shut down Suvarnabhumi Airport, the country's main airport, an airport spokesman said.
The clash started when the anti-government group People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) was mobilizing supporters near the Don Muang airport, which the government is using as its temporary office.
The PAD has been leading protests against the government since May, accusing the government of being a front for ousted former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.
The case was one of several lodged against Thaksin, who protesters want to return to Thailand to face trial.
