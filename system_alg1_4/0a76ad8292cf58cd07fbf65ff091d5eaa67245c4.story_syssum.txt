The body of Cher Hughes, a native of suburban St. Louis, Missouri, was found Tuesday on the property of William Adolfo Cortez Reese, who is suspected in her death, said Javier Carrillo, director of the national police investigation unit.
He said Panamanian authorities are attempting to reach police in Holland.
"We believe the motive is that he (William Cortez) is killing people to take their property," Carrillo said.
He said his dog led authorities to a shallow grave, where they found Hughes' body.
