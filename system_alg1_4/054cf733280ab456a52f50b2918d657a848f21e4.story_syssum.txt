That's when Congress passed, and President Reagan signed into law, the Immigration Reform and Control Act, which married border control and the legalization of millions of illegal immigrants.
Reformers today are misguided to seek a similar "grand bargain" on immigration.
The Immigration Reform and Control Act, the bill resulting from the 1986 grand bargain, proved to be a spectacular failure.
But the 1986 grand bargain taught today's immigration restrictionists a simple lesson: Don't make any more grand bargains.
Big changes start with small steps.
Similarly, immigration reformers must start with the strongest claims to legalization: students and soldiers.
Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, and Richard Lugar, R-Indiana, introduced the "DREAM" act in 2009 to offer legal status to these young people who were brought here as children and finished college or two years of military service.
Supporters of comprehensive reform and legalization worry that the DREAM act will take away the impetus for further reform and benefit only a fraction of the illegal immigrants in the United States.
Border control and enforcement, like legalization, needs to move forward incrementally and be paired with a scaled-down sweetener: DREAM.
Legalization forces can get DREAM, but they must also support increased border enforcement.
