She said she thought she was going to die as her car crashed into the concrete and plunged into the water.
I thought I was going to sink with my car," she said from her hospital bed Friday, her left shoulder bearing the bruised imprint of a seatbelt.
She said she looked back, and her car was gone.

More than 100 people were injured Wednesday when the Interstate 35W bridge collapsed into the Mississippi River.
Investigators tracked her down Friday morning at her workplace, Sheriff Rich Stanek said.
The Minneapolis Fire Department recovered the fifth body from the bridge decking, he said.
At least 100 people have come to hospitals with injuries, said Dr. John Hick of the Hennepin County Medical Center.
Friday morning's recovery effort went more smoothly than anticipated, Stanek said.
Stanek said National Transportation Safety Board investigators had told him that 60 vehicles were visible at the collapse site.
"When you go over there, it's quite heart-wrenching," he said Friday morning.
"God bless you all," she said.
President Bush, who on Thursday pledged federal aid to rebuild the bridge, will visit the disaster site Saturday.
