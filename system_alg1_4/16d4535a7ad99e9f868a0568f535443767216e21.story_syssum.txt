Evidence indicates Betty Parente and the two daughters died from blunt-force trauma and asphyxiation, said Baltimore County Police Chief Jim Johnson.
"Baltimore County Police has learned of allegations that William Parente may be involved in questionable financial dealings," Johnson said.
They were due to check out Monday, Johnson said, but failed to do so.
The bodies of Betty Parente and the two daughters were found on a king-size bed in the hotel room, while William Parente's body was found in the bathroom, police said.
Michael Hill said the older daughter might have been killed after she returned to the room and found her mother and sister dead.
There was no evidence they were restrained, Johnson said.
Hill said police believe the family was together Sunday morning for breakfast, and they know what time the card key was last used to unlock the room.
She also volunteered through the college's Center for Community Service and Justice.
