Not the man, not his music.
This would allow them -- in the words of the official announcement from AMI Entertainment Network -- to "play music right from your seat.

Every person with a smartphone already has, in essence, a personal jukebox in his or her pocket -- what's the need for real jukeboxes if everyone has an infinite and portable selection of music available at all times?
For starters, is it really such a burden to stand up and walk the few feet to a jukebox?
Jukeboxes, though ... well, jukeboxes were never meant to be regarded from a distance.
What could be simpler: Head over to the jukebox, commune with its list of songs, feed it some money, listen to the music you've chosen.
If you don't have a Megatouch Live account, you can create one from within the app.
There was an exceptional one in the first-floor bar of a long-gone Holiday Inn in Kansas City, where Aerosmith's "Dream On," when it first came out, sounded almost as good as hearing the band play the song live; a jukebox in a bowling alley called Wally's Seymour Bowl in Seymour, Wisconsin, had an especially crisp-sounding version of Alan Jackson's twang-and-power-chord remake of "Mercury Blues."
There is, at least symbolically, a throwback aspect to the app plan: Americans who are old enough may remember the little wall-box jukeboxes that were mounted next to booths in some restaurants, for the convenience of customers in mid-meal.
Let people, at their homes, in their cars, at their offices play personal music on their phones to their hearts' content.
Now, that would be something worth getting out of your seat to see.
