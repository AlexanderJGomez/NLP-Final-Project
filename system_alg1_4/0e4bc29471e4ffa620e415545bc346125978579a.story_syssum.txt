I wouldn't want to go onto another Games because this has been as good as it can get at an Olympics," says Chris Hoy, Britain's champion cyclist.
Hoy completed his Olympic odyssey with victory in the Keirin on the final day of competition in the velodrome last Tuesday -- a win which preceded an emotional medal ceremony.
So I think I knew when I got up there (on the podium) that it was going to be emotional moment for me," Hoy told CNN.
Human stories, that's what makes the Games special," Hoy said.
