Three older students pummeling a 13-year-old boy in a school bus, leaving him with a broken arm.
Three teenagers appeared in a juvenile court Tuesday in Gulfport, Florida.
The third, the alleged ring leader, is facing an additional robbery charge for allegedly stealing money from the victim after the beating.
The three accused teenagers will be back in court on August 27.
The driver of the bus, John Moody, has said he was "petrified" during the attack and has experienced nightmares about it since.
