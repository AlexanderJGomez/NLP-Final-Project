Police in Dublin, east of Oakland, said Hammer was in a vehicle with expired registration and he was not the registered owner.
Hammer -- a rap and dance icon in the late 1980s and 1990s -- was arrested on suspicion of resisting an officer and obstructing an officer in the performance of his duties, according to police spokesman Herb Walters.
Hammer, 50, was booked and released on bail from Santa Rita Jail, Walters said.
Hammer performed "Too Legit to Quit," which was released more than 20 years ago.
