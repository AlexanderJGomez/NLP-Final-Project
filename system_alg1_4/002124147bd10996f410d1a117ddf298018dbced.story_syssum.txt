The sickening execution, recorded and released online for the world to see, came with a warning to the U.S.: ISIS showed another captive American journalist, believed to be Steven Sotloff, and threatened to kill him too if the U.S. does not stop helping those fighting to stop ISIS advances.
First, obviously, it cannot give into ISIS threats and must continue helping dislodge ISIS from northern Iraq where it is engaging in ethnic cleansing against Christians and other minorities; kidnapping, raping and selling women; and massacring people.
There are few people on Earth who are not horrified by ISIS.
ISIS is the enemy of anyone who does not belong to ISIS.
The U.S. should seek a U.N. resolution declaring that the international community, including the Muslim world, considers ISIS and its methods repugnant.
Before ISIS, we knew that human beings are capable of unspeakable brutality.
When ISIS calls itself a state, it is not hyperbole by very much.
If Osama bin Laden weren't dead, he would die of envy.
That the man who murdered him might have been British should erase any remaining fantasy in the West that this gruesome war, now raging in Syria and Iraq, will stay within any country's or any region's borders.
There have been reports of hundreds, even thousands, of Europeans training, fighting and killing alongside ISIS.
Graduates of the Syria war, from where ISIS pushed into Iraq, have killed in Europe.
And ISIS ideology is gaining support in the continent.
It is politically and strategically complicated, because ISIS is also fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Hezbollah, and defeating ISIS would also be enormously pleasing to Iran.
That suffering has now extended to Iraq, and it will only become more widespread if ISIS is not stopped.
