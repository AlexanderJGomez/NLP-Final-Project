The report noted "missed opportunities" by Lanza's  mother, the school district, and multiple health care providers.
The authors of the report relied on extensive documentation and interviews with Lanza's educators and doctors, as well as email exchanges between Lanza and his parents, to make their determinations and recommendations.
He was anorexic, the report said, and weighed only 112 pounds the day he died, despite being 6 feet tall.
Despite sharing her worries about her son's condition with friends, the report said it does not appear Lanza's mother, Nancy Lanza, communicated any concerns to mental health or medical professionals in her final months.
It was during this late elementary school period that major mental health red flags were raised, the report said.
Warning signs like the book and Lanza's increasing anxiety were improperly addressed by Lanza's mother and educators, the report said.
The report concluded that a pattern of accommodation to Lanza's mental health conditions -- rather than addressing his underlying needs -- by Nancy Lanza and certain health care providers, exacerbated Lanza's mental status.
The report ultimately determines that Lanza's mental health issues may have extended past autism to include anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and suicidal disorder.
The report also noted that it appeared Nancy Lanza made no effort to curtail her son's access to guns in the house in the months leading up to the shooting, despite Adam's severe mental deterioration.
