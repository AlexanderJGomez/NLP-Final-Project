While the majority of the 15,000 crowd packed inside Court Philippe Chatrier roared their home favorite Gael Monfils at every opportunity, their hopes of a French champion were extinguished once again.
The Frenchman, playing to the crowd, took the next two sets 6-4 6-1 before imploding when the tie looked his for the taking.
Murray, who seemed to thrive on the partisan nature of the contest, eased to a 6-4 6-1 lead and seemingly had the match all wrapped up.
The third was more competitive with the home crowd urging the World No.28 to respond and take the contest into a fourth set.
He claimed the fourth set 6-1 and appeared set to apply the coup de gr√¢ce.
He swept Monfils away with disdain -- 6-0 to secure the match, finish the contest and throw down the gauntlet to his next opponent -- champion Rafael Nadal.
After a slow start in which he conceded the first set 6-4, Nadal hit back to take the next three sets 6-4 6-0 6-1.
The 26-year-old, ranked 27, proved too good for Italy's Sara Errani as she carved out a 6-2 6-2 victory.
Petkovic, who is the first German lady to reach the semifinals since Steffi Graf in 1999, now faces a showdown with Romania's Simona Halep.
Halep, ranked fourth in the world, won the junior event on the clay in 2008 and is now hoping to do the double by winning the French Open proper.
I played really well and stuck to my gameplan," she told reporters.
