A hat and glittery glove represent Michael Jackson at the Apollo Theater tribute.
"I'm so happy about the outpouring of love and the crowd and the people.
Fans have been gathering outside the theater since last week to remember Jackson, who at age 9 won a 1967 Apollo amateur night showcase with his brothers in the group the Jackson 5.
But in later years, he was known more for a roller-coaster personal life, including extensive plastic surgery, financial woes and a 1995 trial and acquittal on child-molestation charges.
"Michael wasn't no freak," Sharpton said.
Sharpton said the theater was home to "the best and the baddest."
"You've got to come from the stage of the Apollo and go all over the world to understand Michael," Sharpton said.
Jackson at the time "was a sweet little boy," he said.
