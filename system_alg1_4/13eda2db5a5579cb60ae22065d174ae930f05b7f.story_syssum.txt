(CNN) -- A Georgia youth football coach who made disparaging  comments on Facebook about ethnic groups and women wants to continue coaching and hopes people accept his apology, his attorney said Wednesday.
Blake Fleming, a parent of a player in the association, told HLN Wednesday night that he heard complaints from other parents earlier this fall and sent complaints to officials.
Attorney Chris McClurg, who said he also has been Samuelson's friend for about five years, said the coach made a public apology and "is a nice guy" who made "insensitive" remarks.
My personal observation is that those fishheads still eat with chopsticks.
It took Western ingenuity to invent the fork.
"He wants to move on," said McClurg, indicating Samuelson was not available for comment Wednesday.
Samuelson hopes to continue coaching at Brookwood next year, McClurg said.
"Frank is loved by all those kids," the attorney said.
