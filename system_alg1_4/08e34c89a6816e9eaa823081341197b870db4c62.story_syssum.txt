(CNN) -- At first, Miguel Hernandez thought it was a mistake, or worse, a joke.
More likely, Hernandez was one of hundreds of undocumented immigrants released from detention because of looming budget cuts set to take effect Friday absent congressional action.
The decision was made by career ICE employees, an administration official told CNN.
An exact number of released detainees has not been released; ICE characterized it as "several hundred."
"Detainees with serious criminal histories are a detention priority and have not been released," she said.
Hernandez said he believes some of those released with him are repeat offenders who have been previously deported.
Most were given a paper with a court date, but not Hernandez.
Hernandez said he doesn't understand what all the fuss is about.
