"I was born a fashion designer" she says, and soon after she set up shop, her clothes acquired a reputation for their bold use of pattern and intricate stitching.
Cooper took up the "Fusion Journey" challenge to travel from New Zealand to New Delhi, India's capital.
Trelise Cooper: I absolutely adore the historical aspect of clothing.
From one village to the next you find whole families, generations, that have their own specialties of stitch work.
So in one sense, I've been fusing my clothes with Indian influences for a while.
However, I think this was the first time I've traveled to India with a conscious intention to create a fusion of styles: their own traditional dress with my more modern, western creations.
In fact, when it comes to bold use of colors and the use of these rich, deep dyes, how can anyone deny the huge influence of India on fashion around the world?
There were ideas there, old and new, that I'd never thought about.
However, what I took back to New Zealand, was their techniques, their intense celebratory colors, their detailed embellishments, their expert use of beads and sequins.
But I'll only know I have finished the creative process when someone comes in and says that, no matter what, they have to have it.
