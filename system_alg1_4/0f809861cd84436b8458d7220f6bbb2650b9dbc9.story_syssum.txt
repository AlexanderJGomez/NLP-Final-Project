(CNN) -- As investigators in Georgia looked into the death of a 22-month-old boy left seven hours in a sweltering SUV, they seized computers from the father's office, a source with knowledge of the investigation told HLN's Nancy Grace.
Police in Cobb County, just outside Atlanta, have been tight-lipped and haven't said whether what they found on the computer is one of the reasons they arrested Harris.
Justin Harris, 33, won't be allowed out of the Cobb County Jail to attend, sheriff's office spokeswoman Nancy Bodiford said.
Harris, who worked as a web designer, has been placed on unpaid administrative leave, she said.
"The chain of events that occurred in this case does not point toward simple negligence, and evidence will be presented to support this allegation," said Cobb County Police Chief John House.
On the day Cooper died, Harris stopped for breakfast at a fast-food restaurant and afterward strapped his son into a rear-facing child restraint seat on his SUV's back seat, police said.
But that day, police said, Harris left him in the car seat.
When it became clear Cooper was dead, Harris was so inconsolable police had to restrain him.
The organization says its tally is likely incomplete and much lower than the real toll.
Another, set up at YouCaring.com, has raised more than $22,000 for the Harris family.
"Please don't listen to the media.
As Harris sits in jail, his wife, Leanna, would not discuss the case with the media.
