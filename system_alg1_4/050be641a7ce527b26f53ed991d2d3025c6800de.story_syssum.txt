When Parker arrived in Kenya as a young missionary, he befriended Jay Hindson, a fellow development worker who introduced him to a bridge build in 1996.

Since 1997, Parker has helped build 45 bridges in Kenya.

"A bridge is a beautiful metaphor for many things.
There are bridges of hope, bridges of peace, bridges of life.
