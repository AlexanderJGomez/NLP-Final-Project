Already this month 11 people have been killed by lightning in the U.S.
"Lightning is very random in terms of fatalities," National Weather Service lightning safety expert John Jensensius told CNN.
Summer is the deadliest season for lightning strikes because of the frequency of thunderstorms and the fact that more people are outdoors.
That's because all the people killed by lightning in the U.S. so far this year -- and the 28 killed in 2008 -- were outdoors.
More than 400 people in the U.S. are hit by lightning each year, according to the National Weather Service.
But Florida does not receive the most lightning in the world.
No.
