(CNN)Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has called for a "religious revolution," asking Muslim leaders to help in the fight against extremism.
"We need a revolution of the self, a revolution of consciousness and ethics to rebuild the Egyptian person -- a person that our country will need in the near future," the President said.
Impossible that this thinking -- and I am not saying the religion -- I am saying this thinking," el-Sisi said.
It's antagonizing the entire world!
By all accounts, he's quite comfortable with the prevailing leadership of the Azhari establishment.
"If anything, he wants to empower it further in order to push forward a counternarrative against radical Islamism.
We will love each other," el-Sisi said in that speech.
