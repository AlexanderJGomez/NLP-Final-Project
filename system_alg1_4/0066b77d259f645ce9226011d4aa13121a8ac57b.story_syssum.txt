Beck recently came out as transgender.
Though she's felt trapped in the wrong body since grade school, Beck didn't come out until after she left the military in 2011.
Doing so earlier would have been too big a risk.
Beck says she doesn't need people to love, or even like, her.
Beck explains her years of hiding as living like an onion.
"It is a constant, but as you suppress and as you bottle it up, it's not like on that surface," she said.
... Maybe I could cure myself."
Though her identity was hidden, the rest of what Beck offered was true.
