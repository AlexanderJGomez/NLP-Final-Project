Elizabeth Alexander says poetry can help solve problems by looking at them from a fresh angle.
After the president's speech, Elizabeth Alexander will read a poem she is writing for the occasion.
Her father is Clifford Alexander, secretary of the Army in the Carter administration, and her mother teaches history at George Washington University.
Alexander: I think that the fact that President-elect Obama has decided to have a poem in this ceremony is a wonderful affirmation to the power of language, the way in which poetry gives us distilled and mindful and careful language that can both give us a moment of pause, a moment of contemplation and that can also ... look at the world from a slightly different angle.
...
Alexander: By writing and teaching.
Alexander: It's amazing, isn't it?
I can't tell you how many older people have said to me, "I never thought I'd live to see this day."
...
Alexander: I do believe that it can.
Alexander: That would be fun.
Alexander: I show it to my husband [artist Ficre Ghebreyesus] , and he is my first, last and best critic.
Alexander: I think what I was trying to say is that at the end of the day, demographics doesn't really tell you about how your work is going to be received.
Alexander: Two sons, 9 and 10.
Alexander: They are so excited, and that's of course a lovely thing.
Alexander: Can you imagine?
