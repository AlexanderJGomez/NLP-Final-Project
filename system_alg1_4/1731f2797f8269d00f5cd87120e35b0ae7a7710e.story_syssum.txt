Shortly after Clinton won reelection in 1996, White House aide Gene Sperling drafted a 14-page memo to begin identifying "legacy goals" for the President on major policy issues.
In a 1993 memo on a planned public hearing with then first lady Hillary Clinton to push her proposed health care reforms, aides Alexis Herman and Mike Lux wrote the event would protect the administration from accusations of being closed to outside opinion.
"Some testifiers should be average people with horror stories, middle-class families worried about the future, and senior citizens," the aides wrote.
His staff also could talk tough, as shown by memos responding to a draft text of Clinton's December 15, 1994, speech following disastrous mid-term elections for Democrats.
The 55 documents totaling more than 4,000 pages released Friday by the William J. Clinton Presidential Library were the second batch of Clinton White House papers made public in recent weeks.
While the Presidential Records Act established public ownership of White House documents as far back as the Reagan administration, it specified that documents pertaining to federal appointments as well as confidential correspondence between the president and his advisers could be withheld from the public for 12 years after a president leaves office.
