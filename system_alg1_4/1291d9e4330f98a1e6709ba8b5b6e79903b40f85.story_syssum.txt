The manhunt for Eric Matthew Frein, accused of killing a Pennsylvania state trooper, is over.
"We just thought it was fitting," State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said.
In the end, he gave up without a fight.
The squad of 13 U.S. marshals -- armed like a military special operations squad -- found Frein at an abandoned airport near Tannersville, authorities said.
And he wasn't armed at the time of his capture, according to police, much to the relief of authorities who feared a violent showdown.
"He's been stashing food, he's been staying out in the woods," Noonan said.
"He had a lot of locations he knew how to hide in.
Tonkin, the district attorney, said he plans to seek the death penalty.
Tom Corbett said he expects authorities to make sure Frein stays safe.
After his arrest, Frein made statements implicating himself in the shootings, according to a law enforcement official who was briefed on the capture.
Authorities have not discussed a motive but have said Frein has talked and written about hating law enforcement.
"Eric Frein had a mission that was to attack law enforcement," Noonan said.
There was no indication that anyone was helping Frein, who was "quite well-prepared," Noonan said.
But with Frein in custody, the trick-or-treating will go on as normal, said Barrett Township Board Chairman Ralph Megliola.
Megliola said.
We are so proud of our Pennsylvania State Police, their hard work," another said.
