"I saw a very old man eating his own human waste for food," Krishnan said.
Krishnan was visiting a temple in the south Indian city of Madurai in 2002 when he saw the man under a bridge.
"That spark and that inspiration is a driving force still inside me as a flame -- to serve all the mentally ill destitutes and people who cannot take care of themselves," Krishnan said.

Krishnan's day begins at 4 a.m.
He says many of the homeless seldom know their names or origins, and none has the capacity to beg, ask for help or offer thanks.
"I get this energy from the people.
I want to save my people."
Krishnan sleeps in Akshaya's modest kitchen with his few co-workers.
After coming back home, my mother said, 'You feed all those people, the rest of the lifetime I am there, I will feed you.'
I want to live with my people."
