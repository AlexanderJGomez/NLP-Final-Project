(CNN) -- The legacy of U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy, who died on Tuesday, spreads far and wide, and across the ocean to now-independent Bangladesh.
But Kennedy stood up to the Nixon administration in 1971 and alerted the world to the bloodshed that was engulfing then-East Pakistan.
The United States turned a blind eye to reports of atrocities committed by the Pakistani army to suppress the independence movement -- even as U.S. diplomats urged the administration to speak up.
Our government has failed to denounce atrocities," Consul General Archer Blood wrote in one of many telegrams from Dhaka to the U.S. State Department questioning American policy.
The report, "Crisis in South Asia," spoke of "one of the most appalling tides of human misery in modern times."
America's heavy support of Islamabad is nothing short of complicity in the human and political tragedy of East Bengal."
Two months later -- in February 1972 -- Kennedy flew to Bangladesh and delivered a speech at Dhaka University, where the killing rampage had begun a year earlier.
In his speech, Kennedy drew parallels between the liberation of Bangladesh and the American Revolution.
During his visit, Kennedy planted a new tree there.
