Malaysian authorities apparently did not check the stolen documents on an international law enforcement agency database, CNN has learned.
Malaysian officials said they were aware of reports that the Italian's passport was also stolen but had not confirmed it.
The police official said that Maraldi had reported his passport stolen in Malaysia last August and had obtained a new one.
The names of the persons whose passports were stolen have been circulated and checked, the official said.
Earlier Saturday, an official said FBI agents were heading to the area.
CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director, was told by sources at Interpol, which keeps a database of lost or stolen travel documents, that the stolen Italian passport was in the agency's database.
Referring to the stolen documents, Fuentes added, "You wonder who was using it?
A U.S. intelligence official said authorities had established "no nexus to terrorism yet although that's by no means definitive.
In the United States, Fuentes said, passports are routinely checked against the Interpol database.
Schiavo also expressed surprise that two potentially stolen passports may have been used to board the flight.
"It's rare that you have one stolen passport, much less two stolen passports on a flight.
"For a stolen passport, stolen two years ago -- these visas only last for a certain amount of time.
No one is sure what happened to the plane.
"Of course, you also have to look at in that part of the world and around the world there is still a potential for a terrorist act or an intentional act that could have rendered the airplane incapacitated," he said.
