Michelle Phillips, Denny Doherty and John Phillips, here in 1998, were members of the Mamas & the Papas.
The band's lead male singer, Denny Doherty, later had an affair with Michelle; she was forced out of the group for a time.
John Phillips, the band's primary songwriter, was at least six years older than the others and did not shy from the task of addressing the group's pain and confusion in song.
"One doesn't try to hold Cass and Denny and Michelle together," he said in a 1995 interview.
There was a 1971 reunion that produced the contractually obligated album "People Like Us," but the experience was "horrible," John Phillips recalled in the liner notes to the group's anthology, "The History of the Mamas and the Papas."
Michelle and John Phillips divorced in 1970; late that year, Michelle was married to Dennis Hopper for eight days.
By that point, daughter Mackenzie says, she was also a full-blown drug addict.
According to Mackenzie Phillips, the affair with her father lasted 10 years.
A part of me died when I found out."
John Phillips also underwent rehab but struggled for the rest of his life.
Mackenzie Phillips appeared on the show Wednesday.
