In a career spanning the last half of the 1900s, Sutherland twice won a Grammy for best classical performer, in 1961 and 1981.
Her stage career began in 1951 in her native Sydney in a production of "Judith" by Eugene Goossens, according to a spokesman with her recording company, Decca Records.
Her record company credits her with rising to international stardom in 1959 when she appeared in Franco Zefirelli's Covent Garden production of Donizetti's "Lucia di Lammermoor."
During retirement, she mentored young singers and sat as a juror on international signing competitions.
She is survived by her husband; her son Adam and daughter-in-law Helen; and two grandchildren, Natasha and Vanya.
