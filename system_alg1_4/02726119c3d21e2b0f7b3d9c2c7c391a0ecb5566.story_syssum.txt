Time said Bernanke was the reason the U.S. financial crisis wasn't worse.
Michael Grunwald, who authored Time's article, on Wednesday told NBC's "Today" that "basically [Bernanke] saw what looked like another depression coming, and he decided he would do whatever it takes to forestall that.
One of his responsibilities is for full employment in society, and he hasn't really stepped up on that, but basically in terms of influencing how the economy went this year, Bernanke was the guy."
Wednesday's announcement comes a day before a Senate Banking Committee vote on whether Bernanke should be given another term.
One of Bernanke's harshest critics is Sen. Jim Bunning, R-Kentucky, the only senator to vote against the economist's appointment four years ago by President Bush.
Another sharp critic of Bernanke, independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, said December 2 that he plans to place a "hold" on Bernanke's nomination for a second term once it leaves the Banking Committee.
Bernanke was sworn in as Federal Reserve chairman in February 2006.
He spent years in academia, as a professor at Princeton, Stanford and New York universities and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, according to the Fed's Web site.
