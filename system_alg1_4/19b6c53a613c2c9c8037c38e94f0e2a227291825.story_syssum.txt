(CNN) -- Authorities have obtained an arrest warrant for Jesse Matthew, charging him with abduction with the intent to defile, in the case of missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo told reporters Tuesday.
Matthew willingly went to a police station over the weekend, along with several family members, walking through the front door and asking for a lawyer, Longo said.
Matthew and the lawyer spoke and then left, Longo said.
A doorman turned her away at the pub, Longo said Sunday.
She was at a restaurant, witnesses said.
She and a man were seen having drinks at a bar between 1:30 and 2 a.m., WVIR said.
"Some cases are much quicker than others, just depends on the evidence -- depends on how much evidence we have, where the evidence is, how small the sample is," he said.
"Hannah is beyond precious to us," her parents said in a statement released shortly after her disappearance.
