According to the lawsuit, Paul Nungesser was cleared of responsibility in Emma Sulkowicz's 2013 rape claim, as well as others that came to light after Sulkowicz went public with her allegations in various media interviews.
Bollinger also commented on the case in a 2014 New York Magazine profile of Sulkowicz, now a senior at Columbia.
The defendants "had the power, as well as the legal and contractual obligation" to protect Nungesser, who is also a senior, the lawsuit claims.
Columbia University declined to comment on the lawsuit.
Some of those exchanges were included in the lawsuit, but Sulkowicz told CNN they were taken out of context in the suit.
The project essentially consists of Sulkowicz carrying a twin-size mattress wherever she goes on campus, but not off campus.
