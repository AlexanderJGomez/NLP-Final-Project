(CNN) -- Formula One's 12 teams have struck an agreement to secure the future of the sport until 2020, Bernie Ecclestone has exclusively told CNN.
The German constructor, who have seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher in their ranks, were reported to be considering quitting the sport but during an interview in Monaco, Ecclestone said an agreement had been reached.
"You'll have to wait to see if Mercedes have but I'm confident everything with Mercedes will be fine," Ecclestone added.
"I appreciate and support Mercedes probably more than anyone in F1," said Ecclestone.
Ecclestone also suggested that reports of Formula One listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange might be premature.
