The incident happened as Mazza was being taken to the second day of his trial in connection with the armed robbery of a Coral Springs bank, Sheriff Al Lamberti said.
Mazza and Rein left about 8:05 a.m., Lamberti said.
That's all it took," Lamberti said.
Mazza allegedly took Rein's service weapon away from him and shot him, authorities said.
When the man arrived at the second pawn shop, he left Mazza in the car and went inside, Lamberti said.
As he was talking to the clerk, a television in the shop began broadcasting news about the deputy's shooting, and showed a picture of Mazza, he said.
Mazza faces charges including first-degree murder and escape, Lamberti said.
Mazza initially was reluctant to talk to authorities, but later agreed, and confessed to shooting Rein, the sheriff said.
Broward County also has a pending case against Mazza -- a February drugstore robbery in Pompano Beach, he said.
Broward County deputies conduct some 400 to 500 inmate court transports a day -- one deputy transporting up to a handful of inmates, Lamberti said.
"It's a routine thing," Lamberti said.
"She said you never think it's going to happen to you," the sheriff said.
