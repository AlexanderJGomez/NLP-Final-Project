Washington (CNN) -- Before President Obama says a word during his Tuesday Oval Office address, the backdrop will make a statement for him: that he is the decider.
The Oval Office symbolizes power, command, and authority, Dallek said.
Dallek points out the differences between giving a speech in the Oval Office versus a speech in a different venue.
A speech in front of both the Senate and House shows the president is "trying to convince Congress to join with him."
An Oval Office address is different.
Because of the singular focus on the subject matter during Obama's Tuesday evening address, Obama will have to navigate the tricky road of marking the end of a war he did not support and honoring the lives of all the Americans killed in the war, Dallek said.
Since former President Jimmy Carter, each president has delivered his farewell address from that room, using the office of the presidency to say goodbye to the American public.
Obama's other Oval Office address was two months ago to address the nation about the Gulf oil disaster.
