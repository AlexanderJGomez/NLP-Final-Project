(CNN) -- The Cannes Film Festival entrusted its opening to a Pixar film, and the animation studio did not disappoint.
"The two leading men are 78 and 8 years old, and the age range of those who will appreciate the picture is even a bit wider than that."
"Up" concerns Carl Fredericksen, a balloon seller voiced by Ed Asner.
A stowaway -- a Junior Wilderness Explorer named Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai) -- is in the house as well, and the two of them become mutually dependent after landing a continent away.
It's an unlikely film to be opening Cannes.
"But really the reason 'Up' is opening the festival is not because it's animated, not because it's 3-D, it's ... because it's a wonderful film.
"And Cannes is happy to be part of that.
