Under this plan, the Treasury would have bought the "troubled assets" of financial institutions in an attempt to avoid economic meltdown.
Here's why.
The government implicitly promised these institutions that it would make good on their debts, so Fannie and Freddie took on huge amounts of excessive risk.
The obvious alternative to a bailout is letting troubled financial institutions declare bankruptcy.
In contrast, a bailout transfers enormous wealth from taxpayers to those who knowingly engaged in risky subprime lending.
Thoughtful advocates of the bailout might concede this perspective, but they argue that a bailout is necessary to prevent economic collapse.
If financial institutions cannot make productive loans, a profit opportunity exists for someone else.
Further, the current credit freeze is likely due to Wall Street's hope of a bailout; bankers will not sell their lousy assets for 20 cents on the dollar if the government might pay 30, 50, or 80 cents.
The bailout has more problems.
The bailout will open the door to further federal meddling in financial markets.
The right view of the financial mess is that an enormous fraction of subprime lending should never have occurred in the first place.
