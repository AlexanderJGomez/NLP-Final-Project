Swierczynski is the author of several acclaimed crime thrillers, a regular contributor to Marvel Comics and has collaborated with Anthony E. Zuiker, the Hollywood mastermind behind TV's "CSI" on the series of best-selling, Level 26 "digi-novels."
While Swierczynski hails from Philadelphia, this book is set in Hollywood and takes advantage of a sunny locale loaded with shady people.
Swierczynski: "Fun & Games" is about an alcoholic house sitter who, one sunny California morning, finds himself squared off against the most lethal killers in the world.
(Or am I?
Swierczynski: I love books and movies about hit men.
Swierczynski: Whoever said that is very kind, and I owe them money.
Swierczynski: My love of noir and pulp grew right out of my teenage love of horror fiction (which I still love).
Secret Dead Blog started as a way to share cool stuff with friends, then turned into a place where I can hang with readers and show them cool stuff.
Swierczynski: Absolutely.
Swierczynski: Well, for better or worse, Philly is where my imagination goes to play.
Swierczynski: Such a great question, because I leave for a cross-country book tour/road trip in a few weeks, and I've been obsessing about which books to pack.
Swierczynski: My first issue of "Birds of Prey," for DC Comics, will appear this September -- which is part of the companywide relaunch of every single title (all with new No.1 issues).
October brings "Hell & Gone," the sequel to "Fun & Games."
