New York (CNN) -- Sunday's graduation ceremony at Hofstra University was a bittersweet affair marked by a moment of silence for a 21-year-old student killed by a police officer two days ago.
She was killed by police gunfire during a confrontation between a home invasion suspect and authorities Friday night, a police spokeswoman said Saturday.
When a police officer arrived, Smith told the officer he was going to kill Rebello.
At the time of the shooting, Smith was wanted for jumping parole, police said.
Her parents, Fernando and Nella Rebello, are closely tied to the Portuguese community, and always worked to create opportunities for their children, Conklin-Spillane said.
Hofstra University said it is offering counseling to students.
