Melissa Huckaby is charged with killing 8-year-old Sandra Cantu, who was a friend of her own daughter.
Melissa Huckaby, 28, was arrested and charged with killing and raping 8-year-old Sandra Cantu, a friend of her 5-year-old daughter.
Huckaby did not enter a plea or speak during the court hearing, although she flinched when Sandra Cantu's name was spoken, and she cried at times.
Huckaby was arrested Friday night after questioning by police.
But Huckaby said the suitcase had been stolen.
A memorial ceremony is scheduled for Sandra at 1 p.m. Thursday at a high school in Tracy, police said.
