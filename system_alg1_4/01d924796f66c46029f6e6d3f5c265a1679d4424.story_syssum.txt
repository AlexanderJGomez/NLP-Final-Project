The very next day, the Nigerian military announced that all but nine of the girls had been rescued.
In August last year, a military spokesman announced the death of Abubakar Shekau, the leader of Islamist extremist group Boko Haram, at the hands of the military.
Perhaps the military resorts to this impulsively buoyant tone because it believes it cannot afford to sound anything otherwise.
For a country that is not at war, death is cheap and plentiful.
All of the above combine to create the context in which the Nigerian military -- wielding political power for 29 of Nigeria's first 39 years after independence -- has learned to operate.
The closest it got were the lengthy tours of duty in Liberia and Sierra Leone, in which it played a prominent role at the head of the West African ECOMOG Force, intended more as a "peacekeeping" unit than a combat force.
News reports suggest that the military, long hampered by aging hardware, is now acquiring new weapons and equipment.
Nigerians have long been wary of allowing the American military the sort of foothold it has in countries like Yemen and Pakistan, but there's certainly room for more intense cooperation that does not involve abdicating total control.
Just this week a "Support The Nigerian Military" page launched on Facebook, in honor of "our military men and women on the field who risk their lives daily to keep us safe."
