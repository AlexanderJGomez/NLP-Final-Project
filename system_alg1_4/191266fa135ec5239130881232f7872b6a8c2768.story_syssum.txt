(CNN) -- Fernando Alonso insists he is not thinking about the prospect of his Red Bull rivals Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel combining to deprive him of a third Formula One world title this weekend.
"I don't think I would lose even one second of my energy this weekend thinking of what is going to happen on Sunday afternoon," the 29-year-old told F1's official website when asked whether he would understand if Vettel assisted Webber.
Vettel would not be drawn on whether he is planning to support his colleague during Sunday's race, but he did admit he was keen to avoid a repeat of this year's Turkish Grand Prix where he and Webber crashed while battling for position.
"I know that I've been very fortunate even to have a chance to get to this point," the 34-year-old said.
Obviously I have to win this race.
