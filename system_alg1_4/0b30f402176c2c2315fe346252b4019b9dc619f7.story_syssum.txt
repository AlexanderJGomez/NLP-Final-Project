Mark McGwire apparently felt it was the right thing to do.
Later, with tears streaming down his cheeks, McGwire told the media how, earlier that day, he had held the bat Roger Maris used when he set the old mark.
"I think she was shocked when I called," McGwire said yesterday in his interview with Bob Costas  on the MLB Network.
Yes, Mark McGwire used steroids and human growth hormone.
Twelve years after shattering Maris' record, five years after his embarrassing, I'm-not-here-to-discuss-the-past congressional testimony, the deflated Paul Bunyan of baseball told us that he used PED, and that he was very, very wrong.
Well, very wrong.
"Absolutely," McGwire said.
"The only reason I took steroids was for my health purposes," McGwire said.
"The names," McGwire said, "I don't remember."
And there lies the reason I have trouble forgiving and forgetting: Mark McGwire doesn't see it.
Pat Maris received her phone call.
