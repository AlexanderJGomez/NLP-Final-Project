Partial totals of what was spent so far show that between the candidate, his party and well-heeled outside groups, the "Red Team" spent more money on the effort to elect Republican Mitt Romney than the "Blue Team" did to re-elect President Barack Obama, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that monitors the influence of money on politics.
Combined, the candidate, the national party, and outside spending groups, like conservative issue-oriented nonprofits and super PACs, had spent more than $1 billion on Romney's effort.
No matter who spent more, Allison worries that the amount of money involved in this election will dramatically change politics.
The Center for Responsive Politics estimates that outside groups spent some $1.3 billion and counting on the election.
"At the presidential level, candidates are able to raise enough money to get their message out and drive their own narrative," Allison said.
One Senate race that saw record amounts of outside money was in Wisconsin.
After winning a bruising Republican primary, Thompson was seen as an early favorite -- partly because Wisconsin has recently leaned much more 'red.'
The primary had left Thompson cash poor while Baldwin was able to outpace him in fundraising.
Outside groups spent even more on the race than did the campaigns.
The groups spent $15.5 million against Baldwin, $1.2 million for her.
In the Senate race in Indiana, for instance, Republican Richard Mourdock outspent Democratic opponent Joe Donnelley by about $7 million.
He later apologized for the remarks.
Baldwin will become the first female Senator to represent Wisconsin and the nation's first openly gay person to win a Senate seat.
It looks like the money she spent on the race may have made a difference, too.
