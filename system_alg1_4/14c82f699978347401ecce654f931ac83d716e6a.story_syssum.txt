The Federal Trade Commission is urging mobile phone app developers and phone companies to make it easier for parents to control the personal information being collected by smartphone apps.
"Even more troubling, the results showed that many of the apps shared certain information with third parties -- such as device ID, geolocation, or phone number -- without disclosing that fact to parents," the FTC said.
"Parents should be given the information they need to make informed decisions about whether to allow their children to use apps with these capabilities," the FTC report said.
As of September, there were more than 700,000 apps available in Apple's App Store, a 40 percent increase since December 2011, and more than 700,000 apps available in Google Play, an 80 percent increase since the beginning of 2012, the FTC said.
The agency urged developers and marketers to work together and develop accurate privacy disclosures regarding what data is collected through apps used by kids.
