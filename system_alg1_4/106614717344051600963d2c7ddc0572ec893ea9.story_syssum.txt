At 21, Angie Sanclemente Valencia was crowned as Colombia's "Queen of Coffee."
But Sanclemente's career came to a screeching halt in May of 2010 when she was arrested in Argentina and charged with drug trafficking.
While on the run, Sanclemente continued to update her Facebook page.
It was all a big misunderstanding," Sanclemente said.
Four men and two other women were also arrested in connection with the case.
She says her Argentinian boyfriend and his uncle, who are also in prison, were indeed involved in drug trafficking, but not her.
Moving to Argentina from Mexico, Sanclemente says in retrospect, was a big mistake.
Sanclemente had expressed regret once before about making the wrong choices.
"I'm very capricious and a lot of [bad] things have happened to me for not listening to my mother," Sanclemente says.
