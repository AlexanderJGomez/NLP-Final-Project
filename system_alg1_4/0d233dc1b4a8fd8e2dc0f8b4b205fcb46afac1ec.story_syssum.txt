Two firefighters lay dead on the street near Hofstetter, not moving since they were shot, he said.
The shots came across the street from the burning house and car that were set on fire by the shooter, 62-year-old William Spengler, police said.
He was aiming at a West Webster Fire Department truck that answered his call to 911, they said.
Hofstetter and firefighter Theodore Scardino survived their gunshot wounds and were "convalescing and doing as well as I would expect at this stage," a doctor at University of Rochester Hospital said Wednesday.
The men will start physical therapy Wednesday and their conditions should be upgraded to "satisfactory" later in the day, Stassen said.
Chiapperini, named "Firefighter of the Year" for his West Webster Fire Department just two weeks ago, was also lieutenant with his town's police department.
"Nick was in the dispatch center and heard the entire ordeal play out over the scanners," Sienkiewicz said.
Kaczowka, who was also a 911 dispatcher, had been with the West Webster Fire Department for just more than a year, Sienkiewicz said.
It will be a challenge for the medical examiner to determine if William Spengler's sister -- 67-year-old Cheryl Spengler -- was killed before the fire was set, because it was a "raging inferno," Pickering said.
Spengler was especially attentive to his mother, who passed away in October, a former neighbor, Roger Vercruysse said, visiting her every day in a nursing home until she died.
"The system failed all of us again," she said, adding that her family grieved for the fallen firefighters -- one of whom her two daughters knew from school -- and Cheryl Spengler.
