(CNN) -- The most difficult decision a member of Congress will ever have to make is to commit our nation's armed forces to military action against an enemy.
First, I have concerns that a strike in Syria will only further muddle the administration's disjointed foreign policy approach to the region.
Rather, a strike on Syria must consider the greater strategic implications of military action and should be about one thing: the best strategic interests of the United States.
Next, the administration has yet to clearly articulate the goals, objectives and potential costs of a military action in Syria.
I don't believe that our military, or the American people, are ready to sink the ship.
Thus far, the specifics of a strike in Syria have not met this standard.
As the situation evolves, we may see evidence that the Syrian armed forces are planning to attack our longstanding allies in the region or that there could be a major threat to global commerce.
Such a situation would likely warrant a U.S. military strike.
