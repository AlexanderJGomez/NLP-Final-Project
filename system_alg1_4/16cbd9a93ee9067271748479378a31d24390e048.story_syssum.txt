It showed, apparently, that significant numbers of Hispanics are now identifying as white.
If large numbers of Hispanics were to start thinking of themselves as white, that could alter the calculations and rhetoric of the GOP.
That means there are black, white, even Asian Hispanics.
So Hispanics can be at once a race and not a race.
What it found was that growing numbers of Hispanics, when told by government forms that they were not a race unto themselves and that they had to choose a race, chose the category called "white."
This suggests that the way Americans say "upward mobility for immigrants" or "mainstream integration" is still too often "becoming white."
For proof, look no further than the invention of the white race itself.
In more recent times, Asian Americans who've achieved in visible ways have been granted "honorary white" status (wanted or not), while some people of color seeking middle-class success have been accused by their co-ethnics of "acting white" (whether they thought of it that way or not).
They're not becoming white.
