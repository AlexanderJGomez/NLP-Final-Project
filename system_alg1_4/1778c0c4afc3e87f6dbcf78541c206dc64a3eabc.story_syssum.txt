(CNN) -- "No one's ever asked to see my birth certificate.
But what, exactly, did Romney reveal with this pre-meditated "offhand" remark?
We already know that because he appears on media friendly to the right but limits the number and kind of questions reporters can ask him, and then responds with dodging answers.
Romney -- hiding behind the plausible deniability that it was just a joke, with a wink and a nod to the extremists in his base -- tried to divert attention from the ABC's haunting his campaign: Akin, Bain, "Corporations are people."
