(CNN)  -- Felipe Massa had emergency surgery for a fractured skull after a freak crash in final qualifying for Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix.
"The condition of the driver is serious, but stable," said a hospital spokesman.
Sebastian Vettel, second in the title race to Jenson Button, will start alongside Alonso on the front row, with his Red Bull teammate Mark Webber qualifying third.
Button delayed his final qualifying run while his car was checked out after the earlier incident.
"We will try to win, but being honest and realistic, our target is to get some good points," added the Spaniard.
