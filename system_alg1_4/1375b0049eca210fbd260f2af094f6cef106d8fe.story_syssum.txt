"It was a time when China had very few friends, so we decided to step in and help with what we could put together; funding and expertise," says Wong, founder of the China Exploration & Research Society.
In those early days China was only just opening up.
In 1985, when Wong led an expedition to find the source of the Yangtze River, he says he and his team traveled for nine days on horseback.
He returned 10 years later to find the same journey took just five days.
Now we could probably drive all the way to the source," says Wong, who began leading expeditions for National Geographic before setting up CERS.
Today Wong has to look harder to find truly out of the way places he deems worthy of exploration.
The often complex cultural and historical backgrounds of frontiers can make them especially interesting, but timing is everything when it comes to the exploring border regions.
During a visit two years ago to China's border with Vietnam, Wong said political unrest made exploration problematic.
China and India's political and trade ties are better than they've been for many years, opening it up to exploration.
"It's fascinating to look at the dynamics between people at borders," says Wong.
Wong says the border between China's southwestern Yunnan province and Myanmar is also ripe for exploration, as it is free from the political complications of more sensitive areas close to Tibet or Vietnam.
If you're like a sprint runner, 'Oh, I got there first and I'm home already and on the computer sharing it on Facebook,' then I don't call it exploration," says Wong.
