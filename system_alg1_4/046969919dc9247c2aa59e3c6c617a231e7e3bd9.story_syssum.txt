For almost two weeks, demonstrators across Nepal have chanted slogans and massed outside official buildings, including the prime minister's residence, demanding better protection of women and criticizing what they describe as the government's delayed response to issues such as rape and abuse.
"The media attention to protests in Delhi has raised awareness on issues of violence against women in Nepal," said Manju Gurung, of Pourakhi, an organization that advocates for female migrant workers.
"This case is representative of several others that go unreported," Gurung said.
On November 18, the woman returned home to Nepal on vacation from Saudi Arabia, where she works as a domestic worker, said Basanta Bahadur Basnet, a lawyer who represents the woman.
In mid-December, she filed the case in Kathmandu, and it began to gain attention in Nepal around the same time as news of the gang-rape attack in New Delhi emerged.
Parsuram Basnet has been suspended from his job as a police officer at the airport, but he cannot be removed from his job until the verdict, said Dhiraj Pratap Shingh, a spokesman for Kathmandu District Police.
Although married, he had told the woman that he would marry her, his attorney said.
"We are pushing for female immigration officers at the airport and strict monitoring to prevent such incidents," Gurung said.
