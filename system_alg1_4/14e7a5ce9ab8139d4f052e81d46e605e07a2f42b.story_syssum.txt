A Kentucky pastor who starred in a reality show about snake-handling in church has died -- of a snakebite.
The National Geographic show featured Coots and cast handling all kinds of poisonous snakes -- copperheads, rattlers, cottonmouths.
On Sunday, National Geographic Channels spokeswoman Stephanie Montgomery sent CNN this statement: "In following Pastor Coots for our series Snake Salvation, we were constantly struck by his devout religious convictions despite the health and legal peril he often faced.
In February 2013, Coots was given one year of probation for crossing into Tennessee with venomous snakes.
"He'll give up, just sooner or later," one of the members says.
"Catching two snakes the first day, 'course we'd hoped for more," Coots says in the video.
