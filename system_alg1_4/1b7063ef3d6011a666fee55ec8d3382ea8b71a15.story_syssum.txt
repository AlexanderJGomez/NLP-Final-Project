London (CNN) -- "It is a myth that rape is an inevitable part of conflict.
So said Hollywood star Angelina Jolie on Tuesday in London, as she opened the biggest summit of its kind aimed at ending the scourge of sexual violence in conflict.
And she said it was time to end a culture of silence and denial that helps war zone rape to thrive, and means that the rapists rarely face justice.
It is up to everyone to help make this summit a turning point, Jolie said, and to work across borders, governments and religious faiths to bring an end to the use of rape and sexual violence in war.
According to UNICEF, about 40% of Congolese women are believed to have been subjected to some form of sexual violence at some point in their lives, while in the most recent conflict in South Sudan, rape has been used by both sides of the conflict during fighting.
Amnesty International also said it was "time to deliver" on the ambitious goal of ending violence against women in conflict -- and the broader but related problem of gender inequality.
