Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (CNN) -- An estimated 3 billion people -- nearly half the world's population -- still use an open fire as their primary source of energy for cooking and heating.
TaTedo's stoves are made with clay liners that, along with other simple design features, emit far less smoke and fewer pollutants.
"The charcoal consumption here is less, compared to the traditional one."
This teaches each worker a variety of skills.
While the upfront cost to buy a cookstove is high, the fuel costs are lower because it burns less.
Burning less charcoal or wood means there's less deforestation, something that has caused flooding and other major problems in many countries.
