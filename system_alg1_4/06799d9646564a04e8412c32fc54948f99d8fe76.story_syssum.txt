His first order of business was to eat a big meal, to sustain him through the day until he could break the seasonal Muslim fast at sunset.
Three people in a car came upon the 16-year-old as Abu Khdeir walked between his home and mosque around 4 a.m. Wednesday, then forced him inside, according to authorities and family members.
It was a horrible end for someone who friends and family remembered fondly on Wednesday.
Abu Khdeir hadn't fully made his mark on the world.
His family will never know.
