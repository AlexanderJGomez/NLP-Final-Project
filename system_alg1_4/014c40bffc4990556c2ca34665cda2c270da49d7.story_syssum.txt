(CNN) -- One of the three guns Adam Lanza used to kill 20 children and six adults at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, was a military-style semiautomatic rifle known as an AR-15.
Self-described gun owner Julie Jones-Hawkins comments, "I ... fully support a ban on rapid-fire weapons.
"Every month or so I take my guns out to the range and shoot.
"The AR-15 is what I am used to from my extensive training as an airborne infantryman," writes Nathan Lee.
I've hunted coyote with it," says CNN iReporter MVR155, who owns two of the weapons.
It may not be the best or most important reason, but military-style weapons often appeal to the enthusiast side of the American gun owner.
"There are people who buy certain types of firearms because they have a certain image -- the AR-15 is one of them," says Austin Nikel, a former AR-15 owner in Boulder, Colorado.
"Guns like these are as much a part of the history of this country as the muskets carried by pioneers, the rifles toted by doughboys in the trenches, and the other arms that have served and protected throughout the years.
I don't own these guns to target shoot, though I do that with them.
Like most firearms, military-style weapons such as the AR-15 are semiautomatic -- increasing protection because the shooter can fire off many shots without having to manually chamber a new bullet.
Military-style weapons look more dangerous than other guns, he says, but really, there are many weapons available which are just as lethal, but which are not designed in a military style.
Many people would argue that we have no use for it today because the government is trustworthy.
Perhaps the notion that people feel safe with our government after over 200 years is a testament to the Second Amendment value in balancing power with the citizens."
