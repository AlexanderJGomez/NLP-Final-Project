Both the Lions Tour rugby and the FIFA Confederations Cup football will follow the cricket tournament, heading down to South Africa later this year.
Calvyn Gilfellan, chief executive of Cape Town Routes Unlimited -- the region's tourism board -- told CNN the boost to the region had arrived at a crucial time.
As the focus strengthens on these international events, the Cape Town region looks set to benefit more than many from the expected surge in tourism.
This weekend harbor will play host to the Cape Town International Jazz Festival -- one of many upcoming festivals in the area.
"Cape Town is a real focal point for refueling and repairs and it's also quite cheap here so people tend to stay for a while," he said.
Gilfellan said she felt the surge of massive sporting events would undoubtedly have spin-off benefits for the marine industry.
Matches will be held in Cape Town on June 13 and June 23.
