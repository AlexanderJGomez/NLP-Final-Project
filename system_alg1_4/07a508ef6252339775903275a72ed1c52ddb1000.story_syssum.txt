Colligan claims Jobs called him in August of 2007 — roughly two months after the public launch of the iPhone — to propose "an agreement" wherein Palm and Apple would not hire employees away from each other.
Colligan went on to point out that Palm recruits employees based on talent, not because Palm wants to hurt other companies.
"Threatening Palm with a patent lawsuit in response to a decision by one employee to leave Apple is just out of line.
"This is not satisfactory to Apple," Jobs wrote.
Current Apple CEO Tim Cook has been ordered by Judge Koh to give a deposition about Apple's role in the alleged collusion, although Apple argues that only Jobs was involved in the discussion and that Cook had no knowledge of the agreements.
