"Selma" did pick up two nominations, including one for best picture.
"Selma" is a good film that told a great story, at least according to Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences voters.
And "Dallas Buyer's Club" was also a 2014 Oscar darling that sprinkled creative liberties all over a true story.
My point is -- and I'm sure I'm at risk of losing my black card for writing this -- when those same old, white men made "12 Years A Slave" a favorite of the Oscars just a year ago, it is hard to say the snubbing of "Selma" is all about the demographics of the voters.
But all?
In a town full of gay men, the heart wrenching "Brokeback Mountain" somehow lost out to the woefully mediocre "Crash."
But I do not need her to win an Oscar to tell me how I should feel about "Selma."
Only that the true story of Selma is much more than calling out racism.
The old guard at the Oscars has the power to snub "Selma" for whatever reason it sees fit.
