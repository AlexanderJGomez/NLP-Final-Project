After years of manufacturing delays and cost overruns, the state-of-the-art Boeing 787 Dreamliner makes its North American debut Sunday morning, toting more than 200 eager United Airlines passengers from Houston to Chicago.
United received the Dreamliner flying Sunday on September 28.
"Everyone's very excited, even people who aren't in the industry," Phil Derner, founder of the aviation news site NYCAviation.com, told CNN in August.
Because of unexpected delivery delays, during November and December some domestic flights originally scheduled to use the 787 will operate with a different aircraft type, United said.
It recently received its second 787.
