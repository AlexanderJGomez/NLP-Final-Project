The collection was seized and is now housed under tight security in Las Vegas.
Fees have continued to mount, including $250,000 from a financing company to pay for housing and marketing the collection, said Jason Wiley, an attorney for ABKCO.
Dotan Melech, the federal bankruptcy trustee charged with administering the Montague estate, is still hopeful he can find a buyer or get more time from the court.
He's also considered a Kickstarter campaign.
That will break his heart, Melech said.
"I only want to look ahead, that it can be done," he said.
