Eric Shanteau said he felt angry when he found out he had testicular cancer.
In June, a week before the qualifying round of the Olympics he was told he had testicular cancer.
After weeks of tests to determine the "stage" or spread of the cancer, Shanteau's team of doctors cleared him to compete in the Beijing Olympics, which meant carefully monitoring his tumor but delaying treatment.
Dr. Sanjay Gupta reports from Eric Shanteau's surgery Â»
Cancer was a motivator, he says, because he knew it meant he could be facing his last competition.
A source of inspiration, he says, were fans who shared their stories of beating cancer.
Testicular cancer is diagnosed in about 1 in 300 men in their lifetime.
Shanteau says he experienced no symptoms of cancer and came across the tumor by chance.
Shanteau's father Rick, is battling lung cancer and responding well to treatment.
"But if they feel something [physically] that they don't think should be there, it takes them a year to get to their doctor and that just is not smart.
Later that week, Shanteau's pathology results revealed that the operation removed the most of the cancer.
"The majority of it is gone."
Eric says the cancer diagnosis gave him a different perspective on life.
It is really great."
Right now I'm just kind of taking it year by year and we'll see what happens."
