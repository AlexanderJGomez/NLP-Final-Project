Rihanna was allegedly attacked by her boyfriend, singer Chris Brown, before the Grammys on February 8.
"Emotionally, the remnants of that stay for a long time," she said.
Victims who do leave -- which is the healthier choice, Crawford said -- often become over-accommodating because they want to avoid conflict, even verbal disputes, at all costs.
"What they need to do when they get out of the relationship is make sure they're aware of their own anger, and then they can learn how to freely express it in a healthy, normal way," he said.
It makes sense that abused women would report worse health, given that people in stressful situations have higher levels of stress hormones, which interfere with immune function, Crawford said.
Women who have been abused prior to, but not during, the past five years had depression rates 1Â½ times greater than those without abuse experience, said Bonomi, who has collaborated with Dimer on research on abused women.
Women who have suffered violence also seem to have a greater likelihood of substance abuse, but it's unclear how the two are related -- one doesn't necessarily cause the other, and there could be other factors involved, Bonomi said.
About 34 percent of women in the sample said they had been abused.
Some women do feel stronger having been through the experience of abuse, Dimer said.
Calling a domestic violence hot line is a good first step for anyone who is experiencing abuse, Dimer said.
