(CNN) -- Just one week ago Republicans were united, railing against the man-made evil known as Obamacare.
Republicans in the House had been hit over the head in their districts by ads run by conservative political action committees (paging Sen. Ted Cruz, who appeared in some).
So the plan to defund Obamacare -- and tie it to a measure to fund the government -- was hatched.
At that moment, Cruz morphed from the Pied Piper of House Republicans into the man on the Most Wanted sign.
"He's a demagogue," one senior House Republican told me, then going on to detail how Cruz was shooting "his own team from behind" and other choice descriptions.
But a funny thing happened on the way to the national stage: The president decided not to cave, and Republicans treated this as if it were shocking that he would not gut his single biggest legislative achievement.
So Republicans had accomplished the seemingly impossible: They trampled their own message on Obamacare.
Great strategy.
But look at it this way: A government drowning in red ink is paying people not to work.
So Obamacare had a crashing start, the government is shut down, and the deadline to raise the debt ceiling is a week away.
So what to do?
And some cooler heads I have spoken with are privately making the same point: Wasn't it always unfair to promise people something the Republicans knew they could never deliver (defunding Obamacare)?
That's what has always been done.
In the end, they will probably find a short-term way to fund the government and raise the debt ceiling and continue to argue over spending and taxes.
