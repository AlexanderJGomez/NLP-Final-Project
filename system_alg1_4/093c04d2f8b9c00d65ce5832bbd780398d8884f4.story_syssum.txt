The Drug Enforcement Administration in Atlanta says all of these scenarios should leave pharmacy workers suspicious of illegal activity at their store.
And they hope pharmacy employees -- or anyone, for that matter -- will report such activity to its new prescription drug abuse tip line.
Agents hope it will become a successful weapon to fight the war on prescription drug abuse, a war they feel they are losing.
Prescription drug abuse is a national epidemic, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
Most abusers get the pills from a friend or family member who had the initial prescription.
"The illegal prescription drug market and relative ease of which pharmaceutical substances can be obtained has resulted in a sharp increase in prescription drug abuse," said Harry Sommers, special agent in charge of the DEA's Atlanta division.
The guide, a pamphlet, suggests that people get these drugs illegally by stealing doctors' prescription pads or altering a legitimate prescription with a different callback number that can ring to an accomplice that would verify the prescription.
A prescription with all the words spelled out or with perfect handwriting is also suspicious, according to the DEA.
It also recommends that health professionals consult their state's prescription drug monitoring programs.
