But McIlroy didn't brood.
Instead the world No.
But now, as he returns to the PGA Tour for this week's Wells Fargo Championship -- a tournament he won in 2010 -- McIlroy says taking time out will be the key to his success.
I sometimes take a little bit too much out of myself, especially at the end of the season," he said on the PGA Tour website.
For me there's more to life than just golf.
I've played some great golf here and played not so great golf here last year.
Wells Fargo is the first of four tournaments McIlroy will play before launching his U.S. Open title defense in June.
That's when all the big tournaments are and that's when you want to play your best golf," he said.
