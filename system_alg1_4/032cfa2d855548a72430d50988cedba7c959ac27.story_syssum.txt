Burrell Edward Mohler Sr., 77, and his sons Burrell Edward Mohler Jr., 53; David A. Mohler, 52; Jared Leroy Mohler, 48; and Roland Neil Mohler, 47, were arrested Tuesday on suspicion of sexually abusing children.
"David was one of the kindest people I know in this town," Ramsey said.
Ramsey said he and Burrell Edward Mohler Sr., 77, attended college together 50 years ago.
Mohler has been suspended, Allred said, and further action may be taken at the next board meeting.
Roland Mohler was on duty when Missouri State Highway Patrol officers arrested him, Allred said.
Burrell Mohler Sr., David Mohler and Jared Mohler are lay ministers in the Community of Christ, the organization said.
Burrell Mohler Sr. did go through the group's registered youth worker program, but "his youth worker registration has been terminated and we understand he had no contact with children or youth in church programs," the church said.
We suspend their priesthoods," Booth said, referring to a church designation for male members.
She said she is also "concerned about the greater church, the Community of Christ who represents nations and communities based in love and peace and joy."
