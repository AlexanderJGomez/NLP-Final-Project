BlackBerry?
It's Huawei.
At company headquarters in Shenzhen in southern China, I talked to Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei's Consumer Business Group.
"We are growing."
Despite the trust issues and the fact that many Americans can't even pronounce the name of the company, Huawei has sold and will continue to sell its phones in America under the Huawei brand.
"Huawei is going to be able to execute on smartphones at lower costs than some of its international competitors," he said.
But that's not good enough for Huawei.
"We have the ambition to be the best -- to have the best products and be the best solution provider."
Would you buy a Huawei smartphone?
Not yet.
