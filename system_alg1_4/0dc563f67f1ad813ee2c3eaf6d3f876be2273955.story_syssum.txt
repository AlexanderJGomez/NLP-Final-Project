Liberia (CNN)First, the good news: Ebola is in decline.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) said last week that only half the cases in Liberia and Guinea came from known Ebola contacts, which suggests that hidden cases are causing outbreaks.
And getting to zero can't be the end of it.
Could it happen again?
Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea have never had well-functioning health systems.
Sierra Leone had two per 100,000 people.
Then Ebola destroyed what little healthcare they had, taking the lives of 488 health workers and leaving people too terrified to go through the doors of clinics they saw as harbourers of the disease.
Now trust in the region's decimated health care system is beginning -- albeit painfully slowly -- to return.
Laboratoriess and Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) have been followed by Community Care Centres, or CCCs.
Now there are dozens in Sierra Leone and Liberia.
And even if the person doesn't survive they saw the care that was provided, they saw the attempts to save the life."
And for all the fear, the heartache and the stigma around the disease, there's a clear sense of pride amongst those who are leading the charge against Ebola at a community level.
"Even elders will listen to me more than they would to you because I have been a victim of Ebola," he says, beaming with pride.
And the disease leaves behind people galvanised for action as a result of their ordeal.
Now the question is how to use these resources to transition from an emergency response situation to more sustainable healthcare provision in the future.
