Todd Krim, who founded Give Back Hollywood -- which helps connect celebrities and charities -- says he thinks there's a true desire by celebrities to get involved.
I'm a lawyer and ... in 2003 I met a lot of celebrities and reality stars in social circles who were wanting to give back but didn't know how ...
CNN: Do you think most celebrities get involved with charity as part of marketing their overall image?
...
But then again, I have just as much respect for those who want to promote it because they set an example for other celebrities.
Krim: I would say I think Justin Bieber, I have to say...
Krim: -- I'd like to see more ... of the people behind the scenes get more involved: producers, directors, the talent agencies and the people who support the celebrities ... they have a say in whether a celebrity participates in certain things.
I'd like to see Hollywood work more as a team, and all come together to support charity.
It's a win-win and there' s nothing better than seeing a smile on a kid's face... when you surprise them with their favorite celebrity.
