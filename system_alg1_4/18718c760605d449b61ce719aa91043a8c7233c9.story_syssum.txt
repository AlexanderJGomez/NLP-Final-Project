Washington (CNN) -- The shocking murder last weekend of 16 Afghan civilians -- 9 of them children -- by a U.S. soldier is raising many questions about the war.
In contrast, Sunday's mass murder is not a new outrage for Afghanistan.
Last May, U.S. helicopters in Kunar province came under rocket fire from insurgents; in responding they accidentally fired back at what turned out to be children gathering firewood, killing 9.
The game has already changed, and many Afghans are not surprised when the U.S. kills a bunch of civilians.
A huge challenge facing President Obama is that the U.S. is fighting one war while the insurgency is fighting a very different one.
Because there is no political strategy for the war -- nothing that takes Afghan and Taliban politics into consideration -- the U.S. has no concept of how to manage or react to the political consequences of incidents like Sunday's rampage.
Sunday's mass killing is tragic but it is not a game-changing event.
But shifting Afghanistan from a military engagement to a political one would, by design, extend U.S. operations there.
Abandoning Afghanistan will impose huge costs in Afghanistan but the last ten years of directionless fighting has left Americans tired and frustrated with a war that seems to go nowhere but down.
