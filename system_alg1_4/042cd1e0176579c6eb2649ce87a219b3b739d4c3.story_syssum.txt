It was not until the Iowa caucus win by Obama that many black Americans started to believe it was possible for a black man to become president.
The black caucus and most of black America (with the exception of Tavis Smiley and Cornel West) had remained silent for two years about the devastating economic impact of the recession on black people.
She further indicated that the black caucus wanted to put pressure on Obama, but could not, due to the fact that black people "love the president."
Finally, the White House started a blitz of interviews on black media.
All seemed well, that is until Saturday night at the 41st annual CBC Phoenix Awards dinner in Washington, where the president told the attendees, "I expect all of you to march with me and press on.
We've got work to do, CBC."
The president made clear his dismay with such criticisms during a Monday night BET interview when asked by a reporter why he doesn't "target black  America specifically for economic relief."
Their take is that they are standing up for those who cannot stand up for themselves and that they are pushing a black agenda as others have pushed their own agendas.
For reasons beyond my understanding, the audience at the CBC that heard this rebuke cheered the president.
Obama seemed to be asking black America once again to keep the faith -- to "press on" and to "shake it off."
But I think the time has come for the administration to "take its slippers off" and march into America's urban centers and rural centers, and create a sustainable and real-time jobs policy -- going beyond the president's jobs bill -- that will touch everyday black Americans who are out of work and economically disenfranchised.
The cold hard fact is that no group is being as negatively impacted by this recession as blacks, so it is proper and necessary for the CBC and others to continue to press this president to do more.
