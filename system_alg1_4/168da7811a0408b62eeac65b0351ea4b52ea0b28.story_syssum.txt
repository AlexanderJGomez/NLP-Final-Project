The fate of the Manas Transit Center was thrown into question Wednesday when Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiev was forced to flee the capital after angry mobs seized government headquarters.
The United States likely will retain use of the Manas facility even if Bakiev's opponents secure control of the government, said Alexander Cooley, a central Asia expert at Barnard College.
In exchange for use of the base, the United States provides about $180 million in aid to Kyrgyzstan each year, Cooley said.
But the base also has deep significance to Bakiev's opponents, who see it as a symbol of the deposed president's corruption and U.S. complicity in his abuse of power.
"The United States stayed silent as Bakiev built a criminal state," Cooley said.
The new government has said it will address citizens' concerns.
"Kyrgyzstan seemed to be in the 1990s the one bright spot," Cooley said.
"As they do, he stayed a few years too many," said Cooley.
Demonstrations by political opponents in April, May and November 2006 led to the adoption of a new constitution that gave some of the president's powers to parliament and the government.
"The president then dissolved parliament, called for early elections and gained control of the new parliament through his newly created political party, Ak Jol, in December 2007 elections," the CIA World Factbook says.
"Kyrgyz are great," Cooley said.
Nearly two-thirds of the nation's citizens belong to the Kyrgyz ethnic group, while nearly 14 percent are Uzbek and more than 12 percent are Russian, the CIA World Factbook says.
Although Kyrgyzstan shares a 533-mile (858-kilometer) border with China, most people identify with mother-nation Russia.
"China has moved in, but it's been a very recent development," said Cooley.
"Last year, China did a lot more trade there than Russia did.
