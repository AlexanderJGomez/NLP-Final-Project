Then Mullen said Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence "has a longstanding relationship with the Haqqani Network.
"I also have an understanding that the ISI and the (Pakistani military) exist to protect their own citizens, and there's a way they have done that for a long period of time," Mullen said.
We do not have the capacity to undertake simultaneous operations."
Earlier in the Geo TV interview, Mullen was pressed on issues such as the arrest of CIA contractor Raymond Davis and unmanned drone strikes against targets within Pakistan, which have marked what he called a "rough patch" of increasingly complex relations between the two nations in recent months.
Mullen's term is set to end this year.
