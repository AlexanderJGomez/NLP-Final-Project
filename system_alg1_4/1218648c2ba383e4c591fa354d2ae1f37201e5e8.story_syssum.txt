Roland S. Martin says issue of Obama's birth certificate is being pushed by conspiracy theorists.
(CNN) -- The YouTube video of an out-of-control woman yelling and screaming at Republican Congressman Mike Castle's town hall meeting in Delaware, demanding to see the birth certificate of President Barack Obama, is utterly hilarious.
From the moment President Obama entered the race, he has had to endure the so-called flag-waving American patriots who think they are the arbiters of what's right for the country.
They will then accuse the president of doctoring the document and ordering up the state of Hawaii and federal officials to create the birth certificate.
President Obama is right to ignore these losers.
So nut jobs, keep it coming.
In such difficult times, we all need a good laugh every now and then, and you provide great comic fodder.
