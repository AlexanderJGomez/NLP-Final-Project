The Beijing city government published a draft of the new rules on its website on Saturday and asked for public feedback -- an unusual step that illustrates how carefully the government is treading around the hot-button issue.
Although the Beijing city government has in the past tried to conceal its pollution problem by manipulating air quality data, public pressure has forced it adopt a radically more open stance.
The draft rules also outline a new cap-and-trade scheme for key pollutants, and will require the largest culprits to publicly disclose their emissions -- which environmentalists said was a step toward greater transparency.
"To make this happen the key thing is oversight," said Zhou Rong, air pollution specialist at Greenpeace in Beijing.
"The government put this up on the web because they understand that everyone is watching this issue -- this is a big improvement."
