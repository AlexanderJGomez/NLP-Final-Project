"Our platform is about promoting emerging and established Africa-inspired designers," said Ronke Ademiluyi, founder of the event, held from August 1 to 3.
In many ways, the event reaffirmed why Africa-inspired designs are fast catching the eye of the fashion world.
"That's basically what's the collection is about," says Olayinka, who started the label about four years ago.
"A lot of them are talented but they're struggling," she says.
"They don't have support from anywhere, so what we do is we support them -- it's an affordable platform for the designers to showcase their talents to the world."
"For a lot of them, after Africa Fashion Week, that's it," she says.
