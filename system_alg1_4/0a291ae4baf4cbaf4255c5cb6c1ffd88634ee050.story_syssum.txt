BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Half of Iraq's registered voters turned out for peaceful provincial elections this weekend, the election commission said Sunday.
The highest turnout -- 65 percent -- was in the Salaheddin province in northern Iraq, the commission said.
CNN's Arwa Damon, who toured polling stations with U.N. observers, said she noticed an increased sense of awareness and optimism among voters, who said they felt their participation would have an impact on their lives and country.
Saturday's voting also was seen as a referendum on the popularity of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki.
The results should spell out the status of the Sunni Arab "Awakening" movement -- which opposes al Qaeda in Iraq -- and the popularity of the Shiite factions, such as those backing al-Maliki, Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, and the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.
There were no casualties.
