Michael Jackson performed with James Brown at the BET Awards in 2003.
"Words cannot capture the impact Michael Jackson has had on pop culture around the world," said Debra L. Lee, chairman and chief executive officer of BET Networks.
Several of the scheduled performers include artists, such as Ne-Yo and Beyonce, who have acknowledged the influence of Jackson on their music and careers.
BET CEO Lee said Sunday's show will be dedicated to Jackson and will also pay tribute to his legacy.
The BET Awards is scheduled to run live on the cable network Sunday at 8 p.m.
