London, England (CNN) -- Irish football officials have lodged an official complaint with world ruling body FIFA after Thierry Henry confessed that he handled the ball in the build-up to the goal which sent France to next summer's World Cup.
Millions of people worldwide saw it was a blatant double handball -- not to mention a double offside -- and we should put the powers that be in the cozy world of FIFA on the spot and demand a replay," Ahern said in a statement sent to CNN.
It's the least we owe the thousands of devastated young fans around the country.
Henry is their captain and a wonderful footballer, but does he want to be like Diego Maradona and his legacy to be this handball, this goal that got them to the World Cup in an unjust manner?
This was a defining game with the whole world watching, and if FIFA believe in fair play and integrity, this is their opportunity to step forward."
"The Football Association of Ireland is hoping that FIFA and its disciplinary committee will, on behalf of football fans worldwide, act in a similar fashion so that the standards of fair play and integrity can be protected," the FAI said.
"FIFA will probably be happy.
"With the way we played, we certainly deserved to win the game and it killed us near the end with that handball," he was quoted by the FAI Web site as saying.
You don't get a reaction like that.
Ireland team manager Giovanni Trapattoni told reporters that the referee had time to ask the linesman and then Henry.
"We are angry," the Italian continued.
"But it was a shame to finish the game like that as Ireland had played very well.
But on the wider issue of cheating, Leighton said: "It is all very well to blame the referees for not spotting it but fundamentally it starts with the players.
