LONDON, England (CNN) -- Michael Martin, the speaker of Britain's House of Commons, said Tuesday he would resign in the face of widespread public anger over expense claims by lawmakers.
He proposed a review of expense claims of the past few years by an independent panel, and the introduction of an outside agency to regulate expense reimbursements, which Parliament currently does itself.
"There has got to be transparency.
Brown also paid tribute to Martin and added that he had chaired a meeting of party leaders Tuesday afternoon to discuss an overhaul of the expenses system.
But part of the reason MPs are now focusing their anger on Martin is that his office also handles expense claims.
Politicians across the political spectrum have been under fire after weeks of front-page headlines revealing their expense claims.
The expense claims were to be made public in the summer, but the Telegraph obtained them early.
The police had not yet decided whether to investigate whether politicians broke the law in their expense claims, the statement added.
