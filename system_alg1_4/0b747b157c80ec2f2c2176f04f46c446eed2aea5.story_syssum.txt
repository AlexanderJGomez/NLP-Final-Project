One recruiter, who asked to be called Henry, says there is a concerted effort to increase their membership.
Henry says that in the last few months, he has personally recruited over 40 new members to the Texas Knights.
This push for new members has reached far beyond Texas.
As far as racial pride is concerned, KKK recruiter Henry says that "for me, I love my own people ... there is nothing wrong with blacks (or) African-Americans having their pride; Hispanics have their pride, Orientals.
Levin says the Klan has a membership of about 5,000.
That's how it should be."
