Kingston, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Two weeks ago, a growth was found on the chest of Sara Polcari's 6-year-old dog, Charlie.
Now?
" Polcari said.
Since it started in 2009, Fairy DogParents has provided aid for nearly 400 dogs in Massachusetts: $150,000 worth of dog food and medical care.
"It's to prevent dogs from being surrendered to shelters or euthanized when their owners cannot afford care," said Marlo Manning, who founded Fairy DogParents.
"I've never had to choose between caring for my dogs or caring for myself," said Manning, 39.
...
Get through this, and we'll help you.'
Manning knows how much an ailing dog can cost.
"Having gone through a job loss myself, I thought: 'I'm really glad that we had Ladybug when we did, because we were able to afford it.
"
They couldn't afford to feed them, never mind get them medicine," Manning recalled.
"
I chose to find a way to sponsor other people who could not afford to keep their dog.
Dog owners can apply online for financial help, which is all funded by private donations.
"The money is given directly to the vet or pharmacy," Manning said.
"A lot of the people that we sponsor ... have already lost so much that the one thing they try to hang on to is their dog," Manning said.
And the dog, to them, is some sort of normal or a tie to a happier time.
"We're just completely surprised that they were just able to help us out with the full (sponsorship) amount," Polcari said of the assistance her family received.
This dog is with its family and never had to go into a shelter," Manning said, beaming.
The dog doesn't even know we exist, and we're just making sure it gets to the ball."
