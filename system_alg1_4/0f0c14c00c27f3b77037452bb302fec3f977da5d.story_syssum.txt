Africa is now the fastest growing continent in the world, according a recent report from the African Development Bank.
Spearheading this innovation center is Uyi Stewart, a Nigerian scientist who has spent more than 20 years overseas working on software answers to real-world problems.
"It's easy to talk about giving back but when the opportunity presents itself -- such as IBM Research Africa that allows you to create innovations in science and technology to begin to make a proper impact in the lives of more than a billion people -- I don't know what more can stop anybody," says Stewart.
Stewart went on to work in IBM's Services Innovation Lab -- an international program where he was responsible for the technical strategy at eight global facilities.
"All innovators in the continent of Africa should be problem centric," he says.
If you ask those two questions then we can begin to talk about sustainability."
Stewart says tech entrepreneurs need to be cautious about starting businesses without any commercial foresight.
"Sustainability of innovation comes from commercial viability," he says.
"There is a tremendous potential for skill of impact when you innovate."
