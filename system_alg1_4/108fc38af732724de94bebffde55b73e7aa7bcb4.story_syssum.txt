(CNN) -- Mike Nichols, the award-winning director and pioneering comedian who was one of the few people to win an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony award, died Wednesday evening, according to a note from ABC News' president to its staff.
Nichols was also an outstanding theater director.
He was known as an "actor's director," one able to pull strong performances from his ensemble and capable of seeing things others didn't.
But Nichols saw the character as uncertain and neurotic, qualities Hoffman brought to life on screen.
Nichols was born Michael Igor Peschkowsky in Berlin in 1931.
Nichols attended college in Chicago and later headed back to New York, where he studied acting under famed teacher Lee Strasberg.
Nichols said he took to the stage.
I've never understood it.

He was also the director of the musical "Annie" (1977), which was one of Broadway's longest-running musicals when it closed almost six years later.
Nichols won best director for his work.
"No one was more passionate about his craft than Mike," James Goldston, president of ABC News, said in a note to the staff.
Nichols occupied that rare air in the industry of those who have won the EGOT -- an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony.
And she said: 'No, you're my hero.
In addition to Sawyer, Nichols is survived by his three children -- Daisy, Max and Jenny -- and four grandchildren.
