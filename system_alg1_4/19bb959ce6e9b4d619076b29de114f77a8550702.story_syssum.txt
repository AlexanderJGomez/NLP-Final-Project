Lorna Irungu, 35, had to travel from Kenya to India to receive her third kidney transplant.
Three times she has needed a kidney transplant, and three times her family members insisted on donating.
Irungu says what she couldn't find was a doctor who would do the tricky third transplant in her own country of Kenya.
I'm like, 'We're never gonna get there.'
The cost of a kidney transplant in the United States can be $25,000 to $150,000, also out of Irungu's price range.
Dr. Vijay Kher, the hospital's director of nephrology, first talked to Irungu by phone.
But Irungu made it to India.
Even with the complications that can arise during a third transplant, the cost of it and the weeklong hospital stay in India came to about $8,000.
Irungu said.
"From my experience, the cost here and the quality of care is worth it," Irungu said.
