Relisha Rudd has been missing since March 1, when she was last seen with Kahlil Tatum, a 51-year-old janitor at the homeless shelter where Relisha lived.
Lanier said Relisha was not with Tatum in any of those sightings.
Tatum was a janitor for the homeless shelter where Relisha's family had been staying, and it appears Tatum had permission to be with the girl.
The possible discovery of Tatum's body will not end the search for Relisha, according to Lanier.
"Our primary focus here was to find Relisha," Lanier said Monday.
