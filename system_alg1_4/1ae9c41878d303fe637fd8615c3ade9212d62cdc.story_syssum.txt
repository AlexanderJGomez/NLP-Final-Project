Except Anthony is living for a year in Beijing with a Chinese family.
Their ranks include Shunshun Zhang, 18, who spent three years studying at a high school in Vermont.
Many of my American classmates thought it was insane to leave America and go to school for a year in China.
Before arriving in China, I believed that many locals would be unwelcoming to foreigners like myself but that's totally inaccurate.
The Chinese people I meet are always friendly and willing to help.
Living with a Chinese family has been wonderful.
I consider and treat my host family as if they were my own family at home.
Shunshun Zhang recently graduated after studying at a high school in Vermont for three years.
My three host siblings have helped me a lot in both my academic and social life.
At first, I thought it would be very hard for me to make friends among the high school students but within the first few weeks I was proved wrong.
I grew up in Beijing and I never experienced country life and every family seems like a small part of a bigger family.
For example, we helped stack wood for our neighbor, and my school even has a fund raising day -- every student helped raise money for children in Zimbabwe to go to school.
My high school in the U.S. offers many more diverse classes compared to schools in China.
I was also the editor of the school yearbook.
They treated me as one of their own.
