ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's army said Sunday it has killed 60 "terrorists" as it battles to wrest control of part of the country from the Taliban.
He said the Taliban had killed the Pakistani troops with roadside bombs and in combat.
Pakistan said it was not targeting civilians.
One military official said Pakistani troops seized control of Kotkai, the home village of Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud, where Mehsud has lived with fellow Taliban commander Qari Hussein.
The ground offensive in South Waziristan was launched Saturday morning after the military received clearance from the government, said Gen. Athar Abbas, the Pakistan military spokesman.
Asked by CNN about the potential that the Taliban militants might flee, Abbas said, "there's a huge presence of security forces in the area."

About 28,000 Pakistani soldiers have moved into the epicenter of Taliban activity in the region to counter their activities, officials said.
But despite these efforts, insurgents have continued to strike with relative impunity inside Pakistan, brazenly targeting government, police and security locations.
The attacks heightened internal and international pressure on the government to take swift and effective action.
