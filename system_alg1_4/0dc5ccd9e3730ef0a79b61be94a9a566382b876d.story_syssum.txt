(CNN)  -- China's Olympic gold medal gymnasts have been officially cleared of lying about their ages.
"We have received all we could possibly ask for," FIG secretary general Andre Gueisbuhler told Associated Press.
The Chinese women's gymnastics team won a gold medal in a team competition in Beijing and five members won individual medals.
In Internet searches, "Stryde Hax" allegedly uncovered Web pages showing lists complied by China's General Administration of Sport that show a 1994 date of birth for He.
The New York Times conducted its own investigation, producing similar results that seem to implicate He and two other members of the team.
It was not all good news for the Chinese gymnasts, with the FIG announcing that it would step up its investigation into the 2000 team which won the bronze medal at the Sydney Olympics, particularly Dong Fangxiao and Yang Yun.
Underage gymnasts have been a problem since the 1980s, when the minimum age was raised from 14 to 15 to protect young athletes from serious injuries.
