One health care worker in Orlando began showing symptoms 72 hours after exposure to the MERS patient but did not meet criteria for admission and was sent home, said Dr. Antonio Crespo, an infectious disease specialist at Dr. P. Phillips Hospital, where the MERS patient is being treated.
The two health care workers are among 20 in the Orlando area who may have been exposed to the MERS patient, and they are being tested for the virus, officials said.
Five health team members who may be at risk have been identified at Orlando Regional Medical Center and 15 at Dr. P. Phillips Hospital, Crespo said.
They all report that they're doing great," Michaels said.
The confirmed MERS patient visited Orlando Regional Medical Center on May 5, accompanying another person who was having a medical procedure, officials said.
"Before the patient came to the hospital, he was not having a cough," Crespo said.
Officials from the CDC and the Florida Department of Health are investigating the MERS case.
The Florida patient is also a health care provider who lives and works in Saudi Arabia, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, assistant surgeon general with the U.S. Public Health Service and director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.
They should contact a doctor if they develop symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath and coughing, the CDC said.
As of Friday, there have been 538 cases of MERS in 17 countries, including 145 deaths, according to the World Health Organization, Schuchat said.
The "risk to the general public remains very low," Schuchat said.
Out of "an abundance of caution," the CDC has been contacting people who were passengers on the same flights as the two patients with confirmed MERS, Schuchat said.
"The patient has been doing very well," Crespo said.
