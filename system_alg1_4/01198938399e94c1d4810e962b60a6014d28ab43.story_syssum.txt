(CNN) -- Selena Gomez is ready to show off a new side.
The former "Mouse House" starlet revealed she is most proud of this album because it is the first time she was able to dedicate herself fully to her music.
Before, I would have maybe a month or two to record an album, and I'd have to do my series at the same time and tour on the weekends.
As more former child stars are seen heading down dark and destructive paths, Gomez has always made a conscious effort to keep from falling down the same rabbit hole.
It's a good thing to have a tight group that will keep you in check."
"Stars Dance" is a very personal album, Gomez said.
"I really just want to give it my all.
I want it to be big, but in a grand way, just having my dancers and just bringing it to life."
I'm super-stoked with where this is, and hopefully it will continue to just get better."
