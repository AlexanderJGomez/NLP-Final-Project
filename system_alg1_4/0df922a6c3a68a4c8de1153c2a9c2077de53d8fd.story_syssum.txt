The money came from two funds managed by the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, also known as the Claims Conference, a nonprofit that was established almost 60 years ago to assist those harmed by Nazis.
Six of the 17 people charged Tuesday with fraud and conspiracy are former and currant employees of the Claims Conference, according to Bharara.
Bharara said some 5,000 fraudulent applications worth $18 million were processed through the fund.
"We are outraged that individuals would steal money intended for survivors of history's worst crime to enrich themselves," said Julius Berman, chairman of the Claims Conference.
Sixteen of the 17 people charged Tuesday have been arrested and four of them have admitted their guilt, Bharara said.
