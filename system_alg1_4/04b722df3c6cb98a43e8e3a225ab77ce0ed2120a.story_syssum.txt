(CNN) -- Evidence in the case of a Michigan boy who vanished for nearly two weeks before turning up in his father's basement will not be turned over to prosecutors until at least next week, authorities said Wednesday.
That same day, the boy's father allegedly told investigators that he used a PVC pipe to discipline him, leaving a scar on the boy's chest, according to a petition filed with the Wayne County Department of Health & Human Services.
Mark Magidson, an attorney for the boy's father and stepmother, did not immediately return calls Wednesday seeking comment.
The petition quoted the boy's grandmother as saying that he appeared thin and sickly when she last saw him.
Charles Bothuell IV, and stepmother, Monique, have two other children.
Police said the boy had snacks and a sports drink in the basement.
A lie detector test taken by the father was inconclusive, police said.
Charlie is staying with relatives, police said.
