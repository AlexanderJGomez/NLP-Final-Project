(CNN) -- Last week, the Internet was buzzing with the news that a DNA test of white supremacist Craig Cobb revealed that 14% of his genes originated in sub-Saharan Africa.
When Cobb received the DNA results, he wrote it off.
Well, apparently we aren't talking oil and water, are we Mr. Cobb?
If you were white, you were free; if you were black, you were enslaved.
But this simple social order soon became complicated by miscegenation; and with the rampant increase in racial mixing, the lines between white and black, free and enslaved, became more and more blurred.
Various and varying articulations of the "one-drop rule" emerged: a classification that held that anyone from 1/8 to 1/16 to 1/32 to any known trace of African or black ancestry was to be categorized as black and treated accordingly.
So, what it meant to be white was to be free of "otherness" in general, blackness, specifically.
What that means, then, is that 30% of the folks who call themselves white have much more than one drop, including white supremacist Craig Cobb.
Although the "one-drop rule" in many ways serves foundational to black American racial identity, and has functioned to draw borders around the black community as we know it, one drop of "blackness" -- whatever that is -- does not constitute black identity.
So, while I was thoroughly amused by the sight of Craig Cobb's face when he learned that he, too, is "of African descent," I am clear that those DNA test results do not magically make him black; no number of drops ever could.
