ET shooting, Ohio State University Police Chief Paul Denton said.
Police believe Brown -- a probational employee since October who had received a poor performance review -- entered the building dressed in dark clothing carrying two handguns and began firing into an office suite, Denton said.
About a half-dozen employees were at the building when the shooting occurred, and some witnessed it, authorities said.
E-mail alerts were sent to students warning them about the shooting, the university said.
The shooting comes after the university issued e-mail alerts last week about two alleged sexual assaults and an attempted assault on campus, Ohio State's student newspaper reported.
