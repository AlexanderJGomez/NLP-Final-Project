(Health.com) -- More than one in 10 women develops depression during pregnancy.
"Depression needs to be managed, and for some women, the use of these medications is appropriate and necessary."
The new study, led by Dr. Najaaraq Lund, of Aarhus University, in Denmark, found that babies whose mothers had taken SSRIs were born earlier and were more likely to require treatment in an NICU.
Some, but not all, of these women had suffered from depression.
Babies of women taking SSRIs were born an average of five days earlier than those born to women who had no mental illness, and were twice as likely to be born preterm.
Antidepressant medication is just one part of the equation in addressing women's mental health during pregnancy, notes Oberlander, who says depression in pregnancy is a "huge public health issue" with lasting implications for women and their children.
However, he and Lund agree that it's still unclear whether the differences seen at birth will have lasting effects on a child's development and health.
"As depression itself can influence birth outcome in a negative direction, treatment is warranted in some cases based on the existing body of evidence," Lund says.
