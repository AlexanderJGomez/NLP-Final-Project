Putting the blood onto the testing strip, she saw the results: dangerously low blood sugar.
She yearned for an automatic way of knowing when Elle was dipping into a dangerously high or low blood sugar -- and not just at night, but at school, where the 12-year-old is largely responsible for monitoring her own blood sugar.
Elle was selected to try out an experimental device called an artificial or "bionic" pancreas.
Medical device companies are racing to be the first to market an artificial pancreas, which takes over the work of the diabetic's malfunctioning organ.
It was Elle who urged her mother to enroll her in an artificial pancreas study.
The Shaheens first heard about the artificial pancreas shortly after Elle was diagnosed with diabetes at age 8, but she had to be 12 years old to enroll.
I don't know what's wrong,'" Shaheen says.
Doctors fitted her for an artificial pancreas.
For three days, the device did the work Elle's pancreas can no longer do.
Russell's research partner, Edward Diamano, an associate professor of biomedical engineering at Boston University, says the device learned Elle's blood sugar patterns and made changes accordingly.
"We're extraordinarily impatient for access to the device," Shaheen says.
"That was really hard," Elle says.
The device itself can be worn in a pocket or clipped to a belt.
But "if not properly designed, use of an artificial pancreas device in an outpatient setting can place patients at significant risk."
"We're extraordinarily impatient for access to the device," she says.
