The future isn't hard to excavate in Greece.
"The future is full of opportunity.
In Greece today, the future is mostly characterized by fear rather than opportunity.
In Greece, the "smallest businesses" in an economy still dependent mostly on tourism, are about as multinational as the crumbling remains of the Acropolis.
It's a digital renaissance and it's being pioneered by a new generation of talented young Internet entrepreneurs who are trying to reinvent not only the Greek economy and society, but also Greece's role in today's global economy.
"There's no other option," Tasos Frantzolas, the founder of Soundsnap who splits his time between New York and Athens, told me about this entrepreneurial renaissance in Greece.
In the Greek digital economy, even the smallest business have to be multinational.
Like Doxaras and Frantzolas, Plakopita's confidence in the digital Greek rebirth is rooted in the wealth of human talent in Greece.
The biggest problem, of course, remains the oppressively bureaucratic Greek state that, in spite of the crisis, continues to be a major obstacle to entrepreneurial innovation.
As Stavros Messinis, the co-founder of CoLab told me, Greece remains a "tough environment" for entrepreneurs.
As Warp.ly CEO Doxaras explained, most Greeks -- even its younger generation -- don't "get" the idea that Greece, if it wants to compete in the 21st century global economy, has any other option but to become a start-up nation like Israel.
Oddly enough, a possible Greek exit from the euro is seen by many entrepreneurs as a much a blessing in disguise for their businesses as a catastrophe.
Yet in spite of the danger of a complete economic meltdown, the future remains full of opportunity for Greece's young digital entrepreneurs.
But a country best known for its antiquities might turn out to be a key hub for radical innovation in our digital economy.
