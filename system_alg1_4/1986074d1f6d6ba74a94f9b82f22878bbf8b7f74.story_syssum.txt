Louay Shabana, head of the agency, said more than 22,000 buildings were damaged or destroyed.
Israel said its offensive was aimed at stopping Hamas militants from firing rockets into southern Israel.
The attacks destroyed public sector and private buildings in Gaza, affecting even the United Nations Relief and Works Agency's facilities and halting economic and social services, the statistics agency said.
"The pervasive sense here among the population is one of overwhelming grief, so many families have been destroyed in so many ways," said John Ging, the top United Nations official in Gaza.
"This was not a war against the Palestinians," he said.
Israel began the offensive in response to rocket fire by Hamas militants after showing eight years of restraint, the officer said.
He said seven rockets have been fired from Gaza into Israel since Sunday's cease-fire declaration.
