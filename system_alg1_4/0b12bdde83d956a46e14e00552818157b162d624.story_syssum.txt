Ira Freeman, the chief pharmacist at Key Pharmacy in Los Angeles, testified on the seventh day of a preliminary hearing for Howard K. Stern -- Smith's lawyer and companion -- and co-defendants Dr. Khristine Eroshevich and Dr. Sandeep Kapoor.
Freeman testified that Kapoor faxed to him a list of six drugs that Eroshevich wanted to be sent to the Bahamas, where Eroshevich was treating Smith for anxiety and depression in the days after her son's death.
Freeman said Thompson later told him that he found Eroshevich, a psychiatrist, to be "way out of her league" in her requests for strong drugs for Smith.
Under questioning by the defense, Freeman said that over the previous five years he had filled prescriptions for Smith, he never saw any "red flags" that she was getting dangerous amounts of drugs.
Freeman said he always understood that prescriptions written under the pseudonym "Michelle Chase" were intended for Smith.
Eroshevich, a Los Angeles psychiatrist, traveled to the Bahamas five or six times in 2006 to attend to Smith, he said.
"She was very concerned that we needed to wean her off the medications," Brighthaupt said.
