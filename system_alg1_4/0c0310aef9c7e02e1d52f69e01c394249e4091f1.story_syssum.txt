(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal extinguished any doubts over his long-term fitness after being forced to play two matches in less than 24 hours at the Barcelona Open.
"I'm very happy to be in the semifinals another time in a very important tournament.
Nadal, who lost out in the final of the Monte Carlo Masters to Novak Djokovic last week, is hoping to secure an eighth French Open title next month.
Raonic, who has lost both of his previous encounters with Nadal, overcame Tommy Robredo 6-7 6-3 7-6.
"He had many break points and played really good, but I can rest now for a little bit and we'll see what comes tomorrow in the semi-finals," Almagro told the official ATP website.
In Stuttgart, defending champion Maria Sharapova overcame Serbia's Ana Ivanovic in 7-5 4-6 6-4 to ensure her place in the last four.
The World No.2 will face Germany's Angelique Kerber on Saturday after the home favorite saw off Kazakhstan's Yaroslava Shvedova 6-3 7-6.
"It was extremely important for me to play as well as possible at my home tournament.
Mattek-Sands, ranked 104th in the world, overcame Germany's Sabine Lisicki 6-4 6-2, while Li defeated fifth seed Petra Kvitova 6-3 7-5.
"I saw Bethanie play earlier on and she looks like a good, aggressive, player," Li told reporters.
