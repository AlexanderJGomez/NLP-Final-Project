The man, John Crawford III, was holding an air rifle he had picked up off a store shelf when police shot him.
In the interrogation video, which was first posted on The Guardian's website on Sunday, a police detective repeatedly presses Crawford's tearful girlfriend, asking her where Crawford got the gun he had in the store.
"I swear to God, on my job, my family, on everything I love," Tasha Thomas replies, telling the detective repeatedly that she never saw Crawford with a weapon and that she'll take a polygraph test to prove it.
"Why would he have a gun in the store?"
"Not that I.
The detective says he'll write down her testimony but then asks whether she's under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
"Well, to let you know, John has passed away as a result of this," the detective says.
"I don't know any other way to tell you," Curd says.
"The initial information I had was that (Crawford) may have brought a gun into the store with him.
Wright on Tuesday said his legal team filed a federal civil lawsuit against two police officers; Beavercreek's police chief; the city of Beavercreek and its police department; and Walmart.
Wright said police knew Crawford didn't have a firearm when he walked into the Walmart.
After the grand jury decided in September not to indict the police officers who were involved in the shooting, prosecutor Mark Piepmeier said a "perfect storm of circumstances" led to Crawford's death and noted that the air gun bore a strong resemblance to an actual automatic weapon.
But Wright said that because Crawford was black, police made assumptions.
"They, in their mind, had it made up that Mr. Crawford was a criminal, and they proceeded based on that without doing anything to independently corroborate what was actually happening in the store," he said.
