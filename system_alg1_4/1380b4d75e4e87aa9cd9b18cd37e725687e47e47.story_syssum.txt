House Majority Leader Eric Cantor knew in October about former CIA Director David Petraeus' involvement in an extramarital affair, a spokesman for the congressman told CNN on Sunday.
Petraeus resigned from the CIA on Friday after acknowledging the affair.
During the investigation, other communications surfaced between Petraeus and Broadwell, a married mother of two, according to the official.
The FBI interviewed Petraeus, said the official, who stressed that the CIA director was never the target of the investigation and his communications were never compromised.
According to a congressional aide familiar with the matter, the House and Senate intelligence committees weren't informed that there was an FBI investigation into the situation until Friday.
"If there was an official investigation that was looking, at least in part, at information that was compromising the CIA director, then I think there's a solid argument to say that the committee leadership should have been notified to at least some level of detail."
CNN has confirmed that Petraeus was in Libya recently to meet with the CIA station chief to discuss the Benghazi attack and other issues.
The FBI investigating e-mails, the e-mails leading to the CIA director, and taking four months to find out that the CIA director was involved.
A senior U.S. official said Petraeus' departure wasn't connected to the Benghazi hearing.
He helped turn the tide against insurgents while commanding forces in Iraq and Afghanistan and literally wrote the book on counterinsurgency techniques by overseeing the development of the Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Manual.
