Hayes captured the scene on video while on a walk with his wife along San Francisco Bay, about a mile away.
"Oh, my God," Hayes said as Asiana Airlines Flight 214 tore into the tarmac and skidded across the ground.
He said he had been focusing on a taxiing United Airlines jet when the Asiana flight caught his eye.
"When I caught the plane coming into view, everything looked fine at first until I kind of fixed my gaze on him, and I seen his nose up in the air," Hayes said.
"My initial thought was that with the nose pitched up in the degree that it was that the pilot was maybe trying to divert the landing," said Hayes, who has no background in aviation.
Tilmon, a former jetliner pilot himself, told CNN the pilot showed "a fair amount of skill" in keeping the jet from flipping over.
Hayes said a "thunder-like" sound rang across the bay when the more than 200-foot-long jetliner slammed into the ground.
"The only thing we can say is we're just really happy that a lot of people survived, because it wasn't looking good for them folks on that plane for sure," Hayes said.
