(CNN) -- The legendary Hanging Gardens of Babylon are the inspiration behind an ambitious plan to grow a rooftop forest high above Beirut's crowded streets.
"We want to cover the top of nearly every building in the city with trees," said Melki.
"Even planting just one on each would result in as many trees as there are in New York's Central Park," he said.
"Planting trees in the ground is always preferable, and nothing can replace a wide open space to walk through," said Melki.
Melki estimates the total cost of the project at $3.5-4 million and is currently lobbying for the Wonder Forest via NGO ReAct and a Facebook page.
"Just imagine: The world's first rooftop garden city."
