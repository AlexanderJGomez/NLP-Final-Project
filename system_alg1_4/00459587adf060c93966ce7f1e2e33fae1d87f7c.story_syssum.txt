(CNN) -- A Florida judge sentenced Rachel Wade, the 20-year-old woman convicted of second-degree murder for fatally stabbing her romantic rival in a fight last year, to 27 years in prison Friday.
After a three-day trial and only two and a half hours of deliberation, a jury of five men and one woman convicted Wade of second-degree murder.
"I think about it every day, regardless if they give me five years or 20 years more than they could give me," Wade said.
Hebert said Wade has resolved to teach young people about the dangers associated with social networking.
"I don't think we can appreciate how young people talk," he said.
"There's no face-to-face interaction."
