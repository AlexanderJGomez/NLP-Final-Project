BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN) -- Federal officials said Monday they are probing allegations by a former investigator into the deadliest terrorist attack in Argentine history that he was kidnapped and tortured by men who said they were national intelligence agents.
Lifschitz said his abductors tortured him while asking about the AMIA investigation.
Images of Lifschitz taken after the alleged kidnapping showed bloody marks on his back where the letters 'AMIA' had been scratched.
Lifschitz, who has also worked as a lawyer for Argentine Federal Police, is the former legal secretary for Judge Juan Jose Galeano, who headed the investigation into local connections to the AMIA bombing until he was removed from the case.
Galeano was taken off the AMIA investigation in 2003 and was removed from his position as a judge in 2005.
Menem appeared in federal court Monday on an issue related to the AMIA attack investigation but declined to testify.
"They started to ask about information about the SIDE (State Intelligence Secretariat) related to the AMIA attack," Lifschitz told CNN.
Lifschitz, who said he is a non-practicing Jew, also told CNN the men were interested in his religion.
Jewish leaders from around the world called for an investigation into the attack on Lifschitz.
Earlier this month, an Argentine court ordered the seizure of property owned by a former Iranian diplomat in Buenos Aires sought for his role in the 1994 AMIA attack.
