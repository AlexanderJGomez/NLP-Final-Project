Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea announced Friday that it has detained a U.S. citizen who it says entered the secretive country as a tourist in April and broke the law.
The U.S. State Department said it was "aware of reports that a third U.S. citizen was detained in North Korea."
North Korea said in late April it was holding a different American man, who it claimed came the country seeking asylum.
Other Americans detained in the North have later been released.
