Those of us who know Newt Gingrich tend to describe him as not only intelligent but also charming.
That narrative was front and center again this week as Gingrich explained his remarks to reporters gathered at a New York press conference, emphasizing that he believes the secret to getting America working again is to teach some Americans how to work.
Talk to hugely successful people, Gingrich said, and most of them will say that they got an early start learning about jobs and responsibility and earning money for their labor.
Or you can say that many of these teenagers are unemployable because no one ever taught them the skills necessary to hold down a job.
This subject is as important as they come, and Gingrich deserves credit for kicking off the discussion, especially since he was sure to be pummeled for stating the obvious.
Here's the obvious: Americans have lost their work ethic, and some never had one to lose.
Upper-middle class kids can be harder to motivate, especially if they've never been taught to work by their parents.
You think I'm kidding.
They gave them a list of chores to do to earn their allowances.
Today, parents find it easier to skip the chores and buy their kids what they want, which is no good for anyone and no good for society.
Newt Gingrich had the courage to mention the problem of America's vanishing work ethic, and emphasize the need to restore it.
