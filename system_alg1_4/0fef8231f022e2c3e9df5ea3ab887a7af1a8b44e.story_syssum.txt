A family member found John Chakalos, 87, in his home in Windsor, Connecticut, according a Windsor police department press release.
Windsor police were first to arrive on scene, and the department called in the Connecticut State Police major crimes squad to assist, Lepore said.
Washburn, who has known the Chakalos family for 30 years and worked for them for 25, said she begins working on the display in the second week of August.
Visitors come from as far as an hour away to view the Christmas display, Starbuck said.
The Christmas display will continue this season, Washburn said, but she did not know if the Chakalos family would continue to light up the neighborhood in the future.
