(CNN) -- The body of a University of Georgia professor accused of killing three people was found Saturday buried in woods near Athens, Georgia, authorities said.
The guns are like those authorities believe were used in the shootings, Lumpkin said.
Zinkhan arrived while the Town and Gown event was under way and got into a disagreement with his wife, police said.
After the shooting, Zinkhan left with his children -- ages 8 and 10 -- in the car, police said.
The university fired Zinkhan the day after the shootings.
