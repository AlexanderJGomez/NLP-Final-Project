(CNN) -- By the time police officers reached the swimmer floating off a New Zealand beach, it was already too late: a large shark was biting the lifeless body.
Mose said he believed at least two other sharks had joined in the frenzy around the body after a few minutes.
Shark attacks kill about 25 people a year worldwide, according to the New Zealand Department of Conservation.
There have been fewer than 20 shark attack deaths in more than 175 years in New Zealand, the agency said.
