"He was a gentle, quiet man," Police Chief Thomas Jackson said Friday, referring to Wilson.

It was not known whether Wilson -- an officer for six years, including four in Ferguson -- had been placed on modified assignment.
Brown was African-American; Wilson is white.
Shepard said Wilson "has a huge heart" and cares about people.
The disclosure of the officer's identity was overshadowed by new details from the police implicating Brown as a suspect in a convenience-store robbery that was reported shortly before the shooting.
The claim was immediately greeted with skepticism and anger from some in the community who have accused Ferguson police of attempting a coverup by not releasing details earlier of the shooting or the name of the officer involved.
The Ferguson police chief, before speaking to reporters, told CNN's Don Lemon that the officer was devastated by what had happened.
The documents said Wilson, who was treated for injuries after the shooting, was in the area of the shooting after leaving a report of a sick person when he spotted Brown.
A police officer who responded to the robbery said he identified Brown as the robbery suspect by comparing surveillance images of the incident to the body of the slain teen.
Police have said Brown, who was days away from starting college, according to his family, was killed in a struggle for the officer's gun.
The police chief is white.
The mayor also is white, and so are five of the six city council members.
