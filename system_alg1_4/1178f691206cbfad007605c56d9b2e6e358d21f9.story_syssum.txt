One of the many disturbing aspects of the NSA spying revelations is how much joy they have brought to the world's chronic violators of human rights and political freedoms.
Navalny was particularly worrisome to the Russian president.
But, like other Putin opponents with any possible chance to loosen the president's complete hold on power, he will likely go to prison instead.
They claim it is Washington that leads the world in violating human rights, even as dozens of people who dared protest against Putin's rule face trial or languish in jail, in a country where a number of journalists who criticized the president have turned up dead under mysterious circumstances.
Death didn't save Magnitsky from Russia's courts, which found him guilty of tax fraud just last week.
For Putin, having Snowden in Russia creates many complications, but he has hardly managed to conceal his glee at having America's top critic under his protection.
Snowden and Wikileaks' Julian Assange, Putin said, consider themselves "human rights activist ... fighting for the spread information."

But Russian democrats and human rights activists have a weaker supporter in America now.
Even if you agree with Snowden that the NSA spying is going too far, as I do, it's hard to argue with the negative impact Snowden's revelations have had on human rights activists in other countries.
There are, however, many meaningful differences between America's surveillance excesses and those of Russia, China and their ilk.
When people say, "the Americans are just as bad," they are not only clearly wrong, they are also hurting the cause of political and personal freedom around the globe.
