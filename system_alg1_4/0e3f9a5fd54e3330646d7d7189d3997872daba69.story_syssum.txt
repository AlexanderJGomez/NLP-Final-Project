The bullet came from nowhere, bursting through the frosted-glass window on the family balcony, knocking out one of her teeth, and shattering her family's world.
Her neighbor -- the women looking after Rena can't leave their home unaccompanied by male relatives -- then rushed her to the street, carrying her body.
He stopped the truck he was in, leapt out and ran towards us, Rena bleeding in his arms, and screamed for help.
After a minute that seemed to creep by, the car arrived at the hospital.

In the window was the small hole that the bullet had made.
It was clear to him that it must have been fired from one of the high apartment blocks opposite Rena's home.
The next morning, we returned.
It was hard to believe that the girl we had seen recover, and who appeared so free from the bullet that should have killed her, had died from her wounds.
After an hour, one relative met us outside.
It appears the bullet, which we did not find inside their home, had lodged inside her throat.
