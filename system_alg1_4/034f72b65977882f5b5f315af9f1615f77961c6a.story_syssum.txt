Officials in Washington said Monday they would grant consular access to the U.S.-held suspect in an alleged Iranian plot to assassinate the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States.
The Iranian Foreign Ministry said the accusations were baseless and called for access to the suspect.
"Iran's Foreign Ministry reiterated that any delay by the United States in facilitating consular contact with the Iranian national would be contrary to the logic of international law and the United States' obligations," the Foreign Ministry said.
The State Department said last week there had been direct contact with Iran about the alleged plot, but a senior Iranian official denied it.
And he asserted that Iran had never been involved in terrorist operations, the Islamic Republic News Agency said.
"They (the U.S.) want to isolate Iran," Khamenei said over chants of "Down with America" in a speech Saturday before thousands in Gilangharb, Iran.
"It's sloppy.
It's uncharacteristic," Aslan said.
