"That's my favorite part of the circus," Dutch photographer Wiesje Peels said.
Peels' fascination with the circus began as a child.
It's what the majority of Peels' work focuses on, something she calls "in between worlds."
At first, she shot the expected -- the splendor of the circus act.
The images capture a "glimpse of the hidden life of the performing artist."
He emanates an "unavoidable authenticity," Peels says.
"There's the home life and the artist life," Peels says.
"So do you."
Wiesje Peels is a photographer based in the Netherlands.
