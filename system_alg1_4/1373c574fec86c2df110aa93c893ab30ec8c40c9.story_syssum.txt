(CNN) -- A San Francisco man accused of possessing bomb-making materials in his apartment also bought lethal toxins online, the FBI said in documents unsealed Friday.
Chamberlain bought abrin from a seller in Sacramento in December, the documents allege.
He said he planned to use the poison to "ease the suffering" of cancer patients, according to the documents.
Nicotine can be used to poison food and water, according to the CDC.
If convicted of the illegal destructive device possession charge, he faces up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
