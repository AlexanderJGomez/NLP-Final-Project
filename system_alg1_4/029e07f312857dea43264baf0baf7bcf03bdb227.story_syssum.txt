(CNN) -- The president of Guinea-Bissau was assassinated Monday morning, a day after an explosion killed the head of the West African country's military, the prime minister said.
Army spokesman Zamora Induta said an aide to the president was killed during the gunfire.
Gen. Tagme Na Waie, chief of Guinea-Bissau's military, was killed in a bomb explosion in his office Sunday, according to local news reports.
"The secretary-general strongly condemns these violent acts, which have occurred soon after successful legislative elections which paved the way for enhanced U.N. support to the country's peace-building efforts," the statement said.
Monday's development is the latest violence over four months as the army and Guinea-Bissau's president have clashed.
In 1980, Vieira became president after a military coup.
In 1994, the country held its first free elections, and Vieira was elected president.
