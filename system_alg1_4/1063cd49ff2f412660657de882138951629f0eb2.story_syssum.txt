The vigil was held just hours after authorities said they found human remains in an area where they had been searching for 17-year-old Chelsea King.
Her car, with her cell phone inside, was found at the park, Plese said.
Gore said the body was found in a heavily wooded area not visible from nearby homes.
"They were holding out hope as we all were that we would find Chelsea alive," he said.
Gore said he expected to have positive identification of the body by Wednesday.
