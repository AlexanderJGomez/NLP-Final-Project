But no shots were fired when Mexican federal police captured alleged Juarez Cartel boss Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, authorities said Thursday.
But once he realized he'd been found out, Carrillo Fuentes admitted who he was, Rubido said.
Analysts have said the Juarez Cartel's influence had been waning after a lengthy battle for territory with the Sinaloa Cartel.
But at one time, the Juarez Cartel was one of the most powerful in Mexico.
Authorities said last week that they arrested Hector Beltran Leyva, leader of the Beltran Leyva Cartel, while he was dining in a seafood restaurant in San Miguel de Allende.
"He was one of the most important of the most important that Mexican justice had to capture," he said.
