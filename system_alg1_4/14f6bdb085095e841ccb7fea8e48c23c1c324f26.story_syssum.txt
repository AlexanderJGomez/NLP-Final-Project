Rows upon rows of giant robot arms weave in and out of a tightly packed assembly line of unpainted car skeletons.
From a second floor glass bridge inside Toyota's Motomachi plant, our tour group stares down at production lines on either side of us, noses pressed to the glass.
This giant factory full of giant robots produces cars for the world's best selling automaker -- Toyota sold 9.98 million vehicles in 2013.
Located two train rides and a short cab trip from Nagoya, the tour begins at the Toyota Kaikan Museum, a bland-looking building at the automaker's headquarters.

He tells me he once ran a chocolate factory in Holland that adopted the Toyota Production System; he's always wanted to check out the production line in person.
The welding factory is the site of the Terminator-like scene of robotic arms working as fire and sparks shoot over car frames.
After the welding plant, many more human workers fill the assembly line.
These sounds are actually part of a "Just in Time" pull system.
Another geeky fact shared by our guide: Toyota invented a "doorless system," meaning they take the doors off the cars so that workers can get in and out of the car more quickly to assemble parts.
I buy one, of course -- at least under factory conditions, everything Toyota produces looks incredible.
