After working with thousands of men all around the world, I have found that the common issue holding men back with women is that "thing" on top of their shoulders.
Not so, my friend.
Just because a woman is hot does not mean that her life is perfect.
As a woman, I know this to be very true.
What women are really attracted to has nothing to do with appearance.
Women DO NOT like bad boys.
I can tell you that if the right man with the right character came up to me and said "banana, banana, banana," I would giggle like a little schoolgirl and instantly feel attraction for him.
Women want to be approached, as long as it's by the right person.
Women want you to respect them, not admire them.
Respect yourself first, and women will follow.
Sitting on your couch watching "Law & Order" is not going to bring you results with women.
