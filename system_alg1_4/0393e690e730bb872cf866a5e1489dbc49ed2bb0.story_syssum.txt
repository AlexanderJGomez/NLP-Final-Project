Australian Professor Ian Frazer has developed a vaccine to prevent cervical cancer and is working on a vaccine for skin cancer.
There are two types of lung cancer: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC).
Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, with 1.2 million new cases every year.
Surgery on non-small cell lung cancers is more common than in small cell lung cancer, but can still only happen in a minority of cases.
Skin Cancer  Skin cancer is a malignant growth on the skin.
Skin cancer is the most diagnosed form of the disease, surpassing lung, breast, colorectal and prostate cancer.
Treatment depends on the circumstances of the cancer and the patient; including age, type of cancer and location.
Treatments can include, amongst others, radiotherapy (radiation), chemotherapy (pills) and surgery.
Breast cancer is a disease in which malignant cells form in the breast tissue, leading to damage to the cells' DNA.
The World Health Organization states that breast cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer deaths, causing 502,000 deaths worldwide in 2005.
Once a lump has been identified as malignant, the most common treatments are surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy.
A quarter of all new cases of cancer diagnosed in British men are prostate cancers.
Treatment options for prostate cancer depend on the age of the man, his health and the spread of the cancer.
Colorectal cancer, also called colon cancer or large bowel cancer, includes cancerous growths in the colon, rectum and appendix.
If performed at a late stage or when the cancer has already spread, colorectal cancer is unlikely to be cured with surgery.
