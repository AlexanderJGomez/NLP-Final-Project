(CNN) -- The fight to block construction of the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline through east Texas stepped up Monday as protesters locked themselves to machinery.
Two others were arrested when they tried to block a cherry picker crane to remove the protesters from the trees, Nuss said.
All of the blockade protesters were removed from the construction sites by 2 p.m. and 12 of them were arrested, he said.
Actress Daryl Hannah was arrested last month in Wood County, Texas, when she and another woman tried to stop a bulldozer from clearing land along the pipeline path.
