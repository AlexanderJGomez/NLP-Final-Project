(CNN) -- The woman who scrambled to safety after a small plane crashed into her Florida home gave thanks to God on Saturday for allowing her to escape without a scratch and for keeping her family safe.
A little bruise from taking a tumble through the window, but other than that, I'm fine.
"From what we've been told, the pilot was having some malfunctions in flight," said Chief Investigator Terry Duprie of the National Transportation Safety Board.
The crash caused an intense fire that incinerated much of the plane, something that will make the investigation difficult, Duprie said.
Crockett said she was getting ready to leave her house when something told her to stop.
It's blackened, but intact, she said.
"I'm just praising God that I'm alive," Crockett said Saturday.
