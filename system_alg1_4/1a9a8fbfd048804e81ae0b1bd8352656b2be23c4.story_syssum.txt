With 56 million passengers passing through last year, it's the third busiest airport in Europe and claims to serve more international destinations than any other airport in the world.
And more than 18,000 items of baggage travel along its 73 kilometers of conveyor belts every hour.
And a single A380 can require up to 1,200 in-flight meals -- prepped and cooked by the airport's chefs.
While most meals for economy class are deep frozen, for business and first-class passengers food is freshly prepared on the day.
Maik Herodek, section manager of LSG Skychefs, a catering company at Frankfurt Airport, says its hard to create plane food that isn't plain.
There's just one chance to deliver good food on a plane."
