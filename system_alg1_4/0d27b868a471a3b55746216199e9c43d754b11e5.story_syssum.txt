Are you involved in your kid's school?
Alex has been in school for a week now.
A form also came home in Alex's kindergarten folder to sign up to be the class mom.
I don't have the time or desire to be that much of a super mom (for now), but I do want to be involved.
And the PTA seems like a no-brainer, right?
I try not to do anything half assed but I also have a tendency to not say no enough.
At all.
Are you involved in yours?
Is it anything like you see in the movies with cliques and mean-girl behavior?
And also to do things that get you face time with the teacher—staff appreciation, for example—because, well, that one is self explanatory, especially given my worries about Alex's pain in the ass-ness.
When did you get involved and what's your experience been like?
