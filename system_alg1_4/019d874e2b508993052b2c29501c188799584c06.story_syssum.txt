(CNN) -- Tiger Woods' former caddy Steve Williams has issued an apology after apparently making racially tinged remarks at an awards dinner in Shanghai, China.
However I assure you that was not my intent.
His agent Mark Steinberg said in a statement: "I was with Tiger when the story broke.
However, Scott told reporters that he would not be taking any action.
I think everything in that room last night was all in good spirits and a bit of fun, and I think it probably got taken out of that room in the wrong context.
I don't really think that stuff has ever left the room before and it's probably good reasons why.
Former U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell told the UK Press Association that he did not believe Williams had intended to make a racial remark.
"I don't think Stevie Williams was trying to be racial.
I don't think it was a racial comment.
