(CNN) -- Some of golf's biggest names failed Friday to make the cut at the U.S. Open, victims of the Olympic Club's unforgiving roughs and slick greens.
Furyk, winner of the 2003 U.S. Open, said he will be ready for the weekend.
McIlroy seemed to have a birdie putt set up nicely to get him to eight over.
"You really have to be so precise out there, and if you're not, you're going to get punished," McIlroy told reporters.
Five-time U.S. Open runner-up Mickelson barely made the cut by ending at 7 over.
Donald said his game was off both Thursday and Friday.
Casey Martin, playing his first major since the U.S. Open at the same venue in 1998, missed the cut by one shot.
