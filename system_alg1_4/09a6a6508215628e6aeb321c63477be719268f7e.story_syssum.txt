But the full story of Thursday's gruesome beheading at an Oklahoma food processing plant -- especially why it happened -- is still waiting to be told.
Answers may come from Nolen himself.
The attack happened very soon after Nolen learned he'd lost his job.
Lewis also said there may be other information about Nolen's past, that he could not reveal, that might help explain the incident, and that the FBI had been called in to dig deeper into Nolen's background.
The large, rectangular Vaughan Foods processing plant looks like many others from the outside: a no-frills design, nondescript front entrance and loading bays out back.
Some of this drama could be heard in a 911 call released Friday by the city of Moore.
"He wasn't targeting anyone, wasn't going specifically after them," the police spokesman said.
"It appears they were just in his way as he came in."
There's no indication that the suspect, Nolen, was armed with anything other than a knife.
The idea that a man who's been trying to convert others to Islam ends up beheading someone is alarming enough, but perhaps even more given what has been happening in the Middle East.
That said, it's not known if Nolen's religion had anything, at all, to do with what happened Thursday.
As of Friday, all U.S. law enforcement officials said was that there are no indications linking the Moore attack to terrorism.
