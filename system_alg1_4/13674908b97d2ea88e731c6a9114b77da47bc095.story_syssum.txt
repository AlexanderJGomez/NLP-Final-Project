(CNN) -- Muttiah Muralitharan made history with his final ball in Test cricket by becoming the first bowler to reach 800 wickets as Sri Lanka thrashed bitter rivals India.
The 38-year-old was then carried from the pitch in Galle by his teammates, and received a rapturous ovation from the crowd.
Muralitharan dismissed Harbhajan Singh but looked as if he may be left on 799 wickets as VVS Laxman was run out to leave India nine wickets down.
Despite further episodes of controversy Muralitharan kept picking up wickets.
