It wasn't until the Industrial Revolution that men began to work outside the home, tethering women to household responsibilities and child rearing.
My thesis was that attitudes toward motherhood changed as the care of children became the exclusive responsibility of mothers.
Nevertheless, I had internalized the values of my culture, and my own scholarship could not help me override this.
Why?
Mayer's decision was portrayed as limiting work-life flexibility for mothers, who may need to be at home -- or prefer to be at home -- with their children.
Maternal employment continues to pose a threat to our strongly held belief about motherhood -- it is natural for mothers, not fathers, to have primary responsibility for raising children.
When women are pregnant, people ask them, but not the fathers of their children, whether they plan to return to work.
The cost to women is great in lost opportunity.
There are only 21 women leading Fortune 500 companies, and according to a recent McKinsey survey, only 18% of women managers want to be CEO, compared with 36% of men.
By encouraging women to "lean in," some, such as Slaughter, say Sandberg is placing undue burden on individual women.
Our implicit biases limit the aspirations of men and women alike.
Only then will we change our culture.
