Officials were no longer confident in his effectiveness, said Col. Jim Slife, commander of the 1st Special Operations Wing.
Slife said the new squadron commander has extensive history in the Osprey program.
The Osprey was assigned to the 1st Special Operations Wing, the Air Force said.
The Marines deployed them in Iraq in 2007 after 18 years and $20 billion in development.
