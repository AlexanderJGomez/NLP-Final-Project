Brian Sterner has been using a wheelchair since a 1994 wrestling accident.
Sterner had been picked up by sheriff's deputies on a warrant for a charge of fleeing and attempting to elude police in an incident in October of last year, his attorney said.
Sterner spent five days in the jail's infirmary before being released on $2,000 bond, Trevena said.
"The incident involving Mr. Sterner was not caused by a lack of training or procedure," the sheriff's statement said.
Trevena said his client would likely not file a lawsuit in the matter, because Gee has pledged to "make it right."
Trevena said Gee is handing the matter over to the state's attorney to review for possible criminal charges.
Sterner took his story to WTSP a few days after he was released from custody, his attorney said, and the station obtained the booking video from the sheriff's department.
