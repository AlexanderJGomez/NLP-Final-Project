McDonald's and Target dropped an egg supplier this week after an activist group released disturbing video showing what it says shows animal cruelty at three of the company's barns.
We take this responsibility -- along with our customers' trust -- very seriously.
Sparboe Farms launched an internal investigation upon learning about the undercover video, which was shot by an animal activist hired under false pretenses, according to Beth Sparboe Schnell, president and owner of Sparboe Farms.
"I was deeply saddened to see the story because this isn't who Sparboe Farms is.
The company said it responded to the FDA, which in turn told Sparboe Farms that some of the corrective actions it took were insufficient.
The egg industry has been a frequent target of animal rights groups, which accuse suppliers of keeping hens in unusually cruel conditions, and have sometimes used undercover videos to prove their point.
Those that survive are then kept in small wire cages, or battery cages, that are so small as to prevent them from lifting their wings, it says.
Wright County Egg recalled 380 million eggs, while Hillandale Farms recalled 170 million eggs.
