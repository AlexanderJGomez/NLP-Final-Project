Stephen Colbert's trip to Iraq, facilitated by the USO, was six months in the planning.
The organization, which was founded in 1941 to bring comfort and entertainment to America's men and women in uniform, has been focusing its support on American troops stationed around the world, particularly those in the military theaters of Iraq and Afghanistan, said Phillips.
Petraeus liked the idea, said Tischler, and the principals were put in touch with the USO.
He also put in a plug for USO donations: "The USO does more than bring my show to Baghdad," Colbert said on the show.
"We're primarily a volunteer organization," he said, noting the USO has fewer than 400 paid employees and 25,000 volunteers.
Jamie Masada, the owner of Los Angeles' Laugh Factory comedy club, said the organization is close to his heart.
A number of performers return again and again.
Toby Keith has gone on at least seven USO tours; "He insists on going to the smallest, most remote places," said Phillips.
At its core, Phillips said, the USO remains dedicated to the needs of U.S. service members.
"Service members in Iraq and Afghanistan are frequently at small, remote bases," said Phillips.
