Henning, a big-hearted taxi driver from Bolton, northern England, was part of a team of volunteers traveling from Britain to Syria to deliver aid to people in need.
While part of the aid convoy stopped at the Turkish border, Henning was part of a much smaller group that volunteered to press ahead into Syria itself.
Henning was kidnapped by ISIS a day after the video was made.
The coalition of Muslim communities is appealing to ISIS and the people around them to persuade the militants to change their ways, according to Mustafa Field, Director of Faiths Forum for London, one of the signatory organizations to the petition.
"John, we as Muslims are here to preserve lives," Field told CNN.
"We beg you to tread the path of justice and show him the compassion in the heart of believers and in your heart," Abu Abdullah said.
"Young British Muslims are sick and tired of the hate-filled propaganda the terrorists ISIS and their supporters churn out on social media," Qadir said.
