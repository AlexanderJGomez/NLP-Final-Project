And why shouldn't they?
But that handshake that seemed so firm and reassuring online?
In the movie, Schulman meets and falls in love with a woman online who is not exactly (or at all) who she says she is.
Here are some of the lessons Schulman and Joseph have learned along the way.
"If the person is hesitant or reluctant, reconsider meeting," Joseph says.
Joseph says you may want to reconsider if:
"You would be shocked how casual people tend to be when meeting their online crushes and you don't wanna feel awkwardly overdressed," Schulman says.
"The last thing you want is some stranger knowing where you live," he says.
Better to make it a social event and go bowling or something," Schulman suggests.
"You never how things will go down," Joseph notes.
