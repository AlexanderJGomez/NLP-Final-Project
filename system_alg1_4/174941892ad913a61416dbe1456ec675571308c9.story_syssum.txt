Delbert Belton was in the parking lot outside the Eagles Lodge in Spokane on Wednesday night, waiting for a friend to pick him to go bowling, when the two teens robbed and assaulted him, leading to his death, police Chief Frank Straub Jr. said.
"...I don't really care, to be perfectly honest with you, what their motive was.
"We're hoping that he surrenders," the police chief said.
One who did was Ted Denison, who called himself "mechanic buddies" having worked on cars alongside Belton for over 20 years.
According to the 42-year-old Denison, Belton never had problems outside the lodge before -- no threats, no altercations, nothing -- until Wednesday night.
He didn't didn't dress in expensive clothes.
"What did they think they were going to get from this man?"
