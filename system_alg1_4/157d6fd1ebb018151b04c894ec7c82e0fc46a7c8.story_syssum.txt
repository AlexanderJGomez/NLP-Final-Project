(CNN) -- Urban transport in Bolivia's administrative capital of La Paz has always been about what goes up and down.
The La Paz urban gondola will consist of three separate service lines stretching across a combined 10.7 kilometer (6.1 mile) area of the city.
With individual pods traveling at a speed of 18 kilometers per hour (11 mph), the gondola aims to offer a transit system many times faster than more traditional modes of city transportation.
Cost benefits like these have been key in convincing South American cities like La Paz that urban gondolas are a viable and economical transport solution.
Medellin's Metrocable, which connects some of the city's poorest districts with its main metro line, was even recognized as a key factor in the Colombian city winning the prestigious Urban Land Institute 'Most Innovative City of the Year' award in early 2013.
"Being able to connect people from an island, which is what these barrios often are, to the wider city where they can access economic, social and cultural opportunities, that's the real value," Dale said.
Many skeptics point to the "cable car" system built in East London to connect the O2 Arena and the ExCel Exhibition Centre across the River Thames during the 2012 Olympic Games as an example of an urban gondola project gone wrong.
This is massively greater than the revenue from fares income."
Although critical of the London project, Biggs believes the gondola concept itself can still offer a valuable urban transit option if constructed in locations where there is demand and the economic case can be justified.
