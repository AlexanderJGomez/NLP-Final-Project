GARDINER, Montana (CNN)  -- More than half of Yellowstone National Park's bison herd has died since last fall, forcing the government to suspend its annual slaughter program.
Government officials say the slaughter prevents the spread of the disease brucellosis from the Yellowstone bison to cattle on land near the park.
Previously, under the Interagency Bison Management Plan, wandering bison were sent to slaughter without being tested for brucellosis.
"The plan requires all of us to do two things: protect a viable wild bison population and reduce the risk of transmission of brucellosis from bison to cattle.
There is no documented case of the disease passing from bison to cattle, they said.
Yellowstone is the only place in the lower 48 states where a bison population has persisted since prehistoric times, according to the Park Service.
Bison graze high on Yellowstone's grassy plateaus during the summer.
"Bison are bison.
There's limited tolerance for bison outside the boundaries of Yellowstone National Park."
Control of the bison population is essential, Davis said.

Meanwhile, hundreds of bison are rounded up inside the park every winter and slaughtered to reduce competition for food and therefore the need for animals to wander onto private land.
"The Montana cattle ranchers don't want the competition for grass," he said.
"The reality of the situation is that whether you have 4,000 bison or whether you have 200 bison, bison are a nomadic species and they will always be looking out to the horizon and expanding their boundaries," said Tim Reid, chief deputy ranger at Yellowstone.
"It is our job to protect the viability of this population," the Park Service's Nash said.
"The Yellowstone bison population is healthy, it's strong, it's vibrant.
