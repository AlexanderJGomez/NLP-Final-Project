(CNN) -- So it looks like President Obama got the message.
But by the end of the debate, he had checked off pretty much every item on his list of "Things I Should Have Done in Denver."
Both substantively and stylistically, Romney operated in Obama's shadow in this match, second banana to the president's leading man.
Clearly this was not the role Romney intended to play.
The town hall debate was a particularly inappropriate setting for Romney to display this side of himself.
Romney's chief problem was that he did not connect to the audience as effectively as Obama did.
After the president brought up his rival's overseas investments, Romney cited Obama's own holdings: "Have you looked at your pension?"
The governor's response might have been written by the staff of "Saturday Night Live:" "President Bush and I are different people and these are different times," he said.
Before this debate, I wondered whether Obama would acknowledge the elephant in the room: his shoddy performance in Round 1.
