Police said that a man broke into the Mosman, Australia, home of the woman, later identified as Madeleine Pulver, on August 3 and attached what she then believed to be a bomb.
"The information that I have is that the suspect was surprised" to be arrested, said Assistant Commissioner David Hudson.
But Hudson said that he is an Australian citizen who frequently traveled to the United States on business.
The suspect is expected to be arraigned Tuesday morning in a U.S. court, said Hudson.
"The motto for (the New South Wales police force) simply says, translated, 'Justice swiftly follows crime,' " said Scipione.
"You've seen that today."
