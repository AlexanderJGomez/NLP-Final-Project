His heroic showing overshadowed Kimi Raikkonen's first victory since 2009, and ended the Finn's slim hopes of a second world title ahead of the final two races.
We had to fight through the laps, then we had a good strategy that gave us a chance for the victory, but second was the maximum," Alonso said.
"I'm gutted.
It was a thrilling grand prix, up and down all the time," said Vettel, who won in Abu Dhabi in 2009-10 but retired last year with his second world title already in the bag.
Webber's DNF meant that Red Bull will have to wait another race before clinching a third successive manufacturers' title -- holding a lead of 82 points over Ferrari with 86 still on offer.
Massa, who has had his Ferrari contract extended by another year, was seventh ahead of Bruno Senna -- who gave Williams a second driver in the top 10 despite an early collision with Sauber-bound Nico Hulkenberg.
"It's been a hard season, not an easy time, but hopefully this gives us more belief," said Raikkonen, who will stay at Lotus for the second year of his contract.
