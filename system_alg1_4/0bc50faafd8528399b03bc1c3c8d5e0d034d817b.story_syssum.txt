In April, video of a U.S. military helicopter strike in Iraq that killed two Reuters journalists raised questions about the attack, as well as how WikiLeaks got the military tapes.
In a secret 2008 report leaked to WikiLeaks, the U.S. Army Counterintelligence Center called the website a potential threat to U.S. forces and counterintelligence efforts.
At the same time, Assange said, WikiLeaks always provides to the public all the video or documents available so that viewers can decide for themselves.
It claims never to have fallen for a forgery.
Assange, an Australian journalist depicted in media reports as a former computer hacker, described WikiLeaks in a January interview as run by five or so full-time people supported by hundreds of volunteers.
For its own legal troubles, Assange said, WikiLeaks relies on lawyers donated by mainstream media outlets including The Associated Press and the Los Angeles Times.
The website's biggest U.S. splash was the April posting of what it said was video from a U.S. helicopter involved in an attack in Baghdad that killed nine people -- including the two Reuters journalists -- and wounded two children.
He allegedly owned up to leaking other items to WikiLeaks, including the classified Army document assessing the threat level of the website, as well as State Department cables, according to the article
