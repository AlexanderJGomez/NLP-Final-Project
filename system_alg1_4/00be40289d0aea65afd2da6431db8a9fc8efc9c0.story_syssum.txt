Atlanta's FBI field division topped Los Angeles in reporting the most bank heists, with 350 for the 12 months ending September 30, 2007, according to the FBI, which annually names areas most prone to bank robberies.
Just Thursday, two suspects overpowered a security guard at an Atlanta, Georgia, bank, took his gun, robbed the bank and fled with money in hand, police said.
Two more armed bank robberies took place in metro Atlanta Friday.
A recent Atlanta Business Chronicle article reported that metro Atlanta has 26 more banks than in all of North Carolina -- roughly one bank for every 3,500 people in the region.
"We would attribute a lot of that [bank robberies] to the growth and the fact that the banking industry has matched that growth with an increase in bank branches throughout the area," Emmett said.
According to the FBI, its Atlanta field division reported 350 bank robberies in the last year -- the most notorious of which were the "Barbie Bandits" and "Grandpa Bandit" robberies.
While Emmett said there is no "typical" bank robber, he said he has seen some trends, most notably that they are often people battling drug addictions.
Two women dubbed the "Barbie Bandits" were arrested after working with a bank employee to rob a Bank of America in the Atlanta suburb of Acworth.
Emmett says typically very little money is taken in a bank heist.
But Brannen says profiling people like that can be problematic.
He said customers want to come into a bank unimpeded -- that 99.9 percent are just customers, not bank robbers.
Emmett said as long as metro Atlanta continues to grow, so will the number of bank robberies.
