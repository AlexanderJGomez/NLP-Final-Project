President Obama greets people Saturday during breakfast at Osu Castle in Accra, Ghana.
The messages, from Ghana, Sudan and South Africa respectively, were among more than 5,000 sent to Barack Obama during his first visit as president to sub-Saharan Africa.
Three journalists from South Africa, Senegal and Kenya will vet the questions and provide a few to Obama, who will address them on African radio stations and via a Web video Monday, the White House said.
Most of the text messages were coming from South Africa, according to a log on the White House Web site.
"We r disappointed that you have not chosen Nigeria as your first African point of call," one text said.
