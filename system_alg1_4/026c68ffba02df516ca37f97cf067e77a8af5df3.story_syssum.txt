As darkness enveloped Medinah Country Club in Chicago, Europe's captain Olazabal talked of how the spirit of Seve Ballesteros had been key to his team's success.
"The thing that Europe had -- distinct to the United States -- was the notion of playing for Seve, and teams are often at their best when playing for an idea," says Tu, whose book 'Superteams' will be published next month.
After all, could the power and pulling together of the U.S. team match his story?
With Justin Rose looking up to the heavens in triumph, Sergio Garcia suggesting that Seve 'was with me all day' after his win and Europe's star man Ian Poulter saying he owed his presence on the team to Ballesteros, Olazabal's unorthodox approach to captaincy produced compelling results.
"Compared to Montgomerie, Olazabal was all about emotion -- connecting with individuals on a very visceral level," he said.
Despite that glitch, Tu believes Olazabal built a team where belief became an intrinsic value and where his man management skills produced inspired results.
Tu highlighted the way in which Martin Kaymer put a disappointing season behind him to emerge as the effective match-winner, as the German coolly sank a pressurized putt on the 18th to beat Steve Stricker and ensure that Europe retained the Ryder Cup.
"This would have liberated Kaymer -- and just look at the way both he and Stricker handled the pressure in their clash late on.
"The better questions to ask might be how teams from Europe consistently pull rabbits out of their hats at these Ryder Cups.
"If it were just this U.S. team that lost when on paper it seemed to have the better players, the blame might be easier to assign.
