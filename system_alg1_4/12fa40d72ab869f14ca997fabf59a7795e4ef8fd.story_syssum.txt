Oak Creek, Wisconsin (CNN) -- Members of the Sikh temple where six people died in a weekend rampage swept, scrubbed and painted over damage to their building Thursday after investigators allowed them back inside.
Page killed himself in the parking lot of the suburban Milwaukee gurdwara after being shot by a police officer, the FBI said Wednesday.
"Simply put, our families -- his mother, who left behind two beautiful boys ... our father, the four other victims, the people who were shot and are in the hospital, the police officer who did his job -- they are heroes," he said.
In addition to the six dead, three people -- two temple members and a police officer who responded to Sunday's attack -- remained hospitalized Thursday.
The condition of Santokh Singh, 50, was upgraded to serious, the hospital said.
"It's easy to be polite to say 'We're so sorry this happened' and give the same speech at the next killing a month from now," Jackson said.
A CNN/ORC International poll released Thursday indicates that the public remains divided on gun laws, with 50% saying they favor no restrictions or only minor restrictions on firearm ownership and 48% supporting major restrictions or a complete ban by individuals except police and other authorized personnel.
