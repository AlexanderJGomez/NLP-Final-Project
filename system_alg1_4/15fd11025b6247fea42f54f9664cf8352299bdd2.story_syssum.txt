Married couples are connecting in any way they can.
"You just don't realize how much time you give up when you have kids," says Jenny Triplett, 45.
Finding time together is key to making a marriage work.
"The happiest parents are those who are disciplined about integrating their old life with their new life," says relationship expert and psychologist Seth Meyers.
"I married him, and he married me, because we actually like each other, and we like spending time with each other," Charly says.
So they cherish the time they spend together on weekends.
"When you go into a kitchen on a Saturday, and you're spending the day cooking, you really tend to let go of a lot of other things," Jason Rok says.
But spending time together is only part of the process.
"Once the kids go ... it's going to be you and her," Rufus Triplett says.
"If you don't learn how to communicate then (when the kids live at home), it's going to be challenging when they go."
"That gets people out of the pattern of only talking about money when there is a crisis," she says.
She says that couples need to realize that they'll be in their relationship for the long haul.
In addition to honesty, communication and kindness, she says spending time with her husband, despite work demands, is their key to longevity.
She says their secret is learning to ebb and flow together, rather than apart.
"It's pretty awesome," she says.
"When we are together, we're really together," she says.
