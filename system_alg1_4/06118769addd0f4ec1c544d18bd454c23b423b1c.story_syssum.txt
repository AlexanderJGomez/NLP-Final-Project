In a record-setting month, it won't be the worst storm that Boston has ever seen, but it will just compound the exasperation caused by three -- now four -- weather systems that have dumped piles of snow on the city.
From New York's Long Island to Maine, millions of people will find themselves under blizzard warnings.
-- Light snow, relatively speaking: Compared with other storms, this won't be as big a snow event for Boston.
Sustained winds of 30 to 40 mph will cause the snow to blow around and hamper visibility.
So are parts of eastern Maine, where gusts of 60 mph are possible and up to 26 inches of snow.
-- No mass transit Sunday: MBTA, better known to many as the T, won't run Sunday, when the worst of the weather will be hitting.
"Travel will become nearly impossible," the National Weather Service is saying.
The snow will be a light snow, so it will fly around easily in the strong winds.
Already, more than 350 flights have been canceled for Sunday.
The governor is giving you an extension.
"Wintry precipitation possible early next week," the National Weather Service in Atlanta said.
-- Record month: With 42.3 inches of snow recorded this month, Boston has already had the snowiest February on record and with the first inch of Saturday's snow, this month will become the snowiest of any month in Boston history, at least since records have been kept since 1872.
