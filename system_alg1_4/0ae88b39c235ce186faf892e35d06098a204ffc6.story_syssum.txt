Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- In 1998, Kevin Warwick became what some people call "the world's first cyborg."
This isn't just for fun, Warwick tells Motherboard.tv, VBS' technology channel.
Warwick doesn't want to turn into a robot: He wants to be a better human.
Already the latest bionic technologies are allowing deaf children to hear and disabled war veterans to run again.
"Technology, directly integrated with the brain, can help overcome some problems people have," says Warwick.
Someday, says Warwick, humans could become "a curiosity for the machines."
