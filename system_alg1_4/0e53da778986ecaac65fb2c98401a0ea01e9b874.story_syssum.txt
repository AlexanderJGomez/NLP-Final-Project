London, England (CNN) -- British Prime Minister David Cameron will discuss BP, whose leaking well has caused the worst oil spill in U.S. history, when he speaks by phone with U.S. President Barack Obama this weekend, Cameron's office at Downing Street said Friday.
I wouldn't make it a British thing, because BP is not a British company anymore, they are an international company.
"I do think that it starts to become a matter of national concern if a great British company is being continually beaten up on the international airwaves," he said, adding that the disaster is the result of an accident that BP is trying to remedy.
"Just about everything they've said at some point has turned out to be wrong.
Crowley denied Thursday that Obama or the United States is "Britain-bashing" and said it would probably be a topic the president discusses with Cameron on the phone.
"It is not going to affect our relationship between the United States and Britain."
