(CNN) -- Authorities in some Afghan prisons are torturing detainees into confessions, using methods that meet the international definition of torture, according to a new U.N. report.
UNAMA documented one death in government custody due to torture in April 2011, the report says.
"Despite their cruel and barbaric acts," terrorists are being treated "humanely and in accordance with the law," the Afghan government said, in a response included in the UNAMA report.
"UNAMA's detention observation report found compelling evidence that 125 detainees (46%) of the 273 detainees interviewed who had been in NDS detention experienced interrogation techniques at the hands of NDS officials that constituted torture," the report said.
Torture was used on some children under 18, the report said.
Canada and the United Kingdom ceased transfers of detainees to facilities in Kandahar and Kabul at various times based on reports of torture and ill treatment, the report said.
UNAMA took steps to ensure that the information it collected was credible, the report said.
We are happy that this report also testifies in a part that torture did not take place in a systematic manner in all NDS headquarters."
