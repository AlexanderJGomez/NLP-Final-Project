(CNN) -- In his September 4 op-ed, Jack Schlossberg presents his case that young Americans should cast their ballots for President Obama this fall.
Schlossberg concedes that we're "a little more cynical," but contends that "just because our politics and government can disappoint us sometimes doesn't mean we should forget how far we've come."
Or, according to this analysis, that half of recent college graduates are jobless or underemployed Or that under Obama, the national debt has risen $5 trillion.
In a word, travesty.
He compares Caulfield's desire to escape phonies to young people's support for Barack Obama in his first presidential campaign.
In 2008, Obama regaled us with promises of hope and change, but his time in office has exposed the emptiness of these promises.
Schlossberg praises the president's "insistence on keeping student interest rates low," but that hasn't kept student loan debt from reaching record levels.
But of all of Schlossberg's claims, perhaps the most misguided is the notion that Obama has displayed political courage in the White House.
But in this case, it's about coming to terms with the fact that Obama has had his chance to lead and his policies have failed.
We can vote for a new direction.
