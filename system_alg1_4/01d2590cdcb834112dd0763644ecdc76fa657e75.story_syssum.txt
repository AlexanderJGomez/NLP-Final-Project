Clinton aides say the event was tied to her family's foundation  -- the Clinton Global Initiative -- and the fact that its annual meeting will be held in Denver later this month.
Instead of surrounding herself with the regular PR flacks and publicists in preparation to sell her book, Clinton has brought on seasoned campaign veterans and political communicators.
In addition to helping Clinton, the hypothetical candidate, Gergen said the book rollout will help her staff.
"It gives them a sense of what a political campaign feels like," he said.
At the end of the speech in Colorado on Monday, Clinton closed with what sounded like an impassioned plea for support and, if the venue was different, for votes.
Once an operation with just a few press staff and advisers - along with dozens of informal friends and longtime confidants - the Clinton world has added a few seasoned political hands to help communicate Clinton's message around the book.
It is safe to say that Clinton's book roll out is one of the first to use phrases like war room and surrogate operation.
As her aides have been planning and preparing, Clinton has been all over the news.
The first book excerpts came out in early May, when in honor of Mother's Day Vogue published a passage of Clinton's book that was dedicated to her mother.
The speculation was that Clinton's staff wanted to get the news out of the way early so that it wouldn't shadow the rest of the book.
And as is evident with Clinton's stepped up presence and the slow trickle of news about her campaign, Clinton's book tour appears to be as much a memoir roll out as it is political tune up.
