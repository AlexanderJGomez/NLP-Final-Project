A BP executive said Monday the energy company is working "parallel paths" to fix the oil well.
David Nagel, executive vice president of BP America, said the blowout preventer may be working better than some people believe, limiting the gusher to 5,000 barrels of oil a day.
Suttles said BP is drilling a relief well to try to divert the flow to another pipe.
"That started about a week ago," Suttles said.
It may take up to three months to reach the target area, Nagel said.
On Friday, BP lowered the massive containment vessel over the well to cap the larger of two leak points.
BP has built the smaller dome and it is already available, Suttles said Monday.
That procedure would be done late next week, Suttles said Monday.
BP has received 3,400 claims for lost income and damages and 295 of those claims have been paid, at a price of $3.5 million, Nagel said.
Also Monday, organizers announced a "Gulf Aid" benefit concert for south Louisiana fishermen and wetlands restoration.
