News apps and mobile sites are helpful, but for real-time streaming updates, it's hard to beat Twitter.
The National Weather Service is tweeting out forecasts and analyses hourly from its National Hurricane Center account.
CNN's meteorologists are posting frequent updates to the CNN Weather Center account, which also appears on CNN's interactive Hurricane Tracker page.
Also, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's office has been tweeting frequently about closures of the city's parks, tunnels, subways and related services.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the New York City area's three major airports, also has an active and helpful account.
But all the major airlines are tweeting updates about delayed or canceled flights.
