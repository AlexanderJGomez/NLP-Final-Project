(CNN) -- Police expanded their search Friday for a man who either jumped or fell from a small plane as it flew off the Florida coast near Miami.
After searching until dark Thursday, authorities resumed their efforts early Friday, expanding the search area based on currents and weather conditions, police said.
A police spokeswoman said it was unclear whether Nales accidentally fell out of the plane or deliberately jumped.
The pilot first told air traffic controllers that a door was open on the plane, then added that a passenger had fallen out.
