The bickering started when Mubarak's lawyers raised a picture of the deposed president, infuriating the victims' lawyers, the station said.
Outside the courtroom, clashes broke out between police and families of those killed in the uprising that led to Mubarak's ouster.
Nothing has changed."
The clashes began when the families of those killed tried to push their way into Cairo's police academy, the site of the trial.
A similar scene played out in August during a court appearance by Mubarak.
Former Interior Minister Habib El Adly, a member of Mubarak's inner circle, is being tried alongside the former president on similar charges.
In addition to accusations of ordering the killing of protesters, Mubarak faces corruption charges.
The elder Mubarak is the first leader since this year's Arab Spring revolts to face a judge.
Meanwhile, Cairo's district courts have indicated they are considering filing individual charges against Mubarak for every person killed by his forces in the uprising.
