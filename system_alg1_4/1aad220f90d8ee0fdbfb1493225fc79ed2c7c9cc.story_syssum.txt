In the city's busy Covent Garden shopping piazza, a building floated above the ground.
"Architecture is the fabric and surroundings of our daily and habitual environments," says Chinneck, 30.
The floating building is part of what Chinneck calls the "architectural chapter" of his career, which has born four large-scale installations that use the materials, language and shapes associated with the craft.
The floating building looks like a part of the 184-year-old market has just been plucked and suspended in mid air.
"I don't like to disrupt a district too much, so the work is contextually sensitive.
This last phrase seems to sum up his installations well.
Along with comments on-site, Chinneck says he regularly receives emails, tweets and links to articles from people who have enjoyed his installations.
He's grown immune to accusations that his work is pointless, a waste of taxpayers' money, or, alternately, a waste of private commissioners' money, but he's still occasionally frustrated by the assumption that his work is easy or banal because of its simplicity and lack of intellectual intent.
"With art, and I think really a lot of public art, you create it and then you have to abandon it a little bit, distance yourself from it, because it's not really yours anymore," he says.
With the melting house now a pile of hardened goo being scraped off a pebbled lot (the installation finished Sunday), and the floating building broken down and hauled away, Chinneck is focusing on the future.
