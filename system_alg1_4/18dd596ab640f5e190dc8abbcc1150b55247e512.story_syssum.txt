In the space of one devastating week, natural disasters killed more people in Afghanistan than they did all last year.
"The scale of this landslide is absolutely devastating, with an entire village practically wiped away," said Richard Danziger, the chief of mission for the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Afghanistan.
When residents from a nearby village rushed to the scene to help dig people out, the second landslide struck, sweeping away many of the rescuers.
But IOM staff on the ground said the double landslide killed as many as 2,700 people and affected 14,000 others.
Sunday was declared a national day of mourning for victims of the disaster.
The landslide followed days of flash floods across nine northern Afghan provinces that killed more than 160 people, displaced 16,000 others and affected a further 50,000, according to a bulletin from the International Federation of the Red Cross.
"There have now been more Afghans killed through natural disasters in the past seven days than all of 2013," said Mark Bowden, U.N. Humanitarian coordinator in Afghanistan.
