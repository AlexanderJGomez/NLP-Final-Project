Washington (CNN)Israeli officials are looking at changing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans to address a joint meeting of Congress, including potentially relocating the speech, according to an Israeli source.
House Speaker John Boehner invited Netanyahu last month to speak in the House chamber, but did not consult with the White House before officially reaching out to the Israeli leader.
A move to shift the speech to a venue outside the Capitol, or deliver the speech in a closed chamber could be a face saving compromise for Netanyahu.
Ron Dermer, the Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. made the rounds last week on Capitol Hill, meeting with frustrated House Democrats, including some Jewish members, who lashed out at his handling of the matter.
While affirming their support for Israel, these members urged Netanyahu to reconsider coming to the House floor, and suggested moving the speech to another venue --anywhere in Washington outside the chamber, according to one source familiar with these discussions.
He also reiterated his position that he didn't support a public address so close to the Israeli election.
As much as I love Angela, if she was two weeks away from an election, she probably would not have received an invitation to the White House, and I suspect she wouldn't have asked for one," Obama said.
Last week, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said she hoped that Netanyahu's speech would be cancelled.
Both Herzog and Livni, who have teamed up to form an alliance in the election, have criticized Netanyahu's decision to address Congress and have urged him to cancel it.
An Israel Army Radio poll on Monday said only 34% of Israelis think Netanyahu should go ahead with the address, while 47% think he should cancel.
Another poll published by the Times of Israel on Monday showed Netanyahu's party four seats in the Knesset behind Herzog and Livni's  Zionist Camp alliance.
