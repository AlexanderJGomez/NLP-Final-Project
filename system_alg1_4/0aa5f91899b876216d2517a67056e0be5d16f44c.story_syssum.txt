"I never really worked very goal-oriented," he admits.
Back home after an emotional Olympics in Sochi, where Miller cried during a live interview with NBC's Christin Cooper when asked about the recent death of his brother, Miller is focusing on another project: his Turtle Ridge Foundation.
He was a great athlete before his injury and was really having a hard time sort of adapting, which is a really tough process when you're injured like that," says Miller.
Shaw-Doran serves as director of equipment development for Turtle Ridge, and Miller has called on friends and associates from across the sporting world to create and adapt equipment to help adaptive skiers and adaptive athletes in other sports.
It turns into a bit of pandemonium on the way down," Miller says.
"When we build some of our ski equipment and you give it to a kid who never had the chance to go up and experience what it is to ski down a giant mountain and you watch how life-changing that can be for them, I think it's really -- it's pretty incredible."
It may not be competition, but it is a goal he can take into retirement -- and still win.
