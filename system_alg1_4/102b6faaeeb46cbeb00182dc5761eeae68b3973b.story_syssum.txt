Island County, Washington (CNN) -- Colton Harris-Moore returned Thursday to a setting with which he is all-too-acquainted: a Washington State courtroom.
If a grand jury hands up an indictment in the plane case, Harris-Moore would next appear at an arraignment to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty.
"He was let down," Harris-Moore's aunt Sandra Puttmann told CNN.
In court records, Harris-Moore tells a psychologist his mother acted "mean" when drinking and "she will break my things.
But in a handwritten letter in Harris-Moore's court file, Kohler wrote, "This boy has had many disappointments all his life.
According to court records, Kohler said Colton's father left when he was "four to five years old."
Colton was "attached to" her next husband, Kohler said in court records, but he was "a heroin addict" who died of undetermined causes when Colton was 10 years old.
When police arrived, according to the records, Colton's father Gordon Moore "ran into the woods... but they soon caught him.
According to court records, Pamela Kohler blamed her son for the incident.
"
In a 2004 report, Harris-Moore's probation officer wrote, "Colton and his mother share a tumultuous relationship.
Kohler stated, according to court records.
In the 2007 psychological evaluation that is part of Harris-Moore's court file, Dr. Delton Young writes "Colton has a long-term history of psychiatric and behavioral difficulties.
With Harris-Moore facing 23 charges, Miyoshi negotiated a deal where Harris-Moore plead guilty to three charges of burglary and was sentenced to three years in a juvenile detention home "I love that boy like one of my own kids," Harris-Moore's aunt Sandra Puttmann wrote, the judge in the case.
Sandra Puttmann said Harris-Moore's story could have turned out differently had he gone to live on her farm.
Instead, Puttmann said, she would receive phone calls from Harris-Moore every month or so to let her know he was doing ok and still running.
