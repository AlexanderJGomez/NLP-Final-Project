(CNN) -- Michael Schumacher, the most successful driver in Formula 1 history and one of the world's highest-profile athletes, remains in critical condition after suffering severe head trauma in a skiing accident in the French Alps, hospital officials said Monday.
Schumacher was in a coma when he arrived at the hospital and required immediate brain surgery, officials said.
Schumacher was wearing a helmet when he hit his head, Gernignon-Lecomte said.
Doctors at the Grenoble hospital said that without the helmet's protection, Schumacher wouldn't have made it to the operating table.
Former French Formula 1 driver Olivier Panis visited the hospital in Grenoble on Sunday but was not able to see Schumacher, CNN affiliate BFM TV reported.
Schumacher made his Formula 1 debut in 1991 and won a record seven world titles -- five of them with Ferrari -- by the time he retired for the first time at the end of the 2006 championship.
"If you are anything less than a really experienced skier, it's very easy to lose your bearings, because you don't see much in the way of vegetation around you or anything else," said Paul Hochman, a former contributing editor at SKI Magazine.
British journalist Kevin Garside told CNN that Schumacher is "a very good skier" but acknowledged that he is "fearless" -- like most Formula 1 drivers.
"Schumacher wasn't a skier when he joined Ferrari (in 1996), but by the end he was excellent," he said.
"I approached him for an interview at the top of the slope, and he said it would have to be quick as he wanted to check the piste.
