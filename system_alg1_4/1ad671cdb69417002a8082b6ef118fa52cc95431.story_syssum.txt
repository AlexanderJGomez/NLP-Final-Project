Jerusalem (CNN) -- The Israeli government's press division is apologizing for circulating a link to a video that mocks activists aboard a ship headed to Gaza earlier this week that was blocked by an Israeli raid.
The video, titled "We Con the World" -- set to the tune of the 1985 hit, "We are the World"-- was put together by Caroline Glick, a former member of the Israel Defense Forces and columnist for the Jerusalem Post.
Israel said the passengers initiated the attack; the passengers blamed the troops.
Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev dismissed the the video link, saying, "The GPO sends out lots of articles.
"It is what Israelis feel.
It was not the first time the Israeli GPO stirred controversy with its public communications on the Gaza flotilla.
In an interview with the Jerusalem Post, GPO director Danny Seaman defended the communication, arguing that foreign media coverage of Gaza was not balanced.
