It was a sad moment but, as a life-long patriot, he knew he had to resign as secretary of Veterans Affairs.
The place to start is to appoint a world-class leader to run the place and recruit a squad of young, talented veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan as a personal support team.
Unfortunately, the best person in the country to run the VA is the least available: Robert Gates.
After Gates, the next best choice is likely to be his last deputy at DOD, Ashton Carter.
Carter won very high marks among civilians and military as deputy secretary, the person who "runs the building."
A smart White House would recruit some of the best among them and put them to work fixing the VA in some imaginative way -- possibly in full-time stints, possibly in consulting teams.
They are extraordinarily talented and ready to help.
Iraq and Afghanistan veterans have had too little voice in the VA.
It's time to call on the best to serve their country again.
