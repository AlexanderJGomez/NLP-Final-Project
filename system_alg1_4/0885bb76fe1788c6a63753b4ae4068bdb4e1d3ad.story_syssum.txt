(CNN) -- Thousands of women demonstrated Monday in front of Yemen's foreign ministry in the capital, Sanaa, demanding U.N. intervention in the ongoing unrest in the Persian Gulf nation, residents and eyewitnesses said.
Medics in Change Square said at least four people were killed and another 26 injured after government forces raided parts of the capital.
Government forces attacked the tribal leader's family residences, al-Qaisi said.
"The international community must stop Saleh from killing his own people," al-Qaisi said Monday.
In a separate demonstration in the city of Taiz, a government sniper killed a woman with a shot to the head, medics and eyewitnesses said.
Opposition activists said the slain woman was 20 and said she was the first female to be killed while marching against the government.
The crackdown in Sanaa was also bloody, doctors said.
Five of the wounded are in critical condition, he said from the square that has become the center of protests against Saleh.
Others carried flowers or signs that said: "We are not armed, Don't attack us with gunfire," witnesses said Sunday.
For its part, the government said it is trying to come up with a solution to end the political stalemate.
