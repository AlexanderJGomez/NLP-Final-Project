(CNN)Jeffrey Williams admitted he fired the shots that struck two officers in Ferguson, police said, but claimed he wasn't aiming for them.
Bishop Derrick Robinson, an area organizer, said he spoke to Williams on Sunday.
He said police served a search warrant on Williams' residence where they seized a .40-caliber handgun, "which has been tied to the shell casings that were recovered" at the scene of the shooting.
One element of the case that authorities have yet to sort out is intent, McCulloch said, adding that Williams has acknowledged firing the shots but has said he wasn't aiming at the police officers.
The shots rang out from a hill overlooking the city's police station shortly after midnight Wednesday, at the end of a protest against the Ferguson Police Department, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said at the time.
McCulloch said the tipster whose information led to Williams' arrest is eligible to receive the reward.
"These police officers were standing there, and they were shot just because they were police officers," he said.
"We are actively addressing the issues that have raised concerns of fairness and fair treatment.
While many protesters have decried the Ferguson Police Department, neither of the officers shot last week were from the city.
Both men have been treated and released.
