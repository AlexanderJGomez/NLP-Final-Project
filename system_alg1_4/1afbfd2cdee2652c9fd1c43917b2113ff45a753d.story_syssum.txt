Republicans and Democrats have urgently pressed President Barack Obama to do something to stem the flow of child immigrants crossing the southern border -- and fast.
"There's widespread doubt about whether this administration can be trusted to enforce our laws and it's going to be difficult to move any immigration legislation until that changes," House Speaker John Boehner said in February.
Obama on Wednesday called the flow of "unaccompanied children" an "incredibly dangerous" situation, and said his proposal offers Congress "the capacity to vote immediately" on a solution if it wants to address the problem swiftly.
"No amount of resources or changes will be effective in stemming the surge of illegal border crossings if President Obama continues to ignore the law," he wrote in a statement, resurrecting the common refrain when immigration reform was still a possibility.
But Democratic strategist Maria Cardona said Republicans are trying to have it both ways -- ask for a solution and criticize the President.
While Democrats indicate they support Obama's request, they want more details before signing off.
Democrats want to maintain the status of current law giving youth the right to make their case in an immigration proceeding.
Republicans want the law changed so unaccompanied youth can be immediately sent home without due process.
While the White House says it will ask Congress to give the Homeland Security Department more discretion to send such immigrants home, it's unclear if Obama will request changes to the anti-trafficking law.
I trust this president but I want to verify," Durbin said.
