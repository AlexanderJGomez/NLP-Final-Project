I was one of those kids who wasted their youth watching "Creature Double Feature" smackdowns between Godzilla and his arsenal of enemy combatants such as Mothra and Ghidorah.
Unfortunately, Gareth Edwards' "Godzilla" feels like two movies Scotch-taped together.
Only one of these movies is any good.
In movies like these, it's all about the slow tease and the big reveal.
When Godzilla first lumbers on screen to hunt the MUTOs and ''restore balance,'' he feels both nostalgically familiar and excitingly new.
Godzilla is humanity's only hope for destroying the MUTOs.
In its handful of moments like these, "Godzilla" almost makes you feel like a kid again.
