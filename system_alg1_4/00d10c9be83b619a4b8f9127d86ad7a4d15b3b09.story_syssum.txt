Seattle won its first Super Bowl in franchise history.
The second half started out bad for Denver, with Seattle's Percy Harvin running the opening  kickoff back for a touchdown.
Just before the third quarter ended, Denver got onto the scoreboard when Manning threw a 14-yard pass to Demaryius Thomas.
Richard Sherman, the Seattle defense player who mocked San Francisco after winning the NFC championship, was never really challenged.
A man was shot several times during a Super Bowl party at a residence in Denver, police said.
