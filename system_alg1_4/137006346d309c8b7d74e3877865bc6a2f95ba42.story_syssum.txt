Washington (CNN) -- Ahead of direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians on Thursday, President Barack Obama said Wednesday night that he was "hopeful -- cautiously hopeful" that the talks could achieve a two-state solution to the long running Mideast conflict.
Also attending the dinner were Secretary of State Hillary Clintonand Middle East Quartet Representative Tony Blair.
"We do not want any blood to be shed -- one drop of blood from the Israelis or the Palestinians," said Abbas.
With the U.S. war in Iraq drawing to a close, the Middle East moved front and center for administration officials Wednesday as Obama held a series of high-stakes meetings with Israeli and Arab leaders.
"Terrorists ... are purposely trying to undermine these talks," Obama said.
Mitchell is Obama's special envoy for Middle East peace.
The hurdles, however, remain steep.
Netanyahu can have settlements or peace, but he can't have both, Erakat said.
Another roadblock to any comprehensive deal is the Palestinian view that any two-state solution must include a handover of all the land Israel captured in the 1967 war, along with East Jerusalem as the Palestinian capital.
Mitchell, however, told reporters Tuesday that both Netanyahu and Abbas are noting polls showing fear of intensified conflict if negotiations fall apart.
But simply resuming talks was a critical step, and a comprehensive Middle East peace deal has been one of Obama's top foreign policy goals, they said.
Clinton is set to play the main role in the talks on Thursday, hosting a meeting at the State Department with Netanyahu and Abbas.
