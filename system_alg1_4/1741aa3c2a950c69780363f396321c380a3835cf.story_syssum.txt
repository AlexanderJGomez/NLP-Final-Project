Health officials are looking for the cause of a neurologic illness that's affected 10 children in Colorado.
Most of the children experienced a respiratory illness before being admitted to the hospital, although only two had a history of asthma.
The CDC is investigating the cause of these symptoms.
"We don't know, at this point, if there is any association between the enterovirus EV-D68 that's circulating and the paralytic conditions some of the children in Colorado are experiencing," CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said.
Of those six, four tested positive for enterovirus D68, which has been sending children across North America to the hospital with severe respiratory illnesses.
Samples from two of the children tested positive for enterovirus D68.
Enteroviruses are very common, especially in late summer and early fall.
This year, enterovirus D68 seems to be exacerbating breathing problems in children who have asthma.
Children's Hospital Colorado has treated over 4,000 children with severe respiratory illness since August 18, said Dr. Chris Nyquist, medical director for Infection Prevention and Control.
The CDC is asking other hospitals across the country to be on the lookout for similar cases and to send in information on any patients with these symptoms.
