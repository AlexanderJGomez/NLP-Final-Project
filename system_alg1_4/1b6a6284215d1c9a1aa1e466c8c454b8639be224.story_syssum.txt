Oranjestad, Aruba (CNN) -- Aruban prosecutors plan to release Tuesday the results of tests conducted on a jawbone found on an island beach and disclose whether it belongs to missing U.S. teenager Natalee Holloway, officials said.
Holloway's dental records were sent to the forensic institute last week, according to the FBI.
Dave believes it is Natalee," Miller said about Holloway's father, Dave Holloway.
Also on Monday, police collected a second bone that was found earlier this month on the beach by a New Jersey family, said Ana Angela, spokeswoman for Aruban prosecutors.
Staffers at the hotel found the bone on the balcony and notified police.
Holloway was last seen in the early hours of May 30, 2005, leaving an Oranjestad nightclub with Joran van der Sloot and two other men.
Her body was found in May in a hotel room registered to van der Sloot.
