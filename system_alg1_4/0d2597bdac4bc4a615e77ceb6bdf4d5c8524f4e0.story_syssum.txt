The son of Jewish immigrants from Hungary, Klein founded his firm Allen Klein & Co. in the late 1950s before the label evolved into ABKCO Music & Records in New York.
Klein represented dozens of artists, including Sam Cooke, the Animals, Bobby Darin and Herman's Hermits.
Klein retained ownership of those titles even after splitting with the Stones.
Late in his career, Klein agreed to license a sample of a Rolling Stones song to the British group the Verve for their hit single "Bittersweet Symphony."
