(CNN) -- After years of setbacks and controversies, the Kenyan deputy president went on trial Tuesday at the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands for alleged crimes against humanity.
Kenyatta and Ruto have denied accusations that they coordinated violence among their respective ethnic groups after the disputed 2007 election.
The International Criminal Court said the trials would proceed despite the withdrawal.
Opening for the defense, lawyer Karim Khan said that the case against Ruto was based on an "exceptionally deficient" investigation and that the deputy president should never have been accused.
He said there was a "rotten underbelly" to the prosecution's investigation, chiefly conducted under former ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo, which Khan said had failed to recognize the "lying witnesses" directing untrue accusations against his client.
A lawyer for Sang will give his opening statement Wednesday, the court said.
We are the ones who experienced the atrocities the court cites, because there were atrocities, and there was pain and suffering by the victims."
After the disastrous 2007 election, Kenyatta and Ruto teamed up and formed a coalition, which won the most recent poll held this year.
Ruto and myself cannot therefore be away at the same time," he said.
Kenya's previous administration reneged on a deal to set up a special tribunal to try suspects in the post-election violence, forcing the international court to step in.
The ICC intervened "only after the Kenyan efforts to establish a domestic mechanism to investigate the violence failed," Bensouda said.
Kenya is the second African nation after Sudan to have a sitting president facing charges at the International Criminal Court.
The first phase of Ruto's trial is expected to end on October 4.
