What's in your water?
While municipal water utilities are required to provide public reports of test results, bottled-water makers are not.
(See the full report on bottled water at EWG's Web site.)
In fact, the EWG report found that some of the best-known brands -- for example Whole Foods and San Pellegrino -- are the least likely to report where the water comes from and what it contains.
So what's a safety-conscious shopper to do?
Leiba says that activated carbon water filters -- like Brita pitchers or faucet attachments -- are a safe and affordable option for filtering tap water.
Unlike tap water suppliers, bottled water companies don't have to have their water tested by a certified laboratory, and they aren't required to notify customers within 24 hours if they find elevated levels of contaminants.
"There's clearly a difference in disclosure between municipal water and bottled water, but the FDA's laws focus on safety of food more than on disclosure of information," says Sharfstein.
Those regulations may change with the Food Safety Enhancement Act.
