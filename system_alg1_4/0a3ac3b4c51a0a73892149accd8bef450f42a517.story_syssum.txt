Atlanta (CNN) -- The remnants of Tropical Storm Lee settled in over the mid-Atlantic and Northeast on Wednesday, prompting warnings of heavy rain and flash flooding in areas from Washington up to western New England, the National Hurricane Center said.
Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency urged people to "avoid driving when possible, drive very carefully when you must drive, and stay alert for pooling water that you cannot drive through."
The forecast was unwelcome news for waterlogged Vermont and northern New York, which could receive another 1 to 3 inches of rain with up to 4 inches possible in some spots by Wednesday night.
Some eye-popping storm rainfall totals in the Northeast were recorded through 5 p.m. Wednesday in Becket, Massachusetts (8.11 inches); Rockaway, New Jersey (8.43); Phillipsburg, New Jersey (7.9); and Forks, Bethlehem and Dover, Pennsylvania (just over 7 inches).
In Gwinnett County, Georgia, just outside Atlanta, firefighters said Tuesday they found the body of a man who drowned in a rain-swollen creek near Norcross.
A flooding death was also reported in rural northeast Mississippi, where one person drowned after floodwater swept away a vehicle in Tishomingo County, emergency officials said.
