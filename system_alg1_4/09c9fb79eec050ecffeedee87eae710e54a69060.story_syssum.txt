"Police express concern over the video clip showing several plainclothes officers who are suspected of using excessive force," said a statement issued by the Hong Kong Information Services Department Wednesday morning.
Leung said there was a set and effective mechanism in place to deal with complaints against police.
Tsang's lawyer Dennis Kwok said, in the early hours of Wednesday morning, "six or seven police officers" led his client to a corner where they punched and kicked him.
"It is stomach-churning to think there are Hong Kong police officers that feel they are above the law," said Mabel Au, the group's Hong Kong director.
Another main protest group -- The Hong Kong Federation of Students -- issued a statement calling for the resignation of Police Commissioner Andy Tsang Wai-hunh, and other police commanders involved in preventing protesters from re-occupying Lung Wo road on Tuesday night.
A total of 45 people -- 37 men and eight women -- were arrested for alleged unlawful assembly and obstructing police officers, police said.
They're not.
In a statement released on Wednesday morning, police appealed to protesters in the area to "stay calm and restrained."
At the peak of the protests, tens of thousands of demonstrators crowded onto the streets, calling for the resignation of leader C.Y.
Hope that the two sides might be able to solve the impasse evaporated on Thursday when the government canceled talks planned with student groups, after protest leaders urged supporters to keep up the occupation.
He said student leaders had "almost zero chance" of pushing Beijing to change its stance on how Hong Kong's leader is elected.
That is impossible," he said.
The move was seen as a miscalculation and only served to garner support for the protesters, who accused the government of heavy handedness and of stifling free speech.
