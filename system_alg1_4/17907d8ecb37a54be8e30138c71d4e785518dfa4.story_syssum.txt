"If you ask me this question in 10 years' time I will tell you less, because two championships are more than I could dream," the Formula One driver told CNN.
A return to Renault in 2008 saw him slip from third place to fifth in the drivers' championship -- a season that will be forever remembered for the so-called "Crashgate" affair -- and a year later Alonso registered just one podium and finished ninth overall in his worst showing since debuting for Minardi in 2001.
With the first pre-season testing session now complete, Ferrari have learned much about their new-look F14 T.
"These were four very demanding and important days to give us something to work on over the coming days in Maranello," team principal Stefano Domenicali told Ferrari F1's official website.
"The car has some good signs and, let's say, the philosophy that the car has been designed is just what we are seeing now on the data.
"They are ugly, yeah.
"So probably we will get used to these new aesthetics, let's say, but the first moment they are not good enough because people look at Formula One like excellence of motor sport, of aerodynamics, excellence of performance and technology -- and when you see those front part of the car, it doesn't look like all the things we've been saying.
"I think he's very talented so that is a huge help and a huge motivation for myself first and also for the team, because the team knows it has to deliver a good car because Kimi will deliver a good result," Alonso said.
"I think we are (all) still in shock, after nearly one month," Alonso said.
Alonso's quest for a third drivers' championship title begins in Melbourne on March 16.
