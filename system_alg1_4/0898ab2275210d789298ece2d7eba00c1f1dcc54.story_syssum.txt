With lingering questions about privacy, game trading and selling, and an "always-on" Kinect device, Microsoft has released new details about the new Xbox One console, hoping to address issues that have had some fans in an uproar.
One blog post emphasizes there will be no fee for transferring or selling games back for cash and credit on Microsoft's part.
We designed Xbox One so game publishers can enable you to trade in your games at participating retailers," the post reads.
What will game publishers do with this new control over used games and trading?
It's unclear how Microsoft's own Microsoft Games Studios will address those issues.
A separate blog post addressed the privacy concerns raised by an always-watching Kinect device, which is connected to the Xbox One.
The post goes on to say that Microsoft is listening to fan feedback as they refine and develop new policies for the Xbox One.
