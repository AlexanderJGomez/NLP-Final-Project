Starting the minute healthcare.gov went live October 1, Lane spent five to six hours a day trying to make the site work before she finally managed to enroll two weeks later.
"There were days that I would just completely lose my temper with it," she remembers.
But will everyone else -- especially healthy people -- be determined enough to stick with healthcare.gov?
Without those healthy people, Obamacare could be in trouble, since an insurance pool only works well when healthy people, who pay premiums but use few services, are in it to help offset the costs of people like Lane and her daughter.
But some worry that even then, the website will have been branded as problematic and time-consuming, and some healthy people will prefer to pay the fine for being uninsured, which in many cases is significantly lower than the cost of buying insurance.
"If it sticks, that's going to be a problem."
