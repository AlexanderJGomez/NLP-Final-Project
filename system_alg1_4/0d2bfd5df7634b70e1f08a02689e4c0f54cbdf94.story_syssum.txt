Russell Armstrong's lawyer said he's "100% convinced" Armstrong's role in the reality show created his depression, but he does not blame the Bravo network for his death.
After Taylor Armstrong filed for divorce last month she told People magazine that she was verbally and physically abused during their nearly six-year marriage.
In his interview with People, Russell Armstrong said, "Maybe things happened in the heat of the moment, but it was during a time in our lives that was not characteristic of who we were.
"He did not want the divorce at all, but he was willing to accept her decision," Richards said.
But his downfall was caused by his role in the reality show, he said.
"That's what they were dealing with here," he said.
"There's the appearance that she's moving forward as a celebrity," Richards said.
Still, Richards said he does not blame the network for his client's depression and death.
Armstrong's death should serve as a warning to the dangers people face when they sign up for a reality show, he said.
