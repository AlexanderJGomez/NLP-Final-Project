I know eco-sensitive burial methods are increasingly popular with humans, but I wasn't sure about pets, so I checked it out.
When it comes to sending a pet off into the great beyond, the options -- and their eco-drawbacks -- are similar: burial in a pet cemetery -- or zoological necropolis, if you will -- or more commonly, cremation.
There is a natural pet burial movement, although it's a relatively small one.
So there you have it -- the small but growing green pet burial movement.
In the meantime, enjoy frolicking with your pets while you can.
