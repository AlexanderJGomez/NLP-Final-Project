(WIRED) -- Facebook has rolled out its new Timeline feature to the masses.
1.
To hide a Timeline element, click the pencil icon at the top of the offending post, then choose "Hide from Timeline."
If you prefer to keep your profile public, but don't want everyone to see what you posted back in high school, for example, you can also tweak your Timeline settings more generally.
Now click "Limit Old Posts" -- all
These events aren't listed on your Timeline, but they can be.
Now, Facebook can accurately reflect your entire life -- and not just the events that occurred after you first signed on.
First, you can add a cover to your Timeline.
For photo albums you've created, you can change the primary photo that displays (you could do this before, but now the process is different).
Conversely, you can click the star on a maximized featured post to make it normal again.
If you decide to make a number of posts and photos private or hidden from your Timeline, you can still get the full, complete view of your Facebook action history.
You can choose to see only your posts, posts by others, posts from specific Facebook apps ("Hmm, let's look at my past Farmville accomplishments"), photos and more.
Click that, and you can choose "View As..." and either enter a friend's name or click the "public" link to see how your profile looks to strangers.
You can change it to "Only Important" updates or "All updates," and you can also filter what types of posts you're interested in seeing: things like life events, status updates, or photos.
You can click "More" next to Lists to add other lists of your choosing â€” "Acquaintances," "Poker Club Members," you get the picture.
One last thing: If you're one of those people who's still into "poking" your friends, you can still do that.
