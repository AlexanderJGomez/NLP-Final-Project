CNN's Kyra Phillips asked Fallon about his resignation and about U.S. policy regarding Iraq and Iran.
One of the most important things in the military is confidence in the chain of command.
...
Fallon: What was important was not me.
Fallon: I don't believe for a second President Bush wants a war with Iran.
...
Fallon: It's not my position to negotiate with Iran.
Phillips: So when talk of the third war came out, a war with Iran, the president didn't say to you, "This is what I want to do," and did you stand up and say, "No, sir.
Again, don't believe for a second that the president really wants to go to war with Iran.
Fallon: No, I don't believe so at all.
Are you?
I think that what's really important here is that when I was asked to take this job about a year and a half ago, I believe it was because we were facing some very difficult days in Iraq and Afghanistan and in the region.
The important items were the people, what they're doing, how to get this job done, how to get the war ended and get our people home.
Fallon: I believe the best course is to retain the high confidence we have in General Dave Petraeus and his team out there.
There's a very, very important military role here in providing stability and security in this country, but that's not going to be successful, as we know, without lots of other people playing a hand.
People have to have confidence in their futures.
They would like to have a job.
We want to have the majority of our people back and we want the war ended.
