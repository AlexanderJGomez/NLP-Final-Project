(PEOPLE.com) -- A "devastated" Simon Monjack told PEOPLE his wife Brittany Murphy did not overdose on drugs and did not suffer from an eating disorder.
During a sometimes tear-filled interview, an exhausted Monjack, 39, who hasn't slept since his mother-in-law found his wife collapsed in the bathroom early Sunday, said all he knows is what doctors told him at the hospital: She died of cardiac arrest, but they won't know details until after an autopsy.
"My initial reaction to the autopsy was -- they're going to cut her open -- I couldn't bear it," Monjack said, weeping.
"She was on herbal remedies that wouldn't speed up her heart," Monjack said.
That was it."
"She was tired and a little sad because she was sick," Monjack said about Brittany.
"One of the saddest things is that Clara has looked everywhere for Brittany and can't find her," said Monjack.
I was in love with Brittany and Brittany with me."
"She was an only child," said Monjack.
"
Monjack said he has been upset by some of the published reports.
It just can't be a tragic accident," he said, trying to explain the headlines.
Monjack said Brittany's family arrived in town Monday and that funeral plans are pending.
