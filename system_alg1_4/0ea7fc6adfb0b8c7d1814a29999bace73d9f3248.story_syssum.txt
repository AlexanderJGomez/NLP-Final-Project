Its aim is to do something about the more than 7,000 girls 17 or younger who get pregnant in New York City annually, with 90% of those pregnancies unplanned, according to the city's health department.
"We are committed to trying new approaches ... to improve a situation that can have negative consequences that last a lifetime," the health department said in a statement.
Some city dwellers have praised the program, calling it a helpful tool to curb teen pregnancy.
In New York, a person must be 18 or older to buy the pill over the counter.
Yet Davids, who has a teenage girl and a young boy, said, "Most parents I've spoken to" in schools involved in the program never got a letter from the city's health or education departments, thus never opted out of the program.
"Kids are having kids, and that's the end of their education," said Frances Mejias, who said she wishes her daughter's high school had the program.
One New Yorker who strongly supports the program -- which, so far, has led to more than 1,100 students receiving birth control pills, including Plan B, according to the health department -- is its mayor.
Asked about the program that went on quietly for an entire school year before receiving media attention, Bloomberg told reporters that the program is "nothing new" and noted it was a pilot program.
Beyond that, the mayor said he was surprised that a program that's been running quietly for nearly two full years was all of a sudden a source of controversy.
