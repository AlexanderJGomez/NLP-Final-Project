No?
But there's still a faint cell signal from a couple of miles away.
So maybe the zombie apocalypse thing is a wee bit unlikely.
But for emergencies, it still helps to have a simple, small, hardy backup phone that can make calls, send or receive text messages, and hold a charge for a very, very long time.
But the battery on your regular cell phone may not hold a charge that long.
Joire noted, "It's very refreshing to have a phone in your car that can only do three things: make calls, do text messages and set alarms.
That's it!
The charger is also very small.
A 2007 GearDiary review of this phone reported the battery life as about two weeks.
Joire was planning to take her "zombie apocalypse" phone to the Burning Man gathering (August 30-September 6 in the Nevada desert).
Also, she plans to blog about her zombie apocalypse phone when she returns.
Consult local, state and federal emergency preparedness agencies to find out which numbers you should program into the phone, for both calls and texting.
And of course, program in the numbers of your zombie apocalypse phone tree.
