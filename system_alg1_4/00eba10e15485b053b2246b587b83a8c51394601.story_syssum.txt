The taxi driver and a passenger also died.
The shots were fired from the Range Rover, which Las Vegas police spokesman Bill Cassell said could be anywhere.
In a separate interview Friday with CNN, Tehran Boldon said that his brother's son is a limousine driver on the Las Vegas Strip and he called his father to warn him to avoid the area after seeing a car afire -- not realizing that the taxi on fire belonged to his father.
"He saw the accident and he tried to warn his dad to say avoid Flamingo (Road)" because he knew his father was nearby at the Rio casino, Tehran Boldon said.
The father's body was burned beyond recognition and was identified by his cab assignment, Tehran Boldon said.
A passenger in the Maserati and three others were injured in the pileup, Sheriff Douglas Gillespie said.
"Out of everyone I know in the rapping industry, there is no way I would have ever, ever expected to find that he was shot on the Las Vegas Strip in such an aggressive manner," said Vicki Greco, Cherry's attorney.
Cherry had two children, she said.
The Maserati's passenger and other witnesses are helping detectives piece together what happened, he said.
John Lamb, who was inside Caesars Palace, told CNN affiliate KLAS that he heard the commotion and saw the taxi on fire from a window.
