Oscar Hernandez was found guilty on five felony charges for the misappropriation of funds stemming from his years as Bell's mayor, by the same jury that also convicted four former city council members on various counts.
Nearly two months after the trial started in January, the jurors also found Hernandez not guilty on five other charges, as they did with others.
The split verdicts for Hernandez, Teresa Jacobo, George Mirabal, George Cole and Victor Bello came two and a half years after the Los Angeles Times first reported salaries for them and others were well above the norm -- especially considering that Bell, situated about 10 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles, is a relatively small city of 36,000 people.
Not just economically, but a burden of trust," current city council member Nestor Enrique Valencia told reporters following Wednesday's verdict.
Except for Artiga, the jury found the defendants guilty of misappropriation of funds for "payment of services as (members) of the Solid Waste and Recycling Authority."
"I suspect all of us, if we got a job and they said you're getting paid $90,000 a year for a full-time job, we'd be pleased and we wouldn't do analysis of how the employer broke down the salaries," Friedman said.
Even with the jury still weighing some charges and more fights ahead in court, some Bell residents nonetheless took satisfaction in Wednesday's verdict.
"At this point, ... we're ready as a community and as a city to really move on."
