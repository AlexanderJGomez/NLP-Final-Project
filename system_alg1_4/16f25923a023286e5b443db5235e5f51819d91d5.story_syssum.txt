The ban would have included sodas, energy drinks, fruit drinks and sweetened teas.
In fact, the Board of Health has the power, indeed the responsibility, to regulate sugary drinks for the sake of city residents, particularly the poor.
Nearly six out of 10 New York City residents are overweight or obese, as are nearly four out of 10 schoolchildren.
Why?
The so-called "war on sugar" is not a culture war, it is a public health imperative backed by science.
Those who cry "nanny state" in response to almost any modern public health measure (think food, alcohol, firearms, distracted driving) demand a standard of proof that lawmakers don't have to meet in any other field.
The industry stoked the fires of public discontent with its campaign against the "inconsistencies" in the soda ban.
Consider one of the judge's major arguments: balancing public health and economic considerations is "impermissible."
It assumes that unless public health does everything, it can do nothing.
But the Board of Health has authority to act in cases where there is an imminent threat to health.
Members of the Board of Health, moreover, are experts in public health, entitled to a degree of deference.
The fingerprints of the food and restaurant industries, with their clear economic conflicts of interest, are all over the public and judicial campaign to block the soda ban.
Rather than recognize the public health effects of large sugary drinks, they chose to fight, reminiscent of Big Tobacco.
Imagine that in a state with the highest obesity rate in America!
If consumers really want, they can buy several smaller drinks.
Because when it is shown to be successful in New York, it will be emulated in major cities in America and worldwide.
