Washington (CNN)The race for the next U.S. president was evident on Tuesday night as plenty of potential Republican contenders criticizing President Barack Obama's tax proposals, while Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, defended the President's State of the Union address.
The President is proposing a total of $235 billion in tax credits that are aimed to help the middle class.
"It's unfortunate President Obama wants to use the tax code to divide us -- instead of proposing reforms to create economic opportunity for every American," he said on Facebook.
"Our American revival is not going to be led by a lame-duck president who would rather pick fights with Congress," he said in a statement.
Separately, Rubio told CNN's Deirdre Walsh that he felt Republicans could work with Obama on some things, like increasing the child tax credit.
Many of the Republicans were quick to sing the praises of Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, who gave the Republican response, showing that it's never a bad move to praise the new senator from the state that holds the nation's first nominating contest.
Well delivered which drew a clear contrast."
Some of the potential Republican contenders also criticized Obama's speech in real time.
Paul, for example, jabbed Obama's push for free community college with multiple tweets.
