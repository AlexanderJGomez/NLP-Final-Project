(CNN) -- My dad was an avid sports fan and a great athlete in his day.
I thought about him yesterday as I read about Jason Collins coming out as the first openly gay player in NBA history.
Can he play?
"Is this really still news?"
It's still news because the stereotype of gay men as being effete, weak, uncoordinated (except where it comes to Lady Gaga impersonations) and otherwise "girly" is still so strong.
It shouldn't be.
But it is.
That is why it should be news.
Yes, he can play.
At 34, he's probably aging out of the sport, but he's played consistently and well over the years and deserves to be remembered for what he has done on the court, not what he did while off.
Jason Collins is gay.
For decades, the argument had been that having openly gay people in the military would impair unit cohesion.
First, it was the military, now it's pro sports being forced to realize that there is no "us" and "them" when it comes to sexuality.
I'll bet that Jason Collins will be the first in a string of professional athletes to openly acknowledge their homosexuality.
I think my dad would agree.
