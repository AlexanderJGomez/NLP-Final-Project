Korman died at the center four months after suffering complications from the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Korman was a regular on "The Carol Burnett Show" from 1967 through 1978, for which he won Emmy awards in 1969, 1971, 1972 and 1974.
He starred in his own short-lived situation comedy, "The Harvey Korman Show," in 1978, in which he portrayed Harvey Kavanaugh opposite Christine Lahti, who played his wife, Maggie.
The AP also reported that Brooks described Korman as a "dazzling" comic talent.
He married Deborah Fritze in 1982.
In addition to his wife and daughter, Korman is survived by three other adult children -- Laura, Maria and Chris -- and three grandchildren.
