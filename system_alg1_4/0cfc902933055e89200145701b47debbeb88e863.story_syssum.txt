Authorities say the elusive woman has killed at least two bus drivers in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.
In the e-mail, she calls herself "Diana, the hunter of drivers."
We women of Juarez are strong."
Arturo Sandoval, a spokesman with the Chihuahua state attorney's office, told CNN the end doesn't justify the means.
The slayings have terrorized many bus drivers, especially those operating Route 4, also known as the Yellow Route, which serves main thoroughfares and downtown Ciudad Juarez, a city of 1.5 million located across the border from El Paso, Texas.
Others have been forced to look for transportation alternatives for their daily commute.
Ciudad Juarez gained international notoriety in the late 1990s and early 2000s after a wave of slayings involving women.
According to an Amnesty International report, 370 young women and girl were killed in Ciudad Juarez between 1993 and 2005.
