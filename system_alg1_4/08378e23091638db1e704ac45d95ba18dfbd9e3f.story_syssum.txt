Facebook and Google have added new translation tools, but they take different approaches.
Not everyone has access to a computer and a broadband connection.
Facebook Inc. and Google Inc. are two Web companies trying particularly hard to make this happen, and they've released a number of updates to their translation services in recent weeks.
But for now, here's a look at the latest language features from both companies, and some background on how their translation services work.
How it works: Real people are at the heart of Facebook translation plan.
These crowd-sourced edits -- which work kind of like Wikipedia -- make Facebook's translation service smarter over time.
The update allows sites to install a translation gadget on their sites through Facebook Connect, a service that lets Facebook users sign in on other Web pages.
People who use Facebook Connect to translate their sites can choose which text they want users to help translate, according to Facebook spokeswoman Malorie Lucich.
How it works: Google's computers learn how to be translators by examining text that's already on the Web, and from professional Web translations posted online, said Franz Och, a principal scientist at Google.
Size: Google claims to be the largest free language translation service online.
: Google recently created a widget that any Web developer can put on his or her page to offer up Google translations.
And there's a new Firefox add-on from Google to help people translate the Web more quickly.
Also, Google lets people spot translation errors, suggest new wordings and translate its interface into languages Google's computers don't speak just yet.
