"We will be reviewing our security arrangements in partnership with London Marathon," said event commander Chief Supt.
"We have reviewed and will continue to review our security arrangements with the Metropolitan Police and other authorities," a statement on the event website said Tuesday.
London is the next, after Boston, of the six races that make up the World Marathon Majors series.
"The bombings in Boston are shocking, cowardly and horrific, and the thoughts of all Londoners this morning will be with the victims," London Mayor Boris Johnson said in a statement Tuesday.
"You can look at isolating particular areas and trying to secure these -- however, you are looking at a 26-mile-plus route, which often will spread across a major capital, and in terms of protecting it right along the route, it will be very, very difficult," he said.
The Metropolitan Police have said parts of the transport network will be closed down and there will be a large military and police presence on the streets as the funeral procession passes through central London.
