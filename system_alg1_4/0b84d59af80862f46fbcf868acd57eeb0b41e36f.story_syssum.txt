(CNN) -- The United States is vacating an air base in Pakistan at Islamabad's request following a NATO attack that killed two dozen Pakistani soldiers.
U.S. and Pakistani officials said Friday there were conversations between the sides before the strike, but they differed on the content of those conversations.
The loss of the base is unlikely to have any major impact on operations in Pakistan, experts said.
A U.S. official said Sunday that the "loss of access to this base would not lessen capabilities, as it has served primarily as a back-up capability for quite a while now."
"It's what Pakistan intends to do about its airspace," he said.
Period.
High-level Pakistani officials have supported, quietly, the U.S. drone campaign for years, he said.
"Once they feel threatened from their own population because of their support and cooperation from the United States, that's when they'll turn on us," he said.
U.S. officials have long prepared for Plan B in Pakistan, he said.
He said the incident was not a deliberate attack on Pakistan, the White House said.
The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan confirmed Monday that Munter said the United States is complying with the request.
On Monday, Prime Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani said Pakistan wants to have good relations with the United States based on mutual respect and clearly defined parameters.
In Washington, deputy State Department spokesman Mike Toner, referring to the cross-border incident in which two dozen Pakistani soldiers were killed, said he welcomed Gilani's remarks.
