The New Zealand-based Fonterra Group said Saturday that three batches of its whey protein tested positive for the Clostridium botulinum bacteria.
But China -- where at least six babies died from tainted milk powder in 2008 -- has halted all imports of New Zealand milk powders from New Zealand and Australia, New Zealand's Trade Minister Tim Groser said in an interview on television network TVNZ on Sunday.
"China has not closed the market to all New Zealand dairy products," the ministry said.
In the 2008 scandal, milk powder was contaminated with melamine, a chemical commonly used in laminates, wood adhesives and flame retardants that can be used to mimic high-protein additives.
The company involved, Sanlu Group, was partially owned by Fonterra.
At the time, Fonterra said it remained "100% confident about the quality of its products."
