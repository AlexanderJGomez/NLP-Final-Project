My first game was in 1961 when Burnley were reigning league champions.
10?
When we played Scunthorpe -- the game we won to get promoted to the First Division under Stan Ternant in 2000 -- up until then I'd been in Northern Ireland.
As it happened I left early and by the time I'd landed in Manchester things had wrapped up, so he got to his game as well, but I did sneak off early it has to be said.
We had to win a game against Leyton Orient in 1987 to stay in the Football League.
Our wage bill is the smallest in the league by a mile, we've got a small stadium, we've got the smallest squad and we're the smallest town that has ever produced a Premier League football club, so with all that it's quite an uphill battle to stay up but I think we will, and by playing good football.
He was one of these players that when he got the ball you just leaned forward a bit and you thought something is going to happen here and quite often it did.
The Orient game, obviously, was the most emotional for every Burnley fan.
I've got loads of bad memories too, but I think it's the bad memories are what make the good memories even more special.
