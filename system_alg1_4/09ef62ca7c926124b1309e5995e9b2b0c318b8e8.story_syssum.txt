(CNN)For Formula One fanatics it was a thrilling  spectacle  -- the sport's top two drivers going head-to-head for the drivers' championship title.
As testing for the 2015 season continues, he says last term provided some trying moments but he insists he can't think of a better teammate than Hamilton.
"But also my racing career was cloudy at times: my two Formula Three years when I didn't go anywhere and my Formula One dream almost became elusive.
"I wanted to win and had been driving so many years behind, seeing the others having these awesome cars -- Lewis in the early days at McLaren and Vettel at Red Bull -- and I was just driving behind.
Prior to last season's runner-up berth, Rosberg's best finish in an F1 season was sixth back in 2013.
"We have a relationship that goes up and down and it will continue to go up and down," he explained.
"It is an intense battle between us and that will not change any time soon.
Yes, there have been challenging times, but from my point of view I always felt comfortable, and it continues like that."
It is the challenge that I relish."
"For a team it is better to have two equally good drivers trying to beat each other but also sharing data with each other.
There will again be times of discussion, sure.
"They had a very intense battle last year and I have no doubt that if they have a good car they will be fighting for wins and the championship again.
Wolf also said he had no concerns about Hamilton's contract, which is entering its final season.
There is no hurry.
We want him to stay and he wants to stay, so there are no risks in taking the situation calmly."
