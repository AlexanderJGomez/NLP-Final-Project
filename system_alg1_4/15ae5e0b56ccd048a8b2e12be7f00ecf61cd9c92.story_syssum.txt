Washington (CNN) -- A leading Senate conservative said Sunday he can accept tax reform that increases overall tax revenue as part of a comprehensive deficit reduction plan.
Coburn is one of six senators taking part in bipartisan talks on a deficit reduction blueprint.
The deficit reduction debate is central to two key spending issues coming up before Congress -- increasing the amount of money the government can borrow, and passing a federal budget for fiscal year 2012, which begins October 1.
Conservative Republicans are demanding significant deficit reduction steps attached to the debt ceiling measure before they'll vote for it.
However, Coburn and Republican Rep. Joe Walsh of Illinois, a Tea Party conservative elected last November, rejected the Democratic argument that the debt ceiling must be raised, saying the government has enough money to pay its debt obligations, at least for a few months.
And the administration knows that."
The Gang of Six negotiations focus on a deficit reduction plan compiled last year by a commission appointed by Obama that calls for increased revenue through tax reform, spending cuts in all areas and reforms to all the entitlement programs.
