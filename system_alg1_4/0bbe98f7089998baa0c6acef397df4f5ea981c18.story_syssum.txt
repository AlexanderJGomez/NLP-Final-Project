(CNN) -- A Canadian border officer was shot in her booth Tuesday afternoon by a motorist, who then apparently killed himself, Canadian police said.
Authorities had yet to confirm the man's identity late Tuesday afternoon, Paquet said.

"They had it surrounded.
"They said, 'Hold on, you guys are going to be here for a long time.
"Then we wait for a while.
