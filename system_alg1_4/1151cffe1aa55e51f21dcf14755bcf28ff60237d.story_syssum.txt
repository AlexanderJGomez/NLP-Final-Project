Za'atari refugee camp, Jordan (CNN) -- I've spent the past week working in the Za'atari refugee camp in northern Jordan, about six miles from the Syrian border.
Over 20,000 Syrian refugees have moved into Za'atari camp already, and the pace of new arrivals to the camp has more than doubled, with more than 14,000 arriving in the past week alone.
Yesterday, I met many newly-arrived refugees, some just children, who told me how had they witnessed family members and neighbors being killed in Syria.
But the camp is growing exponentially and it is hard to keep up.
Wasfeyah, a refugee mother of five children, told me that when her family was trying to escape to Jordan, they were shot at and her eldest son, Ali, was hit in the head by a bullet.
Wasfeyah doesn't have any money to buy new clothes, so the little boy still wears the blood-stained shirt from that night.
More playgrounds and child-friendly spaces are being planned as the camp population grows.
Improvements to the camp continue despite the massive amount of work going into accommodating new arrivals.
Many days it is hard to see more than a few meters in front of you in the camp, as the air is thick with sand and debris that is carried by the strong winds that blow through the barren camp.
Water is one of the most pressing long-term issue that faces the refugees, as well as the local Jordanian communities.
No one knows how long the camp will be here and when the Syrian refugees will be able to go home.
