The plaintiffs in the federal suit are not African American.
No weapon was ever found in the car.
"The City of Cleveland, through the other named defendants, and the other named defendants in their individual capacities, have a history of treating non-African American officers involved in the shootings of African Americans substantially harsher than African American officers," reads the lawsuit, filed Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.
The lawsuit comes on the heels of another high-profile police shooting in Cleveland.
Authorities are investigating that shooting, and the two officers involved are on leave from their jobs.
