1 Rory McIlroy reiterated his support for 2012 vice captain Paul McGinley on the day he announced a new multi-year sponsorship deal with Nike.
"He's been vice captain a few times, he's holed the winning putt in the Ryder Cup.
"If we go to Gleneagles and lose, he's already a winning Ryder Cup captain.
But when the Americans turned once again to Tom Watson, the last U.S. captain to triumph on European soil in 1993, Montgomerie's name began to circulate.
It would be fantastic to have Paul McGinley as the 2014 captain."
The announcement will be made after a 15-man committee that includes Montgomerie, Clarke and McGinley meets to decide.
