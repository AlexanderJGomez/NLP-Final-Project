But with a New York City apartment.
An apartment I had yet to find.
Not so long ago, I wrote about a similar quest -- for a good man.
New York 2013 is the Wild West of real estate.
According to The New York Times, a go-to place for apartment listings, in October 2009 there were 8,150 apartments listed for sale in Manhattan.
Based on their listings, the average price for an apartment in Manhattan, according to the Times, is $1.1 million.
Trolling the real estate websites, you click on a link and find the apartment of your dreams.
Dare to lock eyes with him?
A good man in New York is like prime real estate, snapped up before you can blink.
Perhaps because you're not entirely sure the person you've been chatting with online even resembles his profile photo.
To help find my apartment "match," I signed with an experienced buyer's broker: Roberta Moser of Halstead Property.
"It's OK to fall in love with an apartment, but you can't get too attached to an apartment."
You think you're close to clinching a deal, and suddenly another buyer swoops in to offer cash for an apartment.
Your bid may be accepted, but until the seller signs the contract, you're in limbo.
"I want that apartment," I told her in the elevator.
We entered our "best and final" bid, but were tied with another buyer.
Once, when there were multiple offers, Moser recalled, "a buyer delivered a signed contract with a check for $100,000 over the asking price of the apartment."
Moser, the ultimate real estate matchmaker, found me the right space at a decent price.
But it was a good deal -- and with a little luck, everything fell into place.
How could meeting a man in New York possibly be as difficult as landing an affordable apartment?
And all those type-A personalities don't work well for matchmaking.
As for men, "you have single dads, divorced dads, widowers, a good portion looking for women 10 years younger than they are.
"The men look incredibly good.
That is, if I can ever bear the thought of moving again.
