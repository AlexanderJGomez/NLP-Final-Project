(CNN) -- A woman whose body was found in the crawl space of an Oregon home -- the mother of a newborn who also died -- died from "homicidal violence," the state's deputy medical examiner said Monday.
Medics received a call Friday from Roberts' Washington County, Oregon, home of a newborn in distress, authorities said.
Roberts told deputies the baby was hers, according to the county sheriff's office.
Police said she had been pregnant; authorities determined she was the baby's mother.
"At this time, it has not been determined if [Snively] died because of head wounds she received or as a result of cutting injuries she received to her abdomen," said a Monday statement from the Washington County, Oregon, Sheriff's Office.
Young said an autopsy was completed on the baby, but he would not release information Monday.
Police think Roberts may have had contact with numerous pregnant women in the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area, the statement said, and police ask anyone who has had contact with her, either in person or over the Internet, to call the Washington County Sheriff's Office.
