Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- People who knew and studied Maj. Nidal Hasan say he was a loner who had no luck finding a wife, and a criminal profiler said the Fort Hood shooting suspect fits the profile of a mass murderer better than that of a terrorist.
"Some individuals said that their experience with him, that he changed after his mother passed away," Imam Johari Abdul-Malik said.
Another cleric there, Shaikh Shaker Elsayed, said efforts to find a wife for Hasan were unsuccessful.
A former counterterrorism official said the information about Hasan's communications with the imam should have been shared with the military unless the FBI specifically forbade it.
Still, one source familiar with the investigation said Hasan's communications with al-Awlaki appeared innocent in nature.
