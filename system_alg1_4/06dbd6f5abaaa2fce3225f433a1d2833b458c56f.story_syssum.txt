As the school year wound down, Matthew's health worsened.
In all, Matthew missed 53 days of school.
"When we put him back in school this year, within three weeks, he missed 10 days with a respiratory infection," Melissa Asselin said.
When he was in school, he became ill," Asselin said.
"If you get an unhealthy building, you're not going to have a successful school," said Lily Eskelsen, vice president of the National Education Association, the largest teachers' union in the United States.
Even when children don't miss school, he said, the medications they take for asthma and conditions like rhinitis, an allergic reaction to mold or dust, can make it harder for them to do their best work.
They can't focus on what's going on."
"It takes a lot to make you sick, but it takes very little exposure once you're sensitized to provoke symptoms," Santilli said.
There's no money to replace the roof, only patch it, Miles said.
The condition of roofs, windows, walls and boilers were all related to the health of children at the school, researchers found.
Kids aren't the only ones affected by school air.
More than half of Chicago teachers responding to the same survey also reported fair or poor school air quality.
Tests this fall at Matthew Asselin's school, Hinsdale Elementary, showed elevated levels of mold in the gymnasium/cafeteria and two other areas, and the school district spent $16,000 for a thorough cleaning.
His mother, Melissa, who received her degree in elementary education last year, is now home-schooling the 9-year-old.
I can't put a price on that."
