Now, more than 100 years later, New York City and Las Vegas are engaged in a contest with dueling plans to erect the world's largest Ferris wheel.
"The New York Wheel will be an attraction unlike any other in New York City -- even unlike any other on the planet," Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an enthusiastic advocate, said in a news release.
Caesars declined to comment on the proposed New York Wheel.
Marin tells CNN the designer of his wheel is working on an even bigger one in Dubai.
