The tech entrepreneur spotted the gap in the market and in 2010 he founded iROKO Partners, an internet company that distributes Nollywood films to viewers across the world.
Described as the "Netflix of Africa," Njoku's company has today grown to have more than 500,000 registered users.
A big part of what we did was actually focusing on cleaning up and organizing the content so we can provide a superior user experience, something which Nollywood lovers can really be proud of.
CNN: Your company has been described as the Netflix of Africa.
We've just reached 500,000 registered users, we think our additional market in the West is at least five to 10 million people, there are lots of Africans who love this stuff.
Are there 25 million people who love this content?
Most definitely there are 25 million people in Nigeria who love this content.
JN: Nigeria has been growing -- I think it's in the top 10, but, again, just to put it in context, I believe we have more people watching just in London than we do have in the whole of Nigeria.
JN: Eighteen months ago when I moved to Nigeria, broadband was really expensive and not that great.
Unfortunately, for five, almost six years I failed miserably at being an entrepreneur.
That was itself a harrowing experience but the interesting thing was that for the first time in eight years since I'd moved out I was actually able to see the viewing patterns of my mom change...She'd gone from watching western films to watching African films.
Hopefully this new approach to monetizing Nollywood content will lead to producers re-investing in their films.
