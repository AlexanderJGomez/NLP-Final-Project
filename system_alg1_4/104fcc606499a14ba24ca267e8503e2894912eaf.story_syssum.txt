That's because, in their conservative estimates, more than 2 million people get antibiotic-resistant infections each year, and at least 23,000 die because current drugs no longer stop their infections.
Antibiotics are designed to kill bacteria that cause infection.
They also took into account how many, if any, existing antibiotics still work on the bacteria.
Some CRE bacteria are resistant to all existing antibiotics.
Most patients who get this potentially deadly infection are on antibiotics for other infections.
The problem is that while antibiotics kill bad bugs, they also kill good bacteria in your gastrointestinal system that help fight off bad bacteria, C-Diff included.
The government agency hopes to better track infections in the future to know when a bacteria is becoming drug-resistant.
You can also do your part, the CDC said, by preventing infections in the first place.
Also, lowering the use of antibiotics in animals to only when it's absolutely necessary can contribute to stretching the life and usefulness of available drugs, Frieden said.
