Jay Inslee said he is suspending executions while he is in office, meaning he will issue reprieves when any capital cases come to his desk for action.
And in death penalty cases, I'm not convinced equal justice is being served," the first-term Democratic governor said.
The governor's executive action will not definitively end future use of capital punishment in Washington -- that would take action from the legislature or voters -- nor will death row sentences automatically be commuted or pardons issued.
Inslee said his action had nothing to do with mercy.
"I don't question their guilt or the gravity of their crimes.
State law gives Inslee the authority to stop death warrants from being issued.
"African-American residents are disproportionately represented on death row, and our state is more likely to impose the death penalty on African-American defendants than white defendants convicted of the same crime."
Both of Oregon's executions since the Supreme Court allowed the death penalty to resume in 1976 happened during Kitzhaber's first administration as governor, from 1995-2003.
