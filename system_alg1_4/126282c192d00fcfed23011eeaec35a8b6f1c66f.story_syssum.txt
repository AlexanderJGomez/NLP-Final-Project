LONDON, England (CNN) -- British television audiences will be shown an assisted suicide for the first time Wednesday, when a documentary is aired about a man taking his own life at a Swiss clinic.
Ewert's story follows a number of high-profile assisted suicide cases in the UK -- where the practice is illegal -- in recent years, with opinion divided as to whether those involved should face prosecution.
This is where the person who is going to die needs help to kill themselves and asks for it.
No.
Daniel James, 23, died with the aid of his parents in a Dignitas assisted suicide clinic last year after deciding he was no longer able to live with the injuries he sustained playing rugby at university.
Since then several attempts to legalize assisted suicide in the UK have been rejected.
MacDonald, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, said people should have the right to choose the time and place of their death.
Who does it?
Campaigners see the absence of a complete ban on assisted suicides as tacit permission to proceed - although their stance has never been tested in the Swiss courts.
