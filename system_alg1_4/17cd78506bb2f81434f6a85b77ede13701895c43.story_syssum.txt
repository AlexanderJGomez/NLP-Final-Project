The mysterious tunnel measured more than 6 feet in height, nearly 3 feet in width and about 33 feet in length, Toronto Police Deputy Chief Mark Saunders told reporters Tuesday.
"What does that tell you?"
"I wasn't overly concerned that 'Oh my goodness this is going to be something horrific,' " said Saunders, a 31-year veteran overseeing security of the world's third largest international multi-sport games.
In October, a soldier was shot and killed as he stood guard at Canada's National War Memorial in Ottawa.
"There is nothing right now that suggest that this is criminal," he said.
The tunnel was equipped with electricity supplied by a generator, a sump pump to remove water and a pulley system to remove dirt, Saunders said.
"We don't know whether someone is building one somewhere else," Saunders said.
