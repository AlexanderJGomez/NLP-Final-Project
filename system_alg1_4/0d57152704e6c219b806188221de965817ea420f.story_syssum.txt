Dubbed Prevent for short, the strategy aims to intervene in the dynamics of Muslim communities to win over hearts and minds and secure allegiance to Western liberal democracy.
First, it seeks to sponsor moderate Muslim organizations to oppose "the ideology of violent extremism" (a British government phrase that is deliberately obscure) and promote accommodation with the West.
And in a liberal society, where ideas themselves cannot easily be criminalized, something like Prevent is a viable and necessary alternative, they argue.
I spent a year researching the effects of Prevent on England's Muslim communities.
As it became clear that the program constructed Muslims as a suspect community, more and more of the government's Muslim community partners began to disengage.
The vague language of "moderate" and "extremist" was easily exploited to silence nonconformist views, whether from an Islamist ideological viewpoint or simply individual opinions about Britain's foreign policy.
The underlying problem with the Prevent strategy is that it assumes that a democratic government can impose political or religious opinions on its own citizens.
But governments will find it easier to gain the allegiance of Muslims if they take democratic principles more seriously when it comes to criticism of their foreign policy and refrain from demonizing whole communities.
