"It's a well-run place now," Walton said.
"When Jim Walton assumed the presidency of CNN in 2003, it was under performing and earnings were in serious decline," Time Warner CEO and Chairman Jeff Bewkes said in a statement.
Phil Kent, Turner's chairman and CEO, said Walton is "the leader we all aspire to be.
"In his nearly 31 years of uninterrupted and distinguished service to CNN, Jim has been instrumental in growing the business into the financial powerhouse it has become, while establishing the brand as the worldwide leader for television news," Bewkes said.
"And each has been challenging and each has been rewarding in its own way.
We've got big news happening all throughout the world and we have got a lot to do."
