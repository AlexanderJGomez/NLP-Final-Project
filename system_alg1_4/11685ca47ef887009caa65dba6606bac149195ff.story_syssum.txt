CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Hey, I'm Carl Azuz, reporting from Washington, D.C. this week where -- get this -- it is actually hotter than it is 500 miles south in Atlanta, Georgia at CNN's world headquarters!
I'm joined by my CNN Newsource colleague Karen Caifa, who's going to talk to us about what to eat to stay cool on the inside while you seek shade on the outside.
KAREN CAIFA, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Right, Carl.
CAIFA: When the weather is hot and sticky, the foods you love may not seem as appetizing.
CAIFA: Fill your cart with alternative sources of fat, instead of processed or, especially, fried foods.
SCRITCHFIELD: A lot of waters are kind of "fancified," and they've got artificial colors and flavors.
CAIFA: And you want to be sure you're not taking in too much caffeine and things like soda and things like iced coffee, because when it's really hot outside and you're working and you're running around, your heart rate can start racing really fast.
CAIFA: You can stick with that in moderation, like all good things.
AZUZ: All right, Karen Caifa.
