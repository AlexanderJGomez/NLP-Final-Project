Sondra Oster Baras: "Israel has many enemies.
Baras stumps for money from evangelical Christians to support Jewish settlements in the occupied territories -- land she calls biblical Israel.
They support Israel -- which to them includes Jewish settlements on the occupied West Bank.
Christofaro and Baras are part of a growing alliance between evangelical Christians and Israelis.
One of the most successful Jewish fundraisers, Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, raised $39 million last year from Christian Zionists to fund human services and humanitarian work in Israel and the settlements.
"There are a lot more Christian Zionists in America than Jewish Zionists," the former Democratic vice presidential candidate told the group.
Baras said God called her to this work.
"My parents felt very safe in America ... but there was always a part of them that said there needs to be an Israel in the event that we have another Hitler.
I was strengthening the Jewish presence here in Samaria," she said, referring to a biblical name for the northern part of the West Bank.
She said she fought back by encouraging support from evangelical Christians in America.
"If you don't live somewhere, if you don't take possession of it, it is not yours," Baras said.
"It is a controversial issue here in Israel as to whether we should be partnering with the Christians in any way," Baras said.
But Baras said she isn't worried.
"Israel has many enemies," she said.
