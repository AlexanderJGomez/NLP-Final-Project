The University of North Carolina failed some of its students "for years" by allowing them to take classes that did not match its own academic standards, Chancellor Carol Folt has admitted.
"We also accept the fact that there was a failure in academic oversight for years that permitted this to continue," Folt told UNC trustees last week.
CNN has asked UNC Chapel Hill for the number of students who were specially admitted because they did not meet the usual academic standards and who majored in or took the classes now acknowledged as fake.
Dean told Bloomberg Businessweek, whose parent company's chairman is a UNC trustee, that he would investigate whether student-athletes were "clustering" in departments or classes that were supposed to have easy grades and to see whether there were any other forces or personalities behind the scandal.
UNC told CNN last year it has a program that alerts it if too many athletes are enrolled in a single class, but it's not yet clear whether this is different.
