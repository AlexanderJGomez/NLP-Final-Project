Washington (CNN) -- Beginning Saturday and continuing over the next few weeks, some of the nation's most prominent governors will be leaving office as a new crop of state chief executives are sworn in.
Richardson told CNN he is going to stay in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and looks forward to becoming a private citizen after having served as a governor, a cabinet secretary, a United Nations ambassador and a congressman.
Schwarzenegger's last day in office is next Monday.
While his supporters point to major environmental and political reforms in the state, his popularity plummeted as the state's fiscal problems mounted.
It was very rewarding to make some of the decisions that had to be made, and we really moved the state forward," he told host Jay Leno.
But he also acknowledged some of the financial problems facing the Golden State with declarations of fiscal emergencies and several rounds of major spending cuts to popular programs.
On Monday, former governor Jerry Brown, a Democrat, will once again take the helm of the state as it faces a growing budget gap.
Even before taking office, Brown has been meeting with state officials and legislators to help find ways of dealing with it.
Before Sanford's last day on January 12, he is scheduled to tour parts of the state to extend thanks to his supporters.
In an interview with CNN affiliate WCBD in Charleston, Sanford said one of the things he was most proud in his eight years as governor was bringing some fiscal discipline to the state.
Sanford will be succeeded by Republican state legislator Nikki Haley, a rising star in the GOP.
