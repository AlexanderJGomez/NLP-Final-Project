(CNN) -- Chelsea Handler has made a clean break from E!.
"No!"
You didn't think Handler would say goodbye to E!
Throughout "Chelsea Lately's" eight-season run, Handler has commandeered an unabashedly salty late night show, which on a typical night included a ring of celebrity trash-talking comedians and a celebrity interview that ran more bawdy than promotional.
Handler is known to run with a powerful crew that includes A-list actress Jennifer Aniston.
"I want to thank every single person who's shown up for me in the last seven years," Handler said.
Handler is moving on to Netflix from E!, where she's expected to produce some comedy specials and deliver a new talk show in early 2016.
