The short answer?
After a couple of days, Amazon caved and allowed publishers to set their own prices as well.
Amazon wasted no time suggesting that its prices will be dropping soon.
That, too, will presumably lead to lower prices.
Calling Amazon "the Darth Vader of the literary world," Turow said in an op-ed piece for Bloomberg last month that an Apple lawsuit would tilt the field too far in Amazon's favor.
The current landscape "looks like a more robust and competitive market, as opposed to the world we will be left with if the Justice Department paves the way for Amazon to return to its predatory practices," Turow wrote.
