What began as a spontaneous idea and Instagram post has sparked a stream of travelers to send in fun, topless photos -- taken from the back -- to be featured on the social media channels of the Topless Tour, which began as an Instagram project.
Then they called for others to send in their topless photos from around the world.
The Topless Tour currently has nearly 20,000 followers on Instagram.
Although the topless photos come predominantly from women, many men have submitted as well.
