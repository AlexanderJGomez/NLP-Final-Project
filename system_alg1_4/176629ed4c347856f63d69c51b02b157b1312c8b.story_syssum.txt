One of the migrants said he looked forward to watching movies on his new device.
"The migrant workers are different than before," Wang said.
They use these [smartphones] because they can know news very fast and share information with others."
Even simple handsets have enabled China's migrant workers to find jobs, communicate with family back home, organize into groups and access information.
"China has long had a very active, even militant, working class," said Jack Linchuan Qiu, an assistant professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong's communication and journalism school, who researches information and communication technologies and their impact on labor movements in China.
"This is all possible because they have smartphones," Qiu said.
Technology is of no use if no one has the political will."
"Am going to bed now," posted one migrant who writes under the name "Blue Piano" on Sina Weibo.
"Stay home.
Marry.
Roaming.
It is only under particular circumstances they get the spotlight, but what we are seeing is a big sign of what could happen further down the road."
