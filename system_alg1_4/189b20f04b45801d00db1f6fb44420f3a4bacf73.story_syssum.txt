"I already feel like I spend too much time online.
But many of my closest friends are on the East Coast or in Europe, so by the time I get my kids in bed, it's too late to call.
Inspired by my conversation with Leda, I sorted my Twitter buddies so that the people I loved most were in a special group.
Whether your online interactions happen on Facebook, Twitter or some other platform, you can bring the same quality of intention to your online relationships.
You wouldn't hang out at the latest trendy bar if your friends were still gathering at the neighborhood pub; don't get caught up in the race to join the latest hip network if it takes you away from the online communities that engage your dearest friends.
If you focus your online and phone time on a couple of close friendships, you'll have more meaningful conversations than you can sustain with a large circle.
"You're friends on Facebook," my husband reminded me.
Make that "friends," not friends.
Ironically, this contributed to our decision to stay put: Once we focused our time and attention on the people we saw as lifelong friends, our social life became much more meaningful and satisfying.
As we compared notes on our jobs, kids and sex lives (like I said, close friends), I found myself looking wistfully at the table next to hours, where four women made up a "Sex and the City" quartet huddled in an intimate conversation.
It's Saturday night, and as my husband and I banter across Twitter, we're joined online by friends who weigh in on our latest debate and tease us for our geekiness.
For those times when you know what kind of social life you want, but budget, time or logistics make it impossible, the Web can be a great pinch hitter.
The secret to a satisfying social life online doesn't lie in which network you join or how cool your profile page looks -- it's about using social networks to reflect and amplify the way you connect with your friends.
