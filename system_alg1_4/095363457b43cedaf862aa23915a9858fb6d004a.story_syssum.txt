Army Gen. Ray Odierno said he's seen a "constant improvement" in both the security situation and governance in Iraq to prepare for the June 30 deadline for U.S. troops to withdraw from major cities.
"We have already moved out of the cities," Odierno said.
The 131,000 U.S. troops in Iraq still will "maintain full coordination with Iraqi forces inside the cities" and continue to have intelligence capacity, Odierno said.
Odierno also said Iran continues to "interfere" in Iraq, including training insurgents and paying surrogates.
"I'm not authorized to do anything outside the borders of Iraq," he said.
