They wrote "liberty" and "free expression" on placards in rallies that came hours after a terror attack killed 12 people Wednesday in Paris.
"The fact that they were killed in the most insane circumstances is just sickening," Vacheret said.
The most immediate rallying cry against the attack was "Je Suis Charlie," or "I Am Charlie," in reference to the weekly satirical magazine's title, Charlie Hebdo.
According to Le Monde newspaper, French police said as many as 15,000 people gathered in the Place de la Republique, which was closed to traffic.
One student held a sign at the Paris rally saying, "Long live liberty!
Long live Charlie!"
"I don't want anyone to say that my kids, someone from my family, is involved -- this is not Islam," Haddad said.
No religion in the world can authorize anyone to kill.
"The drawings never killed anybody," Lemoine said of the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists.
It is part of French culture and has been for many years, so I felt it was important to be here," Lemoine said.
Parisians used social media to urge people to attend the Place de la Republique vigil, which drew a crowd whose numbers reached several thousand.
Participants laid down flowers and lit candles in the cold night.
Shame on you, shame on you," said one man attending the London event.
"It's the most cowardly thing you can do."
