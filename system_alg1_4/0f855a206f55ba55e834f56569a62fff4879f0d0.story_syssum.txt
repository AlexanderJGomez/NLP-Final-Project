Woodall said the decision was based on Nyang'oro's cooperation, both with the criminal investigation, which is over, and the university-sanctioned investigation being done by former federal prosecutor Ken Wainstein.
Wainstein was hired this year by UNC to do another internal investigation, since past investigations pinning the sole blame on Nyang'oro have not satisfied questions and curiosity from the community and from critics of UNC who think the scope of the fake classes was much bigger than UNC admits.
Nyang'oro's cooperation also led to the NCAA announcing it would reopen its investigation into academic fraud at UNC.

Wainstein said Nyang'oro's cooperation has been very valuable.
