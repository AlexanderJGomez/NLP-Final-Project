(CNN) -- The Denver Broncos announced Wednesday night they had finalized a trade that sends high-profile quarterback Tim Tebow to the New York Jets.
Sources told ESPN that the Jets believed Denver should pay $5 million in salary advances to Tebow.
Tebow, an outspoken evangelical Christian, became the Broncos' starting quarterback last year amid great fanfare.
Jets general manager Mike Tannenbaum said Sanchez will retain his starting quarterback job and Tebow will play in a wildcat-style offense, which uses a quarterback more as a runner.
He wore Bible verses on his eyeblack when he quarterbacked for the Florida Gators.
Tebow quickly became the public face of FRS Co. and Jockey; for months, it was hard to click on ESPN without hearing his name.
Broncos executive John Elway, in a statement issued Wednesday night, said, "Tim Tebow deserves an enormous amount of credit for what he accomplished and how he carried himself during his time with the Broncos.
"I think that that affection that people have for Tebow goes well beyond Denver and his ability to play football."
