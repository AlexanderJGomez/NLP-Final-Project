(CNN) -- After he announced the resignations of four top officials in his administration in 1973, Richard Nixon swore he was done with talking about Watergate, according to the last batch of tapes released by the National Archives.
"Well, its a tough thing, Bob, for you, for John, the rest," he said after the April 30, 1973, speech.
Nixon would be forced to deal with Watergate over and over again in the next year or so, culminating with his own resignation in August 1974 -- a development forced by the discovery of conversations like those released Wednesday by the National Archives.
"How nice of you to say that," Nixon replied.
Nixon replied, "Well, good for you, George."
Nixon resigned shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court ordered him to turn over a recording of that conversation to investigators.
The tapes captured a June 1973 summit meeting between Nixon and Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev, in which Brezhnev bemoaned complaints about the world's two superpowers.
Are we to blame for being strong?
"We said no conditions.
And it worked."
