(CNN) -- A scathing resignation letter written by a former city clerk in Pleasant Hill, California, has gone viral after she wished the city "best of luck in finding some schmuck" to fill her position.
"At least her resignation demonstrated her ability to craft a full sentence with colorful language," Flaherty told CNN, adding that there was a recall effort under way to remove Lehmkuhl.
In a blog dedicated to her clerk campaign, Lehmkuhl wrote she "would be honored to have the opportunity to serve our local community as your City Clerk."
Martin Nelis, the city's public information officer, told CNN that residents had complained that Lehmkuhl would post offensive tweets during public meetings about what was being discussed.
Obviously what her expectation was is different of what the public and the council expected of her," Nelis said.
