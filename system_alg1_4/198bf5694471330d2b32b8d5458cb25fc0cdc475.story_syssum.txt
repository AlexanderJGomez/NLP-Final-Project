Toyota has announced no recall of these vehicles, however, and said it has not received any complaints about the brakes from consumers.
Ford said no injuries had been reported involving the problem.
The Prius, which is built in Japan, is not one of the eight models affected by two recent recalls -- covering several million vehicles -- to fix problems with sticking gas pedals.
NHTSA said its Office of Defects investigation has received 124 reports from consumers about problems with the Prius brakes, including four reports that involved crashes and two that resulted in injuries.
Toyota will cooperate fully with NHTSA's investigation," the company said in a statement.
The Prius problem is a "disconnect" in the vehicle's complex anti-lock brake system that causes less than a one-second lag before the brakes start to work, Toyota said Thursday.
The company also said it changed the braking system software in January for vehicles built since then.
