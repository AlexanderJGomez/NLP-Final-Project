But while it may seem contradictory at first, scientists say bigger blizzards fit the pattern they expect to see from a changing climate.
That makes conditions ripe for major snowstorms after a warmer-than-normal January for most of the Lower 48.
As researchers are quick to point out, weather is different than climate.
"We have to keep in mind that in any given winter, you're going to have some big snowstorms," said Marshall Shepherd, a research meteorologist at the University of Georgia.
Sarah Kapnick, who studies snowfall patterns and climate at Princeton University, said the overall trend for snowfall in the western United States is down.
"But when we get blizzards, they'll be stronger," he said.
