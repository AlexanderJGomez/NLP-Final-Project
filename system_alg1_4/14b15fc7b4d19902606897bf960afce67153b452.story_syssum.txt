The 32-year-old son of actor and kung fu star Jackie Chan has been charged with a drug offense and could face up to three years in jail.
State broadcaster CCTV aired footage of Chan, his face blurred, showing police where the drugs were hidden at his home, while Ko was shown making a tearful apology.
I'm very sorry to those who support me, like me or even know me personally," he said.
Jackie Chan publicly addressed the incident immediately after his son was arrested in August on Sina Weibo.
"I hope that young people will see Jaycee as a cautionary tale and stay away from drugs," he said.
The elder Chan, who has starred in a number of Hollywood movies including "Rush Hour" and "The Karate Kid," has actually campaigned against drug use, and was named an anti-drugs ambassador in China in 2009.
