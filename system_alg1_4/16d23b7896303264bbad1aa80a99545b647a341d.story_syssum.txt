Every girl should have the right to that life, but there are millions of girls in my country who are not so fortunate and are subjected to child marriage.
Every child dreams of a brighter future and a better world, but the question is, why does this dream become a nightmare in the lives of so many girls?
It is estimated that two-thirds of Bangladeshi girls are married before the age of 18.
For the past three years I have lost at least two friends to early marriages at an age where I didn't even know what marriage was.
There are many reasons why early marriage is so prevalent in Bangladesh, but one of the biggest reasons is lack of quality education.
If a girl can feed her family, it will help parents rethink the idea that their daughters are a burden.
If we stop this problem, other problems in our country will be reduced automatically.
I am a part of World Vision's child forum and just this year we have used our voices to stop three child marriages in our community.
My grandmother got married when she was 9 and my mother got married when she was 16.
My hope is that my friends in Bangladesh and girls around the world will get to chase their dreams, too.
