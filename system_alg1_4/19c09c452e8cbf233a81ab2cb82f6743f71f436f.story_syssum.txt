Editor's note: Below is an excerpt from Nancy Grace's new novel "The Eleventh Victim."
What was it?
He couldn't just leave the body lying there like that.
She just wouldn't shut up.
She got straight into his car with a big smile when he offered her a ride.
Something about it drew him.
The shiny pink lip gloss she was wearing had thickened in spots across her lips and some had smeared onto her front teeth.
What was it?
Like a delicate souffl√© or performing his specialty, decorating with boiling-hot spun sugar, perfection was achieved only by acute attention to detail.
It was his favorite brand --it was actually the only twine he would ever consider using -- just shipped in from France.
Walking back to her body, which he had spread carefully on a bed of soft grass to more suitably frame her pale limbs in a night lit only by the moon, he paused again.
No.
No.
It was much too close to the lip gloss.
As he stood there at the foot of her body, staring into her face, her own eyes stared away from him and straight up into the sky, her lips still slightly parted just as they had been in life...just as they had been at the zenith, that incredibly beautiful and intimate moment when she exhaled her last breath into the night.
He squatted down and gently picked up her left hand.
He placed the hand back gently across her stomach.
The bow was perfectly symmetrical, and there, in the moonlight, it was just gorgeous.
