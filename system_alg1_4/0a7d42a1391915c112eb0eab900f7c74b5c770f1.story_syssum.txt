For festivals like Bonnaroo and Coachella, much of the experience is about pitching your tent and camping out for the weekend.
Depending on how much sleep you want to get or how close you want to be to the action (many festivals run 24 hours), you'll want to know if the camping sites are near the stages, scattered across the grounds, or both.
