Juror B29 got it right when she said the six Florida jurors had to follow the law, rather than their hearts, Mark O'Mara said in a statement Friday.
Juror B29 said the evidence showed that Zimmerman was guilty of killing Martin, 17, in February 2012 at a neighborhood in Sanford, Florida.
O'Mara said that the defense acknowledged Zimmerman killed Martin -- in self-defense.
That George Zimmerman literally got away with murder," Sybrina Fulton said in a written statement.
Maddy is the second juror to speak about the high-profile case since the all-female jury acquitted Zimmerman earlier this month.
Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, had a confrontation with the unarmed African-American teen after calling police to report a suspicious person, and he said he shot Martin in self-defense.
