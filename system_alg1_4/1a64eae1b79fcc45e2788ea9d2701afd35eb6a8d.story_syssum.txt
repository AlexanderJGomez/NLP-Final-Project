(CNN) -- Six inches of snow in Chicago.
Snow is very fluffy, and it takes up to a foot of it to squeeze out an inch of rain, meteorologists say.
Many drought-stricken states need a foot of rain, not snow.
Lake City, Minnesota, has received 11.5 inches of snow since Sunday morning, which amounts to about an inch of rain.
Comparatively, Minnesota doesn't have it that bad, according to U.S. Drought Monitor.
But the state is still plagued by "severe," "extreme" and "exceptional" drought, U.S. Drought Monitor said.
Total snowfall in the western half of the country is dropping, said Princeton climatologist Sarah Kapnick, which will mean less accumulation of moisture from snow.
Snowfall has bolstered water levels on the Mississippi River, which had dropped due to drought, said Ann McCulloch, spokeswoman for American Waterways Operators.
As the current storm reaches the Atlantic coast, dumping snow on the nation's capital, the white precipitation should become slushier and deliver more moisture per foot of snow, according to CNN's Weather Center.
Snow plows have been readied.
In the parched Plains states, snow hasn't helped enough.
