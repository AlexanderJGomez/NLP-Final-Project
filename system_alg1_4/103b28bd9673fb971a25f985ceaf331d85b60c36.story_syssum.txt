Miguel Angel Iniguez, 41, was a supervisor for 28-year-old baggage handler Dicarlo Bennett, who pleaded not guilty Thursday to two counts of possession of a destructive device in a public place, a Los Angeles Police Department statement said.
Three plastic bottles containing dry ice were found, but only one had exploded, police said.
Bennett continues to be held on $1 million bail, but a bail review hearing will be held October 23.
"One of the other crew members said take the dry ice out or do something with the dry ice because the carbon dioxide is harmful to the animal, so he took the dry ice out."
