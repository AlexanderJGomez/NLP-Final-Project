Many Facebook and Twitter users condemned Rep. Joe Wilson for his outburst toward President Obama.
The most memorable moment came from Rep. Joe Wilson, R-South Carolina, who shouted "You lie" after the president said that a Democratic-sponsored health care bill would not cover illegal immigrants.
Watch more of Wilson's outburst Â»
Congress, as you know, is pretty polarized," said Kasie Hunt, a health care reporter for National Journal's Congress Daily.
Hunt said there is still a lot of misunderstanding among Republican members of Congress.
There's some fear out there about what could happen."
Still, it might have been Wilson's constituents' anger and distrust that contributed to the outburst in Congress, O'Connor noted.
Pelosi said Thursday that there is a procedure that could have been implemented to strike Wilson's "lie" comment from the record.
It's time for us to talk about health care and not Mr. Wilson," she said.
You expect that a lot more from Rep. DeMint [Republican from South Carolina] than Wilson for sure," O'Connor added.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said Thursday afternoon that since Wilson's comment, his Democratic opponent, former Marine Rob Miller, received 11,000 individual grass-roots contributions and raised more than $400,000.
Ornstein added that Wilson's comment was an "incredibly dumb thing to do" for the broader picture of the Republican Party.
