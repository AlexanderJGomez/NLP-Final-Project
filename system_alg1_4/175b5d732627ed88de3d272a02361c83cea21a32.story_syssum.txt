(CNN) -- The man who shot officers inside a Detroit police station had a relative who is scheduled to be sentenced for double homicide Monday, said the city's police chief, who would not confirm that as the motive behind the attack.
Two of the four officers wounded in the shooting were hospitalized in stable condition Monday, Godbee said.
Brian Anderson was grazed in the head, he said.
Schultz was shot in the chest, but was protected by a bulletproof vest, according to police.
"We will do whatever is necessary to provide an environment for our officers that is safe," Godbee said, but he wouldn't specify any immediate changes.
Counseling will be provided for officers affected by the shootings, said the chief.
