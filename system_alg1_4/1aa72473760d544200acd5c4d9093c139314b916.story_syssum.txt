In a country where bleaching creams are frequently used to chemically lighten skin tone, one savvy entrepreneur is fighting against the disfiguring practice.
Alhaji Mustapha Oti Boateng: I started with Chocho cream -- the natural skin restorer and beauty soap.
AB: My father was a herbalist and my grandfather was a herbalist I tried to recall all those things that when I was young they sent me to the bush to collect.
AB: When I found that my children were growing up, I told [one of my taxi clients] that I had to find something to do so that I would be able to look after my children very well.
AB: They gave me the opportunity to go and I traveled to Japan where I started odd jobs...
I came back with about five buses and started a transport business, but unfortunately for me it was all accidents, one after the other.
AB: This name "Chocho" is in the memory of a dear friend, who has passed on.
AB: I went to the market and bought creams that are manufactured and produced by foreign countries, powders and perfumes, and went around announcing those things for sale and it was really doing very well.
AB: The economy is always fluctuating.
AB: I'm not educated but I'm always happy when I see children in school.
You know here in Africa, it's not all people who get [the] opportunity to go to school.
We can always educate ourselves wherever we go.
