Europeans, who welcomed Obama as the candidate of change, didn't expect him to agree with them on everything, but they believed that he would at least listen to them.
That said, Obama remains far more popular personally than Bush, whose Iraq war adventure with the eager assistance of British Prime Minister Tony Blair led to splits among Europe's leaders.
It is a measure of the president's continued pulling power that the Europeans, who have seemingly grudged every extra pair of boots the NATO secretary general has persuaded them to dispatch up until now, are to stump up around 7,000 additional troops for the war in Afghanistan alongside the 30,000 more committed by a president who has now more than doubled the U.S. contingent there.
On Afghanistan, Europe's political leaders were muttering behind the scenes as the president took a long time making up his mind about the extra troops.
He wanted to tell the folks back home in Peoria, Illinois, that the troops would be home in 18 months, and he wanted to tell the Taliban that an extra 30,000 troops were on their way to make life tough for them.
The Europeans, while they like much about Obama's style, are growing just a little uneasy about how things will pan out under his presidency.
They still feel that the new president is a man they can talk to.
They may become a little sensitive as the president is seen to cozy up to the new players.
The U.S. may still have the military might.
And he will probably remain rather more popular in Europe than he is at home because it is in tackling the back-pocket issues with their own electorates -- like health care -- that most politicians make their enemies.
But so discredited did he become back home that he was forced to step down and hand over power to Gordon Brown.
