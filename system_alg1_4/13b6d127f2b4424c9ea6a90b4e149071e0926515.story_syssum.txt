Masterson, she said, walked up to the shooter and convinced him to put the gun down.
"Then he shot up in the sky, then dropped the gun, and then some teacher grabbed the kid that had the gun," eighth-grader Odiee Carranza told the paper.
Another school staff member suffered "very minor injuries" in the shooting and declined medical treatment so he could continue to care for the pupils in the gym, the governor said.
