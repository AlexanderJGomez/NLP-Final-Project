The fact is there is a fundamental shift underway that we must address to get the economy humming again: the steady substitution of human labor with computers.
America needs to adapt to this shift, or these lackluster job gains are going to become the new normal.
The fact is American teens are falling behind in key subjects that will prepare them for the new age of computing.
Our schools need to change.
MIT scholars Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee have been particularly perceptive in formulating strategies for how Americans can adapt to this seismic shift in the labor market.
In response, there emerged what's called "freestyle" chess, which pairs a human and computer together -- the machine crunches the numbers and the person consults on broader strategy.
The key lesson here is that American workers need to be trained to complement the raw processing and networking power of computers with uniquely human facilities, like evaluating subtle social cues and crafting macro strategies.
This insight has clear implications for how to reform our schools so they can better prepare students for the new age of computing.
Second, computers need to play a more central role in all learning.
It can be learned like geology and history.
By training the next generation of American workers how to complement -- not compete with -- these fabulous new technologies, our schools can ensure this country will flourish for decades to come.
