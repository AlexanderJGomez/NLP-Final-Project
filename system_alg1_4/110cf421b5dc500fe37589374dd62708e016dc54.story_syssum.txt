(CNN) -- Police in British Columbia say a man wanted for allegedly recording himself reaching speeds of at least 186 mph on his motorcycle and posting the video on YouTube has been arrested.
The Saanich Police Department on Vancouver Island said the incident took place on April 6 on a busy stretch of the Trans-Canada Highway.
"You can hear him accelerating even when it says 299 kph," Saanich Police Sgt.
Police in Kelowna aren't sure why Scott chose their town as the place to surrender, but said they are working with Saanich police investigators on the case.
Scott remains in Kelowna police custody and was scheduled to appear in court Wednesday.
