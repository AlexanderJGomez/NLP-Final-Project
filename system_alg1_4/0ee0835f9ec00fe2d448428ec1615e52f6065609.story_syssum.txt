ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Polish authorities in Pakistan say they are monitoring local reports that Taliban militants have executed a kidnapped Polish engineer.
He said all efforts had been made by Polish authorities to pressure the Pakistani government to do whatever it could to secure Stancza's release.
"From the Polish side, we did whatever we could, pressuring the Pakistani government on the presidential and prime minister level," Adams said.
Although there were assurances that the Pakistani government was doing everything it could and that Stancza would be freed soon, Adams said it was never clear what the government was actually doing to secure his release.
Shahid Ullah Baig said the government had been working hard to retrieve Stancza unharmed but did not give details.
