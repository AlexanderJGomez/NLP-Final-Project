(CNN) -- A passenger aboard Continental Airlines Flight 1404 described a scene of panic as the plane skidded off the runway while trying to take off and caught fire Saturday at Denver International Airport in Colorado.
Trejos said when the plane hit the ground, he saw an engine on fire and seats buckling toward each other.
Airport officials said it was too soon to determine the cause of the accident or the fire.
"They described a surreal scene when they pulled up, heavy fire on the right side of the aircraft, all chutes deployed from both sides of the aircraft, people evacuating and walking up the hillside towards them," Hynes said.
"There was significant extension of fire into the cabin portion," he said.
