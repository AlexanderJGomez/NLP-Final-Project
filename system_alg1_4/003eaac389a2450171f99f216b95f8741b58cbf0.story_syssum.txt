(CNN) -- The crane operator facing charges over a deadly building collapse was denied bail Sunday.
"My client is being made the scapegoat in this situation," said Daine Grey, Benschop's attorney.
"This was an accident, but Mr. Benschop was not responsible," Grey said, in remarks captured by CNN affiliate WPVI.
"Justice will only be served if Sean Benschop receives a sentence that buries him in a jailhouse forever, just like his victims were buried on Wednesday," Nutter said.
Afterward, searchers climbed over shards of wood, concrete and rebar looking for survivors, such as a 61-year-old woman pulled alive from the rubble early Thursday.
