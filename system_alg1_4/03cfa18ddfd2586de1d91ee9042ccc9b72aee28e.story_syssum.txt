(CNN) -- The 15-year-old Mexican youth who was shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent had a history of involvement with human smuggling and was on a list of repeat juvenile offenders, U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman Mark Qualia told CNN Thursday.
CNN obtained the video, which was shot by a witness on a cell phone camera from the Mexican side of the border, from affiliate Univision.
This happened on the U.S. side of the border.
Moments later, the officer points what appears to be his firearm in the direction of a second suspect, standing about 60 feet away from the officer -- on the Mexican side of the border.
"They're throwing rocks," witnesses screaming in Spanish can be heard in the background of the video as the officer opens fire.
She had said: "This agent, who had the second subject detained on the ground, gave verbal commands to the remaining subjects to stop and retreat.
The FBI has been studying videos of the incident and said some of the video does show rocks being thrown at the Border Patrol agents, the official said.
Belmonte said Hernandez was shot in the head.
Reports that the Mexican military may have drawn weapons on U.S. Border Patrol agents, which surfaced earlier Wednesday, could not be immediately confirmed.
"We are aware of those reports, but I cannot confirm them to you at this time," said Mexican military spokesman Enrique Torres.
The body was found on the Mexican side of the border, Simmons said.
Peaceful protests against the U.S. Border Patrol were held in Juarez on Wednesday, near the site of the fatal shooting.
Earlier, Qualia, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman, said he could not comment because he does not know where the Mexican government obtained its statistics.
From October 1 through May 31, he said, Custom and Border Protection agents used their firearms 31 times.
