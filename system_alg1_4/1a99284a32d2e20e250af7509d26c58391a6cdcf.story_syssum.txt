As Ad-Rock proudly declares on their excellent new "Hot Sauce Committee Part Two," "Oh, my God, just look at me/Grandpa been rapping since '83!"
It's also a return to classic Beasties chutzpah: On "Hot Sauce Committee," they're not sweating to impress anyone except one another.
(Have you listened to "Hello Nasty" lately?
The music is full of signature touches, from the punk drum solo in "Lee Majors Come Again" to the low-end electro funk of "Here's a Little Something for Ya."
So it's no surprise that on "Hot Sauce Committee Part Two" they make no effort to accommodate or even acknowledge any of the latest hip-hop trends.
