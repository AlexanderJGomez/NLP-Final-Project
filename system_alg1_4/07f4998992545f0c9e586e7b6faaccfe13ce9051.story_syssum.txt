MADRID, Spain (CNN)  -- Human rights groups from the United States and Spain filed a lawsuit in a Spanish court Thursday, charging El Salvador's former president, Alfredo Cristiani, with covering up crimes against humanity.
They were killed at their residence at the prestigious Central American University, in El Salvador's capital, San Salvador.
The case filed by two human rights groups in Madrid argues that justice was never done in El Salvador.
The Spanish court has also taken on human rights cases from other countries, including Argentina and Guatemala, testing a relatively new international legal principle known as Universal Jurisdiction.
Family members from at least two of the slain Jesuits will join the lawsuit later, the groups said.
But a lawyer for the Center for Justice and Accountability told CNN that the most immediate practical effect of the case might be an effective ban on Cristiani and the 14 former officers from leaving El Salvador, for fear of arrest.
"We have become used to violence," Martin-Baro said.
For years, the extreme right in El Salvador had accused the Jesuits of siding with the leftist guerrillas, according to a CNN report shortly after the killings.
