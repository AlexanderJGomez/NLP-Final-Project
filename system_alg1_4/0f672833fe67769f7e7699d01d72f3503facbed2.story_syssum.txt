Hatch started the No Cussing Club.
It began at his school and then, through his Web site, attracted members of all ages from all 50 states and 30 countries.
I got a lot of death threats from people, but I realized that through this whole thing that these people were bullies and I wasn't going to let them win.
Hatch: At first I was actually pretty scared because they said, 'I know where you live.'
Hatch: It's definitely worth it.
People are signing up with our Web site nocussing.com and they're taking the pledge to use language to uplift and make people feel good about themselves.
Hatch: Yeah, it's about talking to people with civility like you said, and making people feel good about themselves and talking to people with respect.
