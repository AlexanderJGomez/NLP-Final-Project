(CNN) -- The parents of a 15-year-old girl who was gang-raped on a California high school campus urged the community Saturday to channel its anger over the event "through positive action," according to a pastor.
Police say as many as 10 people were involved in the rape on October 24 in a dimly lit back alley outside Richmond High School, where a homecoming dance was taking place.
Five people have been arrested in connection with the attack.
The parents' statement urged the community to work to ensure that such an attack never happens again.
Be courageous in speaking the truth and in holding people accountable.
