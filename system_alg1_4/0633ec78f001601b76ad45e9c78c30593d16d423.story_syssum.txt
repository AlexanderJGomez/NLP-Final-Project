Kayak guides "immediately dived into the water at risk to their own lives" and rescued five of the teens, said Bari Sims of Hawaii Pack and Paddle.
"We're doing all we can to support the families and students.
"People of Bold Earth Expeditions have shown poor judgment and extremely poor character," Madoff said Sunday.
"We're devastated by this," Wallis said in response.
