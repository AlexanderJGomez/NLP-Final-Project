But the popularity of the tournament also spawns another kind of madness -- one that includes college applications, vasectomies and HDTV upgrades.
Thanks to exposure from the NCAAs, such teams as Florida Gulf Coast and George Mason see rises in applications and endowments.
George Mason, which went to the Final Four in 2006, and Gonzaga, which broke into nationwide consciousness in the late '90s, saw applications go up after their turn on stage.
And those franchises may benefit more from losses than wins.
According to a survey by the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, 50 million Americans participate in March Madness pools.
For all that, employers say the tournament is a net positive on morale.
According to the same 2014 survey, 12% would upgrade to HDTV if their favorite team made it to the Sweet Sixteen.
Odds of picking a perfect bracket are 9.2 quintillion to 1, assuming each team has a 50% chance of winning every game.
Those networks are part of Time Warner, as is CNN.
