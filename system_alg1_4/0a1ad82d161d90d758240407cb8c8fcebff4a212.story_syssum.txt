Mao Zedong proclaims the founding of the People's Republic of China in Beijing on October 1, 1949.
The best place to look back at what China went through in the past six decades is Tiananmen, or the Gate of Heavenly Peace.
It was on the Tiananmen rostrum where Chairman Mao formally proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic.
In Mao's ideology, the Chinese people found hope in a New China, wherein citizens would always have a bowl of rice to eat and clothes to wear.
In the late 1960s, Mao would again stand in the Tiananmen rostrum to launch the Cultural Revolution.
"To rebel is justified!"
For ten years, China was condemned to political turmoil and economic malaise.
Mao died in 1976 and his remains are kept in a mausoleum in Tiananmen Square.
Deng overturned most of Mao's policies and embarked upon reforming the economy and opening up the country to the outside world.
Not every Chinese embraced Deng's reform and open-door policy.
