One day after the Gulf Cooperation Council released a statement urging Yemen President Ali Abdullah Saleh to transfer powers to his vice president, thousands of protestors returned to the streets Monday for marches and opposition leaders are vowing not to back down.
The Embassy of the Republic of Yemen in Washington responded to the GCC initiative on Monday in a statement which  said Saleh has agreed to transfer powers in accordance with the Yemeni Constitution, which means he will not step down from power until his term ends in 2013.
"The opposition wants everything and President Saleh is still the most powerful person in the country," GCC's Ganadi said.
"No initiative will save Saleh from the crimes he committed against the peaceful youth," Anesi said.
Last week, Saleh said he welcomes the council's efforts to help resolve the political crisis in his country.
Violence and protest have raged in Yemen, where protesters have called for the ouster of Saleh.
"We will not be scared to march and make the regime understand that we will not stop until our demands are met," student activist Hareth Abdullah said.
"We will not differ with the revolution youth and we will support them," Yahya Abu Osbaa, a senior JMP official said.
