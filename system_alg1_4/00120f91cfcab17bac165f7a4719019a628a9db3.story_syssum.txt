Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Rebels in Tripoli furiously hunting for signs of longtime Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi are exploring a network of tunnels and bunkers built beneath his massive compound.
It also is thought to extend to a neighborhood where Gadhafi forces were lobbing shells recently toward the compound after it was taken over by the rebels.
Sidner also saw a range of other sights as she strolled through the labyrinth: A thick wall, a massive door and a sturdy lock.
"It's set up like a survival bunker," Sidner said in an on-air report.
