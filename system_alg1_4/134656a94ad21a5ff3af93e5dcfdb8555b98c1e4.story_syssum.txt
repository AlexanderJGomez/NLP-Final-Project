Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korea says it may back out of the family reunions it agreed to hold with South Korea if the latter continues with the annual drills it holds with the United States.
The reunions of about 100 people from each country are scheduled to take place between February 20 and 25, the South Korean unification ministry said Wednesday, following face-to-face talks between the two sides.
To expand the trust, I want to say that the agreement must be kept."
In its calls so far this year for better relations, North Korea has asked South Korea not to take part in the drills -- a request that Seoul and Washington have rejected.
Tens of thousands of people in South Korea are on the list of those wanting to take part in the reunions.
