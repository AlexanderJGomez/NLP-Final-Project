Especially this year, "we've really tried to stay true to (Lucy's) vision with as much comedy as we can pack into a weekend," said Journey Gunderson, executive director of the Lucy Ball Desi Arnaz Center for Comedy.
Now in its 20th year, The Lucille Ball Festival of Comedy draws diehard Lucy fans and comedy enthusiasts from countries as far away as Australia, Britain, Canada and Japan to tour the Lucy-Desi museum and Desilu Playhouse, two of the attractions at the Center.
Lucy Fest has always been a weekend to celebrate Lucy's contributions to comedy on what would have been her birthday.
Gunderson said they are in talks with colleges and universities about offering master classes and seminars in comedy.
Gunderson says bringing a national Comedy Hall of Fame to Jamestown, New York, could be the "most aggressive" of the four pillars in their vision.
"That's the point."
