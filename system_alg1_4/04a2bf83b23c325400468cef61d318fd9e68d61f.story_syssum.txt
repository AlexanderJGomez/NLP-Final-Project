"I was going to be a lawyer and I had studied hard," Liu says, "but then it suddenly occurred to me in a very deep, profound way that I didn't want to keep practicing law for the rest of my life," she adds.
She worked feverishly for 14 hours a day, producing her first novel --  a paranormal magic thriller called "Tiger Eye".
Apart from traditional novels, Liu also found her calling in comic books.
Liu also teaches comic book writing at MIT, even though she only became familiar with the genre at college after stumbling across it in a local bookstore.
Work hard, study hard at it and don't give up," she says.
