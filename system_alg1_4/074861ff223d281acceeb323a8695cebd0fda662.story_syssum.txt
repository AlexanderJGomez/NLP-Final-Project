(CNN) -- For years, Republican presidents and presidential candidates have strip-mined Clint Eastwood movies for rhetorical nuggets.
Bush in 1988, echoing Eastwood in the original "Dirty Harry," adding, "No new taxes."
But to many, the political nuggets Eastwood delivered this time were more like fool's gold.

Not at all.

During the Nixon years liberals branded Eastwood movies like "Dirty Harry" as "fascist."
The first half of Eastwood's career he played men who shot first and thought about it later.
Is that Democrat?
