Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Kepler Meo isn't nervous.
Michael Kepler Meo is just 12 years old.
Los Angeles Opera Music Director James Conlon briefly peeks into the dressing room to wish young Meo good luck.
Michael won the role of Miles, a troubled boy threatened by menacing ghosts in a rambling English country home.
"You have to find somebody whose voice is strong enough, and somebody who can sing at all levels with a very focused tone.
Meo says she isn't sure where Michael came by his musical talent.
"I don't have too much contact with kids my age," Michael says.
By almost any measure, Michael's rise in the world of opera has been meteoric.
What then?
It will be a challenge, but, "It may be better," Michael says.
