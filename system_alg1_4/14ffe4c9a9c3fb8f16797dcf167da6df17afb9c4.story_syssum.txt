At least nine were killed in Cebu province and one died in the province of Siquijor, the Philippines News Agency reported, citing the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council.
Dozens of people were missing, and authorities were checking into reports of people trapped in collapsed buildings in Cebu and Bohol, the agency reported.
Power was restored to most affected areas, except Bohol province, the city of Cadiz and part of the city of Iloilo.
There was no widespread threat of a tsunami, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said, but it warned that earthquakes this large can sometimes cause tsunamis within 100 kilometers of the epicenter.
"It was very strong," Poole said.
I am used to earthquakes.
"Lucky thing is that it is a holiday here today and it happened at a time when nobody was in the church," Poole said.
