If Team USA was going to win at the Special Olympics World Winter Games, Nelson thought, they had some conditioning to do.
Nelson decided his son would set an example for the floor hockey team.
"He put the challenge out there and I accepted it," said Teddy Leonard, captain of Team USA.
"It was very hard at first," goalie Lisa Salim said.
"The whole team suffered because one person stepped out of line," Leonard said.
"
Leonard, one of the team's biggest losers, dropped more than 50 pounds.
"I feel great now.
"I'm able to be on a run all the time," Salim said.
"We have a saying in our team that we're champions, but we're champions in everything we do," Nelson said.
He plans to continue losing weight after the team returns home; he wants to drop from 350 to 280 pounds.
"This is forever," he said.
