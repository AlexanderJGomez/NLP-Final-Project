FNB Dance Umbrella (February/March) If you want to see daring and thoroughly modern dance then this festival is the place to be.
Celebrating its 20th birthday this year, FNB Dance Umbrella brings cutting-edge contemporary dance to venues throughout the city, including the Wits Theatre and Newton's Dance Factory.
Hundreds of thousands of people attend, perhaps to peruse the latest camping and outdoor gear, but more likely to take in attractions including extreme-sports displays, rock concerts and an outdoor film festival, which this year will incorporate a celebration of Bollywood film.
Jo' burg Art Fair (April) African art has inspired painters from Picasso to Matisse, and while the uninitiated might think of African art in terms of traditional statues and masks, contemporary African art is thriving.
Centered around the Newton Cultural Precinct, Arts Alive is one of the biggest cultural events in Africa, with live music, theater, visual arts happenings, poetry readings and stand-up comedy.
Last year's Arts Alive featured high-brow events including jazz performances at Zoo Lake and a student film festival, as well more visceral fare, with the likes of DJ Krush delivering electronic beats in Newtown.
