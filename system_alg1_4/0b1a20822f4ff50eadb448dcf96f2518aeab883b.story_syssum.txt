Washington (CNN) -- Taj Magruder has never voted for Hillary Clinton.
"I have yet to vote for Hillary," said Magruder, who was too young to cast a ballot the last time she was on one.
Magruder is an unsalaried Clinton warrior.
"I am very, very passionate obviously about Hillary," Magruder said, if that wasn't already clear.
"She was so good last night," he tweeted after Clinton's sit-down on the Colbert Report.
And while he only has 780 followers, many of those include reporters following Clinton and representatives from the groups looking to help her if she runs again.
Some, like Still 4 Hill, have devoted years to blogging about her every move.
Still 4 Hill started her blog after Clinton ended her presidential campaign in 2008.
She began to write about Clinton's events at the State Department and once Clinton stepped down as America's top diplomat in 2013, Still 4 Hill began writing about Clinton on the paid speaking circuit.

But Clinton's previous run might not be her last.
If there is one, I would love it," Magruder said.
