Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Riot police fired tear gas and sent hundreds of demonstrators running a day after Haiti's national elections ended in turmoil amid allegations of widespread fraud.
On Sunday, hours before the polls closed, Martelly and 11 other candidates for president made a joint declaration denouncing the election and calling for its cancellation.
"The election day has successfully concluded," said the committee's director general, Pierre Opont, in a news conference Sunday night.
He also said at least one person died as a result of election violence.
We trained the people.
A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince said American diplomats were appealing for calm and waiting for the result of a report expected to be issued by a team of international election observers in a joint delegation from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community.
According to electoral law, a candidate must win 50 percent of the vote or the election goes to a second-round runoff.
"Shots were fired," said spokesman Jean-Francois Vezina.
Vezina said he could not confirm reports broadcast on Haitian radio that a woman and a girl were killed in the border clash.
