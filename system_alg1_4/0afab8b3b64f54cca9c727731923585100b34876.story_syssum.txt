Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- Twelve members of former Ivorian president Laurent Gbagbo's inner circle have been indicted for crimes relating to the post-electoral crisis that left over 3,000 dead.
They had been under house arrest in various locations in the north and centre of the country.
Gbagbo and his wife Simone -- whom the United Nations says was responsible for organizing the death squads -- haven't yet been charged.
The members of the inner circle and the Gbagbos are being held under a colonial-era law that allows anyone considered a threat to national security to be kept under house arrest indefinitely.
Around 70 Gbagbo loyalists have been charged by military or civilian courts, while an international arrest warrant has been issued for Charles Blé Goudé, the leader of the pro-Gbagbo Young Patriots militia.
Ouattara Sunday said he was extending an "olive branch" to former members of Gbagbo's party.
