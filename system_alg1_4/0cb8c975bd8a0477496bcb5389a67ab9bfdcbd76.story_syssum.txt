Arsenic in apple juice.
The show tested three dozen samples of five brands of juice and found some contained arsenic levels between 11 and 36 parts per billion.
The researchers found about 10% of the samples had arsenic levels higher than 10 parts per billion.
Human activities also can introduce arsenic into the environment."
Last year they analyzed the arsenic levels in 94 samples of apple juice.
Humans have been exposed to it for thousands of years."
The researchers found about 10% of the samples --including ones from well-known brands -- had arsenic levels higher than 10 parts per billion.
Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports, has advocated since then for a 3 parts per billion limit but said in a statement that it is happy with the FDA's "reasonable first step."
