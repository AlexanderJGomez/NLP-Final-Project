"For any survivor of sexual trauma, it's challenging, and it takes a lot of courage to come forward," said Jennifer Wilson, director of the National Sexual Assault hot line.
The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, which calls itself the nation's largest anti-sexual assault organization, said it had seen an 83 percent increase in activity on its online hot line and a 26 percent increase on its telephone hot line after Phillips' interview with Oprah Winfrey aired last week.

Humans "have an instinct for avoiding incest or inbreeding," said Debra Lieberman, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Miami (Florida) who researches incest.
"It also depends on his other mating opportunities," Lieberman said.
A victim of incest has to understand that it's not his or her fault and get professional help, Wilson said.
"It doesn't make it so that you can't go on and be -- once you deal with honestly and realistically what you've been through, it doesn't mean that you can't be counted on or you can't be well enough to be a part of the world."
