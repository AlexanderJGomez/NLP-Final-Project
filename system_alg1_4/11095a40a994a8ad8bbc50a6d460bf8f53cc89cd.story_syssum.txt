(CNN) -- The deportations of thousands of Mexicans who have served time in U.S. jails into Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, are adding a deadly ingredient to an already volatile state of security, Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz said.
Adding deportees from the United States, some with criminal records, worsens the situation, the mayor said.
They end up in the city of Juarez, and that's a problem generated for us, but also for the United States."
About 85,400 "criminal aliens" were deported from the United States to their homelands in 2008, according to ICE.
Not all were Mexican, so not all left the United States by crossing into Juarez, she added.
Reyes Ferriz wants deportees to be repatriated to the interior of Mexico instead of his city.
In a recent conversation, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the United States would work to give Juarez more details about who is being dropped off on its doorstep, Reyes Ferriz said.
By comparison, the homicide rate in New Orleans, Louisiana, by far the deadliest city in the United States in 2008, was 64 homicides per 100,000 residents, based on preliminary FBI figures.
