Sun Myung Moon, founder of the church colloquially known as the Moonies, is unconscious and undergoing treatment for pneumonia at a hospital in South Korea, a spokesman said Thursday.
Many met their spouses-to-be for the first time during the ceremony.
Moon is the founder of The Washington Times newspaper, which vocally backed Reagan, she said.
Different measures are under way in case of the worst-case scenario, according to the church spokesman.
Followers of the church worldwide are praying for his health, he said.
