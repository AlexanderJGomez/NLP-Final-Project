Her knees, hips and ankles hurt from arthritis.
"I think people tend to think of this as more of a nuisance," said Dr. John Klippel, president and CEO of the Arthritis Foundation.
While older people do develop arthritis, children and teenagers can get certain forms of the condition, Klippel said.
Researchers don't know the exact cause of arthritis, but they do know what puts people at risk.
"It's annoying -- it's certainly not good for the joints, but on the other hand, it doesn't cause arthritis," Klippel said.
Staying active actually is one of the most important ways to prevent and ease the pain of arthritis, Klippel said.
"For people with arthritis, it hurts to exercise," he said.
Klippel worries about arthritis patients who don't seek medical help because they don't think anything can be done about the pain.

She also exercises at least three days a week; the workouts help her strengthen her muscles.
