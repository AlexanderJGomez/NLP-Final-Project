Chief Petty Officer Terrell Horne was one of two Coast Guard members thrown off their cutter's small boat when the suspect's panga-style vessel "suddenly increased speed and maneuvered directly" at them, then struck the boat, said Capt.
"Chief Petty Officer Horne was an outstanding Coast Guard member," Jenkins said.
Then, the panga accelerated and hit the small boat, forcing Horne and another Coast Guard member overboard.
The panga boat fled the scene but was later interdicted by a different Coast Guard boat and helicopter, he added.
