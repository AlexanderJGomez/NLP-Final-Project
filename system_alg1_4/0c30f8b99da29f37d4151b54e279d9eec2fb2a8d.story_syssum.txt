I like to help people so they can help themselves in the long run," she said.

Food stamp "benefits aren't really enough for a healthy diet," said Jim Weill, president of the nonprofit Food Research and Action Center.
But she said she would starve herself before letting her boys go hungry.
All SNAP recipients are eligible for free nutritional counseling to help people stretch their food budgets, said Daniel, of the USDA.
"The money will be found so people are not turned away," Daniel said.
But the food stamp program is somewhat successful, he said.
Thomas, the laid-off furniture worker in Washington, said he doesn't want people to feel sorry for him.
For now, he's just happy to continue the job search without the pain of hunger nagging at his stomach.
