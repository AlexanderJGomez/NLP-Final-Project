Hockey and I are old friends.
Why?
Because they don't lose?
Are the Blackhawks unbeaten?
A hockey game no longer can end in a tie.
So, even if you lose a game in extra time -- as the Blackhawks have -- you didn't "lose."
Hey, you obviously know your hockey!
The team is the talk of the town.
On national TV's sports news, the two smokin'-hot teams have been basketball's Miami Heat (beating almost everybody they play) and hockey's Blackhawks (kinda sorta technically not losing to anybody they play).
I do not know if you know who Chicago's hockey stars are.
Another one is Marian Hossa, which is pronounced "Ho Sa," not hoss sa, not hah sa.

The Blackhawks hadn't won a Stanley Cup since 1961.
I was a hockey guy.
I have a daughter who recently asked whether I could get her hockey tickets.
Hockey isn't for everybody.
