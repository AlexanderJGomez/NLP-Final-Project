We had tried to get this British businessman to talk about the mysterious death of Neil Heywood.
Heywood was found dead last November in his hotel room in the sprawling southwestern Chinese city of Chongqing.
Hakluyt has released a statement on Heywood, saying, "We had a long history of advising Western companies on China and we are among those who sought (Heywood's) advice.
Now, the British government is asking China to investigate Heywood's death.
Heywood's death on its own -- a man linked to former spies, a light drinker dead from apparent alcohol poisoning -- would be suspicious enough.
Bo rose through China's political ranks and was appointed Communist Party secretary of Chongqing, a city of more than 30 million people.
But Bo also made enemies.
His right-hand man and former top cop Wang Lijun spectacularly sought refuge in an American consulate.
The Wall Street Journal, quoting anonymous diplomatic sources close to the case, reports Wang clashed with Bo after raising his suspicions that Heywood had been poisoned.
In a year of political transition in China, with a new generation of leaders poised to inherit power, the Bo case has captivated the country.
"This is a battle of the gods, not ordinary people," said one old man, who has seen leaders and revolution come and go.
Bo, the man who ran the criminals out of town, now finds himself ousted.
