But if you visit Microport, a startup firm funded by venture capital, you will find a group of tech entrepreneurs with a global mindset trying to disrupt an overpriced, legacy-ridden industry (in their case, the one for medical diagnostics equipment).
Microport's dynamic founder says his dream is for China to become an innovation powerhouse that produces its own homegrown Apple.
The Chinese government is investing tens of billions of dollars into science and engineering research and education, and lavishing tax breaks and subsidies on technology firms and clusters, in an effort to leapfrog the country to the cutting edge of innovation.
That is why bashing China and using it as an excuse for industrial policies that subsidize uncompetitive domestic companies is a folly.
An even more dangerous prospect is a trade war, something that might happen as a result of Western governments ganging up on China at the World Trade Organization over its policies on rare Earth minerals.
That means shoring up the things that made America the world's innovation powerhouse in the first place.
So, as Gates notes, they go home and start companies there that compete with America instead.
Finally, America can make it easier for young firms, which have created almost all the net new jobs the last few decades, to find capital.
Congress should pass this bill quickly, and help entrepreneurial energy to kick-start growth.
If America wants to stay at the top, it needs to gear up on innovation.
