Washington (CNN) -- "Our foreign policy is just spinning out of control" one senator said.
I don't care," Kerry said when Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a committee veteran, complained of what he predicted would be failed diplomatic efforts on Syria, Iran and Middle East peace.
The debate on the Syria issue demonstrated how things have changed between Kerry and his former committee colleagues.
On Tuesday, Republicans who joined Democrats in backing the resolution last year castigated Kerry and the administration for what they characterized as an ineffective Syria policy.
Obama has rejected any chance of U.S. troops joining the Syrian fight, but Kerry said the President believes arming the opposition could change the Syrian leader's "calculation" of how the conflict will proceed.
Kerry shot back.
Obama had decided back then to attack, Kerry said, and the President's resolve led to the agreement brokered by Russia for Iran to turn over its chemical weapon stockpiles to international control.
The Ukraine crisis also drew criticism, with McCain accusing the administration of using "the logic of appeasement" by failing to provide military support against Russia's expansionist moves.
Initial sanctions imposed because of Russia's recent move to annex Crimea from Ukraine already had an impact, Kerry said, telling the panel the Russian ruble currency had been devalued by 7%.
Kerry responded with his insistence that any final deal with Iran must include proof through verification that an Iranian nuclear energy program would only be capable of peaceful use.
McCain said failure appeared certain for three initiatives under Kerry -- the Geneva agreement for Syrian talks, the ongoing talks on Iran's nuclear ambitions, and the Israel-Palestinian talks.
McCain rejected that, telling Kerry: "It is stopped.
"We'll see where the reality is as we go down the road here," Kerry responded.
