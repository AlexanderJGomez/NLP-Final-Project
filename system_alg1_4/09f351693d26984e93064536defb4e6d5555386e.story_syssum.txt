A woman in Argentina says the pope called her Monday and told her she could receive Communion, despite being married to a divorced man, reports say.
It's true that Pope Francis has earned the nickname the "cold-calling pope" for his practice of picking up the phone and calling everyday folks (although there has been at least one hoax about a papal phone call).
The Catholic Church officially teaches that marriage is for life and that couples who divorce are still married in the eyes of the church unless they receive an annulment -- a process that literally nullifies the first marriage.
Conservative Catholics, many of whom have been less than thrilled with the new pope during the first year of his papacy, are not happy with the latest news.
Despite all the brouhaha, this phone conversation was actually a private one, between "Father Bergoglio"-- as the pope allegedly identified himself -- and the woman.
Even if he is the pope, such a private conversation does not automatically change centuries of church teaching, as the most recent Vatican statement points out.
It's too early to tell if this is the pope's way of asserting his position on a possible change in pastoral practice or even church teaching.
