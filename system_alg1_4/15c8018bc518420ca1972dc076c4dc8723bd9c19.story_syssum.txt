(CNN) -- Police in Albuquerque, New Mexico, released a composite image Tuesday of a young boy found buried beneath the sand of a local playground.
On Tuesday, police still had no answers as to what happened at Alvarado Park -- or even who the boy was.
Albuquerque Police Department spokesman John Walsh said a preliminary autopsy didn't reveal a cause of death.
Walsh said there were no obvious signs of bruising on the boy.
Though police have received numerous tips from the public, Walsh said nothing has come from them.
Resident Rachel Lesperance told CNN affiliate KOAT-TV she spent her weekend collecting $3,600 for the boy.
"We're his family now, and we want him to be taken care of like one of our own."
