Washington (CNN) -- A federal appeals court in Washington Thursday struck down the Texas voter ID law requiring photos for voters at the polls, calling it racially discriminatory.
Although the law provides for approved voter registration certificates with no photo as acceptable for voting in certain circumstances, the court said the law imposes "strict unforgiving burdens on the poor."
The panel of judges for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia also said it was ruling only on the Texas law, and not issuing a statement about other state voting laws.
Abbott, meanwhile, said Texas will immediately take the case to the nation's highest court, where "we are confident we will prevail."
"Chalk up another victory for fraud," said Gov.
The Texas law said those who are 65 or older, disabled or expect to be absent on Election Day may vote by mail without presenting identification.
Earlier this month, a state court in Pennsylvania approved a voter ID law requiring photo identification at the polls.
