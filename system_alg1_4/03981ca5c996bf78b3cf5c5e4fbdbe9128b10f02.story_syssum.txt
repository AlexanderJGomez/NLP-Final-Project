Kevin Lunsmann was reunited with his mother, the U.S. Embassy in Manila said Monday, without offering additional details.
He "was spotted alone" Saturday about six miles southwest of Lamitan City on the island of Basilan, a stronghold of the Islamic militant group Abu Sayyaf, the official Philippines News Agency said.
Fourteen gunmen snatched Kevin, his mother, Gerfa Yeatts Lunsmann, and his 19-year-old cousin, Romnick Jakaria, in July while they vacationed on the island of Tictabon, authorities said.
Jakaria was released last month, according to the news agency.
Basilan's governor called on authorities Sunday to prosecute the alleged kidnappers of the Lunsmann family, according to the news agency.
"The prosecution of kidnappers by a court of law will put a stop to kidnappings," the news agency quoted Jum Akbar as saying.
Kevin's father told WSET that the boy will eventually share his story of escape, but did not say when.
