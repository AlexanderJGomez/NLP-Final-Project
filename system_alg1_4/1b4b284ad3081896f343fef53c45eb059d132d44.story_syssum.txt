The vertical passenger seat -- or "standing cabin" -- may be the next big cost-cutting move in aviation, according to a new report whose author says the concept could be here within five years.
Romli quickly discovered that the idea had already been researched -- most notably by Airbus, China's Spring Airlines and Ireland's Ryanair.
"We have no plans to trial or introduce standing flights," says the spokesperson.
"We don't believe there are good market opportunities for this idea," says Mark Hiller, CEO of Recaro Aircraft Seating, one of the world's major suppliers of commercial airplane passenger seats.
"The idea seemed to be nixed before it was properly analyzed because I couldn't find any published study about it," he says.
"So if that's possible, then standing on an aircraft (shouldn't) be a far-fetched idea.
Romli admits his concept is likely to be greeted with skepticism, not least from aviation safety authorities who would have to sign off on the concept.
