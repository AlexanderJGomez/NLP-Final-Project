The first lady turns 50 on Friday, and it's being reported that she will be serenaded by singer Beyonce for the occasion.
The singer even once wrote an open letter of admiration: "Michelle, thank you so much for every single thing that you do for us.
Michelle Obama responded, "@Beyonce Thank you for the beautiful letter and for being a role model who kids everywhere can look up to.
"When BeyoncÃ© goes into the studio to record an album for her millions of fans, she's not thinking about her friendship with the first lady; she's thinking about what's hot, what's edgy, and what will sell to the masses," Samuels wrote.
I am not a Bey hater, but I am an observant onlooker."
Powerful friends can attract powerful opinions.
