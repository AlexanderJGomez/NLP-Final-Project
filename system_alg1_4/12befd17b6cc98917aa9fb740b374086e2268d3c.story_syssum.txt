Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf pledged in a speech Sunday to return to his country later this month, despite word from authorities that he will be arrested when he does so.
When he does, Pakistani officials said, Musharraf will be arrested in connection with the 2007 assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
The former president said Sunday that he will return even at the risk of his life.
To exploit this vacuum, I have to be back now," Musharraf said.
Musharraf, who resigned in 2008, is expected to fly into Pakistan from the United Arab Emirates later this month, accompanied by up to 500 supporters, said Jawed Siddiqi, spokesman for the former president's All Pakistan Muslim League party.
Terrorism in Pakistan, he said, "is at its peak.
In 2010, the United Nations released a report that said Musharraf's government had failed to protect Bhutto before her 2007 assassination.
In 2010, Musharraf said the timing of his return to Pakistan would depend on the environment there.
