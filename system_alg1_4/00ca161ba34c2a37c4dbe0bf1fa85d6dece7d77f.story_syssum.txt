Today, the services built on top of that network have done a great job in enabling communications, perhaps none more dramatically than Twitter.
Could we trust Twitter?
Not at all.
And wasn't that the promise of the Web in the first place?
The company has even shown a reassuring sensitivity to the civic and social obligations that come from running such a popular communication service.
But the Web is bigger than any one site or any one social network.
We'll naturally make great use of Twitter and Facebook and all the other services, but it'd be unforgivable to pick only one of them as a platform for civic engagement.
Now the challenge is reminding all of the social institutions, media organizations and government agencies that they need to use their own communications infrastructure just as much as they participate in services such as Twitter and Facebook.
In fact, many of us have allowed companies to become intermediaries to all our communications, whether it was AOL 10 years ago or Facebook today.
We can run our own Web sites, at our own Web addresses and keep control over how we communicate.
This is, after all, how the Web was designed to work.
Because we'll have a web of independent but connected communications systems, just as the Internet was always designed to be.
