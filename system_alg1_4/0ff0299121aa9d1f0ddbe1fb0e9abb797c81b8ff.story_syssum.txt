(CNN) -- How are fads started and spread?
Maybe Twitter can tell us.
To demonstrate the unique power of Twitter data, our research group at Northeastern University and Harvard Medical School recently began a study to infer the mood of Twitter users in the United States from their public tweets.
Never before have academic researchers had access to this much real-time public information about what people are thinking and saying.
In fact, other research groups have also begun to examine Twitter data and have demonstrated that it can be used to predict the box-office success of an upcoming movie.
Because most users leave their tweets public, Twitter represents an unprecedented opportunity.
Unlike many existing tools, such as surveys and polls, researchers cannot ask a question of the Twitter users directly; instead, researchers must determine whether the question is one that the Twitter data can answer.
From a scientific standpoint, Twitter data can shed light on how information spreads through society.
In short, the data that is now becoming available from Twitter and related websites offers a new lens through which we can view society.
