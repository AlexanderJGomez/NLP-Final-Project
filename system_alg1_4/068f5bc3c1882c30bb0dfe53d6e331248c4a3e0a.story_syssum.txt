Paul Embleton's BRAVE Foundation has trained more than 1,000 volunteer firefighters in Guatemala.
Veteran firefighter Paul Embleton witnessed such a rescue attempt in 1996 while on a medical mission trip to Guatemala -- and it moved him into action.
Embleton launched the BRAVE Foundation -- Bomberos Resourceful And Valiant Efforts -- to provide emergency response training and equipment to volunteer firefighters (bomberos) in Guatemala.

"I'd gone back to my hotel to try to think how I was going to teach with the same limited resources they had," Embleton said.
"Basic techniques that firefighters had outside of Guatemala, we'd never learned, and we wanted to learn."

His group is building a fire station and training firefighters at 120 Company -- the newest company of firefighters in the remote lake community of San Juan La Laguna.
We're educating the people that the firefighters are here to help."
"The firefighters have the motivation, and you get a heart for it because you see how well we have it in the States," Embleton said.
Despite his personal sacrifice, Embleton is quick to share credit for BRAVE's efforts and success, citing the help of volunteers, private donors, firefighters, Rotary and the Guatemala community.
