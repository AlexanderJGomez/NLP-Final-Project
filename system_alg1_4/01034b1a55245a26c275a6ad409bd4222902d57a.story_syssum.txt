(CNN) -- Elvis was singing in the men's room.
In the men's restroom, every time I've gone in, Elvis Presley's voice is singing.
.
The other night I was eating at the restaurant and, of course, Elvis was singing in the men's room.
The signature: Barbara Hearn Smith.
But now, in the dwindling weeks of 2011, in the BrickTop's men's room, here was Elvis singing, and here was Barbara Hearn's autograph.
She's 74, and she laughed out loud when I told her where I had found her photo.
She said that she and her husband had been having lunch at the BrickTop's in Nashville when a waiter had overheard them talking about Elvis.
Jim Smith went out to their car, where he knew there was a photo of Elvis and Barbara; he brought it into the restaurant, and she signed it so the waiter could give it to the boss when he came in.
Why?
But back to Barbara Hearn: She said she first met Elvis when she was working at Goldsmith's Department Store in Memphis with a friend named Dixie Locke, who was dating Presley.
Elvis?
In the photo, Barbara is prim in a white dress with dark polka-dots; Elvis is slouched and shirtless.
And what we're doing is, he had just taken the train back from New York, where he had recorded some new songs for RCA Victor.
I said yes, I thought it was.
("I didn't hold it against him at all," Barbara told me.
"That year of 1956, I saw him go from being barely famous to a super-duper star," she said.
She said she'd had no idea, until I told her.
