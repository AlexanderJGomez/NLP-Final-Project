Sydney has been at the forefront of this since establishing the "Sustainable Sydney 2030" vision.
In Sydney, this has been our warmest winter in 150 years with the average daily temperature rarely dropping below 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius).
This includes installing Australia's biggest program of building-mounted solar panels -- with 5,500 solar panels on 30 buildings.
While Sydney is moving towards a more sustainable future, climate change demands we do more.
As far as transport goes, cities like New York and London have experienced a cycling boom and despite the nay-sayers, Sydney has also seen a 113 percent increase in cycling since 2010.
As Sydney becomes a greener and better connected place, our long term "Sustainable Sydney 2030" plan is designed to make sure the city works for everyone, now and in the future.
