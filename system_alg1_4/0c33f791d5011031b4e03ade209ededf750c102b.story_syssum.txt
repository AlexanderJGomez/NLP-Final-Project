Hernandez was a member of the Texas National Guard, officials said Thursday.
"The Texas National Guard family has lost a friend and fellow soldier and he will be missed, but more importantly the soldier's family mourns the loss of a loved one," the Guard said in a statement.
Ciudad Juarez is in the Mexican state of Chihuahua and shares a border with El Paso.
In November, a member of the U.S. Air Force was among six people killed when gunmen entered a strip club in Ciudad Juarez and opened fire.
A second person, Rafael Ramirez Reza, 22, originally from Juarez, was also killed, said Carlos Gonzalez, spokesman for the Chihuahua Attorney General's office.
