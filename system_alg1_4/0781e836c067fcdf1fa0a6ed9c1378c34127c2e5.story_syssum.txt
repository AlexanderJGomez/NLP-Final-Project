(CNN) -- After a judge temporarily lifted a gag order so that he could respond to allegations made on YouTube by his ex-wife, comedian Steve Harvey Tuesday released court documents saying those allegations are false.
In addition, the court documents said, Mary Harvey received $40,000 a month from Harvey until March 2009 and received $1.5 million from him in March 2009.
Edmonds said in late January Marjorie Harvey was "contemplating" filing a defamation suit against Mary Harvey because of the accusations against her.
Harvey "is authorized to publish this order for the limited purpose of refuting the allegations of respondent Mary Lee Harvey," the documents said.
Edmonds said that hearing is on contempt of court allegations against Mary Harvey.
