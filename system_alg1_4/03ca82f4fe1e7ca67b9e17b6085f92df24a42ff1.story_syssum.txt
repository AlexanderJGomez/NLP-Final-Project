"There's the fine line between seeing that things are bigger than you and letting your ego go," Nyad said at a news conference in Havana Friday.
Were Nyad to swim the 103 miles from Havana to the Florida Keys, she would be the first person to do so without the benefits of a shark cage, flippers or wet suit.
Since Maroney's swim, some of the world's best endurance swimmers have tried to cross the straits of Florida without using a cage.
Cuban authorities said that after her latest attempt was announced in state media, they received a barrage of suggestions from across the island on how she could ward off the stinging jellyfish that ended previous attempts.
This time, Nyad said, she will wear surgical gloves and a specially designed prosthetic face mask to prevent the jellyfish from stinging her.
Nyad will be accompanied by a 35-member crew aboard two sail boats.
If all goes to plan, Nyad said, the swim will take her three days to finish.
