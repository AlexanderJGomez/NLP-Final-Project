iReporter Bob Austrian, 45, of Tiburon, said he could see the blaze from his home about 4 or 5 miles from the island.
"It's still ripping right now," Austrian said at 5 a.m., noting that the blaze posed "quite a spectacle" with the town of Belvedere in the foreground and the Bay Bridge that connects Oakland and San Francisco serving as a backdrop.
Fire crews and equipment were being ferried to the island to battle the blaze, Giannini said.
Even with the necessary manpower and firefighting resources, he said, it will be difficult to reach the actual blaze.
Fire officials said earlier that all of the park workers and campers on the island were safe.
