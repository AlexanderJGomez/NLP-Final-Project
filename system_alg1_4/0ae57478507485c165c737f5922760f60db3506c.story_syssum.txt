Yet it should also be said: In Venezuela, the most important forms of vote fraud happen well before Election Day.
That's how much advertising each candidate is allowed in Venezuela in the weeks leading up to a presidential election.
Apart from campaign ads, however, the president himself can commandeer as much TV time as he wishes, although in the case of the long-winded Chavez, such appearances may not be vote-winners.

Hugo Chavez has laid Venezuela's economy to waste.
Did Venezuela vote for more of the same?
