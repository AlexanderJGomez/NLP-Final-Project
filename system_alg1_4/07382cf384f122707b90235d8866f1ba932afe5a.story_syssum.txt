Five days after a hacker invaded Sony Computer Entertainment's PlayStation Network resulting in a lengthy outage, the video game giant has yet to offer a comprehensive explanation.
The PlayStation Network is a free utility that lets gamers communicate and play with each other, as well as download games and movies.
Sony also offers subscription programs called PlayStation Plus, which provides access to exclusive games, and Qriocity, which offers on-demand music and movies over the internet.
Sony released a statement on Thursday saying, "It may be a full day or two before we're able to get the service completely back up and running."
The new "Mortal Kombat" game is also supposed to let gamers play online.
All these launched in the United States on Tuesday, one day before the outage.
