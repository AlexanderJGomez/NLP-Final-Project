Although Rizana said the baby died in a choking accident, Saudi courts convicted her of murder and sentenced her to death.
Rizana's case was rife with problems from the beginning.
But it should also spotlight the precarious existence of other domestic workers.
When Rizana traveled to Saudi Arabia, for example, she may not have known that many Saudi employers confiscate domestic workers' passports and confine them inside their home, cutting them off from the outside world and sources of help.
Conditions for migrant domestic workers in Saudi Arabia are among some of the worst, but domestic workers in other countries rarely enjoy the same rights as other workers.
Many governments have finally begun to recognize the risks and exploitation domestic workers face.
Thailand, and Singapore approved measures to give domestic workers a weekly day off, while Venezuela and the Philippines adopted broad laws for domestic workers ensuring a minimum wage, paid holidays, and limits to their working hours.
The Convention also has specific protections for domestic workers under the age of 18 and provisions for regulating and monitoring recruitment agencies.
And they can protect millions of other domestic workers who labor with precariously few guarantees for their safety and rights.
