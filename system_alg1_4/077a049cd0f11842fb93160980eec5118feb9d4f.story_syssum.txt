(CNN)Not one, but two French citizens have been connected to beheadings in a recent ISIS video, both of them 22-year-old men who went to Syria to join the group, authorities said Wednesday.
He was known to French security services as far back as 2011, the prosecutor said.
The ranks of ISIS -- the extremist group calling itself the Islamic State that's taken over vast swaths of Syria and Iraq -- have swelled with volunteers coming from outside the region, including from the West.
Last week, a United Nations panel stated what many consider obvious:  ISIS has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria.
The West is fighting back, with many countries -- including France -- allying with Iraq to conduct airstrikes targeting ISIS in that country.
ISIS hasn't relented much either, including unleashing yet more violence Wednesday.
Meanwhile, fighting continues in Syria as well, some of it near the Turkish border.
Turkey has spoken out against ISIS, while also expressing opposition to groups of Kurdish fighters that are among those trying to defeat the group.
