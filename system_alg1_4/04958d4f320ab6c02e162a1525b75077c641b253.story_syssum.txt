In a statement published Friday, security firm IntelCrawler said the breach was the result of malware that infected Target's payment system and possibly compromised the systems of other retailers.
One of the things the hackers do is take the malware as it's called.
And they manipulate or mutate this malware, and then reuse it," SecureState CEO Ken Stasiak said.
The first sample of the malware was created in March and since then, more than 40 versions have been sold around the world, IntelCrawler said.
Andrew Komarov, IntelCrawler CEO, said most of the victims are department stores and said more BlackPOS infections as well as new breaches could appear soon.
All 40 million may have been damaged in some way, and under law they can all be joined together in a class action lawsuit."
