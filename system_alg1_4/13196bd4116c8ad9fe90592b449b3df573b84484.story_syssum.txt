(CNN) -- Prosecutors have offered Ariel Castro, a Cleveland man accused of holding three women captive for close to a decade, a plea deal that removes the possibility of the death penalty, a Cuyahoga County courts source said Thursday.
That source said all that remains to be done to seal the deal is for Castro to plead guilty at the podium, which could happen at a hearing scheduled for Friday.
"It's safe to say (Castro) wouldn't take a deal with the death penalty," the source said.
He is being held with bail set at $8 million.
