(CNN) -- India are poised to build a handy first-innings lead over South Africa after Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar scored centuries on the second day of the second cricket Test in Kolkata.
The veteran Tendulkar extended his world record of Test tons to 47 as he took on the junior role, facing 206 deliveries for his 106.
India reached lunch at 97-2 and Sehwag raced to three figures in only 87 balls for his 19th Test century as the duo batted through the middle session, going to tea at 232-2.
Meanwhile, New Zealand reached 258-5 on a rain-hit opening day of the one-off Test against tourists Bangladesh in Hamilton.
