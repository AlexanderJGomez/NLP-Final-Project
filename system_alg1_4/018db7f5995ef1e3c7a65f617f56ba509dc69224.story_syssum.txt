(Mashable) -- For all their buzz and value, location-based social networks haven't really gone mainstream yet.
Kristine van Dillen, director of industry initiatives and partnerships at the Mobile Marketing Association, said location-based services aren't growing as quickly as they should be.
Sites like PleaseRobMe.com, which humorously bring awareness to location-based privacy issues, may have scared some social media users from opting in.
Most current iterations of the popular location-based networks allow users to opt-out of location tagging and notifying users when their location is being shared.
Because of privacy concerns, it is imperative for location-based services to clearly communicate the value proposition to users.
For some users, the privacy concerns of sharing their location might be trumped by the potential utility of receiving highly targeted advertising and promotions.
"I think it does have a lot of staying power.
Facebook, meanwhile, will also reportedly soon enable members to add location details to their status updates and release an API so other apps can offer location ability to Facebook users.
Twitter has yet to clearly communicate to users what they get in return for adding location to their tweets.
Further, because location is off by default for all users, without a more clearly communicated message, the feature may remain off for many people.
So how they roll out location to users and how well they do at making users feel that their information is safe may be make or break for location on Facebook.
"Facebook could really be the looming giant that could wipe all [other location services] away," Boland said.
"Facebook has proven to have so many users who are mobile.
