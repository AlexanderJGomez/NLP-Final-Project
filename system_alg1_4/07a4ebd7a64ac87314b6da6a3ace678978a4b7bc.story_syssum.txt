"Sometimes I think I'm going crazy."
Jenkins cannot shake the feeling that these and other symptoms he has add up to CTE, but he will never be sure.
"There is no framework to make that diagnosis while someone is alive."
Family members and loved ones of 36 athletes -- 29 football players, three professional hockey players, one professional wrestler and three boxers diagnosed with CTE after they died -- were quizzed about, among other things, the nature of the players' CTE symptoms and when they appeared.
Three players did not display any symptoms before being diagnosed with CTE.
For example, tau, which tends to be peppered in particular areas of the brains of people diagnosed with CTE, could damage brain tissue at different stages of the disease, depending on the person.
Symptoms could also be explained by other changes in the brain, associated with repetitive brain trauma, that have nothing to do with tau or CTE.
Stern and his colleagues know that their study sample is skewed: People who tend to donate a loved one's brain to be studied for CTE also tend to suspect a problem.
In the meantime, former players like Jenkins are left in a fight against time and the progression of whatever brain disease their concussions may have wrought.
Both Jenkins and Stern hope that for CTE, it will not be that long.
