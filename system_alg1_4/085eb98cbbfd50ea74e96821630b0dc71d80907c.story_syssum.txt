(CNN) -- There was a pretty epic party on Wednesday night.
Naturally, of course, I was present, showing up casually late because it's what awesome people do at epic parties.
OK, so maybe it's not Ibiza, but there was a popular online party hosted by the CVS Beauty Club to promote the pharmacy's cosmetic offerings via social media.
Treat yourself to some hooker makeup.
CVS really managed to get people talking about and participating in their virtual Twitter party, which is pretty amazing.
Basically, I guess a Twitter party is just like any other party.
Except there's no guacamole, and if you happen to do a keg stand, it's not because everybody else was doing one.
Personally speaking, the most appealing aspect of a digital Twitter party is that I only have 140 characters to completely embarrass myself.
"Hi.
But let's get back to this beauty club.
I'm all about discounts and Twitter parties and Beano and maybe even a touch of mascara when I'm feeling pretty, but I'm not exactly sure this is qualifies as a "club."
Clubs have to have standards, and I simply can't appreciate any exclusive organization that doesn't charge excessive dues and/or base one's membership on blatant superficiality.
At the CVS Beauty Club, there are no initiation fees.
But for those of us who don't use cosmetics or, at the very least, aren't planning on going to the Gathering of the Juggalos, there's probably no real need to apply.
In which case, by all means join the CVS Beauty Club and start saving.
