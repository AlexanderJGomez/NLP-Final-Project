In experiments with the material in shrimp shells, called chitosan, and material from silk, known as fibroin, researchers at Harvard's Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering put the two together at a nano level.
"We can get the range of different properties of plastics by changing how we fabricate these."
Though the word "plastic" applies to any moldable solid, it's come to be associated with materials made out of petrochemicals.
Shrilk, on the other hand, is fully biodegradable, says Ingber -- a necessity if the product is to succeed.
There's plenty of raw material, says Ingber -- the seafood industry has so much shrimp shell discard "that they have to pay to get it cleared away sometimes" -- but there's still a ways to go.
"They are so rich in nutrients that you could put seeds in them, just in the broken down material, and a plant will grow," says Ingber.
Perhaps, a new part of the plastics industry will as well.
