The network is now negotiating with Leno and its current late-night hosts, Conan O'Brien and Jimmy Fallon, to decide who ends up with which time slot, Gaspin said.
Gaspin said the plan now is for Leno to host a new, half-hour show at 11:35 p.m.
Leno dismissed them on his show on Thursday night, telling his audience, "It's always been my experience NBC only cancels you when you're in first place."
While NBC appeared to be fine with Leno's numbers, the affiliates "kind of revolted and said we have to have better ratings," Levine said.
For NBC, which had promised to give Leno a full year in the 10 p.m. time slot, "It's certainly a little bit of egg on the face," Levine said.
"My guess is down the road, they will give back Leno the 'Tonight Show,' leave it on at 11:35 p.m., and Conan will move to Fox," he said.
