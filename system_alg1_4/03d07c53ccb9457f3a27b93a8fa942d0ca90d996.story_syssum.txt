Hong Kong (CNN) -- Chinese Super League club Shanghai Shenhua have pulled off an audacious transfer coup by signing former France international Nicolas Anelka from English team Chelsea.
No details were given about how much the contract was worth, but a club official denied reports that Anelka's weekly salary would be as high as Â£200,000 ($312,000).
In 2008, Anelka moved to Chelsea in a Â£15 million deal from Bolton, where he resurrected his career after a short spell in Turkey with Fenerbahce.
Meanwhile, Shenhua owner Zhu Jun said last week that former France international Jean Tigana will become the club's new coach, according to the Shanghai Daily website.
He had already made a one-year coaching plan for the team," Zhu said.
