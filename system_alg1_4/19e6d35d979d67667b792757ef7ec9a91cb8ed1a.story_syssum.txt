In a Massachusetts court Tuesday, during testimony by one of three cleaning ladies in the Hernandez household, prosecutors showed video of  Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, taking a trash bag from the house and placing it in the trunk of her sister's car.
In the video shown to the jury Tuesday, Jenkins appears to walk out the back patio door of the Hernandez home carrying a heavy, black trash bag.
Prosecutors allege Jenkins may have been following instructions from Hernandez to get rid of the murder weapon from their home by removing the gun inside a box, putting it in a black trash bag, and borrowing her sister's car to dispose of the bag in a dumpster.
Jenkins, who was Hernandez's high school sweetheart, has pleaded not guilty to charges of lying to a grand jury several times about the presence of guns in the couple's North Attleboro home, among other issues.
Hernandez asked Jenkins to get something out of their basement, according to search warrants.
Shayanna Jenkins borrowed her sister's car to dispose of the bag -- something her sister told investigators she had never done before.
When Jenkins returned home, she was captured on the same security system, but without the bag.
"I mean, who knows?"
There are all kinds of possibilities."
