Perry also wants President Barack Obama and Congress to hire an additional 3,000 border patrol agents for the Texas border, which would eventually replace the temporary guard forces.
The Rio Grande sector, where most of the immigrant children are turning themselves into the border patrol, has a large number of agents but it is also the largest crossing.
The deployment at Perry's direction means Texas will have to pick up the price tag of $12 million per month.
Conservatives largely point to border security as their top immigration priority and Perry has been an outspoken proponent of securing the border since the influx of immigrants began.
The potential 2016 presidential candidate previewed his plan in Iowa over the weekend in a television interview while campaigning for Republican candidates.
But Perry said the guard will be "force multipliers," helping Customs and Border Protection agents both on the ground and in the air to catch the 80% of people crossing the border who aren't children and to combat cartel and trafficking crime.
"You cannot have (national security) without border security," Perry said.
And the amount spent on border security has more than doubled.
