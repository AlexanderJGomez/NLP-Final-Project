The judge greeted him with "Good afternoon, Mr. Coke," to which the seemingly calm Coke didn't respond.
The court-assigned attorney told the judge he has not been permanently assigned to case because the Coke family hired attorneys Frank Doddato and Steven Rosen.
He appeared subdued, a smirk on his face.
"At Coke's direction and under his protection, members of his criminal organization sold marijuana and crack cocaine in the New York area and elsewhere, and sent the narcotics proceeds back to Coke and his co-conspirators," the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York said in a news release.
He would face a maximum sentence of five years in prison on the firearms trafficking charge and a fine of up to $250,000.
