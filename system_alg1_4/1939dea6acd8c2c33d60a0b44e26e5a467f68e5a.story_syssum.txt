Lapid segued his journalism into politics and emerged as an archetype -- a voice of the middle-class Israeli striving for success, but anxious about the high cost of living, a voice representing Israelis who've had it with the exemptions from mandatory military service for the ultra-Orthodox, a voice of everyday optimism.
Members of Yesh Atid range across the spectrum, Lapid said after the election in Tel Aviv.
Shas, a religious party, gained 11 seats.
But the center and the left showed strength.
But in interviews, Lapid has proposed Israel should give up much of the West Bank -- while retaining control of Jersualem.
Yair Lapid is the son of the late politician Tommy Lapid, whose one-time anti-religious party Shinui battled the power and influence of the ultra-Orthodox.

Yair conveys the impression of a man comfortable in all parts of Israel," Halevi wrote.
