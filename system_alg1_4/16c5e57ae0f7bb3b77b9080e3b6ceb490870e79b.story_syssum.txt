One A Day Men's 50+ Advantage ads say selenium may cut men's risk of prostate cancer, a consumer group says.
"The selenium claims are made by a [Food and Drug Administration]-approved qualified health claim.
In its promotions, the company says "emerging research" suggests that selenium might reduce the risk of prostate cancer, the center said.
"Now there is something you can do."
"It's astounding that a company such as Bayer ... would make such deceptive claims," the center's litigation director, Steve Gardner, told reporters during the same teleconference.
A seven-year, $118 million study funded by the National Institutes of Health found last year that selenium does not prevent prostate cancer in healthy men, the center said.
