Radamel Falcao Garcia Zarate, Falcao for short, is a Colombian soccer star.
Yes and no.
Falcao is good enough to improve any team, but United hardly needed another attacking player.
Simply put, United signing Falcao is like buying a really nice sweater but forgetting to put on your trousers.
A new star was born, and Rodriguez is now strutting his stuff at Real Madrid having also left Monaco.
As well as Falcao and Rodriguez, Mendes brokered the deal to bring Di Maria to Old Trafford and Eliaquim Mangala to Manchester City.
@FALCAO is his official Twitter handle.
"Falcao will lead Monaco to the Champions League," said Falcao's entirely impartial father when his son first signed for the French team in 2013.
Monaco did qualify for the Champions League, even if Falcao missed most of last season through injury.
The Manchester club isn't in Europe after an awful season under Alex Ferguson's successor David Moyes, who was subsequently sacked.
