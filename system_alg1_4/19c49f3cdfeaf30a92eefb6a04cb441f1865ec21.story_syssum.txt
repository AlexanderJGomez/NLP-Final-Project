Former President George W. Bush is enjoying another bounce in the post-presidential polls.
They are a bit like what Mark Twain once said about the weather in New England: if you don't like it, just wait a second and it will change.
The most obvious reason is that the passions for presidents -- both good and bad -- tend to go down after they leave office.
Much of the controversy that surrounded Bush had to do with his national security policies.
In some ways, Obama did Bush a favor.
Without any kind of mass chaos in those countries, as some critics had warned would occur, the issues that caused Bush so much problems faded from the public mind.
Presidential reputations also can be shaped, in the relative short term, by what a president does after leaving office.
But when those problems continue long after a president is gone, as has been the case with the economy, the public tends to gain some perspective (even as they attack the existing president) about how the sources of discontent stem from the structural problems with the government and the economy rather than any individual person.
Finally, and this is not relevant to Bush yet, the opening of archival records from the period a president is in office can dramatically change how we see him.
On the one hand, it might give him some solace that even with all the grief he has faced over issues such as health care and sluggish economic growth, it is easy to see how his record could look much stronger to Americans over time.
After all, it's all relative with respect to time.
