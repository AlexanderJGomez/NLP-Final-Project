It stopped my seizures for two years but not my appetite, it just kept on growing!
After two years my seizures came back and now they are longer.
Mindy is my seizure dog.
When I first got Mindy it was pretty hard because she didn't listen to me, but now she does and she knows a lot of commands.
I have epilepsy but I can do some extraordinary things like ride a zip line!
Mindy barks when I have a seizure so my parents will know.
People ask me a lot what it feels like but it's hard to describe and sometimes I don't remember having a seizure.
