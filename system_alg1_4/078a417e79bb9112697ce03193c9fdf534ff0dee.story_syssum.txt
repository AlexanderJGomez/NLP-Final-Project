Thursday's partial solar eclipse was no exception.
"The moon took a little chunk out of the sun, like Pac-Man," she said.
"Even at maximum eclipse, a sliver of sun peeking out from behind the Moon can still cause pain and eye damage.
Direct viewing should only be attempted with the aid of a safe solar filter."
The above photos were snapped by iReporters across the country, all with the aid of filters or other creative methods of viewing the eclipse indirectly.
