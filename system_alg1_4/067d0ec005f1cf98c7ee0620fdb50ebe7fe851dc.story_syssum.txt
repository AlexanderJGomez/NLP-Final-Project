He had been guarding the U.S. Embassy in Ankara, as he'd done many other days -- with commitment and professionalism.
So, too, did the Turkish guard -- described by U.S.
While theories have been floated,  neither Turkish nor U.S. authorities have detailed why they think Sanli blew himself up.
Prior to Friday, he was known to U.S. and other intelligence agencies, a U.S. law enforcement source told CNN.
The bomber had first gone to the rear access of the embassy, then went to a checkpoint on the building's perimeter where IDs are checked, explained U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland.
The guard, Akarsu, on one side of the security barrier was killed.

The U.S. Embassy in Ankara subsequently put out a statement telling Americans not to visit that facility or U.S. consulates in Istanbul or Adana "until further notice."
Not first brush with terror for Turkey, U.S.
Hasan Selim Ozertem, a security expert at the International Strategic Research Organization in Ankara, said Friday's attack could be related to recent arrests of DHKP-C members.
Ozertem said that one plausible theory is the group is trying to send a message to Turkish authorities by attacking the U.S. Embassy because it is near the Turkish parliament building.
Ozertem said the attack could be linked to negotiations between the PKK and Turkish government.
While the U.S. Embassy in Ankara has not seen this kind of incident in decades, in 2008 three police officers died in a shootout with assailants outside the U.S. Consulate in Istanbul.
Three attackers died in the incident, which the U.S. ambassador at the time called "an obvious act of terrorism."
