(CNN) -- Jim Tressel -- who gained fame then infamy as a collegiate football coach in Ohio -- is now poised to lead a new team: Youngstown State University.
This success catapulted Tressel to the top job at Ohio State, which historically boasts one of the top football programs in the country.
"Of great concern to the committee was the fact that (Tressel) became aware of these violations and decided not to report the violations to institutional officials, the Big Ten Conference or the NCAA," the NCAA Division 1 Committee on Infractions said in a report issued in December 2011.
The job as president at Youngstown State, which boasts nearly 13,500 students and more than 135 undergraduate and graduate programs, would be another step for Tressel.
"People said they either really wanted Tressel, no matter what, or ... said he was the worst candidate and couldn't believe (university officials) would consider him."
The student government leader said he thinks Tressel, as president, would excel at "being a cheerleader, the face of the university (because) he knows the area and donors" and expressed confidence he can craft "a vision" for Youngstown State and its future.
But, at the same time, things could quickly turn south -- just like Tressel's time at Ohio State.
"Do I think he has the potential to be a bust?
