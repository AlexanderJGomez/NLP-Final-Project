The surprise was not so much that 18 million votes were cast for Rouhani, slightly more than half the ballots, but the fact that the regime had endorsed his victory, triggering hope that international pressure over Iran's nuclear program and growing internal rifts at home might have forced the leadership to restore some of its lost legitimacy.
Rouhani is not a reformist, even according to Iranian standards.
He gained momentum only a few days before the election when two former presidents, both aligned with the reformers, Mohammad Khatami and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, threw their support behind him.
The Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, along with his military loyalists, the Revolutionary Guards and its militia wing Basij -- the alliance that many believe stole the election in favor of the incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad -- still remain in ultimate power.
The Guards and the Basij campaigned vigorously for Saeed Jalili, a Khamenei loyalist and Iran's hard-line nuclear negotiator.
Although the election was far from democratic, it provided an opportunity for many Iranians, especially the young, to break the deadly atmosphere of fear the government has imposed for the past four years.
Voters recalled Rouhani as the county's pragmatist nuclear envoy who deterred threats in 2003 by signing the Additional Protocol, allowing inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency to visit Iran's nuclear facilities.
If Khamenei is willing to end international pressure over Iran's nuclear program, Rouhani provides the perfect opportunity.
In his first message after his election, Rouhani declared that "a new chapter" has begun and hoped the international community would use a more respectful rhetoric toward Iran.
