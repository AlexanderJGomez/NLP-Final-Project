The election of 2004 was seen as a referendum on the Iraq war.
The conservatives who governed Spain in 2004 had strongly aligned themselves with the United States after the 9/11 attacks.
Aznar's replacement, Jose Luis Zapatero, ended the Spanish commitment to Iraq and sundered the close relationship with the United States.
Indeed for a long time, Zapatero seemed not to comprehend that Spain faced any economic challenges at all.
Spain created nearly half of all the net new jobs created across the whole continent of Europe in the years between 2000 and 2005.
Spain had signed up for the euro currency back in the 1990s.
The German economy is much more productive than the Spanish economy.
If the price of German goods and services declined inside Spain, then logically the price of Spanish goods and services (including vacations) must have risen to Germans.
Between 2002 and 2008, Spanish households went on a borrowing binge.
By 2008, construction accounted for a staggering 16% of the Spanish economy.
The bubble pops.
That causes a recession, which causes asset values to tumble more, which causes debts to go into default -- and the whole economy painfully unwinds.
The government must cut to balance its books if it is to remain within the euro, but government cutbacks only make it that much more difficult for households and business to service their debts.
It will take a grand rethink of the whole euro currency project, a rethink that either emancipates Spain to quit the euro and export enough to repay its debts or else reduces the debt enough that Spain can sustain its expensive new currency.
