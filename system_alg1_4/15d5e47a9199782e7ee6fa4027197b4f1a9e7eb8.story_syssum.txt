Khin Zaw Lin lives in a Thai garbage dump with only his adopted mother and his toy gun to  protect him.
Lin is one of about 300 refugees in the dump who survive on other people's trash.
Many are children.
He shows me his feet, which were filthy and ribbed with cuts.
My assistant told me about Lin's home while he was researching another story on the border area in Myanmar, the country once known as Burma.
We'd been told there are orphans living at the dump, but people are wary.
Lin gives the money to his adopted mother.
She tells me that Lin's biological mother gave him to her in Myanmar when he was a baby because she couldn't cope with the responsibility.
Watch as Lin and others root through the dump Â»
He is part of special group of refugees from Myanmar that don't officially exist.
As a result, these refugees are trapped in the garbage dump -- not enough money to go elsewhere and no prospects back home.
Near the end of my meeting with Lin, I ask his adopted mother if she, and Lin, would ever escape the rubbish dump.
