Add Southwest Airlines to the list of U.S. airlines that have received Federal Aviation Administration approval to allow passengers to use many portable electronic devices in all phases of flight.
Other airlines are moving to get FAA approval to allow greater electronic use.
"We're in the process of applying through the new process and hope to implement the changes as soon as possible, with the goal of having the change live in November -- in time for the holidays," Virgin America spokeswoman Abby Lunardini wrote in an e-mail.
US Airways reminded passengers of some restrictions that remain in place.
Those airlines have to get their own FAA approval.
Some folks had a sense of humor about the device debate.
