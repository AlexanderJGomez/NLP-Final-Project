(CNN) -- President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan will attend the NATO summit meeting about Afghanistan in Chicago this weekend, his office said in a statement Thursday.
Analysts have described the NATO summit invitation as an incentive for Zardari to reopen the routes.
The summit meeting will include Afghan President Hamid Karzai, along with NATO allies and International Security Assistance Force contributors.
Zardari will make a speech in Chicago and also meet with various international leaders on the margins of the summit, his office said Thursday.
"Pakistanis think that the United States is an untrustworthy ally; the Americans think that Pakistani's don't always fulfill their end of the bargain, especially when it comes to terrorism," Haqqani said.
But we will still be haunted by the remnants," he said.
