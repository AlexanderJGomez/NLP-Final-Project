Images from the Jewish Museum of Belgium show the gunman behind Saturday's deadly attack approaching the building, opening fire, and walking away.
Two of those killed in Saturday's attack are Israeli and the third is French, Van Wymersch said.
French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the French victim was a woman and offered his condolences Sunday to the families of all those killed, his ministry said.
That witness was not seen in surveillance video recorded during the attack, she said.
Van Wymersch said it was too early to determine whether the attack was an act of terrorism or motivated by anti-Semitism.
But there is concern that the killer could strike again, the official said, and that authorities could be dealing with a "Mohammed Merah" type of killer.
But the official stressed that no evidence has emerged in Saturday's attack pointing to any link to Islamist terrorism.
The official said the killer shot the Israeli couple first in the museum entryway with one of his weapons.
The official said the killer appeared to be skilled in using weapons and likely planned the attack meticulously.
She met with the police, Belgian Jewish community leaders and the president of the European Jewish Congress, Moshe Kantor, on Sunday to discuss the security arrangements, an Interior Ministry statement said.
"Attacks on Jewish targets in Europe do not exist in a vacuum, but are part and parcel of an overall climate of hate and incitement against Jewish communities," he said, according to the statement.
In neighboring France, two Jewish men were assaulted late Saturday as they were leaving a synagogue in Creteil, outside Paris, the French Interior Ministry said Sunday.
Belgium received a 27% index score in the survey.
The ADL said one-fourth of adults worldwide are "deeply infected with anti-Semitic attitudes," according to a CNN.com report on the survey.
The United States was given an index score of 9%.
