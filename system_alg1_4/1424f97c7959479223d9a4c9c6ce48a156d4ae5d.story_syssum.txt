(CNN) -- Citizens of the Ivory Coast headed to the polls Sunday for a repeatedly delayed presidential election -- the first in a decade for the top cocoa-producing west African nation.
Analysts hope the election, which has been delayed for five years, will bring lasting peace.
U.S. President Barack Obama said the nation's citizens are entitled to a fair election.
