Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- Arizonans paid tribute Friday morning to the federal judge killed in the deadly shooting rampage last weekend in Tucson.
John McCain and Jon Kyl, both Republicans, said Friday they will introduce legislation to name a new federal courthouse in Yuma after Roll.
Chief Justice John Roberts said Roll was "a wise jurist who selflessly served Arizona and the nation with great distinction, as attorney and judge, for more than 35 years," McCain said.
Bush appointed Roll, a Pennsylvania native, to the bench, and he rose to become the state's chief federal judge.
He said in a November letter to the 9th U.S.
Roll also had been assigned to hear a case on ethnic studies, according to the lead attorney in the case, Richard Martinez.
On Thursday, family, friends, classmates and hundreds of mourners filled St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Catholic Church in Tucson for the funeral service for Christina Green, the 9-year-old.
I want America to be as good as she imagined it," Obama said.
