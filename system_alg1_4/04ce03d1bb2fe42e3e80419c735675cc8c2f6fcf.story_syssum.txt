But what's really interesting about Thanksgiving is the day after -- known as Black Friday.
But what about those who succumb to mass hysteria at local megastores?
Are we really surprised people get hurt on Black Friday?
Once a person steps onto private property, the law traditionally considered him one of the following: 1) trespasser; 2) licensee; or 3) invitee.
You might think an "invitee" is someone who is just invited on to the property, say, for a cocktail party, but that's not it.
You're not providing your pal any business benefit, other than emotional support for his team, and divesting him of his chips and salsa.
When you shop at a store, you're considered an "invitee."
Even the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has acknowledged the sometimes fatal injuries suffered on Black Friday, and has published crowd management safety guidelines for retailers.
The bottom line is that stores will be liable if people are injured by known, unsafe and nonobvious conditions on their property on Black Friday, especially if stores take no special safety or security precautions, and treat the day like any other day.
But, if a store is deliberately indifferent to security problems, then it may be liable where it knowingly ignores the behavior of that riffraff.
If a Black Friday sale devolves into the running of the bulls in Pamplona, and the store knowingly allowed dangerous conditions on the property, it's likely that the store will be held liable for injuries on the premises.
Maybe the Black Friday retailer deserves the Black Friday shopper.
