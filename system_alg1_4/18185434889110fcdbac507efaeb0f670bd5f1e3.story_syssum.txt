So what could come next for Greece?
The vote of confidence in Papandreou's government is expected to go ahead as planned, despite discussions Thursday on the formation of an interim coalition or national unity government.
In another scenario, the leader of the main opposition New Democracy party said Thursday that his party could enter a coalition government with the PASOK party, as an interim stage leading to new elections.
Opposition leader Antonis Samaras later Thursday said Papandreou should step down and called for snap elections within six weeks.
The conservatives have said Greece needs to bargain harder with Europe on any deal.
And the office of Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said Friday he had confirmed to the European Commission that the referendum had been scrapped.
But Greece could find it hard to put the cat back in the bag now it's been allowed out, Conley said.
If its people vote "no" to the bailout plan, European leaders have made clear they will not hand over a sixth tranche of European funds from a previously agreed bailout.
The Greek government is expected to run out of money in mid-November, and that 8 billion euro (about $10.9 billion) tranche is needed to keep it afloat.
Europe must put provisions in place to allow Greece to leave the euro, if that becomes necessary, with minimum damage, she said.
"The priority now is to focus not on Greece but on the rest of Europe, in particular Italy, which is the country most likely to be affected," she said.
