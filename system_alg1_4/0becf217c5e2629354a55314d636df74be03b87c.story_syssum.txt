Democratic Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska announced Tuesday that he will not run for re-election next year.
His departure increases the difficulty for Democrats to retain their Senate majority next year.
A Senate Democratic leadership aide, speaking on condition of not being identified, told CNN that party officials are reaching out to former Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey to possibly run for Nelson's seat.
However, Manley said Reid "always respected the fact that Nelson was trying to do what was best for Nebraska."
A Democratic strategist who spoke on condition of not being identified characterized Nelson's decision as disloyal to the party.
It's about fairness for all, not privileges for the few.
I hope and believe I have fulfilled these principles to the best of my ability."
