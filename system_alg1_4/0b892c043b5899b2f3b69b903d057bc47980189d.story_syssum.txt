Missiles are not, of course,  the only way to launch an attack.
And one, the Stuxnet virus, was able to penetrate Iran's Natanz nuclear facility, researchers say.
Stuxnet spread through the network undetected.
First, it effectively hijacked the Natanz control system, speeding up or slowing down the centrifuges, wearing them out prematurely.
Stuxnet is the suspected culprit.
Researchers at internet security firm Symantec say they have identified a new virus called Duqu that they believe is a successor to Stuxnet, although not all security experts agree.
"It could be that Stuxnet didn't entirely achieve what was wanted the first time around," Cox told CNN.
The problem, he says, is that Stuxnet, in its bid to stop nuclear proliferation, may have sparked its own arms race.
To copy the design, it requires just a bunch of engineers -- no genius needed.
