They planned a fairly easy, "semi-technical" hike in which they would come down the south side of the mountain, Meyers said.
"This is still called a rescue operation, at least for a couple days," Meyers said Sunday, meaning authorities hold out hope of finding the hikers alive in the freezing conditions.
"We're looking at the area where we found the body," he said.
A U.S. Coast Guard C-130 aircraft was coming to help in the search, and an Oregon National Guard helicopter was flying around the area where the hikers might be, authorities said.
