Jane's Information Group, the British-based defense publications and military intelligence company, shows the Georgian military would be trying to hold off a force more than 20 times its size.
About 26,000 are in the Georgian military, and about 17,000 of them are in the army, which has had the benefit of four years of training by the U.S. Marines, Army and Special Forces, according to Jane's.
Georgia has been trying to form a professional military force and by the end of next year expected to have only a small number of conscripts in its main force, Jane's said.
The sharp end of the Georgian air force consists of seven aging Su-25 ground attack fighters and seven attack helicopters, according to Jane's.
Georgia has 150 surface-to-air missiles to use in the fight, according to Jane's.
It is not known how many or which of its forces are fighting in Georgia.
