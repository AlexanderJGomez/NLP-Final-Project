(CNN) -- Just six weeks after the Australian Senate rejected a bill that included opening offshore processing centers for asylum seekers, a government-appointed panel has recommended just that.
Under the so-called "Malaysia Solution," Australia would have sent 800 asylum seekers to Malaysia for processing each year in exchange for 4,000 confirmed refugees.
Refugee Convention, Malaysia has no legal obligation to protect asylum seekers, something required under Australia's Migration Act.
"We will also move to immediately implement the recommendations on family reunion," she added.
"What we need to do is promote proper protection standards in the region.
Since then, there has been a sharp increase in asylum seekers making the dangerous trip by boat to seek a new life in Australia.
In a statement, Amnesty International's refugee spokesman Graham Thom said he was "appalled" by the panel's recommendations.
"Sending asylum seekers to places like Malaysia, Nauru and Papua New Guinea is unacceptable and a complete outsourcing of Australia's human rights obligations.
In late June, the senate rejected the Migration Legislation Amendment (The Bali Process) Bill 2012 which would have allowed Australia to send asylum seekers to Malaysia and Nauru for processing.
The panel estimated that if all the report's recommendations were adopted, they would cost US$1 billion to implement.
