Exciting or frightening, these connected devices of the futuristic "smart" home may be familiar to fans of science fiction.
Smart homes are just one segment -- cars, clothing, factories and anything else you can imagine will eventually be "smart" as well.
Many can communicate with their own apps and ecosystems but haven't found a way to play nice with each other.
Now chipmaker Qualcomm is trying to give the industry a major push with an open-source project that can link all these disparate pieces.
Many standards already help smart devices communicate, though none has emerged as a dominant option yet.
"Because (the Internet of Things) is so vast and varied, it will be hard to come up with a 'one size fits all' standard," said Bartleson.
It also sells the chips that will go inside smart thermostats, security systems, cars and everything else.
The first revolution was the connected Internet," she said.
Ben-Zur predicts the Internet of Things will be the third revolution.
But it's still to early to say for sure how all these devices will chat with each other and whether Qualcomm's AllJoyn or some other option will take off.
The exact killer apps for the Internet of Things are also a mystery.
"Exposing that, how your toothbrush and your water heater and your thermostat ... are going to interact with you, with your school, that's what's next," said Ben-Zur.
