And so it is.
To begin with, Marathon Monday is a holiday â€” Patriots Day, an annual commemoration of the Battles of Lexington and Concord.
That's why so many people descend on the marathon every year, and why so many people found themselves in harm's way.
To complete the celebration, Patriots Day marks the annual 11 a.m. Red Sox game at Fenway Park, an utterly local tradition concocted so baseball crowds wouldn't get in the way of marathon crowds.
As a spectator sport, the Boston Marathon probably hit its peak in the 1970s, when local favorites Bill Rodgers and Joan Benoit Samuelson were dominating the race.
My only direct involvement came in the early 1990s, when I worked as editor of the official program for several years.
I am not privy to what sort of security arrangements go into planning the Boston Marathon, but there's only so much you can do along a 26.2-mile route that passes through seven cities and towns in addition to Boston.
And we are.
The marathon will go on.
