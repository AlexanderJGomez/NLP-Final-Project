(CNN) -- The White House confirms that Syria has crossed a "red line" by using chemical weapons in its war with rebel forces, prompting the United States to boost the "scale and scope" of its support for the opposition.
The weapons will be provided by the CIA, the officials said.
The United States has also ruled out sending troops, or putting "boots on the ground" in Syria.
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel also ordered the deployment of up to 200 additional U.S. troops to Jordan in April as the violence spreads from adjacent Syria.
The United States is also deploying a Patriot anti-missile battery and F-16 aircraft to Jordan as part of military exercises taking place this month.
The United States also has deployed Patriot missiles to Turkey, which also borders Syria.
Speaking in Brussels, he said he welcomed "the clear U.S. statement" on Syria's alleged chemical weapons use and that it was a matter of great concern.
"As for NATO, the Patriot deployment will ensure effective protection for Turkey against any missile attack, whether the missiles carry chemical weapons or not," he said.
But such strikes pose a danger of releasing chemical agents into the air around civilian populations in Syria, U.S. officials told CNN in March.
Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey said the United States could send troops to Syria if al-Assad's government fell, if needed, to secure chemical weapons.
