U.S. officials later took the two negotiating pirates into custody -- a move that goes against standard negotiation practices, the maritime source said.
U.S. Central Command declined to comment on whether officials detained the pirates and said the FBI and the Justice Department have the lead in the case.
"It would be unfathomable to have put them back on the boat where they might have done harm to the hostages," the official said, disagreeing with a published report that the detention of two fellow pirates might have upset those still aboard the captured yacht -- named the Quest -- who were holding four Americans.
The official took issue with a New York Times report that said the FBI's hostage negotiator aboard the USS Sterett decided the two Somalis were not serious about resolving the matter, which led U.S. officials to take the two men into custody and ask for a new representative from the pirates.
Americans Jean and Scott Adam, Phyllis Macay and Bob Riggle were found shot to death after U.S. forces boarded the Quest around 1 a.m. Tuesday, U.S. officials have said.
When Fox spoke last week, he said two pirates boarded a U.S. Navy ship Monday for talks.
Thirteen other pirates were captured and detained on the Quest, along with the other two already aboard the U.S. Navy ship.
Fox said authorities believe the pirates were trying to get the vessel and hostages to Somalia, or at least into Somali territorial waters.
