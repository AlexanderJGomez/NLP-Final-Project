Or compromised electrical wiring.
We know the Boston Marathon is seen around the world.
And we do not need the president to say the word to feel the word.
We do not need the president to say the word to feel it.
We don't need the president to say the word to be reminded constantly that if we see something, we need to say something, blurring the lines between a healthy awareness of our surroundings and irrational paranoia.
We will never, ever be safe again.
So while Obama telling the American people those responsible will "feel the full weight of justice," we are haunted by the fact that "justice" won't bring the victims back.
"Justice" won't take us back to September 10, 2001 ... back before the word "terrorism" was on the tip of every American's tongue.
If April 15, 2013, was the day the Boston Marathon became a target for terrorism, then September 11, 2001, was the day we all were warned that it would be.
Nothing will be the same.
