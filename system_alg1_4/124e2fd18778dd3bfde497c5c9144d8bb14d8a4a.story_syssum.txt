Kobayashi vowed he will avenge those two defeats on Saturday.
Saturday's competition will be partially about redemption for Chestnut, too.
In May, he suffered a stinging defeat to Kobayashi in a loss he said "really set a fire underneath me" and "made me hungry for this contest."
In a recent trial round, Janus downed a personal-best 55 hot dogs -- a weiner's throw from the 59 that Chestnut and Kobayashi wolfed down last year.
Kobayashi, at 123 pounds, lifted his T-shirt to reveal the sort of chiseled abdomen one would expect at a bodybuilding competition.
Others contestants were not quite as disconcertingly trim.
