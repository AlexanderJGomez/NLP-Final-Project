I asked professional dog trainers to share the most prevalent behavior issues, along with solutions.
Dog trainer Sarah Wilson suggests that the whole family try an old-fashioned game of hide and seek.
"It's the dog's job to keep up with you, not your job to keep up with the dog," she says.
Over time, your dog will understand that the command leads to wonderful treats.
As you practice the "come" command, dog trainer Andrew Zbeeb of Frogs to Dogs in Atlanta suggests adding focus exercises to the mix.
"As we run backward, the dog follows," he says.
The dog learns it is running toward its handlers and being rewarded for doing so."
When they know what that means, you can teach the dog."
"If you can't walk the dog easily and safely, don't ask the child to do it," she says.
"If you can't feed the dog safely, don't ask the child to do it."
No."
If the dog ignores people, she says that means they are not interested in playing.
Problem: The dog is unruly around other pets.
It also helps to keep dogs on a leash when visiting a home with other pets.
"Usually the older dog is growling because it already said, 'Leave me alone,' and the pup didn't," she says.
Dog trainer and police officer Michael Upshur of Dogma Dog Care says several pet owners call seeking help with separation anxiety.
He also says owners should let dogs be dogs.
"A dog needs to run, too.
"If the owner pays attention to a stray dog, the dog will pay attention.
Upshur tells owners to walk with confidence and move away from distractions such as stray dogs or children playing.
"The dog needs to know that the owner is not going to let anything happen," he says.
