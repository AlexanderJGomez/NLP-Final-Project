The game's creators are partnering with Zynga, maker of such popular social games as "Farmville," "Cityville" and "Words With Friends," to produce Zynga Slingo.
"Slingo" is played by more than 55 million people through online, mobile and casino games.
" 'Slingo' is one of the earliest and most cherished games of the Internet," said Rich Sawel, product manager for Zynga Slingo.
The fourth-quarter report shows the company's games were played by 54 million users daily, an increase from 48 million during the same time in 2010.
According to the report, Zynga's net loss of $435 million in the fourth quarter included a $510 million stock-based compensation expense that was previously unrecognized until triggered by an initial public offering in mid-December.
