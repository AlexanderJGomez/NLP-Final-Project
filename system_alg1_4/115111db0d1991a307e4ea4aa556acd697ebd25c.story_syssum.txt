The incidents occurred between 2005 and 2010.
Berndt was arrested in 2012.
His attorney, however, did turn to the gallery when speaking in court and said Berndt was profoundly sorry and remorseful for the pain and discomfort he caused.
"He deserves to be punished," one mother said in her statement to the court.
In September, the Los Angeles Unifed School District announced it paid almost $27.3 million to settle 58 of 191 students' lawsuits alleging they were victims of sexually lewd acts by Berndt.
"We are relieved that the students and families will be able to put this part of the proceedings behind them," Deasy said in a statement.
