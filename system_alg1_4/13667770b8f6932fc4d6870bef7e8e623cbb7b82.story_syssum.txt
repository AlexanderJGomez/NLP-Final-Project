In a survey of 4,000 people, about a third said they had accidentally sent an e-mail to the wrong person.
says Dunetz, 68.
He explained he'd been experimenting with his new computer and was trying to figure out how to add attachments to an e-mail, Dunetz says.
Instead, the e-mail program automatically filled in an entire group from his address book -- something he apparently didn't realize until after he hit the "send" button.
In a recent online survey conducted by AOL, 32 percent of the 4,000 respondents have at one time or another mistakenly forwarded an e-mail to an unintended recipient.
She tried to end the relationship by simply not returning his phone calls.
She thought she sent the "he's an idiot" e-mail only to her girlfriend.
Unfortunately, Diamond says, she also sent the e-mail to the client -- oops, make that ex-client.
Microsoft Outlook has a "recall" function that can erase unread e-mails from the in-box of the recipient -- as long as the recipient is using the same mail client or server as the sender -- as does AOL, but only for messages between AOL users.
Then there's BigString.com, an e-mail service which lets you tinker with (or even erase) messages that have already been sent by having the sender write e-mails that are created, stored and viewed on a remote server, where they can be edited or revoked at any time; recipients are actually accessing the e-mail on the remote server when they read the message, even though it looks like a regular e-mail.
If you type just the first few letters and let your e-mail program fill out the rest based on your address book, it could easily misroute your message without your realizing it.
â€¢ Immediately notify the person who received the e-mail that it was a mistake and, if possible, ask them not to read the message -- or at least to delete it right away.
