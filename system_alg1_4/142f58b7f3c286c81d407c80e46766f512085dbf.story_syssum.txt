(CNN) -- The Williams sisters have not had it easy in recent years.
1 in the Open era, winning seven grand slam singles titles and 12 major doubles crowns alongside Serena, Williams would have been forgiven for deciding to chuck in the towel.
"When you don't feel well and things are taken away from you, it's hard to stay positive," the former world No.
But I need to look back and know that I gave everything.
Williams has played just one Fed Cup doubles rubber for the U.S. team and an exhibition match against Serena since withdrawing in New York on August 31, and she will make her return as a wildcard at the Miami Masters this week -- an event she has won on three occasions.
By managing her diet, she is aiming to one day play unaffected by the syndrome's debilitating symptoms.
I've started eating raw, vegan, unprocessed foods, doing lots of juicing, I juice twice a day.
Another motivator for Williams is the prospect of challenging for a fourth Olympic gold medal in London, where the tennis tournament will be held at Wimbledon.
"For me, the Olympics have been the pinnacle of my career -- this will be my fourth," she said.
