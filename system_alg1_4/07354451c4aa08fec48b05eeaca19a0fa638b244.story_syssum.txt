(CNN) -- The winner of the 82nd annual Scripps National Spelling Bee said Friday she is "pretty excited" but a little tired.
In an event that has seen contestants crack under the strain of the national spotlight, Kavya -- competing in her fourth national finals -- appeared composed throughout.
"I focus so much on my word; I don't really pay attention to all the cameras and photographers and all the media in front of me," she said Friday.
Kavya said she would miss competing in the spelling bee, as the rules do not permit her to enter next year.
Her hobbies include swimming, cycling and traditional Indian dance, according to the contest's Web site.
