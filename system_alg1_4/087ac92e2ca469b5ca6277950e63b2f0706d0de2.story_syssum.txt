"Focus of the Air Force leadership has drifted" in terms of handling nuclear weapons and equipment, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said.
Four officers were relieved of duty afterward, including three colonels.
Gates said the report "depicts a pattern of poor performance" in which Air Force brass didn't act to improve security after mishaps and Air Force personnel handling nuclear weapons consistently failed to follow existing rules.
The investigation found that although the Taiwan incident didn't compromise the integrity of the U.S. nuclear force, it represented "a significant failure" by the Air Force to ensure sensitive military components, Gates said.
"Secretary Gates' focus on accountability is essential and had been absent from the office of the Secretary of Defense for too long," Levin said.
Markey said he's long been concerned about what he called a series of dangerous Air Force missteps in handling nuclear weapons.
A previous investigation into the B-52 flight uncovered a "lackadaisical" attention to detail in day-to-day operations at the air bases involved, an Air Force official said in October.
