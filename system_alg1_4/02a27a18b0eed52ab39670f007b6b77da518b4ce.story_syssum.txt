This 60-foot sailboat, the Plastiki, is being built from more than 12,000 recycled plastic bottles.
De Rothschild hopes his one-of-a-kind vessel, now being built on a San Francisco pier, will boost recycling of plastic bottles, which he says are a symbol of global waste.
Everything will be recycled.
In 2005 he founded Adventure Ecology, an organization that uses field expeditions to call attention to environmental issues.
Joining him on the Plastiki will be a permanent crew of three sailors and scientists plus a handful of other crew members who will rotate through the voyage.
"This actually is the same material that is made out of bottles," said de Rothschild of the PET fabric.
Only about 10 percent of the Plastiki will be made from new materials, de Rothschild said.
"We could potentially put together a boat that costs a fraction of what normal conventional boats are made of," he said.
It's infinitely recyclable."
But to conservationists concerned about the amount of energy required to manufacture and distribute plastic bottles, its symbolic message is a welcome one.
This trip strikes me as kind of dangerous."
