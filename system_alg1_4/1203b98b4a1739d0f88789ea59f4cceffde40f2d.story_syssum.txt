Moscow (CNN)Joy Womack is taking part in her first ballet class of the day at the Kremlin Ballet Theatre, kicking her legs up to her head, jumping and spinning across the room.
The dancer did not pursue a case against the Bolshoi.
Womack says a friend helps her with accommodation and she says she has to make the money stretch in order to buy food.
I'm at a point in my life where experience is worth more."
But she says that is not always the case offstage.
Although relations between the U.S. and Russia have taken a nosedive since Russia's annexation of Crimea last March, Womack says she is "very loyal" to the Kremlin Ballet Theatre.
