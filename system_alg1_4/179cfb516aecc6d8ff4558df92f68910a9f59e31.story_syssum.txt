(CNN) -- Football's world governing body, FIFA, has officially sanctioned the wearing of religious headscarves.
However, following a request by Zhang Jilong from the Asian Football Federation in January 2012, FIFA unanimously approved headscarves for a trial period six months later.
"Players must not reveal undergarments showing slogans or advertising.
This will apply from June 1 and will be in force for the World Cup," FIFA secretary general, Jerome Valcke said.
The simplest rule for the image of the game is to start from the basis that slogans will not be allowed," said Alex Horne, general secretary of the English Football Association.
