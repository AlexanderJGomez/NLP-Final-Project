At first glance Trey Moses and Ellie Meredith couldn't be more different.
Trey -- a star on Eastern High School's basketball team in Louisville, Kentucky, who's headed to play college ball next year at Ball State -- was originally going to take his girlfriend to Eastern's prom.
"That's the kind of person Trey is," she said.
They were thrilled.
Darla Meredith said Ellie has struggled with friendships since elementary school, but a special program at Eastern called Best Buddies had made things easier for her.
Both Trey and Ellie have a lot of planning to do.
"Ellie can't wait to go dress shopping" her mother said.
