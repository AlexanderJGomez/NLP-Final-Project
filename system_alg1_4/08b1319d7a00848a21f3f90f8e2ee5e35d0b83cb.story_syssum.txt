FARGO, North Dakota (CNN)  -- Forecasters issued flash flood warnings for Bismarck and surrounding areas Wednesday, as volunteers rushed to fill sandbags ahead of expected record floods in the flat state of North Dakota.
Mayor John Warford said that water appeared to be moving more freely in the Missouri River after the explosives were set off, KXMB reported.
Snow, which continued to fall Wednesday, complicated preparations, city officials said.
More than 1,000 people were evacuated from an area near Bismarck on Tuesday night as the Missouri River flooded, Rick Robinson of the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services said Wednesday.
The river is expected to crest between 39 and 41 feet in Fargo on Friday, according to Cecily Fong of the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services.
