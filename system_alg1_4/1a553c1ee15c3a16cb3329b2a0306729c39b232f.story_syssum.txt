The two cheetahs had been separated from their mother so they could be vaccinated, weighed and swabbed for DNA.
Zoologists at the Smithsonian National Zoo have cross-fostered a cheetah cub, persuading a female cheetah to become a foster mom to an at-risk cub.
"A cheetah female can't produce enough milk for just one cub because a single cub won't stimulate mom enough to keep producing milk," cheetah biologist Adrienne Crosier said.
Then they put the two cubs in a box together and let Zazi in.
And then laid down in the nest box with him, and it took about 20 to 30 minutes before she realized that there were two cubs in there with her," Crosier said.
"Hey buddy, nice teeth," Padilla told the young male as he took a look in his mouth and swabbed a sample for DNA testing.
"Last year, we had our new young male coalition, and we wanted to literally teach them about female cheetahs and how to breed because they were very young and inexperienced," Crosier said.
So we are not sure which of the boys fathered the second cub."
