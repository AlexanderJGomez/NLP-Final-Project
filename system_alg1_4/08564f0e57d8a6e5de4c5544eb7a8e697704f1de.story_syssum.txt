(CNN) -- Portugal's Sergio Paulinho won stage 10 to hand Lance Armstrong's RadioShack team their first victory in the Tour de France.
Andy Schleck's overall lead was never threatened during the 179km stage from Chambery to Gap, while the home crowd could not celebrate a local winner in sweltering temperatures on Bastille Day.
"It was a close sprint but the most important thing is to win and so this moment, for me and my team, is a good one," Paulinho told the official Tour de France website.
Overall leader Schleck was pleased with a comfortable day in the saddle: "It was quite an easy day even if it was fast at the beginning.
I had a little bit of time to enjoy my first day in the yellow jersey.
