Timothy P. O'Neill says there are striking similarities in the backgrounds of the Supreme Court justices.
CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- With the retirement of Justice David Souter, President Obama has the opportunity to bring a special kind of diversity to the Supreme Court: the diversity of broad and varied governmental experience.
Many commentators have noted that this is the first Supreme Court in American history in which every justice has come from exactly the same job: judge on the U.S.
For the first time in American history, eight of the nine justices attended one of only two law schools: Harvard or Yale.
(Although Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg graduated from Columbia, she transferred from Harvard Law School.)
This, of course, is an illusion.
The Court decided 72 cases.
The best example of how there is no single "judge's answer" to Supreme Court issues can be found in the eight death penalty cases decided during the 2006 term.
Yet every single case was decided 5-4.
Looking for a single "judge's answer" to an issue before the Supreme Court is usually futile.
We should welcome, and not irrationally restrict, the variety of experience that can be brought to Supreme Court decision-making.
Obama should cast the widest possible net to find a person who can bring a fresh set of experiences and perspectives to the work of the Supreme Court.
