Harry Weeks, left, and Jason McCuiston fired on James von Brunn at the Holocaust Memorial Museum.
What went terribly wrong is that white supremacist James von Brunn allegedly walked into the museum and started firing his rifle, shooting security officer Stephen Johns in the chest.
"This was terrible," Weeks said softly.
"First thing I thought about, I have an 11-year-old," the officer said before breaking down.
Just moments before their joint interview with CNN on Thursday, McCuiston and Weeks attended a grief counseling session together, and both men say they are still struggling with their emotions.
McCuiston said the 6-foot-6-inch, 300-pound Johns was a "gentle giant" who was always friendly to colleagues and museum visitors.
Weeks said he wanted the world to see "what a man of hate did to this family, and the grief he caused.
"
"Everyone knows when you lose someone, death is one of the worst things, even though it is reality," McCuiston said.
