"It's the worst," says the narrator of a new Cochran campaign ad airing in the final stretch before the June 3 primary, not so subtly pointing the finger at his GOP Senate challenger, Chris McDaniel, trying to stir up voter disgust.
Conservative outlets that back McDaniel have been all over the fact Cochran rents a basement apartment in Webber's D.C. home, and that Webber has traveled extensively with Cochran on the taxpayer's dime.
What we're doing right now -- we're talking about the issues," McDaniel told CNN in an interview.
"I am not going to Washington D.C. to be a member of the cocktail circuit or to make backroom deals.
He's a guy that believes in big government.
I am not that guy," McDaniel said.
But like other Republican incumbents this year, Cochran and his allies are fighting back hard.
Other traditional GOP groups like the Chamber of Commerce have also come in with ads supporting Cochran, like they have for GOP incumbents in other states this year.
He said Cochran fights hard for Mississippi's needs and calls his seniority -- ranking Republican on the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, a big plus for the state.
People can lose touch and get lazy and all those things but I don't think that's the case with Senator Cochran.
"I say name one fight Senator Cochran's lead against Barack Obama.
And they can't name one," McDaniel told CNN.
We wanted to ask Cochran himself why he thinks he should get another six years, after serving 36 in the U.S. Senate and six before that in the House.
