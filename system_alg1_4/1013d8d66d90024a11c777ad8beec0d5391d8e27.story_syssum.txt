Albany, New York (CNN) -- Ned Norton was working as a fitness trainer for Olympic athletes and bodybuilders when a young man with a spinal cord injury asked him for help.
"So I opened a gym designed to fit their needs," he said.
They can't live their lives," said Norton, 55.
"I never worry about what they can't do," said Norton.
Most of the people he trains are in wheelchairs and rely on their upper body strength to get around.
So upper body strength is key," said Clement, 65.
Clement has worked out at Norton's gym several times a week for the past 15 years.
For those who can afford to pay it, Norton charges $25 a month.
They also become resources for each other, providing advice and references.
They are out there on their own," Norton said.
Norton says many of the people he has worked with have gone on to drive again, gain employment and pursue their interests without letting their disabilities get in the way.
I'm not a miracle worker," Norton said.
