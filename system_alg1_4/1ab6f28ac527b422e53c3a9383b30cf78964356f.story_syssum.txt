(CNN) -- Journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee told Ling's sister they were treated humanely in North Korea, and they believe they weren't sent to hard-labor camps because they have medical conditions, Lisa Ling said Friday.
She's very, very weak," Lisa Ling said, adding that the stories she's heard so far are "jaw-dropping."
Lisa Ling said that before they left the United States, the pair never intended to cross into North Korea.
Lisa Ling said her sister was allowed to call the family on four occasions during her five months in captivity.
We immediately jumped into action and alerted Vice President Gore," Lisa Ling said.
Laura Ling is "doing well," and Lee is "skinny," Lisa Ling said, joking that her mother tried to force-feed Lee on Thursday "because she's just become so diminutive."
"So even communicating is a challenge because she sometimes yesterday was even having a hard time getting full sentences out, so it's a slow adjustment," Lisa Ling said.
Emotions have run high in Lee's home as well, Lisa Ling said.
Lee and her husband went to Laura Ling's house Thursday night for their first pizza since being released, Lisa Ling said Friday.
She said she always knew they would come home.
I didn't know when it would happen, but I never lost that hope."
