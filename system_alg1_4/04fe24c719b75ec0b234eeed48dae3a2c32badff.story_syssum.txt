(CNN) -- Over the past week, two popular Internet messaging companies, SnapChat and Skype, were hacked.
In August 2013, a group of security researchers publicly reported weaknesses in SnapChat's programming interfaces that could allow data exfiltration and manipulation.
If you're mad at your critics, you might ignore them and quietly fix the flaws.
The next day someone posted the user names and phone numbers of the 4.6 million SnapChat users that they had extracted using the security weaknesses.
Skype had the dubious distinction of being the first major Internet company to be compromised in 2014.
The Syrian Electronic Army is famous for using phishing, a simple tool that persuades users to disclose their user names and passwords through cleverly worded e-mails.
The social media accounts of Skype that were accessed by the Syrian Electronic Army had optional two-factor authentication available, but it was apparently not enabled by Skype.
Similar messages were posted on its Twitter and Facebook pages.
We're sorry for the inconvenience."
Back then most services didn't offer protections like two-factor authentication or those protections were not flexible enough to work for social media accounts.
So, what are they waiting for?
Demand accountability.
