Sajida al-Rishawi was sentenced to death for that attempt, and Jordan executed her early Wednesday.
Al-Rishawi was referred to as an "imprisoned sister" of the terrorist group in a message purportedly posted online by a known ISIS supporter.
Forgoing the money, the voice then issued a new ISIS demand: the release of al-Rishawi.
"They are just demanding the release of their imprisoned sister Sajida al-Rishawi," the voice said.
In 2006, al-Rishawi was sentenced to death, but that same year, Jordan imposed a moratorium on the death penalty.
Jordanian authorities said al-Rishawi, now in her 40s, joined her husband, Hussein Ali al-Shamari, to carry out the suicide bombings at the Radisson hotel.
Jordanian authorities at the time said the attacks were orchestrated by the terrorist group al Qaeda in Iraq, which was led by Jordanian-born Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.
Deputy Prime Minister Marwan Muasher said after the attacks that al-Rishawi was the sister of Zarqawi's "right-hand man," who was killed in Falluja, Iraq.
After the Jordan attacks, Muasher told CNN that al-Rishawi was not wearing an explosives belt when she was apprehended, but two belts were found with her.
Muasher said Jordanian authorities had information that al-Rishawi's husband "asked her to step out of the room" when her explosives failed to detonate.
"There were women, men and children."
