"I am not my phone, but my phone is a reflection of me," said Smith, 26, of Louisville, Kentucky.
As part of our Our Mobile Society series on how phones and tablets are changing our lives, CNN asked a handful of people to document everything they do on their smartphones over the course of a week: every text, every tweet, every minute spent scrolling through Instagram or playing "Words with Friends."
It's not just that we're on our phones a lot.
In one week in early September, Kathleen Baker sent 256 e-mails from her phone, many of those as part of her duties as director of housing for a university.

"The phone definitely helps me keep up with all the moving parts of my life.
Like Baker, most people who shared their smartphone-usage habits said they view their phone as a hugely positive thing in their lives, not a burden or the root of an unhealthy addiction.
Anfield, who lives in Alexandria, Virginia, just outside Washington, sent 423 texts during the week he tracked his phone use.
"If somebody picks up my phone, it does make me nervous," he said.
Smith, the Louisville med-school student, said he didn't realize just how much he used his iPhone until he documented his usage for a week.
"I was stunned by just how integrated my phone has become in my life.
After jotting down all his phone usage and staring at the page -- almost 800 text messages sent and received -- Smith wondered whether he was relying on his phone too much.
Smith also uses his phone to study and do medical research, and he believes the benefits of using it outweigh any potential downside.
But Smith believes that his phone enhances, and not detracts from, his real-life human interactions.
Today's world is too fluid for that."
