A portrait of Eluana Englaro taken in July 2008 in Italy.
For years, her father has fought to have her feeding tube removed, saying it would be a dignified end to his daughter's life.
But although Englaro had cleared the last legal hurdle, the court's decision sparked a new fight to find a hospital or clinic that would take out Eluana's feeding tube.
Finally, a private clinic in the northeastern Italian city of Udine agreed to assist in Eluana's case.
The Udine clinic says the removal of Eluana's tube will begin in about three days, and the process of allowing her to die will take about 20 days.
The outline adheres to the Cassation Court's ruling, which required certain steps and conditions once Eluana's feeding tube is removed.
