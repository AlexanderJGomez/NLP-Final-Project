But Blaszczykowski struck a superb left-foot equaliser on 57 minutes to earn Poland a second successive 1-1 draw and ensure that Group A remains wide open.
Earlier, Czech Republic had kept their qualification hopes alive with a deserved 2-1 win over Greece, who can still qualify for the knockout stages if they beat Russia in their final game.
Either way, as it had been in their first game against Poland, Greece's first-half luck was completely out.
Having fought back from a goal down and with only 10 men in their first game against Poland, Greece looked set to stage another second-half revival.
The victory means Bilak's Czech side now have three points from two Group A games, but leaves Greece knowing that only a win against Russia in their final group game will give them any chance of reaching the knockout stages.
Instead, it was Russia who took control eight minutes before half-time.
That was a trait which ultimately came to haunt Russia as, from one such stray ball, Poland broke with devastating effect.
