(CNN) -- Cycling can be the cruelest of sports and just when New Zealand's Jack Bauer was ready to celebrate a Tour de France stage win it was snatched away from him in an instant.
Bauer was the stronger of the duo and made his run for the finish to be denied by Katusha fast man Kristoff, who was claiming his second stage win of the 2014 Tour.
"This was my first chance to be up the road and with the chance in the wind and the weather, me and Martin realized we had a chance for the win.
I left it until 400.
