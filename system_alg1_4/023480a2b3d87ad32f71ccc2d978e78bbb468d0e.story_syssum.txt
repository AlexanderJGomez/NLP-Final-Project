The move follows strike-related violence at Lonmin's Marikana mine in August that left 44 dead.
The 34 miners in the Lonmin mine in Marikana, South Africa, died after police opened fire on a gathering of thousands of machete-armed workers striking for higher wages.
The bulk of its 28,000 employees work at the mine, and around 23% belong to the AMCU.
Rivalry between the AMCU and the NUM is widely blamed for feeding the violence.
The stand-off later escalated into violence, leaving 34 dead, 78 injured and 259 arrested on various charges, according to South Africa National Police Commissioner Riah Phiyega.
The outcome set a "problematic precedent for platinum companies in South Africa," Africa analyst Mark Rosenberg said.
The video appeared to show the police response was "very forceful," Turner said.
The South African Institute for Race Relations said that policemen randomly shot into the crowd with rifles and handguns.
"We are a peaceful organization and we do not condone violence," he said.
Mphahlele said police initially shot at the protesters from behind, although when asked if they shot first he said: "I was not there," adding: "The killing of those people was not necessary."
Re-election is "significantly less likely" Rosenberg said.
The company said last week that a "peace accord" had been signed, but key unions had not agreed to the deal.
Lonmin acting CEO Simon Scott said the company and unions have agreed to "negotiate to address the wage demands within a legal framework."
