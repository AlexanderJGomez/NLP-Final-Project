(CNN) -- California's vote on a controversial cigarette tax remained too close to call Wednesday morning, although votes counted so far suggest it was narrowly rejected.
Proposition 29, would raise about $735 million a year.
The tax, she said in an interview with CNN, "goes to build bigger bureaucracy, build business, build buildings, not necessarily to go to cancer research."
About $12 million was raised in support of the initiative, including $8.5 million from the American Cancer Society and $1.5 million from the Lance Armstrong Foundation, known as Livestrong.
There is already an 87-cent tax on each pack of cigarettes in California.
29 said it would "save lives, stop kids from smoking, and fund cancer research," while those opposed said the initiative "doesn't require revenue be spent in California to create jobs or fund schools."
And other efforts, including the state's ban on smoking in public places, have succeeded at pushing people to quit smoking, she said.
