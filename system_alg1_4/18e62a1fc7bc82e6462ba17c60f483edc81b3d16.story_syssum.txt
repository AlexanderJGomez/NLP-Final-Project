(Tribune Media Services) -- We don't know where to look first.
Antoni Gaudi's Sagrada Familia is Barcelona's most famous site and Spain's most visited.
This is a great place to engage the kids in a scavenger hunt.
Luckily, Gaudi had made plaster models of the church (we see them in the museum at the site) and though they were also smashed, his supporters were able to painstakingly put them back together so the work could continue.
I want to go to the top (you take an elevator, but walk down the stairs), but I think Erica has had enough.
Unfortunately, no one in Barcelona gravitated toward the idea.
"Cool," Erica says.
Barcelona, home to the 1992 Summer Olympics, is a city that appeals to kids (especially teens) and parents.
And with such friendly locals, there's no better place for the kids to practice their Spanish.
It's been here for centuries.
We're holing up overnight at the Hotel Arts Barcelona, a Ritz Carlton, a famous icon of the Barcelona skyline and a short walk from the beach and many of the city sites.
It's housed in three spectacular stone mansions in the historic quarter of the city and showcases works from the artist's early years, his Blue Period and early works from Barcelona.
I didn't really see evidence of that, but, after all, we were there at 8:30, early by Barcelona standards.
Even Erica agreed the food was great, especially the wood-fired pizza.
We are in Barcelona after all.
Erica unfortunately isn't.
"I just won't eat," says Erica, after perusing the menu.
A few months later, Erica tells me she's already decided where she wants to go abroad when she's in college -- Barcelona.
