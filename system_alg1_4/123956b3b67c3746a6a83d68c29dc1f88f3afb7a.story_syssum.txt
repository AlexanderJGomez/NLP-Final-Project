(CNN) -- Rutgers men's assistant basketball coach Jimmy Martelli resigned the same day his boss was fired after ESPN broadcast a lengthy video of players being physically and verbally abused, the university told CNN on Thursday.
The news comes the same day Rutgers revealed the university will pay Rice a $100,000 longevity bonus, according to a university spokesman.
Rice said after he was fired that "there's no explanation for what's on those videos because there's no excuse for it," according to CNN affiliate WABC.
"I am responsible for the decision to attempt a rehabilitation of Coach Rice," Pernetti said in a written statement.
According to CNN affiliate WCBS, Pernetti said he had talked to Martelli about the video.
Certainly the tape focused on Mike, but it brought some other things to light that we dealt with at the same time that we dealt with Mike."
