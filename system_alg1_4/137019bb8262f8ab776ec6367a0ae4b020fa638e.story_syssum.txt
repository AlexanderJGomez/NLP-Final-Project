Maybe they crave the love of an adoring public, or perhaps they see the movies as a way to leave their mark on the world, to be immortalized on celluloid.
For Danish actress Connie Nielsen it was something quite different.
So Connie Nielsen is not your typical movie star.
I try to do as good work as I can do, I try to grow in my art and reach for truth," she says.
The movie made Nielsen an international star and she scored other successes with "One Hour Photo" in 2002, and "The Hunted" in 2003.
Nielsen has in the past been critical of Hollywood for its lack of female roles, saying "you think once you've shown what you can do, and your movies have been successful, that snap, you work.
But Nielsen has refused to be pigeonholed, seemingly drawn to difficult roles in controversial movies.
But Nielsen makes it clear that her career is not the focus of her life and she stresses the importance of making time outside the movies.
"I will always find something that I want to try and become better at.
Perhaps her commitment to her art, her interest in social issues and her disavowal of fame simply reflect her Danish upbringing, but there's no doubt that compared to many other Hollywood stars Connie Nielsen is a breath of fresh air.
