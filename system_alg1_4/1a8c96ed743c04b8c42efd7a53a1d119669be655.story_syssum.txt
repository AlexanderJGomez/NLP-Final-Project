Nicholson, roughly 13 years of age, is shown here with five of her sisters and two of her mothers.
Today, as Warren Jeffs sits at Utah's Purgatory Correctional Facility awaiting trial, Nicholson has started talking publicly about her childhood in the church Jeffs led -- the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS).
Nicholson recently co-authored an article about leaving her polygamous community for Glamour magazine and is planning to write a book as well.
As a child, Nicholson had three mothers and 12 siblings.
And when it hit me that I could possibly and most likely absolutely would be sharing my husband, I began doubting that I could live that way," she said.
That perspective got Nicholson in trouble at Alta Academy, the FLDS-run high school whose headmaster was Warren Jeffs.
" she said.
It was a common destination for FLDS kids kicked out of high school.
Their marriage was not accepted by the FLDS or their families because they had gone outside of the church, to a justice of the peace, for the ceremony.
That marriage fell apart, but in 2003 Nicholson persuaded her family to allow her brother to come live with her.
As glad as Nicholson is to see Jeffs behind bars and awaiting trial, she finds it unsettling to see a man who led the community in which she was raised now reduced to such a pathetic state.
... And then he looked up at the camera and gave this smirk, and that was the smirk that he would give before he damned you straight to hell or gave you the beating of your life or altered a rule that would absolutely devastate your household," Nicholson said.
