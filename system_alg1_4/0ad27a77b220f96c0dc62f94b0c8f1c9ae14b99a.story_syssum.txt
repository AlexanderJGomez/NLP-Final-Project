(CNN) -- Mexico City sees its share of protests, but this one was unusual.
The protesters who gathered Thursday are relatives of 11 partygoers who went missing more than a week ago from a bar in a posh Mexico City neighborhood known as "Zona Rosa," or Pink Zone.
Guadalupe Dominguez, a relative of one of the missing, said a witness told her the 11 people were kidnapped by armed men who showed up in SUVs, but authorities say there's no evidence of such an incident.
Maria Teresa Ramos, Ortiz's grandmother, said relatives are mystified and want answers.
There should be surveillance cameras that can show us exactly what happened," Ramos said.
Mexico City Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera said authorities are treating the incident as a missing-person case because so far, there's no evidence the young people were kidnapped.
Mexico City District Attorney Rodolfo Rios Garza said security cameras at the bar were not working, but authorities are relying on city cameras in the neighborhood.
The bar has been shut down while the investigation into the disappearances continues.
Shabazz, 28, was found just outside the bar by police at 3:30 a.m. one block south of Plaza Garibaldi.
Rios Garza said the men work at the bar, The Palace Club, where Shabazz and three people had drinks.
