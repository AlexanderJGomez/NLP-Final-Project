Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)Iraqi forces appeared Wednesday to be making progress on the third day of a major offensive intended to push ISIS fighters out of the city of Tikrit.
Despite the reported Iranian assistance, the Iraqi forces face no easy task as they seek to advance on Tikrit.
Iraq has not asked the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS to provide air cover for the operation to retake Tikrit.
On Monday, Iraqi forces approached Tikrit from several fronts, Iraqiya TV reported, engaging with ISIS north of the city at al-Alam and south of the city at al-Dour.
Tikrit is a big city, and the army and its associated militias have had problems recapturing much smaller towns from ISIS.
Prime Minister al-Abadi, who is also commander in chief of the armed forces, said on Twitter that he would "oversee the operation to liberate Tikrit" from ISIS.
Rights group Human Rights Watch on Wednesday urged government forces to protect civilians from revenge attacks by pro-government militias as they fight to retake Tikrit.
