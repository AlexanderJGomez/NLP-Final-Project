It's totally fine to do an initial Google on someone you just met (especially somewhere like a bar or online) simply to make sure that s/he is, in fact, who they say they are.

A story: Back in 2009, American Girl put out a doll named Rebecca Rubin -- a young Jewish girl from New York's Lower East Side.
A simple Google search by an American Girl employee could have waylaid that issue.
Nowadays, when anyone can and will search for you online -- you're not the only one, Creeper(?)
You should even set up a Google Alert for your name.
Then the FBI will take care of that for you.)
