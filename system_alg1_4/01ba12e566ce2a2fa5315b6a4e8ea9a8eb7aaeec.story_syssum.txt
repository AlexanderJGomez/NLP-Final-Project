President Bush says his wife told him that as president, he should watch his words carefully.
Shortly after the attacks of September 11, the president said of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden: "I want justice.
My answer is, bring 'em on," he said then.
To some it said, well, Bush thinks the war in Iraq is over, when I didn't think that.
The president, whose legacy is sure to be hotly debated for decades, said there also is much he is proud of.
In the wide-ranging interview, the president also discussed his Monday meeting with President-elect Barack Obama and said he consulted former President Clinton before his meeting with the future commander in chief.
Bush described the atmosphere in his Oval Office meeting with Obama as relaxed and said he offered the future president advice on the transition process.
"It was interesting to watch him go upstairs," Bush said.
Bush said he plans to return to Texas after he leaves office January 20 and "may write a book" but otherwise has few plans.
"I want people to know what it was like to make some of the decisions I had to make," he said.
It is good for our country that people have hope in the system and feel vested in the future and President-elect Obama has a great opportunity," Bush said.
"I really do wish him all the best.
