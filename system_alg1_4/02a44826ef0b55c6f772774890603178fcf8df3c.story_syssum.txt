Bopanna, an Indian Hindu, and Qureshi, a Pakistani Muslim also aged 30, reached their first major doubles final at the U.S. Open in September and climbed to eighth in the world rankings.
"We're thinking how to get to a wider audience and spread the message of peace through our partnership and thought," Qureshi told CNN's Open Court.
I just hope in the near future we can have that match at the border, that would be great."
"Right now we're trying to see if we can help tennis in both our countries, promote it and keep the sport growing as much as we can."
Their partnership may have attracted plenty of headlines but for Qureshi, teaming up with his Indian counterpart made perfect sense.
"Unfortunately there are not that many Pakistanis on the tour, and playing with an Indian was actually the most natural thing that came to me -- having the same language, most of the time having the same dinner, Indian or Pakistani foods in the evening.
"I've always told him I think he's the most popular Indian guy in Pakistan this year!
It's been a great journey so far."
