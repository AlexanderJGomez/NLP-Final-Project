Hong Kong (CNN) -- Malaysian police are still searching for a Pakistani national over the alleged theft of money from bank accounts belonging to four people aboard missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, according to Malaysian investigators.
About $10,000 (35,000 Malaysian ringgit) was then allegedly transferred to a fifth account belonging to Farran, police said.
HSBC's Malaysian branch said it notified police of potential fraud involving the accounts.
It's believed the plane crashed into the southern Indian Ocean, west of Australia.
