(CNN)There's an old saying which states the Cape Verde Islands are home to a greater number of musicians per square kilometer than any other country in the world.
Now, Cape Verde is seeking to tap-into the spoils of this rich cultural heritage in a bid to help its economy flourish.
"Besides fish, it is pretty common (for Cape Verde) to say 'our biggest richness is in music and culture,'" said Christine Semba of Womex, an international networking platform for the world music genre.
However, a 2013 report from the UN Conference on Trade and Development noted that Cape Verde's creative sector remained a relatively small part of its economy with much room for improvement and long term planning.
"We breathe the music in Cape Verde, we live with the music," he added.
Enter the Atlantic Music Expo, a three-year-old conference and networking event that seeks to help Cape Verdean artists secure international exposure.
"We try to invite lots of producers and a lot of journalists from around the world to see the festival and the musicians from Cape Verde," said Jose Da Silva, long time manager of the late Cape Verdean songstress Cesaria Evora.
Getting Cape Verde's name out on the world stage through recognition of its rich musical culture is therefore increasingly important.
It must be noted, however, that few countries have the same natural resources for music as Cape Verde.
