Based on those submissions, the arbiters at the school decided to put the following on this year's chopping block: "amazing," "baby bump," "shared sacrifice," "occupy," "blowback," "man cave," "ginormous" and "the new normal."
"Worn-out words and phrases are the new normal this year, but with some shared sacrifice, we can clean up the language and win the future," a school representative said in a written statement.
"My teeth grate, my hackles rise, and even my dog is getting annoyed at this senseless overuse.
So please, assign 'man cave' to the lexicographic scrap heap where it so rightly belongs."
"It basically says that anyone who opposes anything meant to 'win the future' must want to 'lose the future,' which is highly unlikely."
"This combination of gigantic and enormous makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck every time I hear it," said Gina Bua of Vancouver, Washington.
Lake Superior State University's annual "word banishment" list was first created at a New Year's Eve party in 1975.
The school now claims to receive tens of thousands of nominations every year.
