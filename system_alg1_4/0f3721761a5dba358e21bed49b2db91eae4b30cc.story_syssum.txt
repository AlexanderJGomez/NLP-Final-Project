(CNN) -- The prominent man had an altercation with his wife at a hotel.
A plea deal so generous that the abuser's arrest record will be expunged -- totally clean, as if the whole thing had never happened -- if he receives some counseling in the next few months.
The woman identified as Kelli Fuller said her drunk husband was assaulting her.
About a minute into the call, as dispatchers summon help, Kelli Fuller is heard saying "I hate you, I hate you."
Then, Fuller will have to undergo a once-a-week family and domestic violence program for 24 weeks.
What happens after Fuller completes counseling?
The parallels between the Rice and Fuller cases extend further.
After Ray beat his then-fiancee, Janay Palmer, unconscious in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the couple married.
Consider that last line: "my family, where they should be resolved."
When husbands beat up their wives, that is not a matter that should be resolved within the family.
Whether the Rices and Fullers stay married is their business; but whether Ray Rice and Judge Mark Fuller committed crimes should be a question for prosecutors, and ultimately, juries to decide.
All the rest of us can do is hope that the next prominent man who beats up his wife doesn't get off as easy.
