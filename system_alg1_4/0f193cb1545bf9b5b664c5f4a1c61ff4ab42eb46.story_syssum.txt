(CNN) -- An Alabama man who says he was fired for exposing public corruption received broad support from the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday in a free-speech dispute testing workplace protections for government employees.
A ruling in favor of the man at the center of the legal fight, Edward Lane, could make it easier for prosecutors to pursue official public corruption allegations where the cooperation of government workers is often a key factor.
Lane says he tried to work with Schmitz to perform her job duties.
Lane was later terminated from his government job, prompting him to sue the college president.
It amounted to someone speaking as "a citizen on a matter of public concern."
And some justices wondered whether a public official should enjoy broad job security when testifying in court.
"That seems counterintuitive to me.
Chief Justice John Roberts said Lane had no choice but to testify as ordered.
"But you are suggesting he can be fired if he does it."
But oral arguments revealed the court was likely to carve exceptions for employees compelled to testify under oath about matters of public concern.
