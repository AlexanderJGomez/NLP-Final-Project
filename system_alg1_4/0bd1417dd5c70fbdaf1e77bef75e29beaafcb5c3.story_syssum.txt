Sarah Palin let the "Road to Nowhere" go ahead because the contract had been signed.
But the three-mile access road that was built on the island is ready for residents to take a drive to nowhere.
But Palin, now the Republican vice presidential candidate, let the access road go ahead because the contract to build it had been signed, a campaign aide said.
Palin could have stopped construction of this road," said Weinstein, who wore his "Nowhere, Alaska" T-shirt to an interview with CNN.
The island is connected to the city by a ferry that runs to the airport, well past the point where the bridge was to have been built.
Campaign spokeswoman Meg Stapleton said Palin would not have allowed the road project to go forward under normal circumstances.
But Weinstein, a Democrat, said Palin instead spent $26 million to build a road "that will not go to a bridge."
She has dropped the line from her stump speech in the past week, but a McCain-Palin aide said that her prepared remarks are being tweaked as needed to reflect current events, and it could come back again.
