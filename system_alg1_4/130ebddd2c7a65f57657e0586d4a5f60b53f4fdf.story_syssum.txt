Specs appeal: 3D is on its way to being free of 3D glasses as the format is rapidly advancing.
But even as Hollywood studios and producers embrace digital 3D, they admit they are still learning how to use it.
"The challenge now is 100 years of experience in how to make movies in 2D," said McNally, speaking of a movie industry that has spent its existence flattening the 3D of real life for the silver screen.
"There's going to be great filmmakers that are going to deliver experiences like you've never seen before," said Jason Clark, a motion picture producer who helped launch Dreamworks' 3D foray and worked on "Monster House" and "Stuart Little," the first time a photorealistic character was spliced into a live action movie.
Filmmakers are greeting 3D with cautious excitement.
3D is the way we experience life."
"3D right now is at its infant stages."
Digital projection is "rock steady" and could define how different generations take on 3D, said Clark.
It's no coincidence that animation is leading 3D releases, along with horror, Clark said, as the children who watched 2004's "Polar Express" are growing up.
The United States will have around 3,000 3D screens by the end of this year when "Avatar" is scheduled for release, according to the National Association of Theatre Owners (NATO).
"Movie theatre owners are highly conscious of the expense involved in installing a 3D system," said Patrick Corcoran, Director of Media & Research at NATO, noting that out of approximately 600 theatrical releases this year, only 12 to 15 will be offered in 3D.
"If you are really determined, you can make a copy of anything," said McNally, suggesting that 3-D movies could be recorded through the same kind of lenses used in 3-D glasses, but pirates would have to be "pretty serious" to pull it off.
3D promises to deliver a unique experience in theatres that could allow Hollywood to take something back.
And that's something that can't be replicated in the home," Corcoran said.
