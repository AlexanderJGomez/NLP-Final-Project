London (CNN) -- Depicting, among other things, Christ's procession to the cross, Spanish soldiers presiding over an execution in sixteenth-century Flanders and a mysterious mill perched atop a hollow cliff, Pieter Bruegel the Elder's 1564 painting "The Way to Calvary" is a complex, multi-layered work laden with symbolism and drama.
"For me, Bruegel is time," said the director.
You can spend your whole life with it, easily outside of the length of a movie," he said.
An exhibition of Lech Majewski's work, including his film installation "Bruegel Suite," based on "The Mill and the Cross" is currently on view at The Wapping Project in London.
The painting which inspired the film, Bruegel's "Procession to Calvary" is in the collection of the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna.
