(CNN) -- Louisiana authorities said Tuesday they found the body of a missing 6-year-old girl, stabbed and stuffed in a trash can down the street from her home.
The Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office said Flugence, 20, often babysat for her.
That's when they found the girl's body in a garbage can, wrapped in a blanket from her house and covered in a garbage bag, Normand said.
Normand said garbage collection in the neighborhood happens Tuesday mornings.
Flugence's brother Russell, 21, was arrested for obstruction of justice in the case, Normand said.
