Arne Duncan, the U.S. secretary of education, set off a firestorm last week when he suggested that most of the opposition to the Common Core State Standards for education was coming from "white suburban moms" who have suddenly discovered from standardized test results that their children aren't as "brilliant as they thought they were and their school isn't quite as good" as they thought it was.
Unfortunately, the way Duncan framed his comments -- and the backlash they've created -- are just more distractions in what should be a serious conversation about the very real education problems we face, and about the role the Common Core might play in increasing rigor and improving opportunities for American students.
The truth is that the backlash against the Common Core has grown strongest in areas where state tests results showed many previously "proficient" students failing to meet expectations.
The evidence suggests that for too long, the expectations we have set have been too low for far too many of our students.
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, between 28% and 40% of four-year college students have to enroll in at least one remedial course to learn content and skills they should have learned before earning their high school diplomas.
Worse, according to a U.S. Department of Education study, only 27% of students who needed a remedial math course completed college.
In the end, the most unfortunate consequence of Duncan's gaffe is that it suggested a division where instead urban and suburban schools and parents could have found unity in talking about the school and classroom changes we need to give all students access to the rigorous content and skills they need to succeed.
