Mercedes teammates Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg's battle for the 2014 championship is drawing tantalizing comparisons with the sport's most famous rivalry between former McLaren pairing Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost.
"They are both competitive guys and they are fighting for a world championship.
"I quite like the way Senna dealt with it so I'm going to take a page out of his book," the British 2008 world champion told BBC radio.
Senna and Prost dueled for the F1 world championship as McLaren teammates in 1988 and 1989.
Hamilton and Rosberg have been buddies since their teenage karting days and were often roommates on the junior racing circuit.
Rosberg, who has never won a world title, leads 2008 winner Hamilton by four points in the drivers' championship ahead of the seventh race of the season.
The tighter the title chase, the looser their ties of friendship might just become.
