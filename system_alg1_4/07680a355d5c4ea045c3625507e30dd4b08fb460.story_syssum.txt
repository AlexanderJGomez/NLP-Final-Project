(CNN) -- One person was killed and dozens injured after unrest broke out overnight at an Australian detention center for asylum seekers on a remote island in Papua New Guinea, authorities said Tuesday.
Australia operates controversial offshore centers for processing asylum seekers on Manus and the tiny Pacific island of Nauru.
The unrest on Manus overnight followed "low-level demonstrations" at the center on the island, Morrison said.
Most of those hurt in the riots have been treated locally, but two severely injured people are being transferred to Australia, Morrison said.
"The news of a death is a great tragedy," Morrison said, expressing his sympathies to the deceased's family and friends.
