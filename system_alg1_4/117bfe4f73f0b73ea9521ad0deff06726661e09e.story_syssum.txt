Sarah Palin, Wasilla, Alaska's former mayor, is under fire for a sports complex she fought hard for.
Palin campaigned for a sales tax increase to finance the $14.7 million project, winning approval for the half-cent levy by a margin of 20 votes.
But the city never obtained clear property to the title until this year, after a lengthy court battle with developer Gary Lundgren, who owned part of the land on which the complex sits.
In 1999, the Nature Conservancy was negotiating to sell the land to the city and Lundgren, but he says that although he signed a purchase agreement with the group, the city did not.
After Palin left office, the city sought to obtain the tract it needed for the sports complex through eminent domain, leading to another court battle.
Lundgren said he offered to give the city a 20-acre parcel to avoid further lawsuits, but city officials turned him down.
Attorney Kenneth Jacobus, who represented the city, said he had no recollection of an acceptable offer from Lundgren.
It may have been a part of Sarah Palin's dream, but it wasn't only her dream," Keller said.
Its operating costs are about $900,000 a year, Urban said, and city records show that the city has to pay about $100,000 of that.
