Even after seven seasons, "True Blood" kept fans guessing right on through to the end.
Granted, the show has been building up to Bill's death the last few episodes, but it still seemed like something that wouldn't actually happen.
All she wanted was for her one true love to live.
He knew they wouldn't be able to stay away from one another, and he wanted Sookie to have the life he felt she deserved -- one with a family, something a vampire cannot give her.
Jessica and Hoyt are one couple that fans have rooted for, and while the gesture was sweet -- it allowed Bill to walk Jessica down the aisle before his untimely death -- it was still a bit of a rush, and took away from the main event.
We knew he got his happy ending with James (Nathan Parsons), but couldn't we get just one sassy comeback from him before the credits rolled?
Paquin and Moyer gave stellar performances as they said their final goodbyes to one another (although the two actors get to stay happily married to one another in real life).
As for Sookie, she got her happy ending.
"Wow True Blood series finale was horrible," another fan said.
The only plot point that seemed to escape viewers' criticism involved Alexander Skarsgard's Eric and Kristin Bauer van Straten's Pam.
So thank you, "True Blood," for taking viewers on an unforgettable, bloody ride, and staying true until the very end.
