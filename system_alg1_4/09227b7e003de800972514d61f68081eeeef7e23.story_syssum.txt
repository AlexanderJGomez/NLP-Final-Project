(CNN) -- Jes Baker is cutting retailer Abercrombie & Fitch down to size.
A lot of people don't belong [in our clothes], and they can't belong.
"I challenge the separation of attractive and fat, and I assert that they are compatible regardless of what you believe," Baker, 26, wrote in a public letter addressed to the CEO.
Baker spoke to CNN about Jeffries' comments and her motivations to address them.
Jes Baker: It really wasn't upset or outrage at all.
Really, it just came because I wanted to not be angry about it.
Baker: In the body-positive world, which is still a subculture, fashion for fat people -- what they call "fatshion" -- is a really big political statement.
Baker: No, no, no.
Only in this last year have I been so dedicated to this journey of learning how to survive bad days and find wanted days.
Baker: It's wonderful.
For a lot of people, it's just a light bulb.
And once it starts, it grows.
Baker: I had never met the model until that day.
In the beginning, I was nervous, but mostly because I had never modeled with other people.
We never see this pairing; we never see a fat woman in a positive light.
