In the 1970s, I ran one of the leading entertainment business public relations firms.
Drugs and alcohol were endemic.
The house rules were "help yourself if you're here on business -- but no take-outs!"
With a career of impressive accomplishments in the rear-view mirror, I had what looked like only despair and death ahead of me.
If I once had a dream, I thought, it was long ago shattered.
I seemed to be the last one to know I was in big trouble.
When the beautiful house I so dearly loved was finally foreclosed, it was the bank that was screwing me.
And when, at last, my only friends, my drugs and alcohol turned on me, I knew it was over.
The journey was within, to at long last discover where the real problem resided.
And if you look that up in the dictionary, you'll find a photo of me.
Yes, I had long hair and a beard, the smug look of false confidence on my face and even the obligatory turquoise jewelry of that era.
I'm a recovering drug addict and alcoholic who was spared from a life of misery, incarceration and death.
I've been spared a life of darkness and shown a path into the light.
