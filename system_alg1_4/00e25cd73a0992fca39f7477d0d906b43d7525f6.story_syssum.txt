"We cannot think somebody else will take care of it," Khalil says.
Khalil started a group called I AM NOT A TOURIST.

The United Nations estimates nearly 2.5 million Syrians are seeking shelter in Lebanon and in other neighboring states, but that accounts for only registered refugees.
Her brother was heading to Beirut and asked if she had any old sweaters that he could take for a U.N. relief effort.
The note touched her boss, who called her and said he wanted to help start a campaign and that he would pay for shipping the sweaters.
One 6-year-old boy is said to have collected 600 sweaters on his own.
"When people know there's something tangible that they can do to make a difference, they'll do it," Alkadamani says.
Alkadamani visited Jordan this month, helping to hand out sweaters to refugees who were crossing the border.
Alkadamani says she wants the world to understand that "the people in those camps are just like you and me."
She says Syrian refugees are just normal people -- from doctors to pharmacists to teachers -- with normal lives before the war tore their world apart.
