NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Viewers may have to get used to a steady stream of reruns now that television and film writers have gone on strike.
"I support them," Leno said of the writers.
A last-day effort to reach a new work agreement collapsed Sunday night despite the writers conceding a demand for a doubling of how much they are paid for DVD sales.
While studios have been hoarding scripts for months in anticipation of a strike, some television shows that are more topical -- particularly late-night TV talk shows -- are expected to immediately go to reruns.
"It's affecting us in the most visible way possible," John Oliver, a writer and correspondent for "The Daily Show," told CNN on Monday as he stood amid the pickets, who carried signs that read "On Strike" and "Pencils Down."
However, he said, the writers need new contracts that incorporate new media's impact.
The union's statement early Monday morning said that while it chose to withdraw its DVD proposal -- which they say would have doubled writers' residuals -- the studios and production companies were still insisting on a framework concerning Internet distribution that "makes a mockery of any residual," the statement said.
Other rules demanded by producers would give writers no residuals when a movie is streamed online or during a "window" when online consumers have free reuse of downloads, the WGA said.
And, as video iPods and Internet downloads increasingly supplant traditional television and movie theaters, writers confront a changing industry.
A spokeswoman for the guild, Sherry Goldman, told CNN on Monday that the strike would not affect news divisions.
If the strike lingers, the WGA faces the danger of writers opting out of full membership for "financial core" status, which would allow them to return to work.
