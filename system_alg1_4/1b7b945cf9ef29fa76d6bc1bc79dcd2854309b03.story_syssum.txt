Already banned twice in his career for biting an opponent, the Uruguay striker was seemingly at it again in his country's key World Cup victory over Italy.
"Suarez is a sneak and he gets away with it because FIFA want their stars to play in the World Cup," Chiellini told Sky Sports Italia.
But Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez insists he did not see the incident when he addressed the press in his news conference.
"I didn't see that.
"There seems there is animosity against this football player," he added.
The defeat led to Italian coach Cesare Prandelli offering his resignation in his news conference after the game -- but all eyes were still on Suarez.
The following year after his move to Liverpool, Suarez was found guilty of racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra.
"Before the game people in England laughed about my attitude over the last few years," he told reporters following the game.
He was voted Player of the Year by his fellow colleagues and also named as the journalists' Player of the Year too -- awards that reflected a feeling that Suarez had put behind him his troubled past.
Meanwhile, Italy coach Prandelli says he will step down following another World Cup disappointment.
Giancarlo Abete, the president of the Italian Football Federation, also announced his resignation while stating he hoped to convince Prandelli to stay on.
Los Ticos, which won both of its previous games, will play its next game in Recife on Sunday.
