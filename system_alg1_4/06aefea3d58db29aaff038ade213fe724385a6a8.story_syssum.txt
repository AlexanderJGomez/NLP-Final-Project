Speaking at the TED Global conference, Assange said that "we are overwhelmed by our growth" and the site can't keep up with the volume of the new material because it doesn't have enough people to verify it.
Assange said at a news conference that Manning "is a political prisoner being held in the nation of Kuwait, effectively keeping him away from the press and effective legal representation."
He said WikiLeaks is providing legal assistance to Manning without saying if he was the source of the video.
The site said the video "clearly shows the unprovoked slaying of a wounded Reuters employee and his rescuers."
At the Oxford event, Assange said, "Remember the people in Baghdad, the people in Iraq, the people in Afghanistan, they don't need to see the video.
Assange said some information, including a patient's medical records, should legitimately be kept secret.
The 39-year-old Assange, who has gray hair swept back behind his ears, noted that WikiLeaks operates in several countries, including Iceland and Sweden, where, he said, laws give protection to the disclosures made on the site.
He asked the audience for a show of hands as to whether he was a hero or a "dangerous troublemaker."
