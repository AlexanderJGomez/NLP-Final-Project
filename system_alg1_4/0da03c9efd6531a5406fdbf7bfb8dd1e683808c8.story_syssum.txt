GAZA CITY, Gaza (CNN) -- Israeli forces fired on a U.N. aid convoy Thursday in Gaza, killing at least one contract worker and prompting the U.N. to halt some of its operations in Gaza, U.N. officials said.
Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council late Thursday overwhelmingly approved a resolution calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza.
Ging expressed frustration with the Israeli military, which he said cleared the convoy to travel into Gaza.
Ging said an Israeli liaison did not dispute that Israeli forces fired on the vehicle.
... You have to brace yourself for more," Ging said.
Palestinian medical sources said Thursday that 765 Palestinians have died in Gaza -- nearly 40 percent of them women and children -- since the Israeli military operation began.
More than 20 rockets were fired into Israel on Thursday, Israeli police said.
Much of the U.N.'s aid is stuck at the Kerem Shalom border crossing because the private company that drives the aid in is refusing to enter Gaza "because the situation is too dangerous," U.N. Humanitarian Affairs chief John Holmes said.
Also, Israeli armored bulldozers demolished a home in Gaza "just as the lull was supposed to go into effect," he said.
The Israeli military had no comment on the incident.
A three-hour truce on Wednesday was also marred by fighting which Israeli officials said were in retaliation for Hamas attacks on Israeli forces.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
