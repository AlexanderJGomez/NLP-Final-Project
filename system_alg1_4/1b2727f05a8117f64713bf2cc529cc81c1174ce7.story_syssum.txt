One Friday evening in 2009, NASA engineer Stephen Altemus arrived home from work feeling, well, kind of frustrated.
"That responsibility to make sure every dollar is spent exactly right within the agency sometimes causes a stifling of innovation," Altemus said.
" 'You never talk bad about NASA, Dad,' " Altemus recalled his son saying.
Monday morning at his office, Altemus made his pitch to his NASA leadership team.
"
They were in.
"
Despite a shoestring budget, Altemus' team cobbled together the parts and technology they needed.
"It was nothing like what NASA was used to."
But it resulted in an offshoot project called the Morpheus planetary lander.
It's the first NASA prototype spacecraft to be propelled using liquid oxygen and liquid methane.
"The technologies demonstrated on Morpheus are directly applicable to future robotic, and eventually human missions," Morpheus Project Manager Jon Olansen told CNN via e-mail.
Thankfully there were no injuries, but the crash "was a huge setback for the team," Altemus said.
Today, the latest version of the Morpheus lander "is a centerpiece for the agency to show what a fantastic team it is, and what incredible things can be done with just sheer willpower to imagine," said Altemus, who in 2013 ended a 25-year career at NASA to start an engineering products business based on space technology.
In fact, during the next decade, NASA plans an unprecedented mission to send astronauts to an asteroid.
Amazingly, NASA planners hope to design a robot spacecraft that would capture an asteroid and haul it into a stable orbit near the moon.
The fuel-making spacecraft would then harvest methane from the atmosphere, said Altemus.
Human space exploration is "part of our DNA," said Altemus.
We as human beings will find a way to strive to create, to invent.
