Blogger Nay Phone Latt was sentenced to more than 20 years in jail for his illegal Internet activities, the court official said.
The blogger was a "major source of information for the outside world" when the military junta used force last year to suppress anti-government demonstrations, said The Irrawaddy, an online newspaper published by exiles from Myanmar, which is also known as Burma.
Irrawaddy said the members were each sentenced to 65 years in jail, but CNN could not independently confirm the figure.
Until then, demonstrations led by the monks -- who are highly respected in the predominantly Buddhist country -- had gone largely unchallenged by the military, which has ruled the country since the 1960s.
