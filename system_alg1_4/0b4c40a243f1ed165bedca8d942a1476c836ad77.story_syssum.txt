(CNN)  -- A woman who said she had a mother-daughter relationship with slain model Jasmine Fiore told CNN's Larry King on Thursday night that Fiore never informed her that she had been married.
The marriage reportedly was annulled a few weeks after their Las Vegas, Nevada, wedding.
Interviewed from San Francisco, California, Beauregard told King all she knew about Jenkins was his initial meeting with Fiore.
Beauregard told King she's never met Ryan Jenkins.
That's, of course, where Britney Spears got married," Fleeman told King.
We today talked to somebody who was at the wedding.
And the marriage had a lot of problems almost from the very beginning," Fleeman said.
Criminal profiler Pat Brown told Larry King that act provided key crucial evidence early in the investigation.
I knew it was somebody who knew her and [that her killer] wanted to make sure that she was not identified," Brown said.
She said he's a manipulator.
He is.
It's just not right."
Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said on "Larry King Live" that Jenkins is the only suspect.
And he's certainly dangerous because he's desperate," Rackauckas said.
