When asked when the ship might have been looted, Clifford said he didn't know.
"I'm not looking for money," Clifford said.
Adviser Damian Merlo said in an e-mail that officials did not know whether the wreck was indeed the Santa Maria.
Two years ago, after having researched the type of cannon used in Columbus' time, "I woke up in the middle of the night and said, 'Oh, my God,' " Clifford said.
But some items, including the cannon, had been looted from the ship in the intervening years, Clifford said.
The ship was found in the exact area where Columbus said the Santa Maria ran aground more than 500 years ago, Clifford said.
Among the islands on which Columbus set foot was Hispaniola, which is divided between Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
Columbus set off back to Spain with the two remaining ships, the Nina and the Pinta, in January 1493.
