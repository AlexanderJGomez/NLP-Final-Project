(CNN) -- Hey Mars!
Now that the Mars rover Curiosity is safely parked, NASA's unmanned planet crawler appears ready to roll.
What can Mars tell us about our own planet?
Who will pay for the first manned mission to Mars?
In 1997, a smaller NASA robot on Mars -- Sojourner -- lit up the Web.
The little rover found clues suggesting that Mars once had a thicker atmosphere and liquid water.
Curiosity "is just another box with wheels on Mars," says CNN commenter It_could_always_be_worse.

Seriously, no matter how successful unmanned missions might be, robots will never replace the need for human space exploration, says Bell.
In a sense, Curiosity is performing a scouting mission for a manned U.S. mission to Mars that President Barack Obama predicts will happen in his lifetime.
Putting a monetary value on space exploration is impossible, experts say, because there are too many unanswered questions, such as whether Mars, the moon or asteroids hold precious minerals, water and cheap energy resources that could be mined and brought back to Earth.
Scientists want to know what Mars can tell us about our own planet's climate and geology.
These stories become part of part of our culture, part of our heritage, part of our shared need to explore the worlds around us.
In 2017, NASA plans to launch Orion with a new heavy-lift rocket NASA calls the Space Launch System.
Or how would it develop an astronaut habitat suitable for the months it would take to travel to Mars or to asteroids?
For perspective, the Mars rover's $2.6 billion price tag equals about 14.7% of NASA's proposed 2013 budget.
"Humans are going to live on Mars in the president's expected lifetime," says commercial space consultant Charles Miller, a former NASA executive.
Do you think astronauts will set foot on Mars within your lifetime?
