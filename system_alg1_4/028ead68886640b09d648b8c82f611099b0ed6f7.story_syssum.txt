A Wesleyan University student who says she was raped in front of onlookers at a "wildly out of control" campus fraternity party has filed a lawsuit against Xi Chapter of Psi Upsilon, 11 of its members and the alleged assailant, according to court documents.
Wesleyan public safety officers then took her to a nearby hospital, where a diagnosis of sexual assault was documented, the lawsuit says.
"Psi Upsilon Fraternity takes all reports of risk management violations, especially those with regard to sexual assault, very seriously," Tom Fox, executive director of Psi Upsilon Fraternity, said on the fraternity's website.
Middletown police confirmed that they responded to a sexual assault complaint from the Psi Upsilon Fraternity house on May 4, 2013, spokeswoman Lt. Heather Desmond said.
Chamberlin's lawyer, Douglas Fierberg, said that because the fraternity sets itself apart from the university, officers from the university's Department of Public Safety can enter the fraternity only in "exigent circumstances" or when specifically asked to come in.
And this victim will hold the fraternity responsible for its tradition of dangerous mismanagement."
Wesleyan University was not named in the lawsuit.
Chamberlin has taken a leave of absence from the university since the attack and is receiving "intensive counseling, trying to pull her life together," her lawyer said.
In 2012, a Wesleyan student sued the university and another fraternity, which Wesleyan no longer recognizes as a student organization, after she said she was raped in its frat house two years before.
