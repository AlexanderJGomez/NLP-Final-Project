(CNN) -- Mourners flooded social media with messages of grief following the death of Brittany Maynard, who took her own life Saturday in the face of a debilitating brain cancer.
Maggie Karner, a woman with the same brain cancer, posted an October 29 open letter to Maynard on YouTube.
Karner compared Maynard to someone standing on a ledge, threatening to jump.
In an article published October 10 on the Federalist website, Karner wrote that Maynard may have wanted to control when she died but "As for my cancer journey, circumstances out of my control are not the worst thing that can happen to me.
"My question is: Who has the right to tell me that I don't deserve this choice?
"It is people who pause to appreciate life and give thanks who are happiest," she wrote in her final message.
People who voiced opposition to assisted suicide often gave religious reasons.
"Suicide has been an answer to some in my situation," Couvrette wrote.
Another Reddit poster questioned the use of the word "brave" to describe Maynard.
In the Twitterverse, two posters were less ambivalent: "Any way you look at it, suicide is wrong because it does not end suffering, it ends hope," tweeted ZEFFeREEN .
Lisa Moreno of Fayetteville, North Carolina, posted a goodbye to Maynard on her obit guest book page.
