Michael Sam, an All-American defensive lineman from the University of Missouri, publicly revealed that he's gay Sunday, creating the possibility he'll be the first openly gay player drafted by the National Football League.
"I understand how big this is," Sam said in the ESPN interview.
I want to be a football player in the NFL."
With those credentials, he's expected to be picked in the NFL draft in May.
His agent said Monday that he does not think Sam's decision to acknowledge his sexual orientation will hurt his draft prospects.
Michael is a football player.
Last year, a University of Colorado player said an NFL team asked him if he liked girls and had a girlfriend.
GLAAD, a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender media advocacy group, said Sam is  "the latest high-profile athlete to come out as LGBT.
Sam's head football coach at Missouri, Gary Pinkel, said: "We're really happy for Michael that he's made the decision to announce this, and we're proud of him and how he represents Mizzou.
GLAAD President Sarah Kate Ellis said in a prepared statement: "By rewriting the script for countless young athletes, Michael has demonstrated the leadership that, along with his impressive skills on the field, makes him a natural fit for the NFL.
