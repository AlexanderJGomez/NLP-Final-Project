(CNN) -- Legendary and now disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong told Oprah Winfrey during a confessional interview that he hopes to compete again.
When asked whether he felt disgraced, Armstrong said that he did.
This is ugly stuff," he said during the second part of the interview.
"I deserve to be punished," Armstrong told Winfrey.
Armstrong, in the first part of the interview, talked about the culture of cycling at the time he competed, telling Winfrey that doping was widespread then and just as much "part of the job" as water bottles and tire pumps.
That moment, he said, was his most humbling.
Appearing to hold back tears, Armstrong said he confessed to the three oldest children over the recent holiday break.
But Armstrong was not telling the whole story, author David Coyle, who wrote a book about doping and the Tour de France, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Thursday night.
We're flying to Valencia to do a blood transfusion.
That's what happens," Coyle said.
Former cyclist Tyler Hamilton, who raced as a teammate of Armstrong from 1998 to 2001, said it was nice to hear Armstrong own up to some of his faults.
"There are many more steps to come for Lance Armstrong."
The International Cycling Union called it "disturbing" to see Armstrong's confessions, but it said the sport is much different today than it was 10 years ago.
But he carried it with him into his sports career, "and that's bad," he said.
"We wouldn't be sitting here if I didn't come back," he told Winfrey.
In 2011, Armstrong retired once more from cycling.
They include Betsy Andreu, wife of fellow cyclist Frankie Andreu, who said she overheard Armstrong acknowledge to a doctor treating him for cancer in 1996 that he had used performance-enhancing drugs.
He owed it to me.
