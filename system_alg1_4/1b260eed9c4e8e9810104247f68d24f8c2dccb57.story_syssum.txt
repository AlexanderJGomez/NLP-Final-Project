From the perspective of people theoretically standing on Jupiter, it would be like three solar eclipses happening at once, astronomers said.
In the last 15 years, this has happened only twice, the Space Telescope Science Institute said.
"We felt that there are images which have aesthetic value above and beyond their scientific value," said astronomer Zolt Levy.
It has many satellites, including 62 moons, and they swarm around the planet with many of them crossing the surface facing Earth constantly.
The four moons are called the Galilean satellites, because Renaissance astronomer Galileo Galilei discovered them in 1610, when he pointed his telescope skyward, forever changing human perception of our place in the cosmos.
The moons spin around Jupiter at different speeds; their orbits vary in duration from two to 17 days, so having them line up together to zip across the side of Jupiter pointed our way is special.
If it is found there, this would be the first discovery of life in our solar system aside from that on Earth.
