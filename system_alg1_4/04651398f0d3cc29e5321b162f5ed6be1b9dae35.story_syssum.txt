Beijing (CNN) -- A goodwill basketball game between a U.S. college and a Chinese military team turned into an ugly brawl, leaving a black-eye on sports diplomacy.
A day earlier, Biden watched another exhibition game between the Hoyas and another Chinese team.
Few mainstream Chinese media reported the Thursday fracas.
The Bayi Rockets is an army team that plays in the China Basketball Association, the local professional league.
The brawl drew comments on Chinese social media, with links to video posted on Chinese websites.
In recent years, however, competition for prizes, honor and fame have sometimes trumped sportsmanship.
In October, an exhibition match between China and Brazil national teams ended in a bench-clearing fistfight.
