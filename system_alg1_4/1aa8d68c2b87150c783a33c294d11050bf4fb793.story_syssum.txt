Robert was 15 when his brother, Edwin, left home at age 18.
"He was in love and ran away."
"Every time they said they saw him it went nowhere.

Weston had identification documents for about 50 people with her when she was arrested, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said.

They (the defendants) all deserve life in prison."
