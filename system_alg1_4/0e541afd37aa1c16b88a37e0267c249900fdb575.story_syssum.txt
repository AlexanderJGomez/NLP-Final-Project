(CNN) -- Canadian explorer Adam Shoalts knew he was heading into uncharted territory when he set out on a solo expedition to explore northeastern Canada's remote Again River.
Even Google Earth's low-resolution satellite imagery, all that's available for this remote part of Canada, is deficient for detecting waterfalls.
With the support of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society, Shoalts conducted two reconnaissance expeditions to the area (one in 2008 and another in 2009), exploring the wilderness around the Again River.
"In August 2012, I went back, this time alone, determined to canoe the river no matter what," he says.
"My first thought when I realized I was being swept over a waterfall was, 'Wow!
He resurfaced, out of breath, and spotted his canoe upside down in an eddy near the riverbank.
This week, Shoalts is heading back to the Again River to continue his work for the Royal Canadian Geographical Society (RCGS).
"This expedition is geographical exploration in the truest sense: Shoalts's work will change the map of Canada -- a rarity in 21st century exploration," says the RCGS.
Though Shoalts says gadgets are useful in the field, it's important not to rely on them completely.
For those with their own Magellan dreams, it's not too late to get into the game, says Shoalts.
