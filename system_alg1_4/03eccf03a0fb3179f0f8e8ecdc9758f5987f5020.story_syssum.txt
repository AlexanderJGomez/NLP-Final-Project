(CNN) -- Amir Khan is a rare thing in sport: A world champion boxer who still lives with his parents and a prominent Muslim who is not afraid to address the image of Islam today.
Amir Khan: It feels like home, even when I step in the ring.
It just feels so comfortable.
I like to entertain when I'm in the boxing ring; I like to show speed, power and explosiveness.
It's like when I'm in the gym I'm 100 percent there ... it's like autopilot, I'm just doing it, man, my body's just making me do whatever.
AK: Being a Muslim and being a Pakistani a lot of people are going to bring that issue up.
I know I'm not on my own, I've got God on my side as well, God's helping me, God's going to give me that inner strength to go in there and win the fight.
Boxing in the ring is a lonely place, it's just you and your opponent, no one else, so you know spiritually when you have that help it makes a massive difference.
AK: It's nice, I think I'm probably the only Asian Muslim role model in Britain, there's no other Muslim, Pakistani, Indian or whatever role model in the country ... that does put pressure on you but I'm only doing what I love to do.
I never look down on anyone and I'll always speak to people, I've got time for my fans ... even if I have to go out of my way to do it, I'll take a picture, and I've been doing that and maybe that's the reason that God gives me so much -- and has given me so much -- success.
