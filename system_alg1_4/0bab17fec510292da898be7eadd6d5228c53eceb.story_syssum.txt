London (CNN) -- The widow of poisoned Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko asserted Tuesday that only a public inquiry will bring her justice in the death of her husband.
A public inquiry is a different proceeding that would "enable the fullest possible investigation" into Alexander Litvinenko's death and, unlike an inquest, can receive evidence behind closed doors, the coroner said during Tuesday's hearing.
Marina Litvinenko's lawyer, Ben Emmerson, said during Tuesday's hearing the widow would be unable to play a role in an ongoing proceedings if the government refused the coroner's request.
Emmerson charged Tuesday that a foreign office minister made what he said was an "improper approach" to Litvinenko's widow while British Prime Minister David Cameron and Putin met in Sochi, Russia, last month.
Garnham said nothing improper occurred.
In that hearing, Emmerson said Litvinenko was working for the British intelligence service MI6 and had been tasked by MI6 with working also for the Spanish intelligence service as it investigated Russian mafia activities in Spain.
The men were both to provide intelligence to the Spanish prosecutor investigating Russian mafia links to the Kremlin and to Putin, Emmerson said.
Berezovsky also blamed the Kremlin for the death of Litvinenko.
"In effect they used a ... radioactive weapon, a weapon of terror against a British citizen in broad daylight in the streets of London endangering lots of other people," Lucas said.
What we do know is that the British government doesn't want to get into detail about how they know about it, and that to me suggests that they were tapping Russian phones, reading Russian diplomatic communications, bugging Russian officers."
