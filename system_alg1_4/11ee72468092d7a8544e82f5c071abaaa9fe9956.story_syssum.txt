And earlier Monday a suicide bomber struck Pakistan's military headquarters in Rawalpindi Monday, killing at least eight people, including the army's top ranking medical officer and himself, military officials said.
The non-governmental organization, Plan, said that at around 4:15 p.m. up to a dozen men carrying guns and grenades entered the office in Mansehra, in the North West Frontier Province -- Pakistan's lawless tribal region bordering Afghanistan.
The fire destroyed the building.
Slater said 21 full-time and seven part-time employees work at the office, though it's unclear how many were present at the time of the attack.
At least 20 others were wounded in the Rawalpindi suicide bombing which happened along Mall Road, a heavily traveled thoroughfare in Rawalpindi, according to Pakistani officials.
It has, in recent months, experienced several suicide bomb attacks -- including the recent assassination of Benazir Bhutto.
In early February, a suicide bomber rammed his motorcycle into a van carrying army medics, killing at least four people.
Two months before Bhutto's assassination, a suicide bomber detonated an explosive near the army headquarters -- which houses President Pervez Musharraf's office -- killing six people and wounding 10 others.
One attack targeted a bus carrying government employees.
The other involved a suicide bomber who crashed his motorcycle into cars.
