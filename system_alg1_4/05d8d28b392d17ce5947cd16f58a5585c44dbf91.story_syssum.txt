Cesar Gaviria highlighted the problems Mexico is facing handling its drug problem.
In a wide ranging interview, Gaviria said the United States now has more people in jail for narco-trafficking or related crimes than there are prisoners in the whole of Europe.
Gaviria said it's time the United States changed its approach.
"The Mexicans probably in a few years will be able to deal a little better with the problems of security," he said.
