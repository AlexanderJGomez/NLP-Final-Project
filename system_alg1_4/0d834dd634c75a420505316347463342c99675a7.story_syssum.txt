Brazil celebrated a third Confederations Cup triumph following victories in 2005 and 1997.
But Bob Bradley's U.S. team, beaten 3-0 by Brazil in the group stage, took a shock lead when Dempsey found space in the penalty area to guide home Jonathan Spector's fierce right-wing cross for his third goal of the tournament.
Howard then saved a low angled shot from Fabiano, then the Sevilla forward headed over the bar 10 minutes before the interval.
But Fabiano struck a killer blow soon after the restart when otherwise-impressive U.S. defender Jay DeMerit allowed him to collect Kaka's pass inside the penalty area and swivel to fire past a helpless Howard.
With the Americans visibly tiring, it was no surprise when Brazil claimed the winner.
Coach Dunga has now presided over seven wins in 20 days, with five at the Confederations Cup and two in World Cup qualifiers.
