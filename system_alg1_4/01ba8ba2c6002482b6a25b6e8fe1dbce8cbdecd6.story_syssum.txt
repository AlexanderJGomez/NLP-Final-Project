The stakes are high in the first debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney, set for Wednesday night in Denver.
As New Jersey Gov.
Presidential debates can make a difference.
"The debate appears to have made Republicans more enthusiastic about voting while turning some Democrats away from the polls," according to a CNN poll at the time.
Maher and SNL can poke fun at the undecided voters, but these people matter -- especially in a tight race like the one between Obama and Romney -- since they make up a small but solid percentage of the electorate.
What about the last presidential election?
In 2008, 72% of voters said they were satisfied with the choices, perhaps because both Barack Obama and Sarah Palin were dynamic.
CNN's Halimah Abdullah took a look at these "slivers" of voters.
Like the unsatisfied voters, there is a group of voters who haven't started to pay attention to the race.
In the 2004 election, which at first looked like a big Bush victory before the debates in the last month, 10% of voters said they decided in the final 30 days, and Kerry captured 54% to Bush's 44% of this group.
Among Obama supporters, 26% of likely voters "moderately" support him while 30% of registered voters "moderately" support him.
In a race that involves both rallying the base and attracting independents, especially in the swing states, turning moderate support to strong support as well as registered voters to likely voters can be a key to victory.
Certainly, Romney's victory in the primary was one.
Back in late February was the "season finale" of the primary debates, which in retrospect seemed like the ultimate reality show with more twists and turns than a "Real Housewives" reunion.
Now we get the season premiere of the general election debates with four highly anticipated episodes before the 2012 series finale.
