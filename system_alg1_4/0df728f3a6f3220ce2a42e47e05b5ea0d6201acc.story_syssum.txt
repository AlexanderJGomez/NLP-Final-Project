Looking to lead from start to finish, McIlroy endured a wayward final round 74 but after brilliantly scrambling a par three on the 15th still held the lead at 10-under-par.
He failed to get down in two shots and with Knox and Palmer also having to settle for par fives, it left Henley a short putt to seal his second PGA Tour victory with a birdie four.
Henley, who had chipped in to join McIlroy at 10-under on the 14th, made a hash of the short 15th himself, finding the water with his tee shot to make a double bogey.
Earlier, world number one Tiger Woods was forced to withdraw during the final round with a back injury.
Woods, who has endured a difficult start to the year, shot a third round 65, but was five-over through 13 holes when he left the course.
