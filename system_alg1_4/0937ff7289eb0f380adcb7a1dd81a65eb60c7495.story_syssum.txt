Nine other countries, together accounting for more than half the euro area's GDP, were downgraded at least one notch.
One could be tempted, following the downgrades, to conclude that most euro countries just cannot get their fiscal houses in order.
The motivation for the downgrades given by Standard & Poor's actually cites the excessive attention given to fiscal austerity as one principal reason for the downgrading of a whole swath of euroland.
The answer is surely no.
This is because euro area savers are usually loath to invest in foreign currency; and most regulated intermediaries such as investment fund have little choice but to invest in government securities in euro.
One major problem is Europe's regional split of savings habits.
The collection of savings within national pools means the capital markets have ceased to function in the euro area.
The ECB cannot single-handedly substitute for all private cross border lending.
The fiscal compact might be useful to prevent the next crisis a generation down the road, but this will not be very useful if the euro does not survive the present one.
