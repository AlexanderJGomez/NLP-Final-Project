Federer recorded the second double bagel of his career when he defeated wildcard Mischa Zverev 6-0 6-0 on Friday to reach the semifinals of a Wimbledon warm-up in Halle, Germany.
He lost to Tomas Berdych in the U.S. Open quarterfinals last September, Andy Murray in January's Australian Open semifinals and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in this month's French Open quarterfinals.
Haas and Federer, good friends, played doubles together this week in Halle.
French second-seed Richard Gasquet topped Mayer 6-3 7-6 (4) and Russian Mikhail Youzhny beat Kohlschreiber, the 2011 champion, 6-3 6-2.
"I thought the first set was good, and then he started playing much better in the second," Murray said in a televised interview.
While Federer tries for an eighth success at Wimbledon, Murray will attempt to end a 77-year British men's singles drought at the All England Club.
Del Potro, still learning the finer points of playing on grass, missed the French Open due to illness.
As in Halle a back-to-back winner remains a possibility because Croatian Marin Cilic, the fifth seed, edged Berdych 7-5 7-6 (4).
