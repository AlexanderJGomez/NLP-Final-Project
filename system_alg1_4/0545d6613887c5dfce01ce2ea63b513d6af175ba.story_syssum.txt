It's not like Aasif didn't know anything about being a Muslim before he was hired by "The Daily Show" in 2006.
Jon Stewart made Aasif more Muslim-ish.
(Okay, it's an O'Doul's ... and it's turkey bacon, but you get the point.)
It's not like Jon Stewart intentionally wanted us to become more Muslim.
You can read all about the experiences in hilarious detail in Aasif's new book of personal essays titled, "No Land's Man."
Another time the show created a parody sitcom of "The Cosby Show" titled, "The Q'usoby Show," about an All-American Muslim family.
These Daily Show experiences "radicalized" Aasif, turning him into, as he calls himself in the book, "the jihadist of irony."
Stewart being in this film was a big deal.
Stewart called Aasif on the phone -- which was the first time Jon ever had called him -- and asked, "How would you feel about talking about the issue on the show as Muslim?
But right now you're all we've got."
That is what Stewart did to us.
