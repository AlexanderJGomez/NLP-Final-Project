"Any weapon we had against IEDs, [improvised explosive devices] was utilized including jamming technology," said Jason Spencer, 29, an Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, engineer who served with the Army in Iraq in 2005.
"The sophistication of IEDs definitely increased during my time in Iraq," said Spencer.
Jamming devices, known as Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device Electronic Warfare, or CREW systems, attempt to intercept or block a signal before it reaches its intended target, preventing detonation.
These technologies represent the last line of defense, Marks said.
IEDs are the No.
"We dealt with hundreds of IEDs while in theater," said Spencer.

U.S. forces are dealing with an adaptive, innovative and flexible enemy, according to the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization, or JIEDDO, which is leading the counter-IED effort for the military.
As insurgents modify their devices to outwit the military, the military in turn adapts its own jamming technologies.
It's capable of jamming most radio-controlled IEDs, according to the Pentagon.
One in six IEDs causes casualties in Iraq, JIEDDO reports.
JIEDDO said it is aggressively going after the bomb makers, working to destroy their networks.
"The best way to counter the IED threat is through understanding the network that allows an IED to even be assembled," said Marks, who supports JIEDDO's work.
