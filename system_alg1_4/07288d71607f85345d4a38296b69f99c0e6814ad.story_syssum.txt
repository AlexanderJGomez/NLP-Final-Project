"22 Jump Street" was the big winner, grossing an estimated $60 million its opening frame—a massive 65% higher than the original's $36.3 million in 2012.
In third place "Maleficent" only fell 45% despite the arrival of the dragons.
That puts its two-week total at an estimated $56.6 million.
It earned an estimated $15.7 million for a 10-day total of $81.7 million.
22 Jump Street — $60 million
How to Train Your Dragon 2 — $50 million
The Fault in Our Stars — $15.7 million
Despite this being only the fourth time the box office has had two films grossing more than $50 million in their debuts, the overall yield was down 7% compared to the same weekend last year, when Man of Steel had a $116.6M debut and This is the End bowed to $20.7M.
