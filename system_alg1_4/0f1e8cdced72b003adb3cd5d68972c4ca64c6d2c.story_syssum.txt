CDC quarantine officers met the plane after one of the 255 passengers was vomiting on the flight, officials said.
Passengers said it took another two hours to clear customs and retrieve their luggage.
"The symptoms of one individual were found to be consistent with another, minor treatable condition unrelated to Ebola," the health department said.
CDC officials removed the man and his daughter while other passengers remained on board.
Dumas said the response was standard procedure with sick passengers, but it was unclear how long the protocol has been in place.
"He nudged me and asked me to get the flight attendant," Burchett said.
According to Burchett, a flight attendant asked the man where he was traveling from.
"Immediately they both left and some time passed and they came back and asked him for his name," Burchett said of the flight attendants.
The plane landed about an hour and a half later.
Nearly two hours after the flight landed, Burchett said, an announcement was made: "Everyone can leave.
"We did get an announcement from a representative of the CDC that we were held as an abundance of caution," Burchett said.
I hope we learn from it."
Costa said he had spoken with the man and his daughter before the flight left Liberia.
In a statement this week, the CDC said quarantine inspectors meet arriving aircraft and ships reporting ill passengers or crew to assist them in getting appropriate medical treatment.
"If the flight crew of a commercial aircraft arriving in the U.S. becomes aware of an ill person on board which may include a person with Ebola symptoms, the captain is required required by law ... to report the illness to the nearest U.S. Quarantine Station, who will arrange the appropriate medical response at the flight's destination airport," the statement said.
