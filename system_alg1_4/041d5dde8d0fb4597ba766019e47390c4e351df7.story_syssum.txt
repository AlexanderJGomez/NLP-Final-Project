Given what Underwood did in the first season of the show, probably more than anybody anticipates.
As the second season begins, Kevin Spacey's Underwood reveals that the vice presidency won't change his cold, pragmatic cardiac muscle.
It's a long way from the beginning of the first season, when Underwood was denied his desired job as secretary of state.
In an interview last fall with CNN, showrunner Beau Willimon explained that Underwood, at heart, is "an optimist," though he understands the darker view.
Willimon added that "House of Cards" isn't necessarily a show about politics, despite its Washington setting.
Naturally, Willimon and his stars have been tight-lipped about how far Underwood will take things in a show The Kansas City Star nicknamed "Mr. Macbeth Goes to Washington."
A New York Times Magazine profile of Willimon mentioned a "super-duper-double-major spoiler."
And Underwood appears headed for a showdown with wealthy industrialist -- and fellow power broker -- Raymond Tusk (Gerald McRaney), a friend of the president.
However the second season concludes, "House of Cards" has already been a winner.
In the meantime, one can only wonder whether a better Shakespearean parallel for Underwood is "Othello's" Iago, dropping poisoned hints in the president's ear.
"There are people who don't like the level of darkness, who find the characters unsympathetic," he told the Times Magazine.
