Austin, Texas (CNN) -- Most Americans are probably familiar with the T-Shirt slogan "Keep Austin Weird."
Yet, on Christmas Day, at the downtown Alamo Drafthouse Cinema at the corner of East Sixth and Trinity, vintage Austin weirdness came roaring back courtesy of the banned-in-Pyongyang film comedy, "The Interview," starring Seth Rogen and James Franco.
Determined to put the weird back into Austin's civic spirit, League spoofed North Korea's damaging cyberattack against Sony with Comedy Central aplomb.
After this perverse round of karaoke, the main feature began, and League watched the controversial film from the aisle.
"The song is the most over-the-top patriotic song I know," League later told me.
In the days before Christmas, League networked with fellow members of Art House Convergence, an association of independent theater owners.
"I was disappointed that Sony stepped back," he admits, but was pleased the company "regrouped" in time for Christmas Day.
When I spoke with League he was beaming yuletide happiness, drinking a can of Four Loko (an energy-alcoholic beverage he calls the "perfect Christmas drink").
"I'm no stranger to wearing costumes or being patriotic," League says.
Only instead of marijuana the smell of wings, popcorn and fried pickles filled the air.
Off-duty Austin police officers, full of holiday cheer, served as security for the showing.
In its own weird way, Austin did America proud.
