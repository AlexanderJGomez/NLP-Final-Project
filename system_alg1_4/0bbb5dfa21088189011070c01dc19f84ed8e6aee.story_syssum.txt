Her lawyer worked out a deal with the prosecutor Monday morning in which Witherspoon will go through a pre-trial intervention program to avoid getting a conviction on her record, an Atlanta Municipal Court spokesman said.
While the court's program may be relatively painless, Witherspoon is suffering from another punishment:  public humiliation.
"Mrs. Witherspoon began to hang out the window and say that she did not believe that I was a real police officer," Pyland wrote.
When the trooper warned her again, Witherspoon allegedly told him she was a U.S. citizen and allowed to "stand on American ground."
the trooper recalled Witherspoon asking him.
"You're about to find out who I am," she replied, the arrest report said.
Their car was impounded, and Witherspoon and Toth were taken to the Atlanta city jail, the report said.
Having had time to sober up, Witherspoon apologized profusely for her behavior.
I was disrespectful to the officer who was just doing his job.
