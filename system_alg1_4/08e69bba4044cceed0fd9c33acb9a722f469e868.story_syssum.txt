Most forecast maps show Hurricane Bill passing to the west of Bermuda.
ET, Bill's center was about 335 miles northeast of the Leeward Islands and about 970 miles south-southeast of Bermuda, the hurricane center said.
Other models show Bill turning more sharply out to sea and not affecting any areas, he said.
"Bill is a large tropical cyclone," the National Hurricane Center said.
