He said many of the surfers off Malibu Surfrider Beach were not used to waves as big as the ones this week.
"You gotta have your respect for the ocean," Hamilton said.
"There is the potential for damaging and life threatening surf," says the National Weather Service, which predicts waves breaking at heights of 10 to 15 feet.

"But the real threat is the surfboards," said Bo Bridges, a surfer who cut short a vacation in Colorado to catch these "epic" waves.
The closest it will come to the state is 800 miles away on Thursday, he said.

Surf forecasters have broken down the height of the surf by time of day and particular beach.
