WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Federal and state health officials said Monday that salmonella linked last week in Minnesota to King Nut peanut butter was caused by the same strain of bacteria responsible for an ongoing outbreak of 410 salmonella cases in 43 states.
A spokesman for the Food and Drug Administration said Monday that the agency has been collaborating with the CDC, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and public health officials in many states to investigate the outbreak of infections due to Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium.
The Minnesota bacteria were linked last week to institutionally distributed peanut butter, sold under the King Nut brand name.
Late last week, King Nut Companies, based in Ohio, recalled King Nut peanut butter.
"King Nut took this action as soon as it was informed that salmonella had been found in an open five-pound tub of King Nut peanut butter," the company said Saturday in a posting on its Web site.
The first cases nationwide were reported September 3, but most occurred between October 1 and December 31, the CDC said last week.
Strains of salmonella linked to outbreaks in the past have been traced to contaminated eggs, meat, poultry, vegetables, pet food and peanut butter.
Most people infected develop diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps within a few days of infection and the illness can last up to a week.
Children, senior citizens, people with chronic illnesses and those with weak immune systems tend to be at highest risk for complications, according to the National Institutes of Health.
