(CNN) -- Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wants a mandate.
Abe put economic rejuvenation at the top of his policy agenda, seeking to end two-plus "lost decades" to both consolidate political support and, perhaps even more significantly, to provide the foundation for a more robust international role.
Abe traveled the globe, offering political and financial support to diplomatic partners and reasserting Japanese national interests.
The economic woes mean Abe can't buy support for the rest of his agenda; in fact, public complaints about the Abe administration are increasing.
And for all the talk of Japan's turn to the right -- Abe is a conservative nationalist -- the Prime Minister is not representative of his country or his party.
Why?
Not surprisingly, support for the DPJ, still the largest opposition party, today hovers around 10%; 37% of voters say they will back the LDP in this month's vote.
The LDP is such a party.
This is how Abe and company, despite increasing unpopularity, increase seats in an election.
They also fear that Abe will instead focus on foreign policy and press the more controversial elements of his national security agenda.
If he does, the Prime Minister will simply end up undermining whatever mandate he will claim after this week's ballot.
