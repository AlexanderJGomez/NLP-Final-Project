(CNN) -- With President Barack Obama's approval rating hovering in the low to mid-40s -- it was 45% in CNN/ORC International's recent poll --Democrats in tough contests are largely keeping their distance from the president's tarnished reputation.
As the Democrat challenging the Senate's top Republican in a state that voted for Mitt Romney two years ago, Grimes has been perhaps the most high-profile candidate to keep her distance from Obama.
Sen. Mark Begich, Alaska.
Only 41% of Alaska voters sided with Obama in 2012, so Begich knows all too well that it's not a smart strategy to be a champion for the president.
And earlier this year he told CNN that he doesn't need Obama to campaign for him in Alaska.
Sen. Mark Udall, Colorado.
The episode was foreshadowed somewhat when Udall refused to answer questions from CNN's Dana Bash earlier this year over whether he'd want to campaign with Obama.
Sen. Kay Hagan, North Carolina.
Last week she reluctantly admitted that the president hasn't shown strong leadership.

Last year Landrieu declined to attend a visit by Obama to her state, though she still hitched a ride aboard Air Force One with the President on his way to Louisiana.
"I don't think it makes sense for the president to come to New Hampshire," she continued, while answering the question at the CNN/NH1 debate last week.

Like other vulnerable Senate candidates -- such as Shaheen, Udall and Hagan -- Pryor has also called for travel restrictions to help prevent Ebola from spreading to the United States, a policy the Obama administration has not pushed.
