The passengers -- who did not know each other before the Monday flight from West Palm Beach, Florida, to White Plains, New York, but were seated in the same section of the plane -- say the incident started during boarding when a male flight attendant began roughly handling bags in the overhead bin.
The passengers said the flight attendant then began to get angry and told them to leave the plane, according to WPTV.
And he said, 'Throw her off, too,' " Karyn Schorr told WPTV.
"We always prefer that a passenger walk away with a positive experience when flying our airline; we regret that didn't happen in this scenario.
As we often do in these situations, we will take this opportunity to review the reports and take away any key learnings that we might uncover."
