Slammed by top U.S. government officials and facing espionage charges in the United States, former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden defended his decision to leak documents about classified surveillance programs during an interview with NBC "Nightly News" broadcast Wednesday.
Speaking to anchor Brian Williams in a Moscow hotel, Snowden said he considers himself a patriot, and he wouldn't have gone to such lengths to reveal secret U.S. government surveillance programs if he didn't have to.
Snowden has been living for nearly a year in Russia, where the government has granted him temporary asylum.
"I have no relationship with the Russian government at all," he told NBC.

Snowden said he would eventually like to return to the United States.

In another excerpt from the interview, Snowden sought to bolster his credentials, arguing that the U.S. government has tried to downplay his skills and work experience.

"I've worked for the National Security Agency, undercover, overseas.
But civil libertarians, technology companies and others oppose it, noting the lack of transparency.
