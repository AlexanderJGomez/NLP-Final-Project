(CNN) -- Prince Albert of Monaco will tie the knot to former South African Olympic swimmer Charlene Wittstock next July, the palace announced Thursday.
"There have been some relationships where, had they gone on a little bit more, they would have headed that way," Albert said.
Albert has two sisters, Princesses Caroline and Stephanie.
Albert was formally invested as Monaco's ruler following the death of his father in 2005.
It has a population of about 33,000 people.
