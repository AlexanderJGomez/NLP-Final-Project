(CNN) -- Three of the best-loved leaders in the history of the Roman Catholic church will be united this weekend when Pope Francis makes his predecessors, Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II, saints in a special ceremony in St Peter's Square.
Vatican analyst Robert Mickens says the pair's poor backgrounds gave them a "pastoral sense" which was key to their success in the church -- and which goes some way to explaining their huge popularity.
John XXIII, already 76 when he was elected pope after a long career as a priest, professor and Vatican diplomat, had been expected to serve merely as a "papa di passaggio," or interim, caretaker Pope.

Experts say that in recognizing the two men together, Francis may be looking to heal a long-term rift in the church, dating back to Vatican II, that ground-breaking conference of church leaders set up by John XXIII.
Karol Wojtyla -- who was to become John Paul II, but back then was simply a young bishop -- was at those meetings.
Cardinal Paul Poupard, former president of the Pontifical Council for Inter-religious Dialogue, who knew both men, says Pope Francis is hoping to repair that rift by canonizing the two men who have come to represent the two opposing views.
