Alabama was the hardest-hit state, and Tuscaloosa was the bull's-eye of the storm.
The storm cut a six-mile-long path through the city, destroying or damaging about 12% of it, Tuscaloosa officials say.

"As bad as disasters are, a lot of people benefit from them, from easier loans, lower loans and stuff like that," Smith said.
"The message is this: We are coming back," Tuscaloosa County Probate Judge Hardy McCollum said during the Friday ceremony.
"As we observe today's anniversary, let us look ahead to the work that remains to be done for the people of Alabama," he said.
