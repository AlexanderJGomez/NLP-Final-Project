It was touch and go whether one of the Saudi women, Shaherkani, would even participate this year when the president of the International Federation of Judo said women wearing headscarves would not be allowed to compete for fear of choking and injury.
The presence of Saudi women is the result of several months of pressure by the International Olympics Committee on Saudi Arabia to include women competitors or face being banned from participation.
Women are not allowed to play in official sports clubs or even watch matches in stadiums.
More Muslim women are competing in sports today than ever.
In sports and in daily life, women have few rights in Saudi Arabia.
Women cannot drive.
The signs of change for Saudi women are yet to come.
