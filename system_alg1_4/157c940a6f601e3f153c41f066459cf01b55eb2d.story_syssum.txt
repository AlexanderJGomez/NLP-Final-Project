(CNN) -- The Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries has tagged two great white sharks off Cape Cod in an area where shark sightings have been reported, state officials said Sunday.
Chatham's beaches were closed to swimmers after the sightings, Skomal said.
CNN affiliate WCVB reported that all of Chatham's east-facing beaches were closed after three sharks came within 75 yards of the coastline.
Skomal identified a great white shark on Friday, and then the two were tagged Saturday.
Researchers have also tagged great white sharks off the coast of South Africa.
