Bogota, Colombia (CNN) -- Two hostages freed by a Colombian rebel group reunited with their family members in the country's capital Friday.
Acuna and Lopez are among a group of five hostages that the FARC leftist guerrilla organization pledged to release in December.
But news of two more kidnappings by the FARC drew the ire of Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos.
The president said Thursday that he was tempted to call off the rescue mission after learning that two workers from the Carton de Colombia company had been kidnapped in southwestern Colombia Wednesday night.
