They were down, then they equalized, then they led.
Now, the U.S. team will have to find steelier resolve for its next contest, against soccer powerhouse Germany on Thursday.
Some made it all the way to the jungle heat of Manaus where the game took place; others joined a crowd of about 20,000 people gathered in front of a big screen in Rio de Janeiro, chanting their belief in an American victory.
In 20 games, the U.S. has never recovered when the opposing team scored the first goal.
All the U.S. had to do next was bide time -- keep possession of the ball, keep an increasingly desperate Portugal at bay.
But shock soon turned to grudging satisfaction.
After all, Portugal is ranked No.
That confrontation is an intriguing one for U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann, who played for the German team that won the World Cup in 1990.
They played yesterday, we played today," he told ESPN.
The key question for American fans is what their team has to do to get through to the next round.
If Portugal and Ghana tie, the United States would stay in second place on four points.
(Portugal and Ghana only have one point each at the moment.)
Portugal would need a big victory or an especially heavy U.S. defeat to tip the goal difference to their advantage.
So if Ghana wins by more than one goal, and the United States loses by one or more goals, Ghana would snatch second place.
"We have to make it against Germany."
