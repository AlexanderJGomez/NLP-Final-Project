ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Nearly a year after assassins killed Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, her widower won the country's presidential election and hailed his triumph as a victory for democracy.
Zardari, 53, had been the front-runner in the race to replace former President Pervez Musharraf, who was forced to resign last month.
According to the chief election commissioner of Pakistan, Qazi Muhammad Farooq, Zardari received 481 votes.
"The democracy talks, and everybody hears," Zardari said in a televised address Saturday evening.
"She taught us how to live.
Zardari took over Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP) after her death late last year.
Siddiqui was nominated by the Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N), led by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Saturday's election came one day after Pakistan's Supreme Court reinstated three of its judges who Musharraf ousted in November, following his imposition of emergency rule.
The PPP, which led the coalition, said it believed the coalition should focus on picking a successor for Musharraf before it decided on reinstating the judges.
As the voting took place, a suicide car bomb exploded in northwestern Pakistan, killing at least 25 people, including eight police officers, local police spokesman Fazal Karim said.
