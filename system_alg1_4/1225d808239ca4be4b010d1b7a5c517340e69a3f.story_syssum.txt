The ministry said the motorcade, which carried Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili and Polish President Lech Kaczynski, was passing a checkpoint near Georgia's South Ossetia region when the shots were fired.
South Ossetia was the site of intense conflict between Russian and Georgian troops in August.
An attack on the motorcade from our military personnel is out of the question," a peacekeeping force spokesman said, according to Interfax.
Tensions have remained high in the area since fighting between Russian and Georgian troops broke out in August.
