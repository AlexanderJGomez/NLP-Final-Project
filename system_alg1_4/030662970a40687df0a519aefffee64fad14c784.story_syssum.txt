(Financial Times) -- South Korean financial regulators will investigate the Seoul branches of Standard Chartered and HSBC in light of money laundering allegations against both banks by regulators in the US.
Shares in StanChart on Monday suffered their heaviest one-day fall in decades after New York state's Department of Financial Services branded it a "rogue institution" and accused it of having breached US sanctions by carrying out $250bn worth of transactions with the Iranian government.
"The Korean financial regulators have always been quite mindful of the US sanctions and the regulations related to Iranian counterparties," he said.
It reached a preliminary agreement in April to sell its Korean retail business to Korea Development Bank, but talks broke down last month.
StanChart, which acquired Korea First Bank in 2005, was badly affected last year by strikes caused by its attempt to introduce performance-related pay.
