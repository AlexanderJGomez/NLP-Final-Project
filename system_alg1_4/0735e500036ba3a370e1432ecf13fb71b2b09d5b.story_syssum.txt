Yet in 2005, a freestyle chess tournament featured teams of humans partnering with computers in various combinations.
Minsky wrote canonical theories of self-replicating artificial intelligence and co-founded MIT's A.I.

It's easy to argue that life and death decisions should never be left to machines, but Licklider's vision was much broader, recognizing technology as an enabler for many human capacities.
Since Kasparov and Deep Blue squared off, we have seen numerous examples of man-computer symbiosis, while A.I.
The tension between the Minsky and Licklider visions has certainly been amplified in the age of so-called big data.
Why is this?
The high-value targets in big data are invariably human: highly adaptive adversaries such as terrorists and cybercriminals whose ingenuity frustrates even the most advanced algorithms.
While technology can certainly be a force multiplier for good or evil, it's difficult to imagine a pure A.I.
Yet how weak is something that can learn in ways even the most robust automated systems can't?
Sometimes, the right combination of humans and technology can reshape the data landscape itself.
Through rapid iteration, a group of determined people using low-friction technology had created a vast, self-regulating system.
Almost 50 years since the identification of Moore's Law, and 10 years since the human genome was first sequenced, humans and machines are beginning a new arc of re-imagining and discovery -- together.
