Livia isn't sick, but doctors fear she might become the 53rd person to contract measles in a recent Disneyland outbreak.
Two days later, the doctor's office called to say that a child with measles had been in the office that same day.
Then the Simons learned from a doctor that the child in the doctor's office had contracted measles because his parents had refused vaccination.
In Alameda County, where Simon lives, nine infants were in quarantine as of Tuesday night because of the measles outbreak, a spokeswoman said.
"Their choice endangered my child," she said.
When asked what she would say to parents of the unvaccinated child, she said she would first ask whether their child was doing OK.
