Scientists at the Smithsonian in Washington announced Thursday the discovery of a new species of mammal called the olinguito (pronounced oh-lin-GHEE-toe).
The olinguito is the first mammalian carnivore species to be newly identified in the Americas in 35 years, according to Kristofer Helgen, curator of mammals at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History.
Previously, scientists had assumed that olinguitos were members of their sister species, the olingos, Helgen said.
Helgen began his detective work in pursuit of the new species when he set out about a decade ago to comprehensive study of olingos.
Cloud forests are "cloaked in fog," Helgen said.
Even people who live in the Andes had the same confusion about olinguitos being olingos, because humans don't hunt them and the creatures stay in the trees, Helgen said.
At about 2.5 feet long from nose tip to tail tip, the olinguito weighs about 2 pounds and is a little smaller than a house cat.
The olinguito's misty high-elevation habitats in Colombia and Ecuador, and the tendency for the animal to stay in the trees, have helped keep the species relatively obscure to scientists until now, Helgen said.
The olinguito is not yet considered an endangered species, but there are threats to its home environment, Helgen said.
The creature came from the mountains of Colombia to the Louisville Zoo in 1967, courtesy of a German couple with a love of raccoon family members, Helgen said.
DNA from this olinguito shows that it is clearly not an olingo, Helgen said.
