Damascus, Syria (CNN) -- A top adviser to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad defended the regime's actions Tuesday, arguing that the government is not attacking peaceful protesters, despite widespread witness reports of a fierce crackdown against displays of dissent.
Shaaban said the government would like "to talk to peaceful demonstrators" and is not opposed to peaceful protests.
Shaaban said that while demonstrators have "legitimate grievances," there are extremists who are using protests "as a cover to incite sectarian violence in Syria" and are badly hurting the economy.
Rami Abdelrahman, head of the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, told CNN Tuesday that 1,342 civilians and 343 security personnel have died since the protests erupted.
The Turkish government said Tuesday that 10,757 Syrian refugees have crossed the border.
Alawites are an offshoot of Shiite Muslims.
But some of those who have been risking arrest or bodily harm as al-Assad tries to suppress a wave of anti-government protests said the people in the hotel don't necessarily speak for them.
"Where are the people who are on the streets?
"We are trying our best to reach the leaders of people on the street because we want to solve this problem in our country and move forward."
"No government in the world would kill its own people," she said.
