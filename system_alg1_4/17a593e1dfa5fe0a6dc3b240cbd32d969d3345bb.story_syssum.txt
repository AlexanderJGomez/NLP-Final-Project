Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Scores of youths attacked police in Northern Ireland for a second consecutive night Tuesday in an expression of rage over a parade in the Ardoyne area of north Belfast.
Police appealed for calm on Tuesday.
On Monday night, police fired more than 50 plastic bullets and used a water cannon to disperse rioters, who threw more than 40 gasoline bombs, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said.
Monday's violence was centered in Catholic areas of Belfast ahead of the main day of the Protestant marching season, when loyalists parade through the streets.
Violence does not need to be inevitable," he said after Monday night's rioting.
The province suffered decades of violence known locally as the Troubles, in which more than 3,500 people were killed before a 1998 peace accord known as the Good Friday Agreement.
This year has been one of the most violent since the Good Friday Agreement.
