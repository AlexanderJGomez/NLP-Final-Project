Dave pays taxidermist to turn bear into furniture.
Because quality taxidermy really depends on the skill of the taxidermist, and a simple hunting mount can turn exponentially more creepy if it isn't done with precision or mild sobriety.
So, although I'm sort of weirded out by this practice (and, hey, to each their own) I can absolutely appreciate bad taxidermy.
And, now, there's a new, popular Twitter feed about just that.
He loves taxidermy and Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.
And it does.
Bad taxidermy on the Web is actually nothing new.
And besides, things are going fairly well for Su.
Just like Nish's twitter feed.
In the meantime, Su maintains her day job as an active-wear designer, but says she's actually going to have to try her hand at taxidermy.
Tainton will be giving Su a private lesson at her apartment, and Su's only real concern is that she'll barf.
