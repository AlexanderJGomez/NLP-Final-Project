Tony Fernandes, CEO of Air Asia, spoke to CNN's Andrew Stevens in The Boardroom.
Fernandes: Well there's a fine line between brilliance and stupidity, so the second point in a statement that Richard Branson's made is how to become a millionaire, start with a billion and start an airline.
I got tired of the corporate life, I got tired of corporate politics.
And I think the key number that got me going was only six percent of Malaysians flew.
I think also when you start a business the most important thing is does the market want it.
Stevens: You like to pluck people from all different walks of life, from all different professions.
Fernandes: Well I think, first is that everyone plays a part.
Fernandes: Oh yes, they do.
You can do all the theory and books and promise people the world but when they see it in reality, boy that's a powerful thing to see.
One is, to see what's going on, and to make sure if I'm making the right decisions.
And the second thing is, I still want to discover these raw diamonds.
And that came from Conor McCarthy of RyanAir.
