CNN's new state-of-the-art production center and newsgathering hub for the Middle East will also be home to CNN's first ever daily live news show from the region.
"PRISM," hosted by news veteran Stan Grant, debuts this evening and joins existing feature shows "Inside the Middle East" and "Marketplace Middle East" as a major addition to its regionally based programming portfolio.
"It gives CNN a powerful base from which to coordinate seven regional bureaus and also launch a new daily news show from the Middle East."
With more than two dozen staff, CNN Abu Dhabi not only consolidates CNN Worldwide's investment in global newsgathering; it also underlines CNN's growth strategy which includes the commercial launch of the CNN Wire, the unveiling of the new CNN.com and the addition of new prime time shows across CNN International and, in the United States, HLN.
Since early 2008 CNN has opened seven new editorial operations across Africa, Asia, Latin America and now the Middle East, as well as placing additional correspondents in many existing operations.
