WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The United States Mint launched a new coin Tuesday featuring jazz legend Duke Ellington, making him the first African-American to appear by himself on a circulating U.S. coin.
Members of Ellington's family were present at the ceremony, and the jazz band of Duke Ellington High School performed.
His orchestra's theme song, "Take the A Train," is one of the best-known compositions in jazz.
He died in 1974 at the age of 75.
The U.S. Mint distinguishes between circulating coins, which are intended for daily use, and commemorative ones, which mark special occasions.
Educator Booker T. Washington, botanist George Washington Carver and the first Revolutionary War casualty, Crispus Attucks, all of whom were black, have also appeared on commemorative coins, according to the U.S. Mint.
