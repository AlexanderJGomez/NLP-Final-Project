Records show that Jeffs made two phone calls on Christmas Day, said Jason Clark, a Criminal Justice Department spokesman, who declined to identify the people who lost their phone privileges with Jeffs.
Texas inmates are allowed to call as many as 10 people who have registered with the offender phone system vendor.
Jeffs remains isolated in protective custody in the state's Powledge Unit prison facility near Palestine, Texas.
Jeffs, the leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is serving a life-plus-20-year term in Texas for sexual assault.
Last week, a long-time follower of Jeffs said he had been ex-communicated after admitting to having sex with his wife -- a violation of an order that the sect leader apparently issued from behind bars.
