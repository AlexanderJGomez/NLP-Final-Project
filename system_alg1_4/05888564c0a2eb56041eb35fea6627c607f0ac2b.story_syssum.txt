U.N. observers went to Houla and viewed the bodies, a day after opposition activists reported a massacre there at the hands of the Syrian regime.
Supervision Mission in Syria, said in a statement.
Observers confirmed the use of artillery and tank shells, Mood said.
Syrian state media reported the observers' visits Saturday to several towns and cities and blamed al Qaeda-linked groups for the deaths in Houla.
A network of Syrian opposition activists, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, blamed "forces and armed militias" of the Syrian government for "a new massacre" in Houla.
Graphic video posted on YouTube purportedly shows the lifeless bodies of small children killed in Houla.
"This appalling and brutal crime involving indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force is a flagrant violation of international law and of the commitments of the Syrian government to cease the use of heavy weapons in population centers and violence in all its forms," the joint statement said.
"Those who perpetrated this atrocity must be identified and held to account," Clinton said in a statement.
The al-Assad government is using the cease-fire and peace plan "to kill more people and is trying to crush the uprising," al-Khaled said.
In a letter to the head of the U.N. Security Council, obtained by CNN, Ban said he is deeply concerned that the Syrian violence has not stopped despite the presence of the monitors and the agreement by both sides to a peace plan.
Since al-Assad's government and opposition forces accepted Annan's peace plan in March, at least 1,635 people have been killed, the LCC said Saturday.
The agency also said similar terrorist groups massacred a family of seven, including three children, in the same province's rural town of Taldo.
