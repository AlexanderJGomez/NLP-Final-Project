(CNN) -- After nearly going to war last year over a Colombian military raid inside Ecuador, the two nations seemed to be patching relations when their foreign ministers met a few weeks ago.
Ecuador previously issued an arrest warrant for former Colombian Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos, who held the post during last year's raid.
Myles Frechette, U.S. ambassador to Colombia from 1994 to 1997, said Friday that "Ecuador is a specialist in bonehead plays.
Tension between the two nations has existed for years.
Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa called the attack "aggression" and a "massacre" and severed diplomatic relations with Colombia.
After the meeting, Colombia signed a statement saying it would never attack inside Ecuador again.
What happened?
"That's not a very coordinated government," said Frechette, the former envoy to Colombia.
Alejandro Santos, editorial director of La Semana weekly news magazine in Colombia, said relations will not improve until the two countries "can close the chapter" on last year's bombing raid.
Esteruelas said Ecuador felt justifiably aggrieved over the attack and wants to make sure it never happens again.
The problems between the two nations are long-standing and have a lot to do with the 45-year-old war between Colombia and the FARC.
Ecuador also resents that the FARC have set up camps inside the country, causing security problems for a nation that is not technically at war with the guerrillas.
Chavez threatened to attack neighboring Colombia after the military raid in Ecuador.
Said Spurrier, "For Colombia, Ecuador is an important market.
But the goods Ecuador sells Colombia are difficult to relocate to other markets.
"We have to close the parenthesis," he said.
