"What is Prince William like?"
I could sense how he had been consumed by his new way of life -- I've been there myself and other fathers will pick up on it too.
William was the one who, outside the hospital, fixed his son's car seat in, then drove home for the first time with his new family.
We started chatting, he was on great form and I knew immediately that he was going to give a great interview.
In fact before I knew it, the cameras were rolling and the interview was under way.
William was very comfortable and revealing about his conservation work, and I can't wait for people to see the full version of the interview in next month's special.
It could be any new dad, and that's what I like about the interview.
There's more next month when we air what's set to be a stunning documentary.
