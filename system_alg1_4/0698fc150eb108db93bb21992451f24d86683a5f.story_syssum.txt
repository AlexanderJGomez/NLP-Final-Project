Jett Webb killed the massive animal last month in eastern North Carolina.
It's not every day you see something that size," Webb said.
Webb, 34, said hunting isn't about bagging trophies for him.
"The meat the pig provided and the memory that hunting provides is worth more than any trophy," he said.
That lasted a few feet.
It topped out, but Webb said he didn't think the boar weighed much more than 500 pounds.
In North Carolina, wild boar may be hunted year round during normal hunting hours.
In 2004, a hunter in Georgia killed an 800-pound boar dubbed Hogzilla.
