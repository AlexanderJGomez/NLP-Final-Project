New Delhi (CNN) -- Here's the best way to understand the new India in 30 seconds.
The story struck me because it weaves together some important trends and forces in India as the nation undertakes the biggest elections in world history.
Even today, there are only 57 million broadband  subscribers in the country, according to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, or TRAI.
The Internet is aspirational in India; it's the new motorbike or washing machine.
The second trend is the rise of rural India.
More than 100 million voters in India's elections are first-timers who turned 18 in the last five years.
Half of all Indians are under age 30; the average age in India is 28.
For the first time in India's history, a majority of Indians are connected and engaged.
Some suggest that these trends mean India's elections will be fought and decided on social media.
India's Internet and Mobile Association says a strong social media campaign could swing up to 4% of votes.
Facebook says it has 100 million users in India: it sounds like a lot but it accounts for less than a tenth of Indians.
Why?
This is also why I think it's far too early to call India's elections for any one politician or party.
Watch India's elections very closely.
Calling these elections too early could be embarrassing, too.
