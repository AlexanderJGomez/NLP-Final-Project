A judge on Wednesday ordered that Ethan Couch -- who drove drunk and caused a crash, killing four people and injuring two -- go to a lock-down residential treatment facility.
That particular defense, however, played no part in the judge's decision, Couch's lawyer told reporters on Wednesday.
It was also unclear how long Couch might stay  there.
If Couch violates the terms of his probation, he could face up to 10 years behind bars.
"Had he (Couch) not had money to have the defense there, to also have the experts testify, and also offer to pay for the treatment, I think the results would have been different," he said Wednesday after the proceedings.
Two people riding in the bed of the teen's pickup were tossed in the crash and severely injured.
No doubt about it, it would have helped," said Boyles.
"I'm used to a system where the victims have a voice and their needs are strongly considered.
The way the system down here is currently handled, the way the law is, almost all the focus is on the offender."
