At 7:11 a.m. that Sunday -- about 11 minutes before the derailment -- the engineer did not dim the train's headlights as required when it passed another train, the National Transportation Safety Board said Monday.
The NTSB said Monday it believes that positive train control, a high-tech system that targets human error, could have prevented the crash.
The NTSB said it has completed its inspection of the train and found no anomalies.
"As a result, at this time, the NTSB believes that if positive train control technology was installed on this line and train, it would have required the engineer to slow the train to an appropriate speed or stop the train in the event the engineer did not do so, likely preventing the derailment," the board said in a statement.
