These men are part of the country's Ebola response team, specifically tasked with burying anyone suspected to have died of the Ebola virus.
Now almost anytime there is a suspected Ebola death in the community, they call in the Ebola response team to come and bury the body safely.
"When it started, it wasn't that easy," says Alpha Tamba, an Ebola response coordinator in Lofa County.
The Lofa County health team arrives carrying gloves, gowns, goggles and diluted bleach.
Then -- and only then -- can the rest of the team enter to place the body in an airtight polythene bag, ready for burial.
A few kilometres away from the village is Zango Town: most of the houses here have been abandoned, their doors padlocked and windows shuttered.
They died," he says.
But then there's Barkedu Town -- of the 1,000 or so Ebola-related deaths in Liberia, 20% of the victims have died in this single town.
Home to more than 8,000 people, Barkedu is now under quarantine: no one can go in, and no one can go out.
But the most important one is medicine because the hospital is closed down, there is no health worker," he says.
One of the local clinics had to be locked up after all the healthcare workers based there contracted the virus.
"Sometimes we go to bed and we dream of nothing else but Ebola, Ebola, Ebola -- nothing else," he explains.
"It is difficult to stand in front of Ebola, but this is the situation we have," he says.
We have to fight it.
