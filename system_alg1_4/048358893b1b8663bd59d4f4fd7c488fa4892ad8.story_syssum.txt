Baghdad (CNN) -- A brazen insurgent attack inside a provincial council building in Baquba killed at least 12 people Tuesday, Iraqi Interior Ministry officials said.
U.S. troops, who were on routine patrol in the area, assisted with an initial search of the building at the request of Iraqi police and later assisted with security, said spokeswoman Maj. Angela Funaro.
The 12 fatalities included four attackers; at least 28 others were wounded in the incident, officials said.
"All terrorist sleeper cells must be eliminated and the security plan in the province must be reviewed again," he said, adding that Tuesday's attack "bears the hallmark of al Qaeda" but cautioned that no conclusions be drawn until an investigation is completed.
The latest wave of violence raises concerns over the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces as U.S troops prepare to leave the country by the end of 2011 under the terms of a bilateral security agreement.
A new Iraqi government was formed in December but key positions that oversee security forces remain vacant amid political wrangling.
