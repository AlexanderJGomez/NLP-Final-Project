A flesh-eating drug that turns people into zombie-like creatures seems to have made its way to the United States.
"It's a zombie drug -- it literally kills you from the inside out," Singla said.
Krokodil causes serious damage to the veins and soft tissue infections, rapidly followed by gangrene and necrosis, according to a 2013 study (PDF).
Geller said he hopes the drug "doesn't show its ugly face" in Georgia but said doctors across the country are aware of the drug.
CNN affiliate KOCO-TV in Oklahoma City spoke with a woman who said her best friend from Duncan, Oklahoma, died after using krokodil last year.
"It was just a drug overdose, and nothing in the system consistent with krokodil."
An estimated 100,000 in Russia and around 20,000 people in Ukraine are estimated to have injected the drug in 2011, according to a study that ran in the International Journal of Drug Policy this year.
Mortality rates are high among users, according to the study.
In Russia, users frequently are young people with relatively short drug histories, the study found.
According to the Joliet hospital, the five people brought in who may have used krokodil said they thought they were buying heroin.
"I think if it stays on the market long enough, you're going to have people who are desperate addicts that can't support their heroin habit but can utilize this drug, not really caring about the consequences, and get the same high for a third of the price."
