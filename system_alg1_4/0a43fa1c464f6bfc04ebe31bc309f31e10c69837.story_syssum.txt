Since then, the number of federally recognized tribes has risen to 566, and Wilbur is still crisscrossing the country, immersing herself in the worlds of Native Americans from Brooklyn to the far reaches of Alaska for her ongoing photo series, Project 562.
"Stereotypes in the media reduce Indian country to the Plains Indian in a headdress," said scholar Adrienne Keene, a member of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma whom Wilbur photographed for the series.
The project is also building relationships in Indian country, cultivating bonds among Wilbur, the participants and also connecting them to elite institutions like the Tacoma Art Museum, Keene said.
"The project is for the people, not just native people but everyone," Wilbur said.
Questions around Native American identity are central to Project 562.
Letting them decide is central to the project, Wilbur said.
Wilbur and Keene knew each other before Project 562 through their efforts in a larger movement in Indian country to change negative perceptions of Native Americans.
Keene told Wilbur about how her Cherokee ancestors were forced from their ancestral lands in western North Carolina to Oklahoma.
I hadn't felt it until I was there."
The concept of identity is fluid from person to person and generation to generation, Wilbur said.
This year, a second Kickstarter campaign surpassed her $54,000 goal, to raise more than $213,000.
"The life we live is for the people," Wilbur said.
