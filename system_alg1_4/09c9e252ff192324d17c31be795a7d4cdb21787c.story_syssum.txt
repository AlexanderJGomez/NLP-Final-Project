The public bus she boarded normally carries ultra-Orthodox passengers and travels to an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood in Jerusalem.
As the bus took on more passengers along its route, an ultra-orthodox man demanded she should sit in the back of the bus as is the custom on that route.
An argument ensued and ultimately the bus driver called the police to intervene, but not before a crowd of black-clad ultra-orthodox men had gathered outside the bus.
Rosenblit said he asked if she was willing to show respect for the objectors and move to the back of the bus.
She refused and, after a 30-minute delay, the bus moved on to Jerusalem with her sitting up front.
I oppose this unequivocally.
Rosenblit describes herself as secular and said she did not ride the bus looking for a confrontation.
"There are a lot of lovely things about religion, but forcing people to choose religion is wrong," she said.
