The family behind  A&E's "Duck Dynasty" rallied around its patriarch Thursday, one day after the network suspended Phil Robertson over controversial remarks he made about gays and blacks in a magazine interview.
We are in discussions with A&E to see what that means for the future of Duck Dynasty," it said.
In the January issue of GQ, Robertson said homosexuality is a sin and puts it in the same category as bestiality and promiscuity.
But hey, sin: It's not logical, my man.
But homosexuals aren't alone, Robertson said.
A&E said it was troubled by Robertson's statements.
"We are extremely disappointed to have read Phil Robertson's comments in GQ, which are based on his own personal beliefs and are not reflected in the series Duck Dynasty," the network said in a statement Wednesday.
The blacks worked for the farmers.
...
They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues," GQ quoted Robertson as saying.
Did A&E make the right decision?
But by early Thursday night, more than 70,000 people had signed a change.org petition calling for A&E to bring Robertson back.
Just because homosexuals do not agree, does not mean Mr. Robertson needs to be suspended."
"Duck Dynasty" follows a Louisiana bayou family that has "made a fortune on duck calls," as A&E puts it.
Videos of his family's duck hunts led to a show on the Outdoor Channel and eventually A&E, the article says.
