Among the show's nominations were picks for best comedy series as well as best actress in a comedy for creator and writer Lena Dunham.
Several veteran shows were among the nominees for best drama series, including "Mad Men" -- which has won this category four years running -- "Boardwalk Empire," "Breaking Bad" and "Game of Thrones."
Some have dismissed the show for its narrow take on New York and young women, noting the lack of African-American characters, its general hip and upscale settings, and Dunham's willingness to make her audience squirm as she follows characters into both bedroom and bathroom.
The show's defenders, on the other hand, applaud Dunham for showing her characters in less-than-flattering lights and observe that "Girls" isn't the first series to take place in a perceived vacuum.
NBC's "Parks and Recreation" missed out on best comedy series as well, though star Amy Poehler got a nomination.
"Homeland," about a CIA agent combating terrorism and her own demons, received plenty of attention, picking up nine nominations, including nods for best drama series and stars Claire Danes and Damian Lewis.
(Her comedy series, "Hot in Cleveland," also got recognition, with two nominations.)
The nominations were announced by Kerry Washington, star of ABC's "Scandal," and late-night host Jimmy Kimmel.
"Who are you wearing?"
The show will air on ABC from Los Angeles' Nokia Theatre.
