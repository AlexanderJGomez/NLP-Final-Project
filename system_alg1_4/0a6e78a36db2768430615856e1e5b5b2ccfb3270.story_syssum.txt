We spent some time testing and touching the new iPad Mini and iPad Air after Tuesday's press conference.
The most unexpected news of the day was a new name for the $499 fifth-generation iPad, which is now the iPad Air.
Physically, the iPad Air is indeed lighter and thinner than its predecessor.
Unfortunately, I didn't have an older iPad on hand to do a weight comparison, and I'd picked up an iPad Mini first.
The iPad Air has a 64-bit A7 processor, the same chip recently introduced in the iPhone 5S.
The iPad Mini got its first upgrade since it was first launched one year ago.
Like the iPad Air, the iPad Mini with Retina has the A7 chip inside.
The smaller tablet size is a competitive market, and the iPad Mini with Retina Display is finally Apple's premium offering for the 7.9-inch size.
Instead, the company keeps older models available, though even those are priced somewhat high.
Faster processors gobble up more battery power, so maintaining 10 hours of battery life from an old tablet to a new tablet probably requires battery improvements.
According to Forrester analyst Sarah Rotman Epps, replacement tablet sales are growing faster than new new tablet sales worldwide.
The competition will stay close until the first company breaks out of the usual faster, thinner, faster upgrade cycle and solves the battery problem.
