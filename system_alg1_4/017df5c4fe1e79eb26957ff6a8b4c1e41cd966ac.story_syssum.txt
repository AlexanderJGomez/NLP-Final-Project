Pick a color that has life and personality," Thom Filicia says.
Thom Filicia: I look at the layout, I look at the way the space is being used, and I try to figure out what the best use of the space is; that it works really well, it looks good, that you're getting the best views, you're seeing the space, and that you're getting through the space.
Filicia: Make sure that your furniture layout works.
Make sure that the things you love to look at, you're seeing.
You can use inexpensive up lights.
You always want to have a Lutron dimmer you plug into the wall.
Start with three: one lumbar in the center and maybe a pair of pillows left and right.
Filicia: People think that dark walls make a room smaller.
Also, I think that color definitely adds a lot of warmth to spaces.
Filicia: The first thing you want to really focus on is a great sofa, because it is really the anchor for the room.
Filicia: Yup, I have a book out right now, which is called "Thom Filicia Style," and it's a great book.
Filicia: It's very easy to use eco-friendly cleaning supplies, environmentally friendly lighting throughout your house using low wattage or eco-friendly bulbs.
