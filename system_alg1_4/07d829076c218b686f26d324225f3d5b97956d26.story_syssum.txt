(CNN) -- Public executions, death by starvation and torture are common in North Korean political prisoner camps, according to testimony given to human rights group Amnesty International.
For decades the authorities have refused to admit to the existence of mass political prison camps," said Sam Zarifi, Amnesty International Asia Pacific Director.
The report says tens of thousands are believed to be held at one camp simply because one of their relatives has been sent to a camp.
Aidan Foster-Carter, Honorary Senior Research Fellow in Sociology and Modern Korea at Leeds University in England, said: "It is difficult to get hard data (on North Korea) for obvious reasons, and it could be that the numbers of people in the camps are growing.
A young boy ended up in one of these camps because his grandfather had expressed political dissent.
The North Korean government -- which has denied the existence of mass political prison camps -- has not publicly commented on the report's findings.
