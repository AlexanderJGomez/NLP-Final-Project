He's had more than 90 radiation treatments and 200 chemo treatments since being diagnosed with head and neck cancer eight years ago.
"With treatment, two years," the doctor responded.
Now, Cossman, 61, is sitting in a doctor's office, ready to undergo a CT scan that will determine if his cancer is being kept in check.
Life offers too much to give in.
...
Cossman is one of the tens of thousands of people worldwide enrolled in drug trials.
He wants to make others "aware of head and neck cancer, and that clinical trials are available," he says.
"You want to see how long you can actually hold the disease at bay," Fetzer says.
It takes about nine years for an oncology drug to go through the necessary clinical studies to FDA approval, said Dr. Kenneth Kaitin, director of The Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, an independent nonprofit research group.
When the test drug is for cancer, the patients have very aggressive forms.
His doctor diagnosed it as head and neck cancer -- a surprise to Cossman because he's never been a heavy drinker or smoker.
He underwent 36 radiation and chemo treatments over 2Â½ months.
Chemo and radiation began again.
"By June 2006," he says, "I went through every type of chemo that's been approved for head and neck cancer.
"You can't immediately go from one study to another.
In his second study, he developed a tumor on his right arm.
Then, when the CT scan comes back and it shows the tumors are growing, it's really frustrating."
No," he says.
So Cossman entered his fourth study this summer, the trial by Cerulean Pharma.
In fact, he celebrates life because "it's been good to me."
He says far too few cancer patients who could be eligible for trials are aware of them.
He tries not to get his hopes up.
His cancer has grown at a rate of 11 percent, enough to remain on the study.
Cossman hopes to enter a new one soon.
"Definitely," he says.
