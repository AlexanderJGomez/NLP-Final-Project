(CNN) -- Ukrainian forces have taken full control of Donetsk airport as they continue to fight pro-Russian rebels in the eastern Ukraine city, a Ukrainian military spokesman says.
A nine-story residential building at the train station area has been damaged.
Still, the train station is working," it said.
The Ukraine government says "terrorists" fired on the plane.
Alexander Borodai, the rebel leader who calls himself the Prime Minister of the self-styled Donetsk People's Republic, has conceded that the plane was shot down but says his forces did not do it.
