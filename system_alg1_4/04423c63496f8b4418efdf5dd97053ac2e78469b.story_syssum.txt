GALVESTON, Texas (CNN)  -- Rescuers in Galveston, Texas, were going door-to-door Saturday to check on the estimated 20,000 people who failed to flee Hurricane Ike, which has slowed to tropical storm status.
Galveston had ordered evacuation of the island, but Galveston City Manager Steve LeBlanc said about 40 percent of the city's 57,523 residents chose to stay.
LeBlanc said 17 buildings on the island had been destroyed by fires, potent winds and a strong storm surge.
