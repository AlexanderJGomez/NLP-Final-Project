Launched earlier this week, the Tony Elumelu Foundation Entrepreneurship Program (TEEP) wants to help find and grow businesses who will contribute $10 billion in revenue across Africa over the next 10 years.
"[It is] my fundamental belief that entrepreneurs -- women and men across Africa -- will lead Africa's development and transform our futures."
"We must strive for entrepreneurial innovation in Africa," says Songwe, "and my participation in this program further promotes the World Bank Group's push for entrepreneur-led global development."
The initiative's goal to nurture 1,000 entrepreneurs every year for a decade may sound ambitious, but research reveals Africa is a hotbed of entrepreneurial spirit.
"African entrepreneurs have ideas, they have products but they don't have support," says technologist Marieme Jamme, a Davos Young Global leader and CEO of SpotOne Global Solutions.
"Some people are ready to fund amazing and bright ideas, like Tony Elumelu, but let's not get ahead of ourselves here -- we have great challenges on quality control.
