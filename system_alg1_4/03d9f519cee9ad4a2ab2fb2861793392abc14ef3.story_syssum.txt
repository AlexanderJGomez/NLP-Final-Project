But as well as boosting the tiny nation's tourism revenues, the high seas off the east coast of Africa have also helped create another strategic industry: fishing.
"Anything that disrupts the tourism or fishing industry or the maritime equilibrium is a very big problem for us," he adds.
As part of this increased security drive, the Seychelles coast guard has intensified its patrolling efforts, with fast-attack armed vessels monitoring a newly defined zone for fishing.
But while the measure seems to be working -- there have been no successful attacks in nearly a year -- the restrictions on the movement of Seychellois fishermen has created another problem.
Pierre, who's been casting his nets for 12 years now, says his job was hardest during the worst period of the piracy -- in 2007 and 2008.
He says fish intake has fallen nearly 25% in the last five years.
Since 2006, the year the World Bank report takes as the starting point of piracy, exports of fish products from piracy-hit countries have declined by 23.8%.
"We now fish where we are allowed to fish," says Peter Sinon, the country's minister of natural resources and industry.
"Five years ago, there was a lot of fish," says Pierre.
