Cairo (CNN) -- Nine people died over two days in clashes between Egyptian police and protesters amid reports of inadequate security at a soccer match that devolved into a riot in which 79 fans were killed, officials said Friday.
Nearly 200 police officers were injured, several by birdshot pellets, Mustapha said.
Police fired tear gas into the crowds and warning shots into the air, he said.
Another fire broke out 20 kilometers from Cairo, at the Al Marg police station, said Usama Emam, a national security investigator.
Among the people arrested in Cairo were 12 Syrians, said Maj. Karim El-Fouli with the Egyptian police.
"Mubarak gone!
"They are here because of the massacre in Homs today," said Syrian activist Sumer Badr, in Cairo, referring to violence between Syrian government forces and demonstrators.
On Thursday, two people died in Suez and a military officer was accidentally killed by a vehicle driven by security forces in Cairo, officials said.
Rival fans battled with rocks and chairs, and witnesses said many of the Al-Masry fans carried knives and sticks.
Mamdouh Eid, executive manager of the Al-Ahly fans committee, said authorities contributed to the escalation of violence.
Mustapha said fans stoked tensions during the entire match.
The order was retracted after lawmakers objected.
The governor and the chief of security, along with the head of the Port Said football federation, the stadium manager and the riot police chief, have all been banned from travel until the investigation is completed.
