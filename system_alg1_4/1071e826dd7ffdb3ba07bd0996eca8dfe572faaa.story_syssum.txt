Phnom Penh, Cambodia (CNN) -- The opposition party in Cambodia has rejected the results of the country's national election, which handed another win to long-serving Prime Minister Hun Sen.
But the number wasn't large enough to unseat the ruling Cambodian People's Party, which won 68 seats.
The excitement bubbled over Friday when Rainsy returned home from exile in France.
The national election committee said it worked hard to ensure the election was far.
