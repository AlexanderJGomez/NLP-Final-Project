Amnesty International said it was "extremely concerned" about the bill and called on the Ugandan parliament not to pass it.
"The bill would have lasting, harmful effects on Ugandans who are thought to breach its far-reaching provisions and it would significantly hamper the work of human rights defenders and public health professionals," the rights group said.
Uganda's parliamentary speaker has reportedly said she wants the legislation to pass before Christmas.
Some nations have also threatened to withhold aid to Uganda over its record on same-sex rights.
