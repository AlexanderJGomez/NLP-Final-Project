NEW YORK (CNN) -- Chris Cornell has taken to Twitter like Tweety Bird took to making mischief.
"It's actually created an environment where I can answer simple questions that someone's probably had forever," said Cornell.
And I can actually have conversations with fans that are quick, but still more meaningful than the typical situations you're put into.

The album debuted at No.

Cornell: It depends.
Cornell: Probably, yeah.

Cornell: Yeah.
So we sort of did it as kind of a ritualistic, "OK, let's participate in the real thing."
