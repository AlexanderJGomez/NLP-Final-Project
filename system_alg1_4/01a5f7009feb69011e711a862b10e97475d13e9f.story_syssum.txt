(CNN) -- While an art student at Dumlupinar University, Turkish illustrator Murat Palta watched "Star Wars".
"I guess I just really like movies," he admits.
There is an underlying playfulness throughout his illustrations.
"The first time I mentioned my project to my teachers, they didn't understand it," Palta admits.
"I think next I'll illustrate 'Lord of the Rings' and '2001: A Space Odyssey,' or maybe 'Pan's Labyrinth.'"
