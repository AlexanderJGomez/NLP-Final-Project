(CNN) -- South Carolina social workers were familiar with Timothy Jones Jr. long before police accused him of killing his five children and dumping them off a dirt road in Alabama, according to documents from the state Department of Social Services.
Jones, 32, was arrested Saturday in Smith County, Mississippi, and charged with driving under the influence, possession of synthetic marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia, the Lexington County Sheriff's Department in South Carolina said.
Jones and the children were listed as missing persons last week after Jones failed to drop off the children with his ex-wife.
The caseworker called police, but when Jones arrived, he'd calmed down, the report states.
The caseworker told Jones the home wasn't safe for the kids, and Jones took them to a hotel, it said.
Four months ago, a South Carolina DSS case manager spoke to one of the children, who said Jones made them do exercises for punishment.
Jones admitted to the case manager that he had spanked his son, and the case manager told Jones to refrain from physical discipline.
Jones said his ex-wife had left him for a younger man and she hadn't seen her kids in four months, the report says.
Once interviewed, the children denied any abuse or neglect and told the case manager what meals they'd eaten the night before.
It's unclear how or why Jones allegedly killed his children, but acting Sheriff Lewis McCarty of Lexington County told reporters that Jones drove for several days with their decomposing bodies in the back of his SUV.
It is believed he killed all the children at the same time, and that the crime happened in Lexington County, McCarty said.
"I'm a father and I'm a grandfather, and in all of my years of law enforcement, I have never seen a case like this," McCarty said.
"We know that the angels are with us, but your prayers are helping us cope," Tim Jones Sr. said.
