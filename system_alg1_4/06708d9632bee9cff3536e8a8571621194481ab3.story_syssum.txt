(CNN) -- While some criticism targeting President Obama is racially motivated, the fight over health care isn't, former President Clinton told CNN.
"While I have devoted my life to getting rid of racism, I think this [health care] is a fight that my president and our party -- this is one we need to win on the merits," Clinton said.
"First, it's more up to them than it is to President Obama," Clinton said.
"I think if we can just get them to start talking again around the two-state solutions, around restoring a sense of normalcy and creating a Palestinian state ...
They're really fine young women."
Clinton, a New York resident, also touched on a New York Times report that Obama administration officials have urged New York Gov.
"I think Paterson is in a tough spot, but he's done a better job than he's gotten credit for," he said.
