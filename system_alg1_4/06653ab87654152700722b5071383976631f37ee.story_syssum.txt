Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, a strongman in the troubled Horn of Africa and a key United States ally, has died, his government announced Tuesday.
"He came to power at the barrel of a gun, but he made the transition from rebel leader to political leader very quickly," said Ayo Johnson, a writer on Africa and director of Viewpoint Africa.
That's partly because of his action against Islamist movements in the region, including an invasion of Somalia in 1998, Johnson said.
Meles died at 11:40 p.m. Monday from an unspecified infection, spokesman Bereket Simon said.
Meles had been scheduled to step down in 2013 as part of a transition process, Mosley said, but questioned whether he genuinely intended to relinquish power.
The news came almost a week after the government said Meles was "recovering well" after treatment for an unspecified illness.
The government held a news conference last month and announced Meles received treatment for an unspecified illness.
Meles has been credited with working toward peace and security in the region, and the Ethiopian army sent peacekeepers to battle the Islamic extremist group Al-Shabaab in Somalia.
