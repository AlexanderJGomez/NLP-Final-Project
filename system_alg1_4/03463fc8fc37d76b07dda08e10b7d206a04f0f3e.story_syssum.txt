(CNN) -- Veteran striker Miroslav Klose equaled the World Cup scoring record of Brazilian great Ronaldo to rescue a point for Germany in a pulsating 2-2 draw with Ghana in Fortaleza Saturday.
Germany started the second half brighter and Mario Gotze headed the opening goal -- which deflected in off his own knee -- in the 51st minute after a pin point cross from Thomas Muller.
It was his fifth goal in World Cup finals, equaling the African record held by the great Roger Milla of Cameroon.
Muller scored 68 in just 62 games, his final goal for his country being the winner in the 1974 World Cup final against the Netherlands.
Boateng's half-brother Jerome was in the Germany side, only the second time in World Cup history this has occurred.
