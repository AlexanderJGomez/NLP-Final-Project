The man he saw in a North Carolina courtroom last week was stooped and shackled, hardly the same smooth and swaggering Jeffrey MacDonald who had told his story so many years ago.
McGinniss testified earlier this month for the prosecution at a federal hearing in Wilmington, North Carolina, that could determine whether or not MacDonald deserves freedom, or at least a new trial.
McGinniss said in court that he considers the latest defense maneuver to be "the Holy Grail," MacDonald's last chance at freedom.
MacDonald's pregnant wife, Colette, was stabbed 16 times with a knife and 21 times with an ice pick.
"It was overkill," said McGinniss, who wrote that MacDonald killed his family in an amphetamine-fueled rage.
Prosecutors alleged MacDonald staged the crime scene.
MacDonald has always insisted he is innocent, so the recent developments in the case come as no surprise to McGinniss.
These were people that got in his way."
"We've been sold a bill of goods about this case," said Morris.
"MacDonald was convicted by a jury in a court of law.
McGinniss also tried to put the rest the notion that he was a passionate believer in MacDonald when he embarked on "Fatal Vision."
McGinniss said what he heard in court was overwhelmingly convincing.
McGinniss also disputed the notion raised by the defense and Morris that the prosecutor at the criminal trial threatened witness Helena Stoeckley to alter her testimony.
"It was in 1987 during the trial of the civil suit against me," McGinniss said.
In the civil case, MacDonald accused the author of breaching an agreement to write a book about his innocence.
In court, MacDonald literally seemed to McGinniss to be a ghost from the past.
