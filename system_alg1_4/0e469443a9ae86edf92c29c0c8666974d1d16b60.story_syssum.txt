Human rights groups decried the court ruling that spared Duvalier.
Duvalier inherited the title of "President for life" in 1971 upon the death of his father, Francois "Papa Doc" Duvalier, who had ruled with an iron fist through his paramilitary force, the Tonton Macoute.
In addition, there were allegations that "Baby Doc" embezzled hundreds of millions of dollars.
Amnesty gave the public prosecutor in the Duvalier case 100 documents that it said detailed cases of human rights violations.
