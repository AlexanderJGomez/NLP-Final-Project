(CNN) -- It's been a busy year for the British royal family.
With more private and public income, Prince Charles' household spending increased by 4.1% to $15.3 million, and all 135 full-time staff members received a pay raise of 3%.
Anti-monarchy groups such as Republic have criticized the royal family for using public money to travel.
However, Harverson maintains: "Members of the royal family do a huge amount of work.
Royal aides champion the continued success of the prince's group of 16 charities as the greatest example of the royal family giving back to the public.
Riding high on that wave is the household of the Prince of Wales, as exemplified by the 76,825 letters received from the public in 2011-12.
