"This is the first time we have won the gold in men's doubles, so it's certainly historic," Sharath told the official Commonwealth Games website.
In the pool, English diver Tom Daley won his second gold medal in two days, adding the 10 meter platform title to the synchronized diving crown he had already claimed in Delhi.
Elsewhere at the games, Australia won a thrilling women's hockey final, clinching the gold medal after a penalty shoot-out victory against New Zealand.
It was also a landmark day for Northern Ireland, who claimed their first boxing medals for 16 years as three of their men won title fights.
