(CNN) -- The lawyer for a U.S. man being held in Aruba in connection with the case of a missing American woman urged authorities on Sunday to release his client.
Lopez denied statements by prosecutors that his client is no longer cooperating with authorities in the investigation.
This weekend, authorities said that crews searching for the missing woman have looked in Aruban phosphate mines.
Stein said Friday that the suspect will appear in court Monday, where an investigating magistrate could order him held for at least eight more days, order him to remain on the island or release him outright due to a lack of evidence.
"In anticipation of any possible reason of prolongation of the client's detention, we can state that no felony has been committed by him," Lopez said in his Sunday statement.
