(CNN) -- Joran van der Sloot returns to a Peruvian courtroom on Wednesday, five days after requesting more time to "reflect" on what plea he will make in his murder trial.
This was the latest twist in a case that has made international headlines, in part because of the circumstances of the killing but also because van der Sloot was arrested twice, but never charged, in the 2005 disappearance of U.S. teenager Natalee Holloway.
On Wednesday, van der Sloot is expected to finally give his plea in the Lima courtroom.
Holloway was last seen leaving a nightclub with van der Sloot and two other men.
Van der Sloot was arrested twice but never charged in Holloway's disappearance, which is still unsolved.
The victim's family, including her father, Ricardo Flores, had pushed for stiffer charges and said that van der Sloot hasn't looked "remorseful" in court appearances.
Besides the Flores murder trial, van der Sloot also faces possible extradition to the United States.
