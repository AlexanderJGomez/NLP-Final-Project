Aberdeen, Maryland (CNN) -- The man who abducted the mother of Baltimore Orioles legend Cal Ripken Jr. from her Maryland home restrained her and appeared to have used her credit cards, a law enforcement official said Wednesday.
Aberdeen police said that they have no knowledge of a ransom being demanded or paid, and that Cal Ripken apparently wasn't contacted.
He also said police don't know of any relationship between the suspect and the Ripken family.
Police believe the suspect drove the woman's silver 1998 Lincoln Towncar throughout central Maryland but they aren't sure of precise locations and counties.
Rich Wolf, a spokesman for the FBI in Baltimore, said the FBI is helping local police investigate the case.
He died in 1999.
