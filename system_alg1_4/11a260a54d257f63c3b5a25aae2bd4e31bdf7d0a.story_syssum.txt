(CNN) -- Syrian commanders say their troops along the border with Iraq are making strides in nabbing militants intent on staging suicide attacks in Baghdad.
Syrian commanders were interviewed by CNN along the border, where Syria and the United States have a complicated relationship.
The United States has long criticized Syria for being a staging ground for insurgents who infiltrate Iraq in the Euphrates River valley of Anbar province and conduct attacks in the towns along that waterway and in Baghdad.
Al-Khaled said Syrian troop outposts are strung along the vast, sandy 385-mile Syria-Iraq border, with 12 soldiers per post.
These jihadi groups belong to different nationalities, such as Egyptians, Saudis, Moroccans, Tunisians, and Libyans that fight in Iraq," Al-Khaled said.
The Syrian military said it has no communication with U.S. commanders along the border -- something that troubles Syrian commanders.
Americans say the errors are tactical or human, he said, but he doubts those assertions because of the U.S. military's acumen and resources.
The U.S. military has not responded to a request for comment.
