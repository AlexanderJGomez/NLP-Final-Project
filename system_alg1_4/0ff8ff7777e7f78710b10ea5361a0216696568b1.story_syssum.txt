(CNN)Every time a snowstorm bears down on Danbury, Connecticut -- which has happened a lot this winter -- students and parents turn to Twitter to find out whether schools will be closed.
Boughton always gets around to the real news eventually.
But on Twitter, at least, many students seem to get the joke.
One twist of the whole thing is that Boughton doesn't even make the call about closing Danbury schools.
Finally, after hours of build-up, the mayor gave people of Danbury the news at 6:21 a.m. Wednesday: Schools would open two hours late.
"That's who I am.
"Because as a parent I don't have time for Twitter."
