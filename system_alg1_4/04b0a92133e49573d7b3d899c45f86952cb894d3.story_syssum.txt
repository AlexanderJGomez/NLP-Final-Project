New York (CNN)When Sharrif Wilson was released after being wrongfully imprisoned for more than 20 years, he couldn't wait to have a hot slice of New York pizza.
Wilson, 38, died Saturday night at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan after suffering from breathing problems and other health issues, less than a year after DNA evidence led to his freedom, according to a statement from his attorney's office.
Yarbough was just 18, and Wilson only 15, when they were accused of murder.
Yarbough and Wilson were already incarcerated when the 1999 rape and murder occurred, according to Adam Perlmutter, Wilson's attorney.
After being wrongfully imprisoned for over 20 years, Lopez passed away at age 55 last September of a massive asthma attack, just days before a scheduled pre-motion conference for his $124 million lawsuit against New York City.
He had been out of prison less than two years, said Jeffrey Deskovic, whose foundation had worked with Lopez to help secure his release.
