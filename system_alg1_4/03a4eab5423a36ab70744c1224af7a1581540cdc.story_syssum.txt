Los Angeles (CNN) -- A decision on if researchers can study Junior Seau's brain for clues to the NFL veteran's suicide will wait until his family meets with elders from their Samoan culture, his family said Monday.
Researchers have contacted the Seau family to request the opportunity to study his brain, Mitchell said last week.
While Mitchell did not identify the researchers making the requests, among the institutions the family could donate Seau's brain to is Boston University's Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy, the research center that found former Chicago Bears safety Dave Duerson suffered degenerative damage to his brain because of repeated hits.
He suffered many concussions, so there is a strong sense that it played a role," said Mitchell, who is also the chaplain for the San Diego Chargers, the team for which Seau played 13 seasons.
"Any allegation that the NFL intentionally sought to mislead players has no merit," it said.
The only way to determine if Seau suffered CTE is to analyze the brain tissue for "hallmarks of the dementia-like disease," Gupta said.
