Given the demographics and family status of many of the women in politics today, there's a pretty good chance that the first female who gets to sit behind the historic Resolute Desk in the Oval Office will be a mother of young children.
It's not and here's why.
They're not waiting until their children are out of the house to make their next political moves.
Even for voters who weren't fans of Palin's political views, she became the new face of women in the arena -- someone knee deep in the details of child-rearing, as well as policymaking and vote counting -- a vision that resonated because most mothers in America are working mothers juggling their own careers and families.
Gillibrand is on at least one short list (if Hillary Clinton keeps her word about not running for president again) of potential Democratic candidates for the White House in 2016.
McMorris is the mother of a 1Â½-year-old daughter and a 5-year-old son, and wields plenty of political power and influence as the highest-ranking Republican woman in Congress.
Political women who embrace electoral leadership while parenting young children are becoming much more common.
The new generation of political women can bring to office a set of life experiences that will inform national policy issues in a new way.
A woman who knows that struggle firsthand might just be the kind of candidate who will be elected to the Oval Office.
