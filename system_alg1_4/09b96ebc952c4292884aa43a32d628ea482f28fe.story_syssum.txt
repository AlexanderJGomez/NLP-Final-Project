(CNN) -- Larry Smith's desire to make sure he's alive to watch his grandchildren grow up was his light bulb moment.
"When they announced I was the winner of the challenge, it was a very emotional experience for me," Smith said.
"During the first day of the program I thought I wouldn't be able to keep up with it because it felt very intimidating and I worried about my weak knees," he said.
"By nature, I think many people are procrastinators, and losing weight was something I always wanted to do but was on my procrastination list," he said.
"The fitness event was one of the hardest things I have ever done in my life," Smith said.
Before the challenge started, Smith had high blood pressure, high sugar glucose levels and did not eat well-balanced meals.
"It took a lot of effort for me to change my lifestyle, but once I started seeing the pounds shed away, it gave me the motivation I needed to keep going," Smith said.
Smith said his goal was simply to get in shape, and he never aspired to win the fitness challenge.
"Paul's program was the jumpstart I needed, and now I am continuing my weight loss journey on my own," he said.
