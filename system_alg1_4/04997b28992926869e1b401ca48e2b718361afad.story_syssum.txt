WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Pirates off the eastern coast of Africa fired on U.S. sailors Saturday as they tried to reach the lifeboat where an American captain is being held, a U.S. official familiar with the situation told CNN.
Richard Phillips reportedly offered himself as a hostage to the pirates during an attack Wednesday on the U.S.-flagged container ship Maersk Alabama in the Indian Ocean.
The crew will not be available to the media in Mombasa," Maersk Ltd. said.
The U.S. Navy -- which is in charge of the situation -- requested help from the FBI to resolve the standoff.
That's kind of the way it is in these communities.
"She has a lot of family there."
The pirate crew had intended to help the pirates holding Phillips but turned back because of the U.S. naval presence, the journalist said.
Pirates have been searching the waters off Africa's coast for the Alabama's lifeboat, a U.S. military official with knowledge of the situation said Friday.

For the U.S. Navy, bringing in more firepower is more than just a means to resolve a hostage situation, said Chris Lawrence, CNN's Pentagon correspondent.
"Well, we got the international news stories on television on the ship and everybody's concerned about the route that we were on because there was always the possibility that we would be approached by pirates," one male passenger said.
