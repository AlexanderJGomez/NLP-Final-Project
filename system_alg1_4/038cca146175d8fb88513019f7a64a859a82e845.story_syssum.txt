Van Marjwik's side next play Germany, who beat Portugal 1-0 in Lviv thanks to Mario Gomez's second-half goal, in a game that never matched the drama of Denmark's victory.
Danish goalkeeper Stephan Andersen was also outstanding, notably when he thwarted Dutch substitute Klaas-Jan Huntelaar after the Schalke forward was sent clear by Wesley Sneijder's wonderful pass with the outside of his right foot.
Van Persie should have scored early on in the game but put his shot wide and later on in the first half the Arsenal striker was thwarted by Danish goalkeeper Stephan Andersen's alertness.
Completely against the run of play, Krohn-Dehli gave Denmark a shock lead after he gathered Simon Poulsen's deflected cross and drilled a shot through the legs of Dutch goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg.
It was not until late in the second half that he forced Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer into a save and for the most part Germany were able to minimize the Portuguese forward's threat.
Germany had arguably shaded a forgettable first-half, with Gomez going close early on with a header that was well saved by Rui Patricio, though Portuguese defender Pepe did hit the upright with a clever shot following a corner.
But it was Gomez who finally broke the deadlock, connecting with Sami Khedira's cross from the right, cleverly guiding a header past Patricio.
