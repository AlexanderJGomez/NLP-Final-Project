ACORN leader Bertha Lewis defends her group at the National Press Club on Tuesday in Washington.
ACORN workers who did perform their tasks properly "did not deserve to have co-workers who did not live up to their standards," Lewis said.
Similar videos were made at other ACORN offices.
ACORN -- which stands for Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now -- was in the headlines during last year's presidential campaign after GOP allegations of falsifying voter registration applicants.
In the videos, some ACORN workers advised the undercover conservative activists how to set up a prostitution business involving underage, foreign girls.
Lewis contends the group also has been responsive to allegations that some canvassers falsified voter registration applications and turned in those who falsified voter registration forms.
One of the shadows over ACORN is an embezzling incident involving Dale Rathke, the brother of ACORN founder Wade Rathke.
She said e-mails from Karl Rove, when he was Bush's top political adviser, show that ACORN was targeted to stop its voter registration efforts because "we were moving too many minorities to vote" and "changing the power dynamics" in local elections.
Lewis said ACORN has been demonized and news about it has served as a Republican fund-raising tool.
She said this form of "modern-day ACORN McCarthyism has got to stop."
"I'm proud to say that they've made it clear to me that I will continue to be tortured for at least another year.
