A nationwide shortage of a commonly used imported drug used in capital punishment has prompted 15 states on Monday to urge the U.S. Justice Department to intervene.
As state attorneys general, we are tasked with enforcing those laws, including in instances where capital punishment is authorized for the most heinous of crimes," according to attorneys general from the 15 states.
States argued the federal agency had routinely released the imported drug for executions, a practice suspended after the judge's ruling.
Some states use a single execution drug, others rely on a three-drug mixture or cocktail.
It was used in a U.S. execution for the first time in December 2010, when it was administered as the first ingredient in a three-drug cocktail used in a lethal injection given to an Oklahoma inmate.
In 2009, Ohio became the first state to perform an execution with a single drug, using a higher  concentration of sodium thiopental.
The European manufacturers of both pentobarbital and sodium  thiopental have opposed using their products for executions in the  United  States.
Only 43 people were executed in the U.S. in 2011, down three from the previous year, and a 56% decline from 13 years ago, when nearly 100 people were put to death.
