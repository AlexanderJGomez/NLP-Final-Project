(CNN)  -- The United Nations has sent police and military patrols to a camp in western Sudan after reports fighting there killed civilians, a U.N. spokesman said Tuesday.
The U.N. African Union Mission in Darfur "is extremely concerned by this serious incident [and the] circumstances will be investigated," the mission said in a statement.
The Sudanese government said it entered the camp to look for "huge quantities of arms and criminals," Nezni said.
The U.N. African Union Mission in Darfur said it sent police and military patrols to Kalma to confirm the details of the incident and provide assistance.
Another 2.7 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of fighting among rebels, government forces, and allied Janjaweed militias.
