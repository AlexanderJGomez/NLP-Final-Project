(CNN) -- Soccer stars have plenty of spare time, and plenty of money, so this week's revelations of players gambling on events during English Premier League matches should come as no surprise.
Former Southampton player Lundekvam is the latest to talk candidly about footballers' vices, revealing that he and other top-flight stars made money out of betting on minor events in games such as the first throw-in or corner kick.
Those were the sorts of thing we had influence over.
Even though what we did, of course, was illegal, it was just a fun thing."
All participants also have a duty to report any such activity," it told CNN.
"One of the examples Claus put forward was that you could bet on the first throw-in," said Bohinen, who retired in 2005.
"It's not well known, but there have been cases," he said.
"At one of my clubs they put an end to gambling on the bus on the way to away games.
The Premier League's highly-paid players have become celebrities, which can make it even harder to admit to a gambling problem when your fans see you as a sporting hero.
"The issue may be getting to admit there is a problem in the first place," said a Sporting Chance spokesperson.
"We've not had a survey or a general questionnaire about the gambling habits of the players," said Carlisle, who was part of the Burnley team which played in the Premier League in the 2009-10 season.
"As a union, we're never going to stop players gambling.
Carlisle refused to blame the Premier League or the FA for their response to gambling and spot-fixing, saying it is the role of the PFA to understand the needs of footballers.
Probably not.
It is the PFA's remit to make sure we're aware of the what the lads are going through and the problems they are facing."
