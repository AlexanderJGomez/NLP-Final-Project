(CNN)It was a very telling mini-scandal, the faux-fury over Michelle Obama's short visit to Saudi Arabia.
But there is a reason, a very good reason, why social media turned its attention sharply toward Michelle Obama in Saudi Arabia.
The presence of an American first lady on Saudi territory embodies the intense unease that surrounds U.S. and Western relations with the Saudi kingdom.
The U.S. needs Saudi Arabia -- and Saudi Arabia needs the U.S.
At the same time, many of Saudi Arabia's practices stand in direct violation of America's -- and the world's -- most cherished values.
In fact, the claim that her attire and performance created a firestorm in Saudi Arabia is plainly false.
Countless prominent women have appeared in public meeting Saudi royals without wearing headscarves.
But it was not committed by the first lady or by King Salman.
The story made headlines because people in the United States and in the West feel a scandal in the relationship, because much of what goes on in Saudi Arabia is an affront not just to Western principles but to human rights conventions endorsed by most of the world.
For decades Saudi women have protested the indefensible rule that bans them from driving, making Saudi Arabia the only country in the world with such a ban.
Saudi women, who are intelligent, strong, competent, mature, capable of making decision for themselves as well as any Saudi man, are treated in many cases as if they were children.
And freedom of expression is severely restricted.
There were 87 such punishments last year.
A condolence call was not the time for public criticism, and Michelle Obama's presence in Riyadh was a meaningful sign that the United States believes women belong in the public sphere.
The scandal was a sign of the frustration people feel with this ethical dilemma.
