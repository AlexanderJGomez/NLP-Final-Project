Bogota, Tennessee (CNN) -- Those who say no man is an island never met Danny Hayes.
Could flip over," Hayes said, standing on the trailer's small porch.
Whatever comes, Hayes said he will not be moved.
The one acre of land Hayes retired to is no longer recognizable to him.
Since the waters began to rise, Hayes said, all manner of animals have swum by the trailer, looking for higher ground.
"Unless it's for your own protection."
But his and his neighbors' homes are safe, Hayes said, while he patrols his small "island."
But Hayes said he never considered leaving.
But with the water slowly receding, it appears that Hayes will be spared from the flood's wet grasp.
Asked what he will do while the floodwaters retreat, Hayes replied with a ready joke.
