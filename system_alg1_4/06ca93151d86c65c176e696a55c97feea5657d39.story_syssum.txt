Beijing (CNN) -- The death toll may climb after a series of earthquakes in southwestern China killed at least 80 people and injured 731, a state-run news agency reported Saturday.
Initial estimates put the "direct economic losses" from the tremors at more than half a billion dollars, the news agency said.
Four earthquakes struck near the border of the provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou between 11:19 a.m. and 1:12 p.m. local time, the U.S. Geological Survey said.
