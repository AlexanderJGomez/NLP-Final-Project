(CNN) -- If anyone deserved the death penalty, it was Clayton Lockett.
On Tuesday night, Lockett was scheduled to die by lethal injection -- the preferred means for executing criminals in states that allow for the death penalty.
Instead of putting Lockett to sleep and stopping his heart, the administration of the lethal injection caused his vein to burst, and about 45 minutes later, he died of a heart attack.
Like I said, if anyone deserved the death penalty, it was Lockett, but the real debate is whether we need to be in the business of trying to find the least cruel and least unusual way to kill anyone voluntarily.
Not at all.
The extended period required to ensure that the death penalty is appropriate -- that all options and appeals have been exhausted before resorting to the ultimate punishment -- is an essential safeguard in a civilized society.
Even with this long process of appeals, our system is far from perfect.
A recent report from Amnesty International shows the average cost to carry a death penalty case from prosecution to execution is three to 10 times more than a case with a life sentence.
The excruciatingly long, and necessary, appeals process in death penalty cases cost taxpayers millions for each case, and it draws resources away from other important prosecutions.
But is the death penalty justice?
I've tried death penalty cases, and I've been lucky: None of my clients has ever been sent to death row.
You may be surprised to know that in many death penalty cases, which last for years, defense lawyers get to know victims' families.
The death penalty is flawed in every conceivable way, and it should be abolished.
