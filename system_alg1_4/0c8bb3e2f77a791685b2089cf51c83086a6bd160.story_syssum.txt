Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel approved Wednesday the construction of a settlement in East Jerusalem just before U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is to visit the country on a peace mission.
Wednesday's approval of a 69-unit settlement in East Jerusalem -- which Palestinians consider to be the capital of their future state one day -- harkens to an incident in 2010 when Israel announced another East Jerusalem settlement during a visit by Vice President Joe Biden.
The approval by an Israeli planning committee was part of a "very long process" and now means that construction can start at any time, Margalit said.
This means that Israel has no serious intentions to restart the peace process," Margalit said.
Brachie Sprung, an advisor to the Jerusalem mayor, said construction permission was granted by local planning and building committee.
Hagit Ofran, settlement watch director for the Israeli activist group Peace Now, said the construction plan was initially filed in April 2012, and the length of time behind its approval is typical.
