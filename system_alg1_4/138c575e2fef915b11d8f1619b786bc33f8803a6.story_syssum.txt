Former CIA chief Michael Hayden said Sunday it is wrong to make interrogation methods public.
That's very valuable information," Hayden said during an appearance on "Fox News Sunday."
It's there."
Hayden said he called several senior White House officials to express his opposition before the president released the documents.
Such techniques "undermine our moral authority and do not make us safer," he said Thursday, when the White House released the memos.
McCaskill, a member of the Senate's standing investigative subcommittee, said the Obama administration made the right decision by agreeing not to prosecute intelligence officers.
Hayden said the administration's decision to release the Bush administration memos will make CIA officials less willing to engage in interrogation tactics now sanctioned by the federal government.
Hayden also said that, contrary to the assertions of many critics, the interrogation techniques in question had forced suspected terrorists to reveal valuable information and made the country safer.
And Graham said that while he was concerned that the release of the memos was a "huge tactical and strategic mistake done for political reasons," the decision to allow certain enhanced interrogation techniques was a mistake as well.
