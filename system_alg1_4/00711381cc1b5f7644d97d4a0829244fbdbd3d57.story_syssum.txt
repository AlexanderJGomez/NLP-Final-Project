Turbulence struck the flight, from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Houston, Texas, unexpectedly, injuring seven passengers badly enough to require hospitalization after the pilot diverted the flight to Miami, Florida.
Police said 26 passengers were injured, four seriously.
"Very rarely does it hurt passengers, which is odd because a lot of them don't keep their seat belts on."
At least two of those deaths involved passengers who reportedly were not wearing seat belts while the seat-belt sign was on.
"The majority of injuries actually happen to flight attendants," Dorr said.
In Monday's accident, passengers reported they were slammed into the Boeing 767's ceiling -- some said two or more times -- when the plane dropped rapidly.
Passengers said most of those injured were not wearing seat belts.
No passengers were reported seriously injured in turbulence incidents in 2008, and five flight attendants -- down from a high of 19 in 2003 -- received serious injuries, according to the FAA.
All licensed pilots also receive "upset training," which teaches how to deal with extreme turbulence, he said.
