(CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is considering how to best regulate electronic cigarettes as tobacco products.
Big Tobacco will then get to decide which products are sold such that it can manage its own transition from cigarettes to e-cigarettes, or end e-cigarettes as a product category entirely, whichever better serves its financial interests.
Electronic cigarettes, also known as vapor products, are designed to mimic the experience of smoking.
There are hundreds of online suppliers, many of which have been pioneers in developing next-generation vapor products known as "mods" or "vaporizers."
Vapor products are increasingly attracting consumers.
In France, e-cigarettes have helped reduce tobacco smoking according to one survey.
All consumer products are regulated, and e-cigarettes should not be an exception.
The FDA should consider creating a tailored regulatory framework, one that would allow the e-cigarette industry to continue innovating to the point that smoked tobacco is made redundant, which could help save many lives worldwide.
The FDA should also conduct epidemiological research to make sure that e-cigarettes are contributing positively to smoking rate decline.
If you start from the precautionary principal -- treat something as bad until proved good -- you miss the context that e-cigarettes are designed to replace one of the most dangerous consumer products invented.
