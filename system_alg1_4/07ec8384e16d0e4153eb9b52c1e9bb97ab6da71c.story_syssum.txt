Medea Benjamin, who co-founded the Code Pink anti-war group, said she was detained on arrival at Cairo airport Monday evening.
I was detained as soon as I arrived and I was violently assaulted in prison," she said by phone on arrival in Turkey.
An official from Egypt's Interior Ministry communications department said Benjamin had not been detained.
"There is no legal basis to detain her."
He also said that he had no information on whether Benjamin had been banned from Egypt.
"Due to the political and security issues in Egypt, there are no guarantees that we will be able to get into Gaza," the group said.
