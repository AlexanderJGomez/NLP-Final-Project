That ruling came as the Pentagon has begun advising recruiting commands that they can accept openly gay and lesbian recruit candidates, according to a Pentagon spokeswoman.
The recruiters were told that if a candidate admits he or she is openly gay, and qualify under normal recruiting guidelines, their application can be processed.
"The bottom line: if you come out now, it can be used against you in the future by the Pentagon."
Former Army Lt. Daniel Choi, an Iraq war combat veteran who challenged "don't ask, don't tell" and was discharged, moved to rejoin the military Tuesday afternoon.
Choi said he told recruiters he was gay and that there was no reaction or delay in the enlistment process.
"Once a Marine, always a Marine," said Rodriguez-Kennedy, a corporal who was honorably discharged in February 2008.
Recruiters told him Tuesday there were no current slots and they would call him in January, Rodriguez-Kennedy said.
"I love the Marine Corps," he said.
They referred inquiries to the Pentagon.
