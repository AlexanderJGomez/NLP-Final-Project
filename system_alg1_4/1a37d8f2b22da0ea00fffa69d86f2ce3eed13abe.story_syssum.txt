(CNN) -- A few dozen protesters picketed the restaurants of acclaimed chef Thomas Keller last weekend, over his use of an ingredient that has become a lightning rod in the culinary world -- foie gras.
"We are the easiest target in the world for a couple of reasons, one our accent, it's called foie gras, it's a French word," Daguin tells CNN.
It's easy to say that we don't need a meat organ to survive or to live.
Only three farms in the United States produce foie gras.
D'Artagnan gets its foie gras from Hudson Valley Foie Gras, two hours north of New York City, which produces about 375,000 pounds of the delicacy a year.
"The idea that you can produce the products that we produce -- that are a delicacy -- by mistreating animals is just completely, it's inconceivable," Henley says.
Veterinarians say the bird lacks a gag reflex and their esophagus is lined with collagen, which makes it insensitive to pain.
"When we force-feed ducks and geese and we stop the force-feeding, the liver recesses to normal," Daguin says.
"The key will be both banning the sale and getting restaurants to just remove it voluntarily and not sell it," Pease said.
But foie gras producers say they're being targeted by people whose ultimate goal is a meat-free world.
Still, there may be middle ground.
Chef Dan Barber, inspired by the work of a Spanish foie gras producer, Eduardo Sousa, has begun experimenting with  "ethical foie gras,"  harvested from geese allowed to roam Stone Barns Center in Pocantico Hills, New York., foraging for food, according to their natural feeding cycles.
