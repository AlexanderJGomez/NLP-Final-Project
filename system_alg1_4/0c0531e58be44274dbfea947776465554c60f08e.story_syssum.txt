The American Medical Association Alliance, pointing to research that big-screen smoking leads teens to pick up the tobacco habit, called for an R rating for any movie with smoking scenes.
"In all, 56 percent of the top box office movies with smoking released between May 2007 and May 2009 were youth-rated films -- G, PG or PG-13," he said.
The association has given no G ratings in the past two years to a movie with smoking, Graves said.
A G movie is deemed suitable for all audiences, while a PG rating is a signal to parents that a film may include some material they might consider inappropriate for children.
A spokesman for Twentieth Century Fox, the studio responsible for the Wolverine movie series, said Jackman's cigar was never lit and it was limited to just two scenes.
" Frost said.
They began factoring smoking scenes into the ratings two years ago as "a reflection of changes in society and health concerns," she said.
"Any movie with smoking should be rated R," he said.
Graves, whose committee makes the decisions, indicated such a zero-tolerance policy would not be accepted.
