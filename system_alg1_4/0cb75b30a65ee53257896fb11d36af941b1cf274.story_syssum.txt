"And I think that understanding the history of the Confederacy and understanding the history of the Civil War is something that every American and every young American should be part of."
As we approach the 150th anniversary of the Civil War, we look back to its centennial in the 1960s.
During the 1960s, we Americans looked at the war as it occurred on the battlefields, because the conduct and course of the war dominated every single moment of every day.
Today, the study of Confederate history is much more "inclusive" -- to use the word of choice for many state's 150th anniversary commissions -- as we look more deeply into the past.
Today we ask different questions of history and I think we get better answers.
So now we look long and hard at this aspect of American history, including its existence and importance in the North.
Why did many take advantage of the first opportunity to escape to freedom while others remained "loyal" to the South?
What about the very important Jewish community in the South?
We Americans -- from native Americans to those who have ancestors who wore the blue or gray to those who are descended from slaves to those who have recently come to our shores -- want to know ourselves.
And to know the Civil War, we must know and understand the Confederacy -- in all of its diversity.
