FAIRBURN, Georgia (CNN) -- In a south Atlanta neighborhood lined with palatial homes and manicured lots, the Hicks family was living out its American dream.
"I've always been looking in this subdivision, but never thought we could afford a home here," Terese Hicks said.
The interest-only, adjustable rate loan sounded good at the time.
It all seemed like a dream come true, until the couple learned the interest rate on their loan would readjust in just six months, making the loan a short three-year ARM.
Struggling to pay the new adjusted mortgage, Terese Hicks appealed to their mortgage company, Homecomings which is owned by GMAC, for help.
She continued to make regular payments for all of their mortgages in order to maintain their good credit.
"In order for us to have been able to modify the loan we needed to get permission on the investor on whose behalf we are servicing the loan," said Jeanine Bruin of GMAC.
The Hicks family's story is one that Marcia Griffin, founder of HomeFree-USA, has heard all too often.
"We advise homebuyers not to talk to a realtor or lender before we can meet with them for a Mortgage Profile Meeting," said Griffin.
During the recent housing crisis, Griffin says people of color have become "easy prey" because they often don't know the right questions to ask about subprime and ARM loans.
Griffin believes families like the Hicks could have qualified for a better, less risky loan and should have been better informed about the terms of their loan.
The Hicks family learned that they qualified for President Obama's new homeownership assistance program.
Griffin hopes other homebuyers can learn from the Hickses' situation and seek out an advocate early in the process of refinancing or modifying a loan -- before they are caught in a financial storm.
