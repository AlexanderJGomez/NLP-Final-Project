The round-ups began May 28, days after the two main political parties said they would not cooperate with the military-backed caretaker government on organizing the elections.
The Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said hundreds of their party members had been taken into custody.
"It is not politically motivated," he said.
The two women who head the parties -- Sheikh Hasina of the Awami League and Khaleda Zia of the BNP -- are in police custody on corruption-related charges.
The current political crisis in the Muslim-majority South Asian country of 150 million can be traced, in large part, to the lingering animosity between the two women, political observers say.
After its last stint in power ended in 2006, the BNP handed over rule to a caretaker government to conduct elections, as mandated by the country's constitution.
It also postponed elections until it said it could clean up the country's graft-ridden politics.
The rules allowed authorities to arrest people without a warrant as long as there was reasonable suspicion that he or she was connected to a crime, Human Rights Watch said.
The government wants to hold elections in the third week of December, and said the crusade on crime is part of its plan to ensure trouble-free balloting.
"The government is conducting political dialogue with small parties.
A similar release for Zia was also expected.
In addition to political party members, the crackdown has also swept up several journalists.
"That actually makes the arrests suspicious in some people's minds," said Sultana Kamal, executive director of the legal aid group, Ain o Salish Kendro (Law and Adjudication Center).
