The kind of battle we are seeing in Florida -- where Democrats and Republicans will go to court over whether early voting should span 14 days or eight -- simply does not happen in Germany, Canada, Britain or France.
In Germany, an independent federal returning officer oversees a complex state and federal voting system.
No voting system is perfect.
Politicians of one party do not set voting schedules to favor their side and harm the other.
Voting delays are notorious.
Al Gore's campaign, desperate to win the state, asked a judge to extend voting for three more hours in the heavily Democratic city -- but only in the city.
Lines were lengthy in St. Louis City because in the United States, almost uniquely, local governments choose how voting is cast and counted.
In any other democracy, voters nationwide would have cast their votes on the same kind of balloting equipment, subject to the same rules.
The voting would have been overseen by a national election commission, not by local judges, who might be nonpartisan -- but who very well might not.
The American voting system too is an exception: It is the most error-prone, the most susceptible to fraud, the most vulnerable to unfairness and one of the least technologically sophisticated on earth.
