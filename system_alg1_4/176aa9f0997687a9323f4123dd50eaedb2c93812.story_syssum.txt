The corrections department's Board of Parole Hearings granted parole for the 71-year-old Davis following his 28th parole suitability hearing on Wednesday.
Jerry Brown will have 30 days more to nullify or modify the decision -- meaning that, if everything goes his way, Davis could still be looking at another four months behind bars.
In January 2010 and October 2012, the parole board granted him parole.
If this time proves different, Davis would become the first Manson "family" member to be freed solely for good behavior.
Manson is serving a life sentence for his role in nine murders.
