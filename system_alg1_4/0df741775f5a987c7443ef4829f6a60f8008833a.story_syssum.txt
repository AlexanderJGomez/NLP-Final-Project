(CNN) -- Former CNN anchor Lou Dobbs said Thursday said neither he nor his companies have ever hired illegal immigrants and it was not his responsibility to check their papers.
But Macdonald said that the situation involved Dobbs and his Dobbs Group hiring contractors that she said used undocumented workers.
"I have documented that undocumented workers have been fundamental in the maintenance of your estate in West Palm Beach," said Macdonald.
That doesn't sit well with me," Dobbs told the author.
Macdonald said Dobbs is responsible for those working at his properties.
In the article, several people identified as current or former workers on Dobbs' properties say they were in the United States illegally at the time.
In particular, he has said that employers who hire illegal immigrants should be prosecuted.
According to the article, the man said an old friend worked at a stable owned by Dobbs and promised the man work as a groom at a Vermont stable contracted to care for horses owned by the Dobbs Group, which is headed by Dobbs.
Several workers are quoted in the article as saying they believe that Hillary Dobbs knew about their lack of legal papers.
"You put out an article that is being used by the left-wing press as a hammer on me," Dobbs told Macdonald.
"Your listeners deserve to know the truth," said Macdonald.
Dobbs said he has done nothing wrong and is being targeted.
