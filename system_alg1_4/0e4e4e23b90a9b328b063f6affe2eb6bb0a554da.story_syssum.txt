LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A plea deal has been reached in the assault case against singer Chris Brown, defense attorney Mark Geragos said in a hearing Monday.
"This is not an easy sentence," Gibbons said.
Brown had previously pleaded not guilty to felony counts of assault and making criminal threats in connection with an attack on Rihanna.
Schnegg told Rihanna, who was wearing a black dress with white pearls around her neck, that she would consider lifting the order after Brown completes his domestic violence counseling but advised Rihanna not to contact Brown.
Rihanna's attorney, Donald Etra, said Rihanna made the request because she felt that a protective order in place, requiring that Brown not annoy or harass her, was sufficient.
"His sentence is not based on what he's available to do," Gibbons said.
Brown "embraces this as an opportunity to get his life back on track and get his career back on track," Geragos said, adding that Brown will speak further after his sentencing.
Rihanna had not attended any of the hearings in the case but had been following the case closely, Etra said earlier.
The statement, filed with the court to support a search warrant for cell phone records, described a brutal attack against Rihanna, allegedly by Brown.
Eventually, "Robyn F. began screaming for help and Brown exited the vehicle and walked away.
At the end of his statement, the detective said Brown sent a text message nine days later, apologizing.
