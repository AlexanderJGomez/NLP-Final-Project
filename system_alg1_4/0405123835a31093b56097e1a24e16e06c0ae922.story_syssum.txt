(CNN)When Kyesha Smith Wood heard that her teen daughters were rude to another patron who asked them to be quiet at a local movie theater, she was furious.
"After the movie she approached my girls and told them that her husband had been laid off and this was the last movie she would be able to take her daughter to for a while and my girls ruined that for her," wrote Wood, who asked the woman to contact her.
The woman Wood was trying to reach is Rebecca Boyd, who saw the sheriff's department post and contacted her.
Glad they are learning a lesson.
I am so humbled by that."
