More than 300,000 customers remained without electricity Monday across Ontario, including 200,000 in Toronto, officials reported, in the wake of what Mayor Rob Ford called one of the worst ice storms to hit the city.
Toronto Hydro CEO Anthony Haines said major power lines are being restored at a rate of one every few minutes, but street-to-street work remains, and he couldn't offer a guarantee everyone will have power by Christmas.
Ford said 100 trucks from other cities were on their way to Toronto to help restore power to more people.
At least five people died in Kentucky floodwaters, two people died in Mississippi storms, and one person died in a traffic accident during Missouri's severe weather, officials said.
New York City set a record high Sunday at 71 degrees, National Weather Service meteorologist Ashley Sears said.
And in northern New England, another round of snow and ice is set for Monday, the National Weather Service said.
She sent photos of some of the countless icicles in her neighborhood.
Coastal and valley rain as well as mountain snow is in the forecast through Tuesday, the service said.
