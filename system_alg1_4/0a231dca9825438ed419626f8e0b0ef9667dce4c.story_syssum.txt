But it is that pursuit of peace, with all its contradictions and all its sacrifices, that remains the centerpiece of Memorial Day.
There is a dichotomy intrinsic to wars waged in pursuit of peace -- an uneasy divide between lightness and shadows.
It's the Alfred Eisenstaedt photo of the sailor and the nurse embracing in Times Square.
But there would be no photo of the sailor and the nurse were it not for scenes no one likes to see in photographs: the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that brought the awful years of war to a close.
Sometimes, when we were traveling together and he would be attending a military reunion, someone would approach him with a copy of the photo.
To let the soldiers, sailors, aviators and Marines go home at last, to rejoin their families or start new families, to somehow, after all the suffering and all the heartbreak, find peace.
Peace is the sun-dappled result, but getting there can be a path of darkness upon darkness.
All the lightness and all the shadows, all the wars waged at terrible costs, all in pursuit of peace.
Because it sounds so simple while remaining so rare.
