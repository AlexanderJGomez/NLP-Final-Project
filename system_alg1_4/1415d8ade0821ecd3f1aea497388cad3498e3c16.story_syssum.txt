(CNN) -- A potent storm system socked the Mid-Atlantic and as far north as New York on Thursday, lashing the region with damaging hail, strong winds and pelting rains.

The National Weather Service documented scores of other such reports, including ones indicating hail the size of golf balls in locales from Hamden, New York, to Roxbury Mills, Maryland.
New York state got its share of bad weather as well, with the weather service tweeting that there was a tornado in Delanson.
The system caused temporary headaches for those traveling in and out of the region, with all traffic bound for New Jersey's Newark airport, New York's LaGuardia airport and Philadelphia's airport not allowed to take off until after 6:30 p.m.
Frontier Airlines tweeted that its call center there was evacuated due to the storm, around the same time Denver International Airport urged travelers to be on-guard for instructions if the situation takes a sudden turn for the worse.
