Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Bangkok turned into a war zone Wednesday as Thai military forces cracked down on anti-government protesters, ending a tense standoff that has troubled the capital for weeks.
The chaotic day left at least five people dead as Bangkok residents endured an edgy and unsettled night.
"I would like to give moral support to officers who are doing their duties now and would like to reassure you," Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva told citizens.
The government considered the demonstrators to be terrorists, and army Col. Sansern Kaewkamnerd said that growing violence necessitated the use of force.
He said the government had regained full control and Red Shirt leaders had fled or were taken into police custody.
Hours after the large military operation got under way, soldiers took control of the park area.
At least five people, including an Italian journalist, were listed as killed by the Police Hospital in Bangkok.
"We Thai people never experienced this kind of situation before," said Sirinun Siripanich, the assistant secretary to the Bangkok governor.
"Negotiations failed because core [opposition] leaders are not to be able to make decisions by themselves," the statement said, alluding to an outside force influencing the protesters.
The Red Shirt opposition members support former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a bloodless 2006 military coup.
"I never approve nor agree to any use of violence," he said.
The violence prompted the United Nations' top human rights official to implore anti-government protesters and government officials to resume talks.
