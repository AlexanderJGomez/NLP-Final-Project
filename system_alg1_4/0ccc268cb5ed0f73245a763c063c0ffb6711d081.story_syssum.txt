Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of Renault-Nissan, told CNN's Max Foster that the company is targeting a "totally autonomous" car by 2020.
"People on average in the world spend two hours in a car per day," he said.
And Ghosn said some of the technology needed for a driverless car is in the new model.
"They are the number one most sold car in Europe, more than 240,000, presenting more than 30% of sales," Ghosn said.
The bad news is that if there is growth, it's going to be very small."
