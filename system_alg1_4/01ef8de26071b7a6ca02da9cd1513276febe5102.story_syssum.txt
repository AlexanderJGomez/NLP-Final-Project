Police shot and killed Ahmed, Louisiana State Police Col. Michael Edmonson said.
Ahmed had with him a book on torture and a bag with items he could use to torture people, state police Trooper Albert Paxton said Thursday.
Police said Ahmed, 20, was known to police, and Edmonson described him as a paranoid schizophrenic.
After word got out about the hostage situation, local, state and federal law enforcement agents descended on the usually quiet community.
