If "French chic" has become synonymous with the elegance, grace and style of its country's powerhouse fashion labels and catwalk shows, this weekend that glamor will be out in force on a very different type of track -- the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.
"The French style is very classic.
While Parisian race-goers adhere to a more classic style, one fashion accessory appears universal -- the obligatory outrageous hat.
Set on the picturesque Longchamp racecourse in Paris, "the Arc," as it is known, prides itself on being Europe's most prestigious -- and richest -- horse race.
For the super rich wanting to beat the crowds, a helicopter flying from London to Issy-les-Moulineaux in Paris will take around one hour and 45 minutes -- and set you back a whopping Â£5,480 ($8,874).
Founded in 1920, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe was named after the very monument built in honor of French allied forces during World War One.
But its chances now look unlikely after drawing the far outside stall 18, where just one horse has won in the 92-year history of the race.
Whatever the outcome, one thing is for sure, the French crowd will be celebrating in style.
