Washington (CNN) -- Sen. John McCain called Monday for the United States to lead a military coalition to help the Syrian opposition rid the country of President Bashar al-Assad.
"To say they are leading from behind is too general," he said.
"Russia is unlikely to ever support a policy of regime change in Syria," he said.
Though some foreign military assistance appears to be reaching the opposition, it is not enough to be decisive, and may just prolong the crisis, which could prove detrimental, McCain said.
Already, some analysts say that opposition forces may be creating some areas of de facto control, along the border with Turkey and in eastern Syria, McCain said.
"It's not a civil war because all the military strength is on one side, and not the other," he said.
