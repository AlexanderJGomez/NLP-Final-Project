An adjunct professor of French at Duquesne University.
The minimum pay for adjunct faculty at Duquesne used to be $2500 per course.
The dirty little secret is that higher education is staffed with an insufficiently resourced, egregiously exploited, contingent "new faculty majority."
We are living a lie that cheats these professors and the students they teach, particularly in access universities and community colleges where adjunct faculty numbers, like percentages of lower-income students, are highest and instructional spending per student is lowest.
Certainly, the institution's wealth ($171 million endowment, tuition over $28,000) and Catholic status (Catholic social doctrine supports collective bargaining rights) make the situation -- and Duquesne's refusal to recognize a union that adjunct faculty voted for overwhelmingly -- particularly indefensible.
So Duquesne should recognize the adjunct union, bargain in good faith, grant benefits and set up a professional development fund in Vojtko's name.
Or can we muster the collective will to appropriately remunerate and honor the work of all working Americans?
Some are involved with caucuses within unions and professional associations where they gather data about pay and working conditions, define best practices, and work to ensure that adjunct faculty are not discriminated against.
Adjuncts are organizing for benefits, a living wage, and conditions that will benefit their students and their schools.
American higher education can and should do better for those who teach our students.
