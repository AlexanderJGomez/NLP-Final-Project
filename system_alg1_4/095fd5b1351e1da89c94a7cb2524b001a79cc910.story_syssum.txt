Government spokesman Abdu Ganadi told CNN said Saleh's forces "are near victory."
But Abdulqawi Al-Qaisi, a spokesman for Al-Ahmar, said "All government claims of victory are fabricated, and our forces are still on the ground."
Saleh has ruled Yemen since 1978, and the nation has been a key U.S. ally in the battle against the al Qaeda terrorist network.
"We asked them why they were going to Sanaa armed," said Mujaili.
Yemeni state television reported that government forces had beaten back tribal fighters from areas of the capital near the Ministry of Tourism building on Thursday, and Sanaa residents reported hearing explosions near the presidential palace, a government source said.
A security official at Sanaa International Airport said inbound and outbound flights were halted due because of security concerns over clashes near the airport.
