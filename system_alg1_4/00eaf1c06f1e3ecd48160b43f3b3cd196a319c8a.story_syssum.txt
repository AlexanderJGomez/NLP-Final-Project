Biochar's high carbon content and porous nature can help soil retain water, nutrients, protect soil microbes.
The raw material can be any forest, agricultural or animal waste.
Its high carbon content and porous nature can help soil retain water, nutrients, protect soil microbes and ultimately increase crop yields while acting as natural carbon sink - sequestering CO2 and locking it into the ground.
"Soil acts as an enormous carbon pool, increasing this carbon pool could significantly contribute to the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere," said Christoph Steiner, one of the leading research scientist studying biochar.
Worldwide use of biochar could cut CO2 levels by 8 parts per million within 50 years, according to NASA scientist James Hansen.
The process of making biochar can also lead to other valuable products.
"These terra preta soils are older than 500 years and they are still black soil and very rich in carbon," said Steiner, a professor at the University of Georgia.
But still more large-scale tests need to be conducted before biochar technology can be rolled out on a global scale.
"They can become the new affluent."
