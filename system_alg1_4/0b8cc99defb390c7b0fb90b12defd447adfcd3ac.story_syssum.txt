"Admired in every corner of the world," Biden said of Blinken in a tweet that included a picture of the two of them strapped inside an aircraft.
John McCain of Arizona and Marco Rubio of Florida made it clear at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing that they would oppose Blinken's nomination.
McCain pointed to statements Blinken made then that "Iraq has never been so prosperous, so powerful, and peaceful as it is today," as reason enough for preventing his nomination.
Blinken was confirmed Tuesday by a vote of 55 to 38.
