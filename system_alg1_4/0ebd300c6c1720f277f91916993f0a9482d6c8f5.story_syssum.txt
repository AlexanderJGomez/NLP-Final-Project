Photojournalist Jonathan Alpeyrie was in the city in May and returned two weeks ago to find it battle-scarred and slowly draining of life as its people flee.
The images he has captured show the anguish of the immediate aftermath of shelling -- the relatives of victims, people left homeless, the dead.
You also get people who stay because they don't want to leave their homes.
"People do get killed.
"It's always hard when we see people getting killed where you are, that's tough, because they're just regular people and they're not really involved in the war," he says.
"You can hang out with them if you want, but since just they get hit all the time and as you can't take pictures or photos there's no reason to hang out with them," Alpeyrie says.
However, recently Alpeyrie and some colleagues got lucky -- obtaining rare images of a rebel funeral.
