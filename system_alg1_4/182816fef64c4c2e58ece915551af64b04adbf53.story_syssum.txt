(CNN) -- Tim Masters squarely blames Fort Collins, Colorado, police and prosecutors for his inability to land gainful employment and for his not having a wife and kids at this stage in his life.
Masters was convicted of murder in 1999, but a judge last year threw out the conviction and released him from prison, citing new evidence that did not implicate Masters.

Things can be tough sometimes, but anything is better than prison, Masters said of his first year as a free man since being imprisoned.
Masters: Yeah, I think that has a lot to do with it.
That's it.
I go to the auction, and I bid on stuff.
You list the item on eBay and let it run its course through the auction for usually seven days.
Masters: Not enough.
This goes along with the eBay business.
I go through his warehouse, take pictures of all the new stuff he's got in and I list it on eBay for him.
Masters: Maybe cell phones?
Now, I don't know what I'd do if I didn't have a cell phone.
Masters: There's so much.
I think they're very much responsible for me not having a family right now, a wife and kids.

Masters: Yeah, that went to hell when I went to Europe.
Masters: No.
Masters: I don't want to talk to them at all.
Masters: Mainly, [former prosecutors, now Judges] Jolene Blair and Terri Gilmore and [Fort Collins police Lt.] Jim Broderick, but there are a few other defendants involved and the city, but in my mind those are the big three.
Masters: I don't know what I'd say to them.
Masters: I try to stay away from Fort Collins.
Masters: Yeah, and every time I go over there I feel like I'm on the defensive, every time I see a police car with someone pulled over or something -- well, let me give you an example.
They did it to me before.
Masters: Yeah, pretty much.
