The USNS Vandenberg was intentionally sunk Wednesday to create an artificial reef for marine life.
The 17,250-ton ship sank in less than two minutes, said Andy Newman, spokesman for the Florida Keys Tourism Council.
Newman, who was circling in a helicopter above the 522-foot-long ship, said the Vandenberg appeared to rest in a level position on the Gulf floor.
To sink the Vandenberg, holes were made above the waterline in the side of the ship and throughout various decks, Newman said.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration projects that the Vandenberg artificial reef will result in an annual increase of about $7.5 million in expenditures in the economy of Monroe County, which includes Key West.
After Japan surrendered, the Vandenberg was the first Navy ship to return to New York Harbor.
In the 1960s the Air Force used the Vandenberg to track missiles.
Four men who had served on the Vandenberg traveled to Key West to see the ship go to its final resting place.
The largest ship ever scuttled to create an artificial reef was the decommissioned aircraft carrier USS Oriskany, which sank to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico off the Florida coast in 2006, according to the U.S. Navy.
It sank in water about 212 feet deep.
