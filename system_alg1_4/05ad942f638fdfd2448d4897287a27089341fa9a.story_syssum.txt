It's that reality the country's principal opposition group says led it to suspend its participation in next week's meeting in Rome of the Friends of Syria -- an international conference of diplomats from more than 60 nations working to bring about an end to the violence.
The whole world is not doing anything," Adib Shishakly, a member of the Syrian National Coalition, told CNN on Friday.
Alawites are an offshoot of Shiite Islam.
But countries have stopped short of providing military aid as many did to Libyan rebels over concerns about the unity of the fractious Syrian opposition.
The news that the National Coalition was pulling out of the meeting came as a surprise to the United States where at least one senior U.S. official warned the move would be counterproductive.
The National Coalition, meanwhile, is pushing ahead with plans to create a transitional government despite al-Assad's refusal to cede power.
The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said 213 people killed in fighting across the country Friday.
The deaths in Aleppo, according to the opposition, occurred when Scud missiles were fired Friday by government forces at rebel strongholds in predominantly residential neighborhoods.
The United Nations recently estimated 70,000 people died in the fighting in Syria.
