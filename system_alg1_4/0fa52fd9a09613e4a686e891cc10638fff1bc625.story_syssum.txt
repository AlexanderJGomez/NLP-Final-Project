Tours highlighting sites used during the filming of "The Sound of Music" have many visitors singing with joy in Salzburg, Austria.
It seemed to be very popular," said Kelly Van Baren, a sales manager who lives in suburban Chicago, Illinois.
The movie was played on the bus during the tour, and the sightseers were encouraged to sing along, prompting Van Baren to wonder what the locals must think of the visitors.
Movie and TV fans who want to stay closer to home to explore famous locations have plenty of movie tours to choose from in the United States.
