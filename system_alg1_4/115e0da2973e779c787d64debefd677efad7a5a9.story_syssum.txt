Anton Caluori, 31, was arrested Tuesday at his home in Federal Way, a Seattle, Washington, suburb, Agent Bryan Molnar said in an affidavit.
A database check confirmed that Caluori lived at the address in the e-mail," Molnar said in his affidavit, and the username of the e-mail account appeared consistent with his name.
Molnar said he and Federal Way police officer Andy Hensing went to the apartment complex at the address, where an employee told them Caluori was a "hothead" with a "temper" who lived with his mother.
Caluori's right hand was placed out-of-view behind his back," the affidavit said.
Caluori continued to struggle and would not comply with our commands," Molnar said in the affidavit.
Molnar said one of them asked Caluori if there was anything in the apartment that "would hurt" law officers and he replied, "There are things inside that go boom."
The safety was not engaged," the affidavit said.
in the affidavit, said Caluori "spends a lot of time on the computer" but she "does not know what he does on it."
After reading Caluori his Miranda rights, Molnar asked him if he knew why the police were at the scene.
Call the CIA or run it up the chain of command," Molnar said.
This situation is indicative of how a routine investigation can very easily turn violent," said James Helminski, special agent in charge of U.S. Secret Service in Seattle.
Caluori is in custody at the Federal Detention Center at Sea-Tac, Washington.
