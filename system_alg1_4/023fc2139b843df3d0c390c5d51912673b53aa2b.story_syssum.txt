The mysterious image captured by Chris Aitchison at Tantallon Castle in eastern Scotland.
The "person" appears to be wearing an old-style greenish ruff around the neck.
The picture was made public Friday by Richard Wiseman, a professor of psychology at the University of Hertfordshire who also studies the paranormal.
The photographer insists no one was around when he took the picture; skeptics say the mirror could be reflecting the headrest or be the result of digital manipulation.
"Many of the photographs can be easily explained," said photographer Gordon Rutter, who also examined the pictures.
But the "ghost" in the Scottish castle has generated the most attention.
For 300 years, the Douglas earls of Angus held sway at the castle as one of the most powerful families in Scotland, according to Historic Scotland, which looks after historic sites for the Scottish government.
It is also possible that a member of the public was standing there when the picture was taken, Wiseman said -- in which case, he hopes they will come forward.
He added, "If they can explain it, e-mail me.
Palace officials insisted at the time that no one was in the room, and they were at a loss to explain the figure.
