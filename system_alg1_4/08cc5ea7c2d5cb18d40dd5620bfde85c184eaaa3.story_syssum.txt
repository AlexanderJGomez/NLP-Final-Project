Paris, France (CNN)Joy Monroe, a tourist from Montana, has come to Paris's Pont des Arts bridge on a mission of love.
American Lisa Anselmo and French-American Lisa Taylor Huff say they co-founded No Love Locks because the padlocks are endangering historic landmarks and have become a threat to safety.
"We just want to give back to the city we love and protect its heritage and beauty," says Anselmo.
There are concerns that the keys thrown in the Seine will add to the river's existing pollution.
Olivier Passelecq, the deputy mayor of the Parisian neighborhood that includes the Pont des Arts, agrees that the locks have become invasive.
"Travelers want to leave their mark on Paris -- it's touching and we understand that," Anselmo says.
