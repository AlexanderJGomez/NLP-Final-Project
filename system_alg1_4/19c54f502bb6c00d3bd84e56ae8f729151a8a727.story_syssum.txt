Todd Nicely screamed twice at the top of his lungs.
If you do that you'll make it back to your wife," he said recently by phone.
What Nicely, who had stepped on the pressure plate of a roadside bomb, didn't realize at the time was that he had lost more than his legs.
But thanks to modern body armor and a helicopter that arrived in just six minutes -- as well as quick reactions by his fellow Marines -- Nicely lived and became just the second quadruple amputee to survive battlefield injury wounds.
"When you are out on the battlefield, you don't realize how many amputees there are because you are not there and you don't see them," Nicely said.

"Despite the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs' best efforts, oftentimes the transition feels like you've been thrown off a cliff," said Jonathan Pruden, who as an Army captain lost a leg in Iraq in 2003 and now works for the Wounded Warrior Project.
Last year, he heard the story of Brendan Marrocco, a 22-year-old soldier from his Staten Island neighborhood, who was the first quadruple amputee wounded in war.
"We know that we've been at war because of what happened on 9/11, so we knew that we had to take care of our military," Siller said.
"When you meet these kids they are so inspiring," Siller said.
Nicely said his new home, being built in Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri, will lift a big burden.
They also explain to vets what conditions cannot be claimed as related to their time in the military.
"There are certain presumptive conditions for veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan that may pop up in one year or five," Jirak said.
Nicely, who now walks with prosthetic legs, plans to go back to college soon, after he and his wife, Crystal, move into their new home.
He wants to raise public awareness on the plight of this new kind of veteran, the triple or quadruple amputee, and help them get homes that work for them, he said.
"There's life after the hospital bed," he said.
