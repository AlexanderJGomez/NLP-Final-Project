Knight, 49, faces up to life in prison if convicted in the fatal hit-and-run.
Knight, who was out on bail in a separate robbery case, is charged with with one count of murder, one count of attempted murder, two counts of hit-and-run with an allegation that he committed a serious and violent felony while out on bail, the district attorney's office said in a statement.
Knight turned himself in to Los Angeles Sheriff's Department investigators early Friday.
Knight was driving the car in which Shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in Las Vegas in 1996.
That prison time -- along with Shakur's death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others -- contributed to the label's bankruptcy in 2006.
