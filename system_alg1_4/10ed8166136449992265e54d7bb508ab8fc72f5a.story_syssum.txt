But across the channel there is one Briton at the forefront of his sport who, through a series of peerless performances, is in line to become the UK's first Tour de France winner.
"It is Bradley Wiggins' Tour de France to lose," according to former British cyclist and now commentator Paul Sherwen, who made his debut in the race in 1978.
Wiggins finished the 2009 race in fourth position, equaling the best finish by a British rider -- first achieved by Scotland's Robert Millar in 1984.
If Wiggins wanted an example of just how quickly a challenge in the prestigious race can unravel, he need look no further than the first Briton to wear the "maillot jaune," Tommy Simpson.
And the team that Wiggins cycles for -- The Sky Procycling team -- is now the dominant force at the Tour, having been established in the wake of Team GB's success at the 2008 Olympics.
British Cycling performance director Dave Brailsford formed the country's first professional team in 2009 and Sky Procycling made its Tour de France debut in 2010.
"Now kids riding their bikes in England can dream of getting into a professional team and getting into the Tour de France.
"They are already comparing it to Lance Armstrong's U.S.
"If Bradley could win the Tour de France this year it would be absolutely huge," said Sherwen.
