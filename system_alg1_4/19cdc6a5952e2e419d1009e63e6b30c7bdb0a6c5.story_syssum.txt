(CNN)It's a wild, wet West.
A new storm marching in from the Pacific promises to leave a total of nearly 10 inches in spots along the coast between Saturday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service said.
The utility said it called in crews from Oregon and Washington to help restore power to customers.
Some postulated what the source of the grime may be, including the weather service.
Or did winds blow up a different kind of ash from last year's forest fires in Oregon or Idaho?
Or was it just dust whipped up by high winds?
The NWS Reno recorded a fast-motion video of an usual cloud formed by the high winds called a lenticular cloud.
