She was terrified that someone would find her boys acting suspiciously and one of them would end up being killed.
But based on my experience defending young black men in the criminal justice system for 30 years, I know her fears are not without foundation.
The Ferguson police chief says the officer was attacked in his cruiser, and the first shot was fired inside the car.
Here's what we do know: A police officer and a black man interacted, multiple shots were fired, and Michael Brown was 35 feet away from the police car when struck by the shots that killed him.
Black or white, an officer must be in fear of imminent death or great bodily harm before using deadly force, just like the rest of us.
Whether my client is black, white, Latino or something else, here is how I want justice defined: Two sides, well-represented, present their cases in an adversarial system; the law is followed and a just result is inevitable.
Many believe that the criminal justice system, from first police interaction to verdict, is infected with a racial bias that taints the possibility of justice as it should be defined.
Consider the very first interactions: A cop and young black male interact on the street, and both give the other a bit of attitude.
This, as simple as it sounds, is how it starts.
And if you want to say the young man is at fault for disrespect or mistrust of a cop's authority, you are right.
To break this cycle, police must recognize there is bias in the system, and they make an effort to treat the people they serve with respect.
And we must understand the grave reality that the way we engage a police officer can affect whether we walk away, whether we are driven away in handcuffs, or whether we are taken away on a stretcher.
For those who say that talking about this now is an insensitive way to blame Michael Brown for his own death, nothing could be further from the truth.
