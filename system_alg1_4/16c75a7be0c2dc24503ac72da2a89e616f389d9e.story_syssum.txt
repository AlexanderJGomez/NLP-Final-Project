(CNN) -- Liz Lee is not your typical MTV reality show star.
The fact that a show like that is on now is amazing and great," said Fogelnest, who hosted his own show on MTV as a teenager (from his bedroom, no less), "Squirt TV," in the mid-1990s.
Like many MTV reality shows, it's not without its share of controversy.
MTV also told the Los Angeles Times last year that neither the terms "reality show" nor "sitcom" fully captured the show.
Benjamin Nugent, author of "American Nerd," noted, "When you have people choosing to be nerds, questions of authenticity can come up.
As a reflection of the rest of pop culture, something it has captured for nearly 30 years, MTV has embraced geeks in a big way (the sitcom "The Hard Times of RJ Berger" will start its second season soon, and there's even a site called "MTV Geek" now).
"Liz" something of a sister show to "The Paper."
"Daria made it cool to be a smart chick," said writer Jennifer Vineyard, who worked at MTV for eight years.
Characters like Daria show you that you don't have to."
"It was just something completely weird and different, that in a way it made so much sense to use him."
'Hey, it's OK to be a nerd, you can be famous.
Nerd culture has exploded because nerds can be successful."
MTV recently announced that "Beavis and Butt-Head" are returning to the network in some form: Can "Daria" be far behind?
All of that kind of stuff has been a great part of MTV's history," said Rick Marshall, editor of MTV's Splash Page, a blog devoted to comic books and comic book adaptations.
"I can actually have conversations with significantly more people about 'Green Lantern' and people will actually know what I'm talking about," he said.
"(MTV was) able to take fan culture and market a show specifically to it," said Nugent.
