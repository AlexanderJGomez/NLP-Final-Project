A Texas company says it has made the first metal gun using a 3-D printer, taking the debate over people's emerging ability to create their own firearms to a new level.
"The 3-D-printed metal gun proves that 3-D printing isn't just making trinkets and Yoda heads," the company said in the blog post.
The metal gun wasn't a move toward making firearms with a 3-D printer cheaper or more accessible, she wrote.
In May, a nonprofit group, also from Texas, stirred far more controversy when it posted a video of the live firing of a plastic handgun created with a 3-D printer.
The group's website was shut down shortly afterward.
It said one use for its new capabilities with 3-D printers may be selling replacement parts for handguns.
