James McClamrock returned late Thursday to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, the most recent deaths of the war in Iraq.
In their new role, U.S. troops are expected to advise and assist Iraq's security forces, back Iraqi troops in counterterrorism missions and protect American civilians there during a transitional period.
Ironically, Jenkins and McClamrock were killed by an Iraqi soldier.
The soldiers were part of a security element for a U.S. company commander who was meeting with members of Iraqi security forces at the compound.
The bodies of Jenkins and McClamrock arrived at Dover on a cool, clear night, along with the bodies of two Marines killed in Afghanistan.
