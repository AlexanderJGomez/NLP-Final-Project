"It signifies the beginning of the process that will hopefully make him whole," said his lawyer, Taylor Koss.
When he was released, Fleming had no place to live and less than $100 to his name, according to Koss.
"It has been a struggle since he got out," Koss said, adding that the damages Fleming is seeking include the loss of wages, companionship and emotional anguish.
But, according to Koss, they did not have evidence he was in Florida on the day of the slaying.
In the course of the investigation, the Conviction Review Unit found the receipt in police records, time stamped and dated -- solidifying Fleming's claim that he was in Florida at the time of the crime, according to the district attorney's office.
The review unit also interviewed Fleming's former girlfriend, who said she called Fleming the night of the killing while he was still at his hotel in Florida.
Koss said the judge threw out her later testimony because she could not provide enough facts to back up her story.
