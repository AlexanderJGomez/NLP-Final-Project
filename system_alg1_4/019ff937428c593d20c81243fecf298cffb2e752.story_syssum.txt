• 6:28 p.m. Fifty milligrams of midazolam have been injected into each of Lockett's arms to start the process, an attempt to sedate him before the second and third drugs are administered to stop the breathing and the heart.
He utters another unintelligible statement.
• 6:38 p.m. Lockett is grimacing, grunting and lifting his head and shoulders entirely up from the gurney.

For those people, perhaps, Oklahoma's botched execution will be a wake-up call -- a realization that all executions, regardless of method, are cruel and not especially unusual in parts of the United States.
This is the state -- the state where I grew up, by the way, and where I once worked as a newspaper reporter -- that has the highest per capita rate of executions in the country.
"I hope that man was in more pain than anyone ever imagined possible," a woman from Oklahoma wrote on Facebook, echoing a sentiment I saw repeated.
It was Oklahoma, after all, in 1977, that was the first state to authorize death by lethal injection.
Yet, the state proceeded with Lockett's execution this week.
But the governor and many residents were unmoved.
But that doesn't excuse the state from ordering his death, especially in this way.
Oklahoma Supreme Court Justice Steven Taylor wrote, in agreement with the court, that Lockett and Warner had no right to know the source of the chemicals.
"Reporters exchange shocked glances," she wrote at 6:39 p.m. "Nothing like this has happened at an execution any of us has witnessed since 1990, when the state resumed executions using lethal injection."
The death penalty is on its way out in America.
But it's got a cold grip on Oklahoma.
