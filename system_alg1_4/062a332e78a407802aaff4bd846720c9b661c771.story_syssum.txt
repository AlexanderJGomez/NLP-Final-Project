At the same time, a new report about the Syrian civil war showed what appears to be convincing evidence of large-scale "systematic torture and killing" by the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Iran's top ally.
Under the deal negotiated in November, Iran suspended some of its nuclear enrichment operations, and Western governments started lifting some of the economic sanctions they have used to pressure Tehran.
They will note that this was a week that showed the consequences of Iran's gradually rising influence, as the Islamic Republic moved steadily toward its goal of becoming the dominant power in the region.
It has become a proxy war for regional rivalries, with Sunni states, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, supporting the opposition, and Iran, along with Hezbollah, standing steadfastly with al-Assad by providing him with manpower, ammunition and intelligence.
Iran has not only saved al-Assad, it has changed the character of the fight.
The Iranian regime's goal is to spread its version of Islamic revolution and to make Iran the most powerful country in the region.
One reason Iran signed the interim deal is that it has already achieved a great deal of what it sought with its nuclear program.
In some respects, Iran is already a nuclear power, although it doesn't yet have the full immunity that nuclear weapons would create.
European, Asian and Arab businessmen are lining up to make deals with a resurgent Iran.
But already Iran and Syria have indicated they have no intention of supporting the meeting's official goal of creating a transitional government to end Syria's war.
Syria's regime will likely become more beholden to Iran than ever.
In the end, much of the Middle East's future will depend on whether negotiators can find a way to stop Iran from advancing its power to the point where it becomes essentially invulnerable.
