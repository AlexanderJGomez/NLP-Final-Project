(InStyle.com) -- Singer Carrie Underwood dishes on dieting, beauty and fashion.
Very rarely do I go out without makeup.
Keep a food diary
Don't be a dairy queen
I mean, it's basically moldy milk, and it doesn't smell that great--but it's so good!
Always take an hour for yourself to go do something positive.
Plus, I get a decent cardio workout every night onstage.
The car I have, a Ford Mustang convertible, is the one I won on Idol--I guess I need to go buy a new car after all!
I don't do smelly soaps or wear perfume, so lotion is kind of my perfume.
And Gwen Stefani's perfume [L], is good too.
I'll put on lip gloss and go, "That needs to shimmer."
Then I want it a little pinker, so I put pink on top.
I know I'm doing myself a disservice, but I'd rather put on a muumuu and have people at least think there might be a skinny person underneath than put on something tight and have them think, Look at that gut!
Usually I come up through the floor to get to the stage.
I just laugh because the audience thinks this is so glamorous--and here I am under the stage with these ropes and equipment, my butt pressed against plastic!
