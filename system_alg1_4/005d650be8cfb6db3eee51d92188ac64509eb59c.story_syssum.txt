Israeli airstrikes killed at least five more people in Gaza on Saturday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.
Less than a mile away from the Qassam mosque, a strike killed two men riding on a motorbike, Palestinian Health Ministry spokesman Dr. Ashraf el-Qedra said.
The Israel Defense Forces said that, since the end of the cease-fire early Friday, about 100 rockets were fired toward Israel from Gaza.
There have been efforts to halt the bloodshed as well as to broach some of the thorny issues related to it.
According to el-Qedra, at least 1,911 in Gaza have died since the conflict began, in addition to just under 10,000 injured.
Israeli officials say 64 Israeli soldiers have died, and three civilians were killed in Israel.
Hamas denied firing rockets into Israel on Friday.
Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said it was Hamas' fault regardless, telling CNN the group runs Gaza and "can't outsource terrorism to the other groups.
The Palestinians have asked for Israel to lift its blockade on Gaza and to re-open the air and seaports, a Palestinian negotiation who spoke on condition of anonymity said.
But Israel was willing to extend fishing rights to only six miles off the coast, said Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri.
Yet Israel is resisting in-depth talks as long as rockets continue to head toward its territory.
