Mexico City (CNN) -- An explosion rocked the offices of Mexico's state oil company Thursday, killing at least 25 people and injuring 101, Mexico's interior minister said.
The explosion tore through the building "from the inside out," he said, and rescuers found many people trapped.
... You could see pieces of the wall falling to the ground," said Joaquin Borrell Valenzuela, an attorney for the Pemex comptroller's office, who was in a courtyard outside the building at the time of the blast.

Authorities said helicopters carried some of the wounded to hospitals.
Pena Nieto cautioned against speculating over what caused the blast, and said authorities would be closely investigating.
The explosion occurred in an annex building just to the east of the tower, Foreign Minister Jose Antonio Meade said.
As they combed through the rubble, a Pemex executive's cell phone rang, Rangel said.
"Unfortunately, we lost communication with him," Rangel said.
