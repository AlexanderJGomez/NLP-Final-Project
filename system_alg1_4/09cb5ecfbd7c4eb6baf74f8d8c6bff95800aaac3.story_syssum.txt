On Friday, Universal Studios is opening its "Wizarding World of Harry Potter" attraction at Universal's Islands of Adventure theme park in Orlando, Florida.
One of the reasons Harry Potter is so successful is its legions of fans, both young and old.
"I've grown up with Harry Potter.
And when I'll be a senior, the last (movie) -- when Harry is like that age, as a senior -- will come out.
I love the Harry Potter series."
"When I read the last book it was almost like the end, I still had the movies, but I was afraid it would be over, but the park is a way for it to live on."
