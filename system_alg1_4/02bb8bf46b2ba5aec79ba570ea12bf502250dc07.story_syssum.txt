Nelson Mandela shouldn't be revered as a civil rights icon, the statements screamed: He should be exposed for what he is: A communist.
A racist.
Mandela was branded a communist by the white apartheid government, which made it a crime to be one.
South Africa's government came down on the side of the West -- and communist or not, Mandela was squarely on the other side.
Then the government banned the communist party and the African National Congress, which fought for the freedom of black South Africans.
Not really, believes South African historian Sampie Terreblanche.
After his release from prison, Mandela made some high-profile appearances with communist leaders.
At the time that Umkhonto we Sizwe carried out its first attacks, Mandela was at its helm.
Police intercepted the plan and arrested Mandela and other ANC leaders.
Mandela received a sentence of life in prison.
"I think it's a very naÃ¯ve plan with very little outlook for success," the former professor of political science at the University of Cape Town said.
Umkhonto we Sizwe beat the war drum against the "white supremacy" and "the white state."
"He was rather strong against racism," Terreblanche said.
Mandela has long espoused the way of reconciliation and called for there to be no racial violence in retribution for apartheid.
At a sports match in 1995, as President, Mandela made a gesture of support to white South Africans that drew gasps.
The crowd began chanting his name.
