When New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg appeared at a news conference Wednesday without Lydia Callis at his side, fans of the sign-language interpreter immediately expressed their disappointment via Twitter.
So sad Lydia Callis is not the sign language interpreter #Sandy" tweeted @kyledoyle.
When the mayor talked about falling trees, high winds, heavy rain and rising waters, Callis made sure her face, hands and body conveyed the urgency to those who could not hear.
When Bloomberg warned "It is dangerous," viewers could see the danger on Callis' face.
New York magazine said Callis gave the city "a legitimate reason to smile" even as the storm loomed.
"As you can see from when I'm interpreting, you see the tree falling, you see the building, you see the crane moving around," Callis told Colvin.
"Hearing people tend to not understand that deaf people need those facial expressions," Callis said.
Callis said she tries to translate Bloomberg's emotions.
But Wednesday afternoon, Callis was gone, replaced by another woman whom Bloomberg introduced at his news conference as Pat Mitchell.
"Lydia Callis has been replaced!
"Bloomberg's new signer does her job fine, but she doesn't have panache of Lydia Callis, who signed with a New York accent.
Bloomberg didn't like all the shine Lydia Callis was getting?
Callis earned a degree in American Sign Language from that school, which is part of the Rochester Institute of Technology, before moving to New York City last year, a school spokesman said.
