In the 1960s, Attorney General Robert Kennedy marshaled the power of the federal government to protect protesters at pivotal moments in the civil rights movement.
Attorney General Eric Holder and Federal District Court Judge Shira Scheindlin landed a one-two blow against mandatory minimums and "stop and frisk" racial profiling.
Judge Shira Scheindlin found that between 2004 and 2012, the New York City Police Department made 4.4 million stops.
Judge Scheindlin's decision followed the tradition of great judges who upheld civil rights.
It is now time for the third branch of government -- Congress -- to adopt measures that address crime while protecting civil and human rights.
Congress should close this gap and take steps toward correcting and preventing the corrosive impact of mandatory minimums by passing the bipartisan Smarter Sentencing Act of 2013.
The bipartisan support for the act offers hope for meaningful change and we strongly urge Congress to pass this measure as soon as possible.
