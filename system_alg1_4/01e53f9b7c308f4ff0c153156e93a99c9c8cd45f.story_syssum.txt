Anthony Gatto says he's been in training since he was 3 years old and performing since he was 8.
Normal might be that man in the corner, wearing a T-shirt, shorts and sneakers throwing balls in the air.
Moments later, he's juggling six or seven orange rings (they move so fast, it looks like a blur) and then does a pirouette -- while all the rings are in the air -- and then catches them on his arm.
"By the time I was 8, I was entered into a juggling competition, and incidentally, that was the same competition that Patrick Dempsey, the actor, was in," Gatto said.
In fact, he didn't audition for "Kooza."
"I have right now 11 juggling world records," he said.
Backstage, it's a long-sleeve T-shirt, gym shorts and sneakers.
"Juggling is something that is so delicate, you have to have a really good feel, you can lose that in minutes," he said.
But he rarely misses -- at least not in his act.
In fact, I have done this a few times," he said.
