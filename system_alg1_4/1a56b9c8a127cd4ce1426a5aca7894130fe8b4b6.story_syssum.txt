(CNN) -- For a new parliament, it was an inauspicious beginning.
For the government of President Mikheil Saakashvili, however, the building represents Georgia's hopes for the future.
"This new building of our parliament is a symbol of the new Georgia," Saakashvili said at the official opening of the yet-to-be finished legislature late last month against a backdrop of marching troops and military hardware.
"I am confident that the Georgian people will stand guard to save Georgia's independence," he said.
The Georgian government, however, is unperturbed by the critics, saying the move makes a clean break from the brutalist Soviet-era architecture that dominates Tbilisi.
"We don't want our children's taste to be ruined by communist architecture," he said.
