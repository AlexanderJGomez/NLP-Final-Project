Los Angeles (CNN) -- Octuplets mom Nadya Suleman faces welfare fraud charges as she's accused of not reporting money earned as a topless dancer and adult film actress.
Suleman, 38, performed in adult videos and danced topless at a Florida strip club last year.
"I wouldn't even kiss somebody for money," Suleman told CNN's Nischelle Turner.
Suleman dreams of building a business "empire" that will pay for food, shelter and college educations for her 14 children, she told Turner.
The criminal complaint, filed by Deputy District Attorney William Clark with the public assistance fraud division, said Suleman applied for public assistance in Lancaster, California, in January 2013.
Suleman faces up to five years, eight months in prison if convicted, the prosecutor said.
