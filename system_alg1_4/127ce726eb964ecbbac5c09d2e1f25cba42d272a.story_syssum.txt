Tairee, a student at the University of Ghana, is proud to wear traditional beads.
"It's coming back into fashion," she told CNN.
"They [women] are more African when they wear their beads than usual.
"There was a period when they [young people] shunned beads; they said it was archaic, it was no longer fashionable.
Beads have a long history in Ghana.
While beads are no longer used as currency, they are still valuable to Ghana.
"Because of that new potential, we don't just produce necklaces and bracelets, we produce home decoration," Torda told CNN.
"They [the beads] mean so much to me," Tairee told CNN.
I know what it means, so its so precious to me."
