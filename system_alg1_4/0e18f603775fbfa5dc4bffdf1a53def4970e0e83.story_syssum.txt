A: Both.
A: The embassy kept lobbying me to leave and promised to have people stay with me in the hospital.
A: I don't think (U.S. officials) protected human rights in this case.
Now they have moved into the house -- eating at our table and using our stuff.
Our home is teeming with security -- on the roof and in the yard.
A: Yes, most of it.

A: Yes, as soon as possible.

Guangcheng is blind and we hired so many guards, how did we lose him and what exactly would he do once he was out?

Friends can't visit us.
I was actually persuading Guangcheng to seek treatment in a hospital -- but I didn't know the embassy (people) were lobbying him to leave (the embassy).
