At the time, he had been the rising star of Swiss skiing with four World Cup wins to his name and a solitary world title -- the 2007 Super Combined.
Albrecht suffered a brain injury and a bruised lung, was airlifted to hospital and placed in a coma for three weeks to give both his brain and lung the best chance of recovery.
The feeling was great because the slope was in good shape and I was fast in first training and I was skiing easily.
Albrecht is able to laugh as he retells the incident, in part helped by the fact he has no recall of the savage beating he took on the final meters of the Kitzbühel course even after watching it back on a few occasions.
"If I watch myself in Kitzbühel then I feel like it wasn't me because I don't have any memory of him.
But remarkably, it did not end his career, rather it was a dislocated left kneecap after crashing in another training run at Lake Louise, Canada in November 2012 that finally called time on his professional career on the slopes.
"The first time I was on skis, I thought 'okay, shit, this is a nice feeling, I wanna go back in the World Cup'," he recalls.
He still recalls the feeling of being in the start gate for that first race back: "It was a great feeling.
Then it was so good, the feeling was so great and I was also fast."
But if you are a skier, if you are a pro, if you're the downhill, it's not so dangerous because you know what you can do, you know how it works and, for us, Kitzbühel, when you ski it's easy."
You came back, you were in the World Cup again, you did it, you have you're whole life in front of you'."
Now, he runs his own clothes line, Albright, and also mentors young skiers giving the 30-year-old a new career in the sport.
