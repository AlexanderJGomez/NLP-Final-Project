We set Baltimore on fire this time.
We threw stones at policemen.
We let the violence stand for everything that's wrong with the things we already didn't like.
To which the only real answer can be: Stop kidding yourself.
Yes we can.
Well, if I -- a son of immigrants whose family had nothing to do with any of those accomplishments -- if I get to claim those aspects of American history, then surely I have to claim the unsavory aspects too.
We cut blacks out of the New Deal.
We created a polity in which racial inequity and economic inequality magnify each other unrelentingly.
No, we own them all.
And we all have to face that before we can fix anything in Baltimore or beyond.
For the left, it's about the deep structural root causes of the alienation and violence.
Both a history of police brutality and a present crisis of street violence.
And until more people can see this, we will not see progress.
But it cannot possibly be that only those with whom I disagree are responsible for what is happening in Baltimore.
Because we are.
And there is no other "we" waiting in the wings.
