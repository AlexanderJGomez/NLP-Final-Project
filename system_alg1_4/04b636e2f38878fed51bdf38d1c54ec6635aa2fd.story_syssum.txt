CNN's Saima Mohsin, reporting from Legazpi on Sunday, said shelters were full as high winds and driving rain battered the city.
About 40 million people are in the path of the storm's winds.
CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam said that the storm is actually breaking up over the land mass of the Philippines, but will continue to pour heavy rain.
Hagupit should be significantly weaker by the time it reaches Manila, but winds will still be higher than 100 kph (60 mph).
If or when it gets worse, we'll go to the evacuation center," one man said.
One city farther south breathed a sigh of relief on Sunday.
About 48,000 people have moved to evacuation centers, he said; there have been no casualties.
CNN's Asia-Pacific editor Andrew Stephens, reporting from Tacloban, said there was no storm surge.
CNN's Madison Park and CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller contributed to this report.
