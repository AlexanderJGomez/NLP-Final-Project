"Get international help to come here now, not tomorrow, now," Fernandez said.
Relatives in the United States and around the world are turning to social media sites such as Facebook, reading Philippine-based media sites (such as Manila's major newspaper, the Inquirer) for news, all while waiting for that phone call, text or any kind of message from an unaccounted loved one.
Among them is Janet Alvarado, who waits for news from her home in San Francisco.
Alvarado, 52, executive director of a historical project that preserves images of Filipino-American life and connects Filipino-Americans to Tacloban's main region, Leyte, has heard from just one family member.
"She said they just couldn't stay," Janet Alvarado said.
Alvarado said they were on a motorcycle on the road from Biliran to Ormoc, another part of Leyte.
"They said there were just too many bodies all around," Janet Alvarado said about her cousin's experience.
Where they are?
The Philippines Red Cross has reportedly set up a call service at 09175328500.
That's tough when even Leyte's Metropolitan Cathedral had its roof and ceiling blown away by the super typhoon, which is known as Yolanda in the Philippines.
The U.S. government has already committed $20 million to help the Philippines.
Filipino-Americans will also be counted on to pitch in, perhaps even more than they already do.
In the meantime, loved ones anxiously hope that messages from relatives will come soon.
