Cairo (CNN) -- A documentary filmmaker who followed Osama bin Laden's jihad against the Soviets in the mountains of Afghanistan during the 1980s said he once warned the world's most-wanted terrorist against attacking civilians.
Daraz filmed bin laden and his 120 Arab fighters in the first training camp located amid the rugged terrain of Afghanistan.
He produced three documentaries and five books about the war in Afghanistan, but his film "Arab Supporters in Afghanistan" remains his favorite piece of work because it featured bin Laden's first appearance on video.
"Bin Laden's office manager in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, informed me that millions of Saudi Riyals were donated by people and organizations supporting the movement after the release of my film," said Daraz.
Daraz followed his friend bin Laden to Saudi Arabia in 1991 and stayed in his lavish villa housing his four wives and numerous children.
Daraz warned bin Laden about attacking civilians but the world's most wanted terrorist did not listen.
Bin Laden had claimed responsibility for the attacks in 2004 after years of denial.
"You will not see bin Laden walking on this Earth again," Obama said.
The release of the photos would have provoked people who already disagree with the way he was killed and the disposal of the body at sea, even if those people did not support bin Laden's views."
