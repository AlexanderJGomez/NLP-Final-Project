Alexandria, Egypt (CNN) -- Emotional congregants returned to their church Sunday in Alexandria, Egypt, mourning the loss of fellow worshippers in a bombing a day earlier.
Evidence indicates that a suicide bomber caused the blast, the country's interior ministry said Saturday, though witnesses reported seeing a car parked outside the church explode.
"What did we do to them?
she said.
A small group of Coptic men held a demonstration against the attack about a block away from the church Sunday.
"The perpetrators of this attack were clearly targeting Christian worshippers, and have no respect for human life and dignity," Obama said in a statement.
"In the beginning, we thought the attack was sectarian, to be honest," he said Sunday.
A nearby mosque was also damaged in the blast and eight Muslims were among the wounded, the interior ministry said.
Authorities believe the bomber was killed in the blast, Egypt's Interior Ministry said in a statement Saturday.
