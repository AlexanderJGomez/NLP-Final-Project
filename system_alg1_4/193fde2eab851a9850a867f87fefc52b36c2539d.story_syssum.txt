Dixon got the tattoos, he said, to send a message to his enemies and the police to leave him alone.
They staged an intervention and convinced him to make a fresh start.
"I was confused, lost, and didn't have the slightest idea of how to be a good father," said Dixon, now 30.
Dixon's outlook began to change, however, when he followed his mother's advice and went to the Center for Urban Families in Baltimore.
Most men, like Dixon, walk through the center's doors because they need help finding a job.
"If we don't crack the code of men having babies for whom they're not responsible for, all of our efforts to build a better Baltimore will be limited," said Jones, 57.
"The one thing that is consistent with all these men is that they want to be involved with the lives of their children, but they just don't know how," Jones said.
When Dixon first came to the Center for Urban Families, he owed $47,000 in child support.
The center also helped Dixon land a full-time job -- loading trucks on the overnight shift at a clothing warehouse -- so he could earn money while taking classes at Baltimore City Community College.
"You have a group of men speaking about issues they are having about their children," Dixon said.
Dixon has now embraced his role as a dad.
"The first day I took him to school, I got the sense of fatherhood," Dixon said.
Jones grew up in Baltimore and remembers the day his own father left, when he was 9 years old.
"I didn't want to go to jail anymore," Jones said.
"It's my way of giving back ... in ways in which I took from my community many years ago," Jones said.
Jones' turnaround is an inspiration to Dixon and the other men in his program.
He's that North Star."
Now Dixon feels confident that he can follow Jones' example.
