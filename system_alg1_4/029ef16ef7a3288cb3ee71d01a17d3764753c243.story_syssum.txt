(CNN) -- The mother of a Brooklyn teenager shot and killed by police demanded an investigation Thursday, saying he was "slaughtered" and that she wants to know why.
"He has a curfew," she said.
As the officers got closer, Kimani Gray broke from the group and adjusted his waistband.
Kimani Gray then "turned on them," it said, and pointed a .38-caliber revolver at the officers.
Gray said that her son was killed in front of his best friend's house.
Most people in the city likely don't believe what police say happened Saturday, said Councilman Charles Barron, who appeared with the teen's mother at the news conference.
Police said they arrested two people that day.
You just knew it was going to turn into the cops trying to contain those kids who were obviously gonna go for it," Graham said.
The police were caught off-guard," Graham said.
One officer received a gash to his face while another was pushed off his scooter, police said.
"I can promise you that we will conduct a full and fair investigation," he said.
"As a black man growing up in Flatbush, you just expect to be harassed by the cops, pulled over, arrested and now just straight up killed," said Shanduke McPhatter, a 35-year-old former gang member who works with young men in the neighborhood.
"There are no community centers here," McPhatter said.
"And for the cops, they just need to take that badge away and talk, talk to us like human beings.
Otherwise, this is just going to keep happening."
