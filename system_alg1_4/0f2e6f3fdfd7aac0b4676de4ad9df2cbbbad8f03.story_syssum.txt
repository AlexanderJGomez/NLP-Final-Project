(CNN) -- The United Nations is asking countries and donors around the world to send urgent aid to the victims of the flooding in Pakistan, one-fifth of which is now under water.
"Floods are always more difficult to raise money for than dramatic seismic events that happen suddenly, because the scale of it only creeps up on people," Wynter said.
"It's very hard to compare disasters," said Nicholas Reader, spokesman for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).
In Haiti, about 3 million lives were disrupted and more than 200,000 people died in the massive January earthquake.
More people have been affected than in the 2004 South Asia tsunami, the 2005 South Asia earthquake, and the Haiti earthquake combined.
"The public is not as shocked by a disaster if the death toll is lower, so we are trying to really push this emergency into the headlines so people understand the enormity of it," said Maurizio Giuliano, spokesman for OCHA in Pakistan.
Many people associate Pakistan with Islamic militancy.
"In the meantime, many more thousands of people in Pakistan will die as a result of these floods."
Haiti was smaller -- and closer to America.
"There was a great outpouring of aid for Haiti," Rauf said from Islamabad.
Over and over again.
