"While 60 years later, much of India is in the process of rapid modernization, the police continue to use their old methods," the group said.
"The institutional culture of police practically discourages officers from acting otherwise, failing to give them the resources, training, ethical environment and encouragement to develop professional police tactics," it said.
The Federal Home Ministry will study the report before responding, said R.K. Sharma, its deputy secretary dealing with human rights issues, but some former police officers agreed that the force had yet to modernize.
The legal basis for much of India's state and federal police services is a law dating back to 1861, which was drafted in the wake of an 1857 uprising against British rule.
Successive governments for decades have failed to deliver on promises to hold the police accountable for abuses and to build professional, rights-respecting police forces, HRW said.
Moreover, abysmal conditions for police officers also contribute to violations, the report noted.
The 118-page report, "Broken System: Dysfunction, Abuse and Impunity in the Indian Police," is based on interviews with more than 80 police officers of varying ranks, 60 people who said they were victims of police abuse, and numerous discussions with experts and civil society activists.
