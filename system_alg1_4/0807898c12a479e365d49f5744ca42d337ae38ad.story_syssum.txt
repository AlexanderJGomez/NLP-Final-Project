And now, as House Republicans weigh a resolution to sue President Obama for not quickly enough implementing a law the same Republicans voted more than 50 times to repeal or stall, all hell has broken loose.
Their complaint?
Meanwhile, at least Republicans aren't going full-political-stunt and impeaching President Obama ... yet.
Republicans bash President Obama for issuing executive orders.
But why should facts like the Constitution or how every president in history has used executive orders, and in most cases more than President Obama, stand in the way of a good partisan line of attack, let alone a political stunt?
But suggesting the White House and by, er, obvious implication President Obama, hates Jews is a whole new level of accusation.
Witness Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn, who last week called President Obama "tone deaf" for not visiting the border during his trip to Texas.
Then, when pressing Congress to pass immigration reform, President Obama went to the border and ... Republicans criticized him for doing so.
In case you're not good at math, that's Republicans criticizing President Obama for doing something and then -- just three years later -- criticizing him for not doing the same thing.
Republicans damn President Obama he does it and damned if he doesn't.
But while blaming and condemning President Obama has been Republicans' sole strategy since the moment he was elected, they've taken that crazy irresponsibility to the next level -- including suing the President of the United States of America for doing his job and carefully implementing laws, even the ones Republicans hate.
The more irrational and hypocritical the Republican attacks get, the more they're desperately trying to hide this simple truth.
