(CNN) -- I recently left the Global Forum on Innovation & Technology Entrepreneurship in South Africa, inspired, empowered and hopeful, but extremely impatient to see radical changes to help women in Africa develop a world-class talent in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and businesses.
Women hold the key to Africa's development, from agriculture to technology and entrepreneurship.
In most African countries women account for a sizable part of the workforce, but still, there are not many places where women entrepreneurs can go for mentoring and support for their businesses.
Technology presents new opportunities for African women who want to take their rightful place in society.
African women are already using information technology to build networks and partnerships.
And women are also contributing to creating technology.
We have to build the pipelines for the next generation of African women leaders, and the only way we can do that is to start finding and creating a good ecosystem for women.
