(CNN) -- Tetiana Chornovol, a prominent Ukrainian civic activist and journalist beaten on Christmas, said she has a long list of enemies, and that she was sure she would die during the attack.
"And I was very scared when they were beating me; I thought they were going to kill me," she said.
"We call on the government of Ukraine to uphold its (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) commitments and ensure respect for human rights, including fundamental freedoms of expression ... ," Jen Psaki said.
The Interior Ministry said it had identified three suspects in the beating.
Pictures and a video of the journalist posted online showed Chornovol with the right side of her face and her lips swollen and bloody, according to Russian state-run RIA Novosti news agency.
The attack was the second on a Ukrainian opposition activist in as many days, according to RIA Novosti.
The latest assault could increase tensions between the state and demonstrators who have braved sub-zero temperatures and set up tents and barricades in the city center to voice their opposition to closer ties with Russia.
