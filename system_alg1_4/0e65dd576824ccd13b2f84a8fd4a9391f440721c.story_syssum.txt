The All Blacks and their fans are clear on one thing, says Dan Carter: the goal is to make history and become the first rugby nation to win back-to-back World Cups.
Next October's final will be at Twickenham, the headquarters of English rugby -- a place where the 32-year-old has endured both highs and lows in his career.
Carter knows there are a host of teams now hoping to seize on any sign of All Black weakness: he lists his old Tri-Nations rivals Australia and South Africa, plus England, Ireland, Wales, and even Fiji as teams that could cause an upset.
"I've been part of the squad that's won the World Cup before so, you know, that's a huge achievement," Carter says, diplomatically.
A year prior, at the same venue, England shocked New Zealand 38-21 to end the Kiwis' 20-match unbeaten run.
"It's a real rugby environment, rugby culture is everything to do with Twickenham.
Lost one game there a couple of years ago but apart from that I've had a lot of success at Twickenham."
"The pinnacle of any rugby player is to reach those heights but to do it away from home, two tournaments in a row would be something pretty special," Carter said.
