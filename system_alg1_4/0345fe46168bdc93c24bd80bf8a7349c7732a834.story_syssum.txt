(CNN) -- Five people were injured -- three seriously enough to require hospital treatment -- when an escalator at a commuter rail station in New Jersey suddenly went into high-speed reverse Monday morning, authorities said.
Rodriguez said the escalator finally stopped after a minute.
"As a precaution, PATH has suspended escalator service at Exchange Place through (Tuesday) morning," said Marsico.
Rodriguez, the witness, said that since Sandy, the Jersey City PATH station hit by Monday's incident has had major issues.
The conditions of those injured, including the three taken to hospitals, could not be determined Monday afternoon.
