The mood at the show was somber, said Bob Templeton of Crossroads of the West Gun Shows.
"We had a moment of silence here at the show," Templeton said, referring to the deaths of six people and the wounding of 13 others, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, after last Saturday's shooting.
"It's going to be a long dialogue on gun control and gun rights, and it will be hard to strike a balance between those two positions," he said.
Bill Schaeffler of Tucson, among those at the show Saturday, said he knows gun control and high-capacity ammunition magazines will be hot topics.
"Being armed is the natural state of man," he said.
Federal law enforcement officials were on site to monitor buyers and sales activity, Templeton said.
