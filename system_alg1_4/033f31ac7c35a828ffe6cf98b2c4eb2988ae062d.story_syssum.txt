(WIRED)  -- Six buses, 40 teams, 48 hours and one winning business idea: The StartupBus is as close to blood sport as Silicon Valley entrepreneurship gets.
Much like a man may be able to run much faster and fight much stronger when in mortal danger."
In fact, the StartupBus itself could be considered a meta startup: Organizers this year are developing an online game, the StartupBus Stock Exchange, in which players become virtual angel investors and invest in the companies as they're built on the buses.
Because of the networking opportunities, the publicity from last year's contest and the sheer challenge of the undertaking, StartupBus founder Elias Bizannes was flooded with applications this year from prospective buspreneurs.
In 2010, 50 people applied and 25 were selected.
Two teams won last year: DormDorm, a startup designed to rent colleges' vacant dorm rooms to travelers during the summer, and DateBrowsr, a Hot or Not for dating profiles the service pulled from several sites.
Over the last year, the competition has grown from one bus to six.
The San Francisco teams drained a keg of Spaten Monday night at the offices of startup networking site YouNoodle.
When the buses arrive in Austin, the buspreneuers will be rewarded with a tour of the local tech culture during the Startup Crawl, which promises "hot tech [and] cold beer."
The exact prizes for this year's StartupBus competition are still being decided (iPads and incubator access have been mentioned), but perhaps the most important rewards for participants are the networking opportunities and the potential for publicity.
