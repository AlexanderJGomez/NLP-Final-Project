(CNN) -- Police in Raleigh, North Carolina, arrested 19 people at a rancorous school board meeting Tuesday afternoon where protesters accused the Wake County School Board of adopting a plan that will resegregate the school system.
Wake County is a booming school system with unprecedented growth that often requires the students to attend different schools, Evans said.
"This board cannot and will not permit these distractions to divert our attention away from our priority, and that is of increased achievement for all students," school board chairman Ron Margiotta has said.
When do we want it?
Police said they arrested 16 others during the board meeting for trespassing and disorderly conduct.
I think they are the right decisions ... there is a big misinterpretation," board member Debra Goldman has said.
