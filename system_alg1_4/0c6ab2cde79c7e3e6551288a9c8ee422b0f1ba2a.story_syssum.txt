Unlike in the United States where the Capitol police is responsible for security at the U.S. Capitol, four different agencies are charged with ensuring the safety of various parts of the parliament building in Canada.
A Senate security detail is responsible for one area of the building while the Ottawa Police keeps an eye on the surrounding streets.
Authorities investigating Wednesday's attack will likely look at why the security agencies at the parliament did not tighten security after Ottawa police received a 911 call at nearby National War Memorial.
It's unclear how the gunman got past the metal detectors and into the building.
In the past two decades, Canada has intensified security in government buildings after a man drove a bus into Parliament Hill in 1989.
"I just think what's really important to remember from this is that Parliament Hill is an incredible public place that's open for people to play football and come and protest and sit and have their lunches, do their yoga," Charlie Angus told CTV.
