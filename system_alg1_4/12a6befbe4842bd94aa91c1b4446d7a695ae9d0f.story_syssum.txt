(CNN) -- Thousands of mourners filled a Tracy, California, high school gym Thursday to remember slain 8-year-old Sandra Renee Cantu.
The printed program called the memorial service "A Celebration of Life," and organizers said they hoped the service would help ease the pain the community has suffered since Sandra's disappearance.
But today she is skipping on the streets of gold, into the arms of a loving God", said Brent Ives, mayor of Tracy.
A private memorial service for Sandra was held Wednesday.
