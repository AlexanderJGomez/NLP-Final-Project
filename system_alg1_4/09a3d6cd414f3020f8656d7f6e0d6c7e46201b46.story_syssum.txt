(CNN) -- The former stepson of singer Usher Raymond remained in critical condition in an Atlanta hospital Tuesday, four days after he was injured while riding in an inner tube at a north Georgia lake, his family said.
Investigators concluded that alcohol was not involved in the incident.
Usher visited Kile early Saturday morning, but has not returned, according to a source close to the family.
The couple have two sons together, ages 3 and 4.
