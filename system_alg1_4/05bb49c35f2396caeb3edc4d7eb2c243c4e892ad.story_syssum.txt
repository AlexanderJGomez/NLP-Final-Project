The city was a flashpoint for the violent conflict between unionists and nationalists that swept Ireland from the 1960s through the 1990s.
This weekend, however, Derry-Londonderry plays host to an event its organizers hope can help unite this divided city, at least for a few days.
And we're going there in the hope that ... maybe people who haven't felt comfortable standing next to each other in the streets will find an opportunity to do that," said Helen Marriage, co-director of Artichoke, a London-based company that stages large-scale public events across the UK.
Each have drawn throngs of people who packed the streets, faces bright with wonder, to witness their city be transformed if only for a moment into something magical.
Marriage had to persuade skeptical city officials to shut down parts of central London and reroute traffic while convincing them the event wasn't just a piece of frivolous disruption.
And we'd like to shut the city (down) for four days,'" she said.
"I used to go to these meetings and say, 'Please, may I do this?'
And immediately the response was different.
Nobody ever really said yes.
"It's always an incredible moment when the city is returned to the people who live and work there.
And they can wander freely as if in a playground, for no better reason than something is happening that they love.
Thanks to a fast broadband connection, people in London could peer into the "tunnel" and see a live feed of New York City, and vice versa.
So Artichoke turned it into a monument to living Brits by inviting people to be hoisted atop the plinth to do whatever they pleased for one hour.
Some played music.
"People used it in incredibly imaginative ways," Marriage said.
We work in the streets, using the buildings of the city, the architecture of the city, as the stage."
The success of Lumiere in Durham inspired Marriage to double down this year on the festival in Derry-Londonderry.
But Marriage is optimistic.
