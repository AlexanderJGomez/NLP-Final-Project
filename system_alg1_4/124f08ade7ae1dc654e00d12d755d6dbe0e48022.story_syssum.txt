(CNN) -- Since the Xbox One's release last fall, customers have been waiting (some more patiently than others) for that one great game that would single-handedly justify the purchase of the next-generation video game console.
"We think (Titanfall) can very much be a game-defining moment for Xbox One as a platform because of how much it has lit up the imagination of gamers everywhere and how it takes advantage of the unique features of Xbox One," said Microsoft Xbox Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer Yusuf Mehdi.
"You put your heart into it.
Asked if the expectations were too great for "Titanfall," he said with a laugh, "If I say yes, it makes me look like I don't have confidence in the game.
"We are able to do much more with the game.
Microsoft's Mehdi said game developers were able to store a lot of the computing that "Titanfall" uses directly onto Microsoft servers.
Zampella said the real adventure and fun begins when players realize how much freedom they have during the game.
"It isn't just about getting to Point B and crushing everybody.
"We have had a tradition of a big, multiplayer, epic game that defines each one of our console generations," Mehdi said.
'Titanfall' is certainly going to be one of those for Xbox One, no question."
