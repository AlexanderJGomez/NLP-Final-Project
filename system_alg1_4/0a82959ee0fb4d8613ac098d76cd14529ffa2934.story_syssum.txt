Golan Heights (CNN) -- Israeli troops fired on protesters trying to cross the fortified border between Syria and the occupied Golan Heights on Sunday, with Syrian authorities reporting more than a dozen dead and hundreds wounded.
The Syrian state news agency said 23 people were killed and more than 350 wounded in the protests, which continued past nightfall.
As many as 500 people took part in the demonstration, holding mid-day prayers on the Syrian side of the border, then crouching down behind ramparts that Israel constructed in response to similar demonstrations three weeks ago.
Israeli forces also fired tear gas, while Palestinians threw stones.
Those protests left at least 12 dead.
Demonstrators arrived in at least eight buses before the protest began, then came down from a hill known locally as "Shouting Hill" -- where people shout to family and friends on the other side of the border -- toward the ramparts Israeli forces constructed last month.
