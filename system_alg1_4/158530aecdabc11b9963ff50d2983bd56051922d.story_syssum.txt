Their lawsuit names the Army Corps of Engineers and the National Weather Service, which have acknowledged that a lack of communication undercut flood warnings.
"It is a simple fact that we incurred millions of dollars in damages because the Corps released so much water into the Cumberland River that it rose above the 100-year flood plain," the companies said in a joint statement.
Smith plant in the Nashville suburb of Ashland City was covered in mud and silt after the flooding, with the company estimating its losses at $76 million.
The lawsuit argues that the Corps "repeatedly provided incorrect and inaccurate information" to the Weather Service, which issued flood warnings for the Cumberland River.
