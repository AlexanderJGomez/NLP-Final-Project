Vos had spoken to the media on her mobile phone while trapped under her desk in the Pyne Gould Corporation building, drawing international attention to her plight.
In the 24 hours she spent under the rubble, Vos, 57, said she gave up hope, and accepted she would die.
There wasn't any time to think, but I am lucky I didn't go to the stairs.
I don't know what might have happened.
It was then, in severe pain and struggling to breathe, that Vos realized she may not survive.
Some time after those initial calls, Vos says she passed out.
She was awakened by shaking, but she says she doesn't know whether it was an aftershock or the building further collapsing.
The whole time I was thinking about my family and my friends and I just wanted to make it out.
She said the feeling of relief was hard to describe, especially when she saw the state of the building.
I was just trapped under my desk, you know.
I am scared.
I feel a bit like I have nothing keeping me here.
I think I would be too afraid to go into a tall building for a while," she said.
