Beijing, China (CNN) -- In a round-table meeting with government advisers and researchers of a government-run think tank on April 14, Premier Wen Jiabao enjoined them to listen to people's voices and relay these truthfully to top leaders.
"I don't think it is in contradiction to the party's crackdown on dissents," says Wenfang Tang, a political science professor at Ohio University.
In recent years, China has seen communist governments in Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan swept by political turmoil called the "color revolution".
Still, China's leaders fear outbreaks of luan (chaos).
They do not care what other people and countries will say."
"But the challenges of growing social injustice, environmental damage and sustaining high economic growth will continue to haunt the leaders."
At the same time, Chinese leaders try to project a sense of calm and normalcy.
At the press conference at the end of the annual session of China's legislature last month, I asked Premier Wen if he thought political reform was urgently needed so the leadership could better address the people's grievances and avert social unrest.
Premier Wen is not necessarily pushing for radical political reforms, analysts say.
Says Professor Wenfang Tang: "The question is whether Wen's effort to promote inner-party democracy will have a spill-over effect on political opposition outside the party.
Some observers wonder if Wen's pronouncement is just part of a "good cop, bad cop" charade, with Wen playing the reform-minded leader and President Hu Jintao playing the hard liner.
His two five-year terms will end in March 2013, after which he is expected to go into semi-retirement.
