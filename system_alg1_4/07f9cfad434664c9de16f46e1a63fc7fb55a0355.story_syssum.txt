Hayden, President George W. Bush's CIA director from 2006 to 2009, said the release of the memos emboldens terrorist groups such as al Qaeda.
That's very valuable information," Hayden said on "Fox News Sunday."
The memos include details on terrorist suspect interrogations such as waterboarding, a technique used to simulate drowning.
One memo showed that CIA interrogators used waterboarding at least 266 times on two top al Qaeda suspects.
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said Sunday that the release of the memos is consistent with how Obama conducts government.
And on the other hand, he said to those CIA employees who were following what the Department of Justice told them they could do, they would not be subject to further prosecution, because it's also about closing this chapter so we can move on to the future," Napolitano said.
