This something is someone now: Pope Francis.
While Israeli guards looked anxiously down from a nearby tower, wondering what on Earth was going on, Francis touched the wall with his right hand, bent his head, and prayed for several minutes.
My father was a Baptist minister, and once -- in 1989 -- I took him to the Church of the Nativity, the spot where (by tradition) Jesus was thought to have been born.
It became a refuge for Palestinians at this time, largely under the control of Jordan until the Six Day War in 1967.
Some 150 people then (mostly Palestinian civilians, with numerous Catholic and Orthodox monks and nuns) took refuge in the Church of the Nativity from an Israeli siege known as Operation Defensive Shield.
Ultimately, Israeli snipers shot dead eight people in or around the church; they wounded at least 22, all of them designated as terrorists by the Israeli army.
One could say that Pope Francis, in turn, follows him as a man who lives without pretense, who understands symbolic gestures.
(In a gesture of reconciliation, the pope did â€” on Monday â€” accede to an Israeli request to pray before a memorial to Israeli victims of the conflict as well.
As the pope's unexpected pause by the wall near Bethlehem makes terribly clear, this ugly partition that weaves through the West Bank has become a potent symbol of the Israeli occupation, and it's an affront to all reasonable Christians, Muslims, and Jews.
