He said Colombian officials will do whatever they can to guarantee journalist Romeo Langlois' release by the rebel group, commonly known as the FARC.
Langlois, who works for the France 24 television network and is a war reporter with more than 10 years experience in the country, was reporting alongside soldiers when the rebel group attacked on April 28, the Colombian government has said.
The Colombian government and military officials have said that Langlois was not wearing a full military uniform, but was wearing a helmet and a protective vest.
In that statement, the purported FARC commander said Langlois was "lightly wounded in one arm.
What a combatant does is armed, and Romeo Langlois never had a weapon in this circumstance, and for that very reason holding him is absurd," said Ignacio Gomez, director of the Bogota-based Free Press Foundation.
Kidnapping government forces and civilians has been a key strategy of the rebel group.
Last month, the FARC released a group of 10 members of the military and police that it said were its last government hostages.
