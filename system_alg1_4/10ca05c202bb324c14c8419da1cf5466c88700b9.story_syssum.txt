Several years later, they turned that idea into a way to help children around the world and founded the nonprofit 100cameras.
They partner with a local organization serving children in the community.
For the kids, sharing their life with the rest of the world is a reward in itself, but 100cameras goes one step further.
They know the local needs ... and they know the best ways to serve these children and their families."
Since that 2008 trip to Sudan, they have brought their cameras to Cuba and taught kids in New York.
Bullock says they have a lot of freedom as a small group to address each community's needs individually.
In Sudan it was lifelines, like food and medicine.
Cuba's greatest need was humanitarian aid like food and medicine, but the community also needed a center where the children's parents could be taught business classes.
Bullock says, "It's really exciting for kids there to see these changes and to feel an ownership in that."
To know it's their work that can create change in their own communities."
