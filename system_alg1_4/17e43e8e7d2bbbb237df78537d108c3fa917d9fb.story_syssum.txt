Bob Dylan wrote "It Ain't Me, Babe" for Joan Baez.
Further complicating things, Beethoven had hideous handwriting -- to the point that some scholars speculate the song was actually written "for Therese," as in Therese Malfatti, one of several women who turned down a marriage proposal from the notoriously lovesick maestro.
Written for: Billie Jean King, as a thank-you for a tracksuit she gave Elton.
Turns out, the song was a reference to King's pro tennis team, The Philadelphia Freedoms.
Written for: A transvestite.
If that's the case, then "Lola" is just another notch on Darling's song belt -- she's also referred to in Lou Reed's "Walk on the Wild Side."
Written for: Unknown, as the songwriters apparently make up a different story about its inspiration every time they're asked.
While the woman continues to remain a mystery, however, the phone number is all too real.
Other unfortunate phone customers have fought back with creative and profitable solutions, like the holder of 212-867-5309, who put his phone number up for auction on eBay in 2004.
However, the real success of "Oh, Carol" came a few months later, when it inspired King to write a rebuttal entitled "Oh, Neil."
After Sedaka gave a tape of the song to his boss, King and Goffin landed jobs at the legendary Brill Building pop music factory, where the duo went on to write chart-toppers like "Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow" and "The Loco-Motion."
Written for: Joan Baez, though it clearly wasn't the nicest gift Dylan could have given her.
He eventually ended up going on tour with her, which is how he first became famous, and also how the two began dating.
"Our House"
Written for: Joni Mitchell.
The couple went out to brunch, hit an antiques store, and then returned to find the house just a bit chilly, at which point Nash literally "lit a fire," while Mitchell "placed the flowers in the vase that she bought that day."
