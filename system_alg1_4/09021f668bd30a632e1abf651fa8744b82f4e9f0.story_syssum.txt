Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thailand's prime minister acknowledged on Sunday he did not expect protesters would use weapons and apply violence toward authority.
Red Shirt leaders offered Friday to return to the negotiating table -- but only if the government meets certain demands, including lifting a state of emergency and accepting responsibility for the deaths of protesters earlier this month, said Weng Tojirakarn, a co-leader of the group.
Other conditions that must be met before any negotiations could take place include having protest leaders make sure there will be no further expansion of demonstrations into other districts and no threats to government officers, the government spokesman said.
The Red Shirts have been clashing with the Thai military in a Bangkok area that serves as a financial hub.
Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban said in a televised address that the grenades were launched from the area where the Red Shirts have been encamped for weeks, but the protesters denied any responsibility for the attacks.
The official said authorities would suppress the terrorists at the appropriate time, but did not want to complicate the situation by trying to take action against them now.
Suthep said riot police and helicopters were deployed to join Thai troops in the affected area, which was still littered with glass amid the standoff.
Some fear that the emergence of such groups could spark a civil war.
He said the Thai are all one people and this shouldn't be happening.
