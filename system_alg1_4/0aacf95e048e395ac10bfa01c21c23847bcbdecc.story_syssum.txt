(CNN) -- Molly Haskell will always have brotherly love for Ellen Hampton.
"This was my 59-year-old brother," Haskell said of the revelation in a phone interview.
Haskell recently spoke to CNN about her own familial and emotional journey with her transgender sibling.
Haskell: First of all, I realized very soon that it's very overwhelming.
Haskell: I was afraid for her.
The one thing is that we are born male or female, and we need those boundaries to rub up against.
I do believe there is such a thing as a male and a female; we need these dichotomies, like good and evil.
Haskell: I think a lot of people who are transsexual emphasize the strangeness of it all.
I think it's more unnerving to people when the person does just seem so normal, but I do think we have to remember that it's not that many people.
Haskell: It's wonderful.
At first I thought I'm really losing a brother.
Haskell: I think the reason she didn't go through with it before is because there was no acceptance.
Why is so much of this happening now?
Haskell: The first time we went out in public, I was very self-conscious and nervous.
When she gets on the phone, I would see her as Chevey, my brother.
Why?
Haskell: She wished she had this book when she was struggling with it.
