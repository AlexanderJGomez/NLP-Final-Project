(CNN) -- The Syrian government is freeing some activists while arresting hundreds of others in its back-and-forth bid to placate protesters and crush dissent, a human rights lawyer said.
Last week the Syrian Arab News Agency said that a wave of arrests came as government security forces were searching for members of an "armed group" that killed "a number of citizen and security forces."
They also want the release of all political prisoners and an end to emergency law.
There is no judicial system in Syria and the security apparatus arrests people and send them to courts directly," she said.
Omar al-Abdallah, 26, was accused of "taking actions and making threat(ening) statements against the state in Syria," his brother said.
Their father remains a political prisoner, he added.
