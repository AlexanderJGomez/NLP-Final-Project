But for Debbie Fisher, who's legally blind, the visual displays used to play and chat meant they were off limits to her.
Fisher said she has always enjoyed playing games with her family.
"I always get the free version (of games) to make sure it is Voice Over compatible, which is what makes the iPhone and the iPad talk," she said.
But only one game, she says, has let her both play and communicate with friends.
Fisher said "Hanging With Friends" specifically works with Voice Over and lets her "see" what's going on and chat with her family and friends who are playing.
Paul Bettner, general manager of Zynga With Friends, said they didn't intend to make a game for the visually impaired, but are pleased that their game can be enjoyed by people like Fisher.
Fisher said there are other games that are Voice Over compatible, but they don't allow for the social interaction that "Hanging With Friends" does.
But I love this game."
