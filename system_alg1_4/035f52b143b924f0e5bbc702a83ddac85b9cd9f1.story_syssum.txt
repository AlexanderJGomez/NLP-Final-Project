(CNN) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams was released Sunday after four days in police custody in connection with the 1972 abduction and killing of a mother of 10 by the Irish Republican Army, police in Northern Ireland said.
This is my life, and I'm philosophical, and I understand that I have detractors and opponents -- and I especially understand that there [are] sinister elements who are against the changes Sinn Fein and others are committed to achieving," Adams said.
Adams had surrendered himself for questioning Wednesday evening and his detention had threatened the fragile peace in Northern Ireland, a peace Adams is in part credited with bringing about after decades of sectarian tensions.
One man has been charged with aiding and abetting the crime.
She died of a single gunshot wound to the back of the head.
