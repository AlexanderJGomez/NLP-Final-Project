Bush, who is considering a 2016 presidential run, planned on releasing the tens of thousands of emails next month.
While Bush was clearly aware that the emails could go public one day, the notes offer an insider's perspective on Bush's time in office and his dealings on issues ranging from land disputes to funding for a military base in Florida and the state's citrus industry.
On one of his top issues, for example, Bush received a "daily immigration update."

Bush slammed President Barack Obama's decision last week to normalize relations with Cuba, and it's clear from the emails that he's remained consistent on that issue.
One email exchange with a top GOP donor, Al Hoffman, gives a candid glimpse at Bush's stance on campaign finance laws.
In the email, Hoffman encourages Bush to support a campaign finance reform law working its way through the Florida legislature, but the governor balks, explaining that he's only in favor of "campaign finance reform that doesn't put us at a disadvantage."
Lauded by many in the GOP establishment as a smart, fiscally conservative governor who delivered economic gains for his state, the emails also reveal a challenge from the party's most conservative members that Bush is likely to face in an eventual GOP presidential primary.
One pro-life activist attacks Bush in an email for appointing a lawyer who represented the owner of an abortion clinic.
