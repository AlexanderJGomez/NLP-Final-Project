Washington (CNN) -- Before Tuesday night's debate, polls showed Mitt Romney had gained ground with women voters.
"Romney's discussion of his promotion of women in his gubernatorial administration was ... problematic," said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University in Atlanta.
President Barack Obama was quick to use the "binders" line against Romney on the campaign trail Wednesday.
During the debate at Hofstra University in New York, Romney, who worked in business before serving as governor of Massachusetts, said he "learned a great deal" about the inequalities between men and women in the workplace when leading his state.
The responses from the women jumped sharply on-screen when Romney spoke about workplace flexibility.
"The gap between Obama and Romney was declining and I'm not sure ... if the governor made significant headway (with women voters)," said Meena Bose, director of the Peter S. Kalikow Center for the Study of the American Presidency at Hofstra.
A USA Today/Gallup poll conducted last week showed Romney had closed the gap with women and was within one point among women who are likely voters, 48% for Romney and 49% for Obama.
After the debate, Democratic pundits criticized Romney's efforts to hire women.
Socarides gave Romney points for trying to hire women but said in doing so, "Romney demonstrates that he's living in another world."
Romney campaign surrogate Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee, said one reason more women may be looking to vote for Romney is because of his economic message.
