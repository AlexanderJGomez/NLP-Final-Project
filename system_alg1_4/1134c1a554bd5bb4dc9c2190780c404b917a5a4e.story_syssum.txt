House mice not native to the island are threatening the Tristan albatross with extinction, the RSPB said.
The mice on the island eat the chicks of the albatross and bunting before they make it to the fledgling stage, the RSPB said.
"What [the mice] are affecting is the ability of the albatross to produce enough young to sustain the population," he said.
A survey of the albatross on Gough Island in January showed 1,764 adults incubating eggs, the RSPB said.
"We've known for a long time that the mice were killing albatross chicks in huge numbers," said RSPB scientist Richard Cuthbert, who recently visited the island to assess the problem.
"Without urgent conservation action to remove the mice, both the albatross and the bunting are living on borrowed time."
It said eradicating the mice from Gough Island would solve the primary conservation threat facing both bird species.
One species -- the wandering albatross -- has a wingspan of 11 feet, the RSPB says.
