KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- NATO-led troops killed 12 insurgents in a firefight Friday in Afghanistan, and a civilian caught in the crossfire was apparently killed by militants, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said.
The militants retreated to a compound and attacked ISAF troops with small arms.
Troops found one woman who was killed in the crossfire by insurgent small arms fire, ISAF said.
Also, ISAF reported the death of a soldier from the NATO-led force Friday in eastern Afghanistan.
Overnight in the southern Afghan province of Helmand, troops killed four militants in an operation targeting a mid-level Taliban commander responsible for attacks against Afghan civilians and coalition forces.
