Will and Jada Pinkett Smith's 11-year-old daughter, Willow, was recently given a tongue-lashing on social media after posting a picture of herself sporting a tongue piercing on Instagram.
Though she later revealed that it was in fact a fake, magnetic tongue ring, people were already whipping their opinions back and forth about whether young people are too vulnerable to make permanent (or potentially scarring) decisions about their bodies.
A "family tradition," according to Garrison.
Most states allow tattoos and body piercings for children under the age of majority, which is 18 years old in most of the United States, with parental consent.
And in Minnesota, it is unlawful for anyone under age 18 to receive a tattoo without written parental consent.
They are thus a Catch-22 for young people," says Pitts-Taylor.
Hillary Kevilus recognizes that aesthetic commitment now, but it was a different story when she got her first tattoo at the age of 15.
John A. Haynes, however, says those reminders are exactly why he doesn't regret his decision to get his first tattoo at age 17.
Piercing ears is socially acceptable in America, especially for girls, in contrast to earlobe stretching or tongue rings, like Smith's, that are far less common.
The three main motivators are relationships, work and motherhood.
Cassandra Martins got her first -- and only -- tattoo when she was 15 with her mother's consent, and already began to regret it a few years later when she entered college.
It's ultimately not what the young people are doing, but why.
Did you get a tattoo at a young age?
