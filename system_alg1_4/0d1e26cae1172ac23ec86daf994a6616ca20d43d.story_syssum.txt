Kathleen Sebelius will deliver the Democratic response to President Bush's final State of the Union address - a marquee assignment for a woman who leads a state with fewer than 2 million voters.
Sebelius became the 44th governor of the state of Kansas in 2003.
"Mark my words, Sebelius will be on everyone's VP short list in 2008," Democratic blogger Markos Moulitsas said on his Daily Kos Web site, as he applauded her 2006 success in wooing disaffected Kansas Republicans.
And the 58-year-old has an offbeat sense of humor.
Sebelius has won two gubernatorial elections in a state with roughly twice as many registered Republicans as Democrats.
But she has begun to have an impact beyond the Midwest.
Democrats close to the campaign of Sen. Barack Obama told CNN Sebelius will announce after tonight's State of the Union speech that she's endorsing Obama.
