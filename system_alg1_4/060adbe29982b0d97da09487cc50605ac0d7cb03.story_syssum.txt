(CNN)After postponing its first execution of a woman in 70 years because of "cloudy" lethal injection drugs, Georgia has indefinitely postponed at least one other execution until it can analyze the cocktail it uses for the procedures, the state said Tuesday.
The drugs fell within the acceptable testing limits," the Georgia Department of Corrections said in a statement.
The Department of Corrections immediately consulted with a pharmacist, and in an abundance of caution, Inmate Gissendaner's execution has been postponed."
It was the state's first time using a new, three-drug cocktail for an execution.
Thirty-two states were left to find new drug protocols.
