Jos√© Miguel Vivanco says conviction of Peru's ex-president is a warning to those who deny human rights.
It is one of the first times a nation's own independent courts have convicted a former leader for such serious human rights crimes and it sets an important precedent for a region that suffered so much from political violence and rights violations.
Just a few years ago, Fujimori had near-total control of Peru's judiciary.
Just 20 years ago, it was exceedingly rare for even the most brutal leaders to be brought to book.
Since then, however, the tide has turned.
Thanks to these efforts, former leaders in Argentina, and Uruguay have also faced human rights trials.
The Fujimori case stands out, though, because it was Peru's national court system which demonstrated the will, capacity, and independence to try its former president.
It is likely, however, that yesterday's verdict will help give momentum to efforts currently underway in many Latin American countries to bring other human rights violators to justice.
