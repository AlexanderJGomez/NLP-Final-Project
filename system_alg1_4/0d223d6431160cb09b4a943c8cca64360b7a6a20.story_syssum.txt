It would be an even better thing if the discussion were based on fact rather than contaminated by inaccuracies and posturing.
For example, Fox News seems incapable of commenting on this story without the header "NSA Scandal," a lead that brings with it its own conclusion.
What's the NSA really about?"
Terrorists, drug traffickers, arms proliferators and the like live on a unitary global information grid where their communications co-exist with the communications of the very people the NSA is committed to protecting.
It was clear even pre-9/11 that the NSA could not do its mission without working aggressively on this common grid.
Although Congress, the courts and two administrations have authorized what the NSA is doing today, these are not easy issues.
How does the NSA get the power to do any of this?
Most intelligence collection -- by the NSA, CIA or any intelligence agency -- is not overseen by a court.
Most casual commentators simply assert that anytime the NSA is listening to an American, the agency must have a warrant.
..."
If it is tracking the communications of a legitimate foreign intelligence target and that target talks to an American, the NSA indeed covers it -- and always has.
This is what the NSA calls incidental collection of information to, from or about a U.S. person.
Like The Washington Post's August 15 headline screaming, "NSA broke privacy rules thousands of times per year, audit finds."
The NSA later confirmed that in one quarter there indeed were 115 incidents of NSA queries being incorrectly entered, mistakes such as mistyping or using overly broad search criteria.
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Hayden.
