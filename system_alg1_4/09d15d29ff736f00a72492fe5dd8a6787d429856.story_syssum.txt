(CNN) -- In his first executive order as Illinois governor, Pat Quinn established Friday the Illinois Reform Commission as an official state body under the governor's office.
His executive order "formally establishes the Illinois Reform Commission under the auspices of the governor's office," he said at a news conference.
The Illinois Senate on Thursday voted unanimously to remove impeached Blagojevich from office.
He was arrested on federal corruption charges in December.
Federal authorities allege, among other things, that he was trying to sell or trade the Senate seat that became vacant after Barack Obama was elected president.
