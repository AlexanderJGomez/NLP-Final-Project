Ready for Hillary, a pro-Clinton super PAC that has been organizing around a Clinton run for almost two years, is hosting an all-day strategy session that will bring together the different groups that have been working around a Clinton run since shortly after she left the State Department in early 2013.
Ready for Hillary has been the most high profile pro-Clinton super PAC that sprung up to boost Clinton between her years at the State Department and her eventual presidential run.
Multiple sources from the group told CNN that while Ready for Hillary will keep working until Clinton announces her candidacy, the group will wind down operations that day the former first lady announces.
The day Clinton announces, the group will also make their supporter list available to the Clinton campaign, allowing their operation to reach out and activate the supporters Ready for Hillary have cultivated across the country.
Although the group promised not to raise money for Clinton while other groups competed for donations around the 2014 midterms, organizers from Priorities have been meeting with big Democratic donors across the country and plan to contact those donors the instant Clinton announces.
Correct the Record, a communications and research outfit that has been operating for over a year, is another pro-Clinton super PAC gearing up to run side-by-side with a Clinton campaign.
While the group will have a presence at the Ready for Hillary event -- founder David Brock will moderate a panel -- over three dozen Correct the Record donors will meet Friday in New York to discuss Clinton and the future.
