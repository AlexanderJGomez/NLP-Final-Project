Can we please stop saying, "Happy New Year?"
And I grew up in New Jersey; I know a thing or two about tacky.
Seamon-Primas told me: "In my opinion, after the first week, I stop wishing others a Happy New Year, the new year is well on its way."
If you really care about how my year is going, ask me in October.
And when is the last time you heard a "Happy St. Patrick's Day" on March 19?
Tech: Losing New Year's resolve?
But among the vast array of omens that predict good fortune for the coming year, not one involves saying Happy New Year's for weeks on end.
If even one custom instructed us that extended New Year's wishes would increase the chances the year would indeed be a good one, I'd be saying Happy New Year's every day until April.
Consequently, I propose that from here out we need to come together in a bipartisan fashion -- as a lesson to our dysfunctional Congress -- and stop with New Year's wishes after the first seven days of the year.
