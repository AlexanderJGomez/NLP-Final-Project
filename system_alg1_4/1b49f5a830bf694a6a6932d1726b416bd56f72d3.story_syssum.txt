London, England (CNN) -- Whether in the form of personal history or political biography, Jung Chang has spent her writerly life telling the story of China's tumultuous recent past.
She served briefly as a Red Guard and worked a variety of odd jobs in the countryside before turning to studying English.
CNN caught up with Chang, who currently lives in London, and asked her about China and why it's so important to remember the past.
And then with Mao, there is still a lot of myth about him perpetuated in China today.
CNN: Your books are banned in China.
JC: I feel frustrated and very unhappy of course.
Hong Kong is still largely separate from mainland China, which is wonderful from my point of view as a writer.
CNN: China is such a rapidly changing country.
People are under the impression that China is what it is today because Mao had laid the foundation.
Of course, having said all that, there are still many things that frustrate me.
JC: If there isn't anything dramatic happening, I think the country will probably go on as it is for a very long time.
I hope, of course, for the obvious and the best -- I want people to enjoy the kind of freedom they do in Britain for example.
China -- as a culture, as a people -- is something that I care about.
All these things make tears come to my eyes.
