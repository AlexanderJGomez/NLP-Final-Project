Marquez equaled Valentino Rossi's record of 10 podium placings in his rookie season, set back in 2000, and became the first rider since the Italian in 2008 to win four successive races.
"Before we came here I didn't expect win, because Jorge and Valentino had both tested at Brno recently and Dani is always so fast here and won the race last year," Marquez told the MotoGP website.
"Today was better than Indy, especially because my gap to the front is half what it was there," the Yamaha rider said.
