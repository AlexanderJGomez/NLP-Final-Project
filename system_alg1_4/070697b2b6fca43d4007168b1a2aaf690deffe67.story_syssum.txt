What hurt is that we lost the chance to win a gold medal that we could take home and show our family and our kids.
Ronaldinho, Chelsea defender David Luiz and Barcelona's Dani Alves are among the more established stars hoping to be named as one of the three players aged over 23 who will be allowed in the final 18-man squad.
