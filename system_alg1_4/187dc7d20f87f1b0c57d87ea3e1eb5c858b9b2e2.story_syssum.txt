(CNN) -- Kenny Dalglish last managed a football club more than a decade ago, and he was given a stark reminder of how much the game has changed since then as Manchester United spoiled his return to the hotseat at Liverpool on Sunday.
I have seen the replay and unless they have changed the rules, it is no penalty," he told reporters following his first match as a manager since leaving Scottish club Celtic in 2000.
Dalglish's next task following his appointment to the end of this season as replacement for Roy Hodgson is to prepare Liverpool for Wednesday's Premier League trip to Blackpool, with the club 12th in the table just four points above the bottom three.
Manager Alex Ferguson expects England striker Wayne Rooney to be ready to return from an ankle injury well before then.
At that point, we said no.
Meanwhile, Chelsea also progressed to the fourth round of the FA Cup with a  thumping 7-0 win over managerless second division club Ipswich on Sunday.
Manchester City face an FA Cup replay after the club's former manager Sven Eriksson led second division Leicester to a 2-2 home draw.
Spurs' 19-year-old midfielder Andros Townsend opened the scoring, then England striker Jermain Defoe netted twice against his former club.
