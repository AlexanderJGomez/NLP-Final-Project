TOKYO (CNN) -- The U.S. military held a "Day of Reflection" on Friday for troops in Japan after allegations that two U.S. service members committed sexual assaults on the southern island of Okinawa.
"As responsible members of the Japanese community, and consistent with the values of our military, we will continue to do everything possible to prevent incidents," said Lt. Gen. Bruce A. Wright, commander of the U.S. forces in Japan.
Police in Okinawa said Thursday they were investigating a second reported sexual assault involving an employee of the U.S. Army.
The U.S. Army in Japan said it was aware of the incident but did not give further details.
The U.S. military announced Wednesday that it was restricting the movements of all American troops and their families in Okinawa because of the allegation involving the Japanese girl.
It was taking part in more than 23 locations on Okinawa and mainland Japan, the military said.
More than 40,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Japan, most of them on Okinawa.
She said reported sexual assaults committed by U.S. servicemen on Okinawa have continued despite years of promises to prevent them.
"The U.S. military bases in Okinawa and Japan are not welcome," Watanabe said.
