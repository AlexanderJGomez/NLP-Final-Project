(CNN) -- As a professor who sees firsthand how tough it is to get into college, I expected to hear widespread howls of protests from high school seniors and their parents when, this fall, a Kaplan Test Prep survey showed that an increasing number of college admissions officers were discovering information on Facebook and Google that hurt a student's acceptance chances.
With Harvard's 5.9% acceptance rate and six of the eight Ivy League schools taking in fewer than 10% of their applicants, competition is certainly tough for ambitious students.
However, this doesn't mean we should brush aside the ethical questions that arise when college admissions officers get information about an applicant from the Internet rather than from the applicant directly.
I asked everyone to answer on the record, and what I found was that none of the admissions officers who responded said they made it a practice to search the Internet for information about their applicants.
Debra Shaver, the dean of admissions at Smith College, had this to say of student writing on the Internet: "I do think that students can be held accountable.
At the same time, they are not about to turn a blind eye to facts about their applicants -- even if they come across the facts by happenstance.
At present, it is unrealistic to expect colleges to come up with a policy on admissions and social media that they can all agree on.
That's the least they can do for applicants who may be dangerously naÃ¯ve about the consequences of their Facebook or Google posts.
Their new maxim should be "caveat discipulus": Let the student beware.
