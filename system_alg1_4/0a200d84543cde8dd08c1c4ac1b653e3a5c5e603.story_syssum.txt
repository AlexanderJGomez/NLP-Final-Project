Of the 50 animals Thompson released, 48 were killed by law enforcement, while two primates were killed by the other animals, zoo officials said.
The five animals being returned to Marian Thompson were never released from their cages by her late husband.
State officials said they were concerned that Marian Thompson has said she would put the five remaining animals into the same cages they previously inhabited on her Zanesville farm.
Deputies are ready to deal with any problems with the returned animals, Lutz said.
"Zoo officials encourage lawmakers to pass a bill quickly to ensure public safety and protect the welfare of animals," the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium said in a news release.
