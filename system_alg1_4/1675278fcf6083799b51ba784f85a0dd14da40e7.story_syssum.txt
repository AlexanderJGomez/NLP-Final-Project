So says a new report, which estimates that the richest 1% will have as much wealth as the other 99% combined by next year.
"Do we really want to live in a world where the 1% own more than the rest of us combined?"
The 80 richest people on the planet have the same wealth as the poorest 3.5 billion people, the report says.
"Of the remaining 52% of global wealth,  46%  is owned by the rest of the richest fifth of the world's population," the report says.
Meanwhile, the "global elite" members had an average wealth of $2.7 million each last year, it says.
