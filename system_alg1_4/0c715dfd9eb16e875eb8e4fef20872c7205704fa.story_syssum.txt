Tokyo (CNN) -- The light bulb above our dining room table begins to swing.
There's a loud rumble and a roar.
But not for long.
The room jumps up and down and moves from side to side.
"Well done, you survived your first earthquake," she says with a smile.
The Tokyo Earthquake Simulation Center is located on the fourth floor of the city's Ikebukuro Bosai-kan fire station.
The computer-controlled earthquake mimics a quake measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale.
No area of the earth is entirely free from the threat, although some areas are more active than others.
The world's biggest earthquake is believed to have been the 1960 Valdiva Quake in Chile, which was a 9.5.
A serious earthquake with accompanying aftershocks is simulated every half hour every day except weekends and Tuesdays at Tokyo's Life Safety Learning center.
Our programs improve all-round earthquake skills."
The center has a permanent exhibition to the 1923 Tokyo earthquake.
The shock started a tsunami tidal wave that reached a height of 36 feet at Atami on Sagama Bay, where it destroyed a further 150 houses and killed 60 more people.
There's a special room where you're given a canister and told to spray foam over anything and everything.
Students learn how to protect themselves and prevent fires from spreading after an earthquake.
"We have a lot of people coming back.
Would you like to enjoy another one yourself?"
I can cause earthquakes!"
The room begins to shake again.
The Tokyo area experiences minor tremors every day.
"But it won't be so much fun," my earthquake examiner says.
