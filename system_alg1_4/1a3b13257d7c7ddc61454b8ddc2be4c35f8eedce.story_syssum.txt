Washington (CNN) -- A judge on Monday ordered the release of sealed documents and transcripts from court proceedings related to the murder case of Chandra Levy, a Washington intern whose disappearance in 2001 drew national headlines and damaged a U.S. congressman's political career.
Guandique repeatedly said at his trial he had nothing to do with Levy's death.
Guandique's defense attorney, Jonathan Anderson, on Monday questioned Morales' credibility and said he had given contradictory testimony about Guandique.
Condit was never a suspect in the case, but he was questioned intensively for details about Levy's whereabouts.
The sealed information is from hearings late last year and earlier this year.
