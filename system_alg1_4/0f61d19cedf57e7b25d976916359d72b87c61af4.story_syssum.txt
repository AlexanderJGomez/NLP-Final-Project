In a two-year mission likely to start in May, New Zealand personnel will  train Iraq security forces at the Taji Military Complex north of Baghdad, Key said.
Key said attacks in Ottawa, Sydney and Paris had underscored the risk of complacency.
Opposition leaders were quick to condemn the decision, which they said should have been debated and voted on in parliament.
They will not just be behind the wire; they will be exposed to the much wider conflict; it will not be just the soldiers we send to the Iraq, it will be Kiwis traveling around the world," Little said.
Key said the government had carefully considered New Zealand's contribution to the coalition.
The deployment came at the request of the Iraqi government and was likely to be a joint training mission with neighboring Australia, Key said.
"There is definitely a risk in joining the international effort and that risk is first of all that New Zealand personnel in the region will become a more identifiable target," he told CNN.
"The secondary risk is that New Zealand involvement in the international effort will radicalize people in New Zealand and or Australia.
Jackson warned that the conflict would likely escalate and said that New Zealand had no clear exit strategy.
"It's been clear for some time that the government was intending to make a military contribution," he said.
The delay had also  provided opposition parties with plenty of opportunity to poke holes in the government's argument for joining the coalition, he said.
This is of course not like 2003, this is not an unrequested invasion," he said.
The United States said it welcomed New Zealand's contribution.
