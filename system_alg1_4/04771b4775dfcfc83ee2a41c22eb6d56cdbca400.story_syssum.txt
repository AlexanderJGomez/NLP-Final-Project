Rio de Janeiro (CNN) -- Soldiers in full combat gear move silently through a sprawling shantytown in northern Rio de Janeiro, pointing weapons down narrow alleys and poking through sacks of cement in search of drugs.
The troops will remain until at least July 31, after the World Cup ends, Escoto said.
While soldiers have provided support during the initial campaign, they have been replaced by police posts in most operations.
Unlike many of the favelas that cling to the hills near Rio's picturesque beaches, the Complexo da Mare is a sprawling, mostly flat shantytown that combines 15 different neighborhoods in the city's smoggy north zone.
So far, they have registered more than a half dozen gun battles.
The resurgence in violence in some of the favelas already pacified has raised alarms in a city that will host many of the 600,000 international fans attending the World Cup.
"Use common sense, grab a cab in the evening," he said.
In the Complexo da Mare, Escoto said the military will have everything under control.
