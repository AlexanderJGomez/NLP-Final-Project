MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- A grand jury Tuesday indicted four suspects on charges of first degree felony murder and armed burglary in the slaying of Washington Redskins star Sean Taylor.
They were ordered held without bail at the Pre-Trial Detention Center in Miami, Florida, where Corrections Officer Janelle Hall said they are under suicide watch.
Miami-Dade police investigators said they believe the burglars thought the house was empty.
Police said Taylor and his girlfriend, Jackie Garcia, were awakened by noise coming from the living room early November 26.
Authorities have said Garcia told police she was hiding under the bedding during the attack, did not see what happened and could not provide a suspect description.
A police report from that incident said someone forced a window open and left a kitchen knife on a bed.
