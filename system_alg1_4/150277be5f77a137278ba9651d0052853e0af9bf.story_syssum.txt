William Jelani Cobb says Somalia's piracy problem was fueled by environmental and political events.

Somalia is like Afghanistan in that we had a great deal of interest in the place during the Cold War and more or less forgot about it afterward.
And like Afghanistan, Somalia quickly fell into disarray after the Cold War ended and the United States cut off support.
But that incident actually served as a kind of foreshadowing and highlighted yet another link to Afghanistan: The forces that attacked American troops in Mogadishu were reportedly linked to al Qaeda.
In the wake of the government collapse, the Somali coast became a target of illegal commercial fishing.
To add to the burden, the coast also became a favorite locale for nuclear waste dumping.
Similarly, we were not talking about the over-fishing and nuclear waste issues -- to the extent we do talk about them now -- before the Somalis began to respond in kind.
Given the recent history of unstable states like Afghanistan and Iraq, piracy is actually one of the milder problems we could have expected from the region.
In light of this incident we should recognize there are two sets of victims here: innocent workers taken hostage by pirates and those people living along the poisoned and depleted Somali coast who may well see these pirates as heroes.
Extortion and kidnapping on the high seas is certainly wrong, but by ignoring the dumping of nuclear waste and the threats to the regional food supply, we effectively created a niche for these pirates.
