Many of the robots in "Terminator Salvation" are real machines, which increased realism, the cast says.
The choice to use real robots when possible, instead of CGI (computer generated images), was deliberate, McG said.
We can feel when something is CGI and that's no disrespect to CGI -- we couldn't do this movie without it -- but, whenever possible, in the tradition of Sam Winston, he wanted to build the robots.
So, we built all the robots, we built all the sets, we blew them up for real, a great many of us lost our eyebrows!
