Two teenage girls were killed early Tuesday when a train derailed on the bridge they were sitting on, spilling coal and burying the young women, police in Maryland said.
Another appeared to look down Main Street.
He said he grew concerned when he heard about the accident and saw the pictures on Twitter that indicated Mayr and Nass were on the bridge.
A spokesman said Nass was an honors student in the interdisciplinary liberal studies program.
Butko said Mayr was a very funny girl.
He said the train -- with two locomotives and 80 cars  -- was going 25 mph when it jumped the tracks.
"It's probably just as well to stay away, not just to be off the tracks, but stay away from the train so you know you're going to be safe," she added.
According to the Federal Railroad Administration, through the first five months of the year, 178 people have been killed in accidents on or near tracks (not including at a railroad crossing).
