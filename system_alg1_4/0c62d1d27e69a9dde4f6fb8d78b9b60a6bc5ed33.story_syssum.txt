Robertson interviewed Meshaal over the weekend in Qatar, where he lives.
Robertson asked Meshaal why Hamas is firing rockets from civilian neighborhoods.
Up until now have been killed 1700 people, while we have killed 63 soldiers.
Meshaal called that a lie and said Hamas is not seeking international sympathy through its own victims.
Meshaal said Israel has a powerful military but the Palestinians will triumph.
We are the rightful owners of the land, and they are the thieves of the land.
Robertson pressed Meshaal on the point, asking how this can be a victory for Hamas and its cause when so many Palestinians are dying.
He's the one responsible for this.
Hamas has agreed to cease-fires through Egyptian mediators "many times" since 2003, Meshaal said.
"Regardless what the others' positions (are), we stated that we are ready to go as a Palestinian delegation to Cairo in order to talk to the Egyptians so they can hold indirect talks between us and the Israelis, so we can reach an agreement that will address our Palestinian demands, headed by ending the siege of Gaza.
"We the Palestinian people have, since 1948, have listened to the international community and U.N. and international regulations, in the hope they end the aggression against us.
Meshaal said he would support a temporary cease-fire for humanitarian purposes.
