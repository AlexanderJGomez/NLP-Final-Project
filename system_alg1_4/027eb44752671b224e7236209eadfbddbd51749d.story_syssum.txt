Knowing next to nothing about what they might encounter in the dark recesses of the hotel, Indian Army commandos decided to go back in -- and were met by terrorists firing mercilessly, throwing  grenades and continuously switching positions.
Through it all, the commandos walked down pitch-black halls, trying to navigate the damaged hotel without knowing the layout.
Watch what it was like inside the hotel for commandos Â»
"There was one person on the hotel staff who was helping to guide us around."
"Then we heard gunshots on the second floor and we rushed toward the fired shots," he said.
The attackers had a clear advantage, commandos said, because it was apparent from their movements they knew the hotel's layout.
As the commandos approached one of the rooms, attackers opened fire at them and said all the people in the room were dead.
"We fired at them and they fired at us, but because the room was absolutely dark and we had just gotten [inside] it made it difficult for us," the commando said.
But the attackers knew all the doors, he said.
"Within the first exchanges of fire, we could have got those terrorists -- but there was so many hotel guests -- there were bodies all over and blood all over.
In trying to rescue hostages and trapped civilians, commandos had to convince guests they were there to help, not terrorists trying to trick them, Indian Army Lt. Gen. Noble Thamburaj said.
CNN-IBN said that attacks at the Taj Mahal Hotel were well under way at 9:30 p.m. Wednesday, but unnamed sources said the commandos were not given the go-ahead to take part in the rescue until midnight.
Once they arrived, the sources said, commandos had no precise maps of the hotel layout or its access points.
