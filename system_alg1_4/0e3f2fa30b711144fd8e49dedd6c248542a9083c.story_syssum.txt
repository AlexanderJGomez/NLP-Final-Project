NEW YORK (CNN) -- Twenty-four people, including eight children, were injured in an apparent gas explosion at a Harlem apartment building, the New York Fire Department said.
One child was in critical condition and the three others were in serious condition, New York Fire Department Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta said.
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg visited the five-floor building after the explosion.
Residents who assisted in pulling the injured out of the building said some kind of restaurant was being operated on the bottom floor of the building.
The building, which has 20 apartments, was evacuated, as were apartment buildings on both sides, Scoppetta said.
