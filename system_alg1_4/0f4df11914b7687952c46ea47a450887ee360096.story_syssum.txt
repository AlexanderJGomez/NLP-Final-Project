(CNN) -- Nearly one in four people worldwide is Muslim -- and they are not necessarily where you might think, according to an extensive new study that aims to map the global Muslim population.
Nearly two out of three of the world's Muslims are in Asia, stretching from Turkey to Indonesia.
There are about 1.57 billion Muslims in the world, according to the report, "Mapping the Global Muslim Population," by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life.
"Overall, the number is higher than I expected," he said, noting that earlier estimates of the global Muslim population have ranged from 1 billion to 1.8 billion.
Their aim was to get the most comprehensive snapshot ever assembled of the world's Muslim population at a given moment in time.
One in five of the world's Muslims lives in a country where Muslims are a minority.
"In the rest of Europe -- Russia, Albania, Kosovo, those places -- Muslims are an indigenous population," he said.
The Pew researchers concluded that Nigeria is just over half Muslim, making it the sixth most populous Muslim country in the world.
One in three of the world's Shiite Muslims lives in Iran, which is one of only four countries with a Shiite majority, he said.
"We don't care only about Muslims," Grim said.
"This is no way reflects the religiosity of people, only their self-identification," Grim said.
