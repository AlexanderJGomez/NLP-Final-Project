On Thursday, the agency proposed rules that call for strict regulation of electronic cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, nicotine gels, water pipe tobacco and hookahs.
Initially, the only health warning required for e-cigarettes would be about the potential for addiction to nicotine.
E-cigarettes deliver nicotine to the user as a vapor.
Because they have not been fully studied, the FDA says it's unknown what health risks they pose, how much nicotine or other chemicals are actually being inhaled, or whether there is any benefit to using them.
"It's really the wild, wild West out there," said Margaret Hamburg, FDA commissioner.
"We're already conducting research and working with partners in the research community to better understand patterns of use of these e-cigarettes and  to learn more about the way in which they work and the delivery of the nicotine through e-cigarettes.
Miguel Martin, president of LogicTechnology Development -- considered the second-largest electronic cigarette company in the U.S. -- said he is encouraged by the FDA announcement.
The company has nine products on the market, both disposable and rechargeable, but no flavored nicotine products.
Experts have said that e-cigarettes, if properly regulated, could help reduce the number of people who use conventional cigarettes and die of tobacco-related disease.
"How concentrated is liquid nicotine?
But what precautions do consumers take when they put the nicotine vials in?
Hamburg said it's buyer beware.
If the FDA broadens its authority to regulate tobacco products, she said, it will make a major contribution to the health of Americans.
"This delay has had serious public health consequences as these unregulated tobacco products have been marketed using tactics and sweet flavors that appeal to kids, and their use has skyrocketed.
