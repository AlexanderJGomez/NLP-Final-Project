The 43-year-old former Russian agent turned Kremlin critic pointed his finger directly at Vladimir Putin, then as now, Russia's strongman president.
The poison used to kill Litvinenko is a rare radioactive isotope, polonium-210.
The kinds of facilities, in other words, controlled by a state.
He was a former agent of the Russian Federal Security Service, the FSB, the post-Soviet successor of the feared KGB.
His last job at the agency was heading up its anti-corruption department.
Why, for instance was polonium-210 chosen to kill Litvinenko?
But the biggest question of all is whether the killing was ordered by the state, or was the work of rogue elements within it.
Perhaps only President Putin, himself a former KGB agent, has the answer to that.
