"I can only rejoice about the decision of inclusion of women's boxing," IOC President Jacques Rogge told reporters.
Have your say - should women's boxing be included?
Rogge pointed out that women's boxing has around 200 athletes who could potentially compete in 2012, while softball has only around 120.
As a result, he said, the IOC considered women's boxing to be more popular.
The International Rugby Board has proposed men's and women's Sevens tournaments, with 12 teams in each being divided into two pools before semifinals and finals.
