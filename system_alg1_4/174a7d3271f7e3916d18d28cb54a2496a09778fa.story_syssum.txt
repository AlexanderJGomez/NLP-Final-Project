(CNN) -- My great-grandmother used to laugh in moments of misfortune and confusion.
This trend came to a sickening halt this week when the Senate sought to extend critical protections to immigrant and Native American women, as well as LGBT people.
Before VAWA, women saw little incentive and an ominous downside to reporting abuse.
That led the Senate to pass an expanded version of the reauthorized bill -- one that extends protections to populations that remain vulnerable.
The need is clear: A full third of Native American women will be raped in their lifetimes; an even higher number will experience physical and emotional abuse.
These same husbands often threaten deportation and separation from children if their wives seek help or report abuse.
These reforms seem like no-brainers in the face of so many brutalized women.
More protections for these immigrant women would cost Spivack's company a lot of money.
But the result today is millions of ignored and vulnerable women within our own borders.
