But despite his menagerie of ceremonial credits, the consummate entertainer admits that it's the Tony Awards -- which Harris is hosting for the third time on Sunday, June 10, on CBS -- that hold the dearest spot in his heart.
Despite powerful performances, plays typically tend to get short shrift at the musical-focused Tonys â€” a foregone conclusion of the ceremony that Harris hopes to change this year.
"I'm really trying this year to figure out a way to get performances by plays somehow in the show," Harris tells EW.
"The more content I end up doing, then the less time everyone gets to spend watching performances, and really, in addition to doling out awards, that's the reason you watch," says Harris, who last year sang a duet with Hugh Jackman, a group performance with the New York Philharmonic cast of "Company" and a full opening and closing number.
As we count down the days until we can see what NPH has up his sleeve at the Tony Awards, we'll just have to make do with his opening number from last year.
