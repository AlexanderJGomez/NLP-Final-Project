It was two days after ADM fired Whitacre and accused him of embezzling millions from the company.
Some scenes just can't be played for laughs.
"There was nothing comical in the reality of the story," said Whitacre, who eventually spent nearly nine years in prison for his role in the price-fixing scheme and revelations he siphoned off $9 million from the company while he was working for the FBI.
"He didn't want to talk to a 52-year-old Mark Whitacre while preparing for the role, the Mark Whitacre who went to prison, who has been treated for bipolar disorder, who is now COO of a company," said Whitacre, who is now an executive for a small food supplement maker.
"As a result of this case, the Department of Justice and the FBI started looking around to see if they could find any other cases like this," said Dean Paisley, a retired FBI agent who supervised the undercover ADM work.
Last month Japanese company Epson agreed to pay $26 million for its role in price-fixing LCD panels used in mobile phones in the U.S. Several other companies, including Sharp, LG and Hitachi, have already pleaded guilty in the case and paid fines of more than $600 million.
"The movie should be taken very, very seriously," said Sam Antar, a CPA who turned government witness against his employer in the 1980's.
Whitacre said he began stealing millions from the company while working for the FBI, in part, as a financial backstop in case things went wrong.
"There were no provisions for similar checks and balances with Whitacre," Paisley said.
Although Whitacre has served his time, Paisley and other agents involved in his case are seeking a presidential pardon.
