It's no wonder, then, that Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Doha, Istanbul and Riyadh are each vying to throw up the biggest and grandest transportation hub in the region.
It will also alter the Abu Dhabi skyline.
Doha's impending Hamad International Airport will house the world's second longest runway, while Istanbul and Dubai are competing for the title of world's largest airport.
The Abu Dhabi terminal, for instance, will also house a museum to pique interest in the city's impending Louvre and Guggenheim additions.
Perhaps more telling than the various design features are the airports' planned capacities; combined, they will ultimately accommodate 450 million passengers a year -- a significant jump from the 140 million that currently make their way through the region.
"Maybe they won't fill capacity in the next five years, but I don't think any of the airports will collapse.
"This is a country that sees the value of aviation and embraces it," says Lorne Riley, head of corporate communications at Dubai Airports.
This year, it surpassed Charles de Gaulle in terms of international passenger traffic, making it the second busiest airport in the world.
By the end of the year, we should reach 66 million," says Riley.
Will they hit the exact numbers they talk about?
Riley admits that there won't be room for two Dubai airports.
What will ultimately happen to Dubai International, though, remains to be seen.
