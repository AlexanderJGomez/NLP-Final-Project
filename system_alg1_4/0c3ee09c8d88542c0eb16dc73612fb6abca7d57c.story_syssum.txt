(CNN) -- Today's hotel bathrooms are more than the sum of their sinks and shower heads.
Fresh air and natural light are prized commodities, as are stunning views of skylines or natural landscapes.
Here are ten hotel bathrooms that cohesively balance utility and beauty.
Opened in June, Park Hyatt Vienna has a Presidential Suite that comes with a grand marble bathroom containing a striking lapis lazuli wall and a walk-in rain shower.
Rooms start at $510.
Designed by local talent Ronald Zurcher, this Costa Rican retreat engages with its natural surroundings and local traditions.
Rooms start at $450.
Drawing from the luxurious design elements of the hotel lobby and the suite itself, the master bathroom features an original collection of lighting fixtures and hand-perforated brass hardware.
Rooms start at $280.
Made with 95 percent local resources, including natural wood, the ceramic-intense rooms make a bold, clean statement with touches of nature.
