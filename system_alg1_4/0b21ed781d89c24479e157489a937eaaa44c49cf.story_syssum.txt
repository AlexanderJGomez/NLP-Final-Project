Excited and humble, he congratulated her on being the new king of Otuam.
The previous king of Otuam, who was Bartels's uncle, had just died.
Over the course of a few days, she went from being plain old Peggielene Bartels, who had worked for nearly three decades at the Ghanaian Embassy in the United States, to becoming King Peggy -- the first female king of Otuam, reigning over approximately 7,000 people.
We have to be ready to accept it because helping my people has really helped me a lot to know that I can really touch their lives," she adds.
King is the traditional title of Otuam's ruler, and Bartels says she's happy to be called a king, rather than queen, because it means she can achieve more.
In Washington, her secretarial duties include typing letters, answering phone calls and booking appointments.
But back in Ghana, she stands out as a gold crown-wearing, scepter-holding king who lives in a refurbished palace.
"When I am back home they see me as their king and they want to pamper me," she says.
But beyond the bows, the royal attire and certain luxuries that come with her title, being a king in an impoverished place like Otuam is all about dealing with the pressing needs of the community and improving the lives of the people, says Bartels.
Her next priority, she says, is to bring state-of-the-art toilets to Otuam.
And even when she's not in Ghana, her royal duties do not stop; she wakes up at 1am every morning to call Otuam and be informed about what's happening in the community.
"Queen Latifah is going to play me and I'm so happy to at least let the whole world know that a secretary can become a king and lead wisely and help the people."
