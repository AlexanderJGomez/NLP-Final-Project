Meanwhile, Democrats blamed the Bush administration for the financial crisis, while the White House pointed a finger at Congress.
"Once again the Fed has put the taxpayers on the hook for billions of dollars to bail out an institution that put greed ahead of responsibility and used their good name to take risky bets that did not pay off," said Sen. Jim Bunning, R-Kentucky, a member of the Senate Banking Committee.
Republican Rep. Roy Blunt of Missouri complained about not getting a heads-up about the bailout and said House Republicans are struggling to "understand a coherent strategy" about which firms get rescued and which ones don't.
"The most recent bailout initiated by the Bush administration -- that of AIG -- is just another example that George Bush is a failed manager," said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California.
"But also, why don't we just set that aside for a minute and focus on the fact that we have a crisis that we're trying to manage."
Reid said he will keep the Senate in session through the end of the year so committees can hold hearings and start writing legislation that he said could become law next year.
He also said the Federal Reserve should make sure the bailout plan protects well-paying jobs and helps Americans pay their bills.
We'll put an end to running Wall Street like a casino.
