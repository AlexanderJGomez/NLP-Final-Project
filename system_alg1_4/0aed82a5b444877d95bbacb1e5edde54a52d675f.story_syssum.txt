Hawking, on the other hand, has lived more than 40 years since he learned he had the disease, which is also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease in America and motor neuron disease, or MND, in the United Kingdom.
The physicist should be a role model for people with the disease as well as those without it, Hawkins said.
This empowerment theme is part of the mission of the ALS Association, she said.
Hawking has had direct involvement in promoting awareness and research into his disease.
Hawking's case is also unusual because his condition was diagnosed at a young age, said Sharon Matland, vice president of patient services at the ALS Association.
Barry said she knows of a man in Ireland who has lived with the disease for 30 years -- but only about 5 percent of people with ALS live longer than 10 years.
"It slowly takes over your entire muscle structure and eventually your limbs are affected, your speech may or may not be affected.
People with ALS may also find it difficult to lift their arms or feet, Matland said.
The nature of the disease is that it's very different in each person, she said.
Drugs in these trials include lithium, ceftriaxone, and memantine, according to the ALS Association.
In the UK, the MND Association is funding a trial for lithium, which has produced promising results in mice, Barry said.
Hawkins said he will be participating in the 2009 Fayetteville, North Carolina, Walk to Defeat ALS in May.
"I would encourage everyone to recognize how terrible this disease is, and encourage them to support the ALS Association and research projects," he said.
