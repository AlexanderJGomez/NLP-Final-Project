Los Angeles traffic police arrested the stand-up comic on "suspicion" of drunken driving early Sunday.
When patrol officers pursued him, he took an off ramp and pulled over, police said.
In a stand-up routine in his 2011 movie "Laugh At My Pain," Hart lampooned his father's alleged embarrassing behavior due to a drug addiction.
Hart has been in various movies, including "Think Like a Man" and "The Five-Year Engagement."
