Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Fighting continued Monday as rival Libyan militias battled for Tripoli International Airport and the interim government said it was considering asking for international military help.
The government in a written statement said early Tuesday that it discussed at an emergency session "a potential request for international forces to solidify the state's capabilities" at an emergency session.
It said any commander that orders attacks on civilian facilities, including the airport, will face charges of murder.
The government said the customs building, maintenance building and some national security department planes had been destroyed.
"This is a temporary measure," the United Nations said in a written statement.
The United Nations, which stood by the Libyan people in their revolution in 2011, will not abandon them as they seek to build a democratic state."
Other militias have tried to wrest control of the airport from the Zintan brigades for years.
Nine people were killed that day and 25 others wounded, the government said.
The U.S. State Department said this past weekend it was concerned the fighting could lead to widespread conflict and backed the new government.
