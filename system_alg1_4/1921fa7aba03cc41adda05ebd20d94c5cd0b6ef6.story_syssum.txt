(CNN) -- Williams have become the first of the 10 current Formula One teams to confirm their entry for the 2010 world championship.
"We have done that, because we have a contract with Bernie Ecclestone's Formula One Management, and also with the FIA, called the Concorde Agreement.
We have been paid in full for our participation.
It is very important for our employees, sponsors and fans to know we will be in Formula One for next year and many years to come."
Parr is eager to stress Williams have not broken ranks with FOTA, that the team remains fully committed to the organisation and their efforts to build a relationship with the FIA for a better F1.
But what we have here is a marriage.
Parr added: "We have 10 teams all committed to Formula One.
We are trying to be reasonable and find a sensible solution."
