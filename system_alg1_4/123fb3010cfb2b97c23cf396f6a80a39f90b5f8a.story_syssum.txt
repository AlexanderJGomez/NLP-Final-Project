The government was applying a provincial law barring ships traveling under British colony flags from docking at the port, said the state-run Telam news agency.
"Because the ship had previously called at Stanley, it was denied entry to Ushuaia," said Julie Benson, a spokeswoman for Carnival Corp. She was referring to the port city in the Falkland Islands, which are referred to in Argentina as Las Malvinas.
The ship "was this morning refused permission for its scheduled docking in the Argentinian port of Ushuaia by the local mayor on the grounds that it had visited the Falklands Islands two days before," said CNN contributor Robin Oakley, who was aboard the Adonis as a lecturer.
The head of the province's port authority, Alejandro Berola, said that the decision to turn away the ships was made following "express instructions" from Gov.
The president of the tourism board of Usuaia, Marcelo Lieti, said Monday's incident "had nothing to do with the Malvinas subject," according to Telam.
"The policy that the government is carrying out, in reality, is distancing us from the Malvinas instead of getting us nearer," said Jorge Latana, a journalist who has proposed greater cultural integration with the islands' inhabitants.
In Argentina, it is very odd the way one thinks about Malvinas, because the public thinks of it as if no one lived there.
Latana said that Argentina was being inconsistent.
On one hand it is attacking England through the Malvinas and on the other it is favoring some businesses to exploit minerals.
