No one knows what was said amongst Solange Knowles, Jay Z and Beyonce in that elevator in the Standard Hotel in Manhattan or even what led up to the video that appears to show Solange kicking and hitting her brother-in-law.
The incident has inspired a hashtag, #WhatJaySaidToSolange, countless memes and tons of speculation.
This, according to the Daily News, did not sit well with Beyonce's younger sister.
Beyonce has posted happy pictures of her and her sister, while Solange participated in "Throwback Thursday" with a picture of the two siblings as kids.
I am actually impressed with her independent spirit... She seems like a fighter #festivallife."
