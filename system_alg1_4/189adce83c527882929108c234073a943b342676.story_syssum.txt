So many are now imagining an end to the energy crisis.
We need to innovate alternative energy sources now more than ever ... and our choices are limited.
All need time-consuming innovations so we cannot afford to hesitate; research must be ramped up across the board and government must keep up the pace.
The catch is fusion is very hard to do.
It is not easy to build a device that runs at ten times the temperature of the Sun, but it is possible.
We must now extend that duration and power and innovate technologies to make fusion electricity at a price that the consumer will pay.
Called ITER -- it is designed to reach a self-sustaining fusion burn -- the last scientific hurdle to fusion power.
In addition to clearing our last remaining scientific hurdle, we need to advance a parallel engineering agenda into key reactor technologies that will enable commercial fusion power plants to reliably deliver electricity in a highly competitive market.
If we continue to starve the technological research agenda of funds, however, we risk delaying fusion power and ceding technological leadership to China and Korea.
Fusion research including ITER construction is less than â‚¬1.5 billion ($2 billion) a year -- not even 0.05% of the market.
Only if we sufficiently fund alternative energy research now.
