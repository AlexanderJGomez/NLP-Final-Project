Miami (CNN) -- After weeks on the run and days in immigration detention, American technology pioneer John McAfee arrived in Miami on Wednesday.
For the past week, McAfee waged a public battle, requesting an asylum in Guatemala and arguing that police in Belize were persecuting him.
"He opted to return to his country of origin," said attorney Telesforo Guerra, who has represented McAfee since he arrived in Guatemala last week.
CNN en EspaÃ±ol's Adriana Hauser reported from Miami.
Journalist Miguel Salay reported from Guatemala City.
