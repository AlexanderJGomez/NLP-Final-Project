Hura, Israel (CNN) -- Israeli riot police broke up a demonstration comprising more than 1,000 people who were protesting an Israeli Parliament plan to displace tens of thousands of Bedouin from southern Israel's Negev.
In the protests here, Israeli riot police -- some of them on horseback -- fired stun grenades, tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon to disperse the protesters, most of whom appeared young.
"Prawer is the plan to take out Palestinians -- the indigenous people -- from their land in the a Negev and bring instead Jewish settlers.
The Prawer Plan would allow Israeli police to use force in its expulsion of Palestinian-Bedouin, they said in a news release.
The plan negates Palestinian-Bedouin ownership rights in their ancestral land, it gives Israel's Prime Minister unprecedented powers to implement the plan and it legitimizes the use of violence and coercion in the execution of the plan."
