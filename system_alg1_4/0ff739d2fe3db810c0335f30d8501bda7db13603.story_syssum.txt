(CNN) -- Loyda Rodriguez says she can still remember the day her daughter was taken.
In 2008, she told ABC News a woman appeared in her backyard and grabbed her out of her arms, while she was trying to enter her house.
Reached Friday by phone, Rodriguez told CNN she does not remember telling ABC or anyone that the girl was snatched from her arms.

Rodriguez told CNN she was devastated by the news.

Rodriguez says she now hopes to go to court in Missouri to get her daughter back.
