(CNN) -- Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II are to be made into saints this weekend in an unprecedented double papal canonization.
Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli, the man who would become Pope John XXIII, was the third of 13 surviving children born to a family of farmers in the tiny village of Sotto il Monte, near Bergamo, northern Italy in November 1881.
When John XXIII died in June 1963 he was mourned around the world as "Il Papa Buono" ("The Good Pope").
During the Second World War Roncalli, by then an archbishop, was serving as head of the Vatican's diplomatic mission to Turkey, and as a Vatican diplomat in Greece.
Strictly speaking, he wasn't the first Pope John XXIII
Today, Pope Gregory XII is considered the only true pontiff from that period: Benedict XIII, John XXIII and his predecessor Alexander V are all regarded as "Antipopes," which is why Roncalli became John XXIII, and not John XXIV when he was elected pope.

Unlike other saints, Pope John XXIII only performed one miracle
However, John XXIII has only been credited with one miracle.
Indeed, some would say that his canonization is already long overdue.
