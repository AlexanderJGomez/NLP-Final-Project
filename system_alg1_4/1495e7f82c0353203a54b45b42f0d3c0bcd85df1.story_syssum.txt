Protesters pushed their way past police in rowdy scenes as elite members of Hong Kong's Election Committee decided the city-state's next chief executive.
While most of the mudslinging during the campaign was aimed at Tang, Leung ran into his own trouble.
On returning to Hong Kong in the late 1970s, Leung worked for real estate consulting firm Jones Lang Wootton, before becoming the youngest partner in the firm's 200-year history, the website says.
He later opened his own firm, CY Leung & Co. and became involved in Hong Kong's administration through his election to the Executive Committee of the Basic Law Consultative Committee.
Leung replaces outgoing Chief Executive Donald Tsang.
