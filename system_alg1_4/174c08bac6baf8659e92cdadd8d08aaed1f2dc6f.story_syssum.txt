But his luck was about to run out in the chaos of Mogadishu, where the frontlines in the battle between the weak transitional government and al Qaeda affiliate al-Shabaab shift almost weekly.
Mohammed was killed, but to begin with the Somali security forces had no idea who he was.
The other man in the vehicle may also have been a senior al-Shabaab figure by the name of Musa Dheere, according to Kenyan officials.
The forged passport found in the vehicle had a recent exit stamp from South Africa, according to Somali officials.
Several of the foreign jihadists have come from the United States, with at least two (one from Minneapolis and one from Seattle) carrying out suicide bombings.
Ugandan officials suspect Mohammed -- who was probably in his late 30s -- advised on the bombings of two bars in Kampala last year, in which 79 people were killed.
Al-Shabaab attacked Uganda because it had troops in Mogadishu as part of the African force (AMISOM) protecting the transitional government.
And a recent offensive by Somali troops backed by AMISOM firepower has pushed al-Shabaab out of several districts of the capital -- for now.
And the transitional government is invariably preoccupied with clan-driven power struggles rather than taking on al-Shabaab.
But al-Shabaab is well-entrenched in central and southern Somalia, where a few dollars are enough to recruit young men with no hope of a job.
And al-Shabaab does not seem to have been knocked off its stride by Mohammed's death.
