Paris (CNN) -- Investigators trying to determine why an Air France plane crashed mysteriously two years ago have recovered the complete contents of the flight data recorder and the last two hours of cockpit conversation, they announced Monday.
They were brought to the surface and taken to Paris by ship and plane.
They will not bring more bodies up from the ocean if they cannot identify the two they already have, they said Thursday.
The pilots of Air France 447 lost contact with air traffic controllers on June 1, 2009, while flying across an area of the Atlantic known for severe turbulence, officials said.
The fuselage was discovered in April with bodies still inside, investigators said.
