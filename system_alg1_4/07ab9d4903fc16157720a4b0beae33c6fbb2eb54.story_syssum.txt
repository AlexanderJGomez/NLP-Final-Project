"The 1% is doing fine.
We now have a war of words launched at the 1% by the 1% -- or in the case of Mitt Romney, the .01%.
More than 60% of voters support policies addressing income inequality.
Over the last 10 years, American families have become poorer with the median household income dropping by 7%.
A recent study found the income of the top 1% of Americans almost tripled from 1979 to 2007, increasing by 275%.
As Reich notes, the top 1% -- no matter how wealthy they become -- cannot alone fuel our consumer-driven economy.
If we continue down this path of greater income inequality, I fear the unthinkable could occur: the death of the American dream.
The American dream has also inspired millions to immigrate to this nation.
But America offered them a place to dream.
"
History has shown that policies to promote greater income equality are good for all Americans both economically and because they preserve the American dream that the rich, the poor -- and everyone in between -- can not only dream but can also achieve a better life for themselves and their family.
