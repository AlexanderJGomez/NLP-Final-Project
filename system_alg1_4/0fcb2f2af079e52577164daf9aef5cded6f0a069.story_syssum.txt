(CNN) -- The world-famous Hubble Space Telescope is owned by the U.S. government and operated cooperatively by NASA and an institute under contract to NASA.
If Hubble encounters a problem or a glitch, as happens occasionally, science operations will be suspended and the spacecraft will be locked into safe mode until government employees can issue spacecraft commands to restore operations.
Each year thousands of astronomers from around the world compete to decide where Hubble will point -- toward particular stars or planets or galaxies or gravitational lenses.
That means each week the government is shut down could cost dozens to hundreds of critical astronomical observations.
As long as the government remains shut down, the testing will have to wait.
To check on the number of satellites that might be affected by the shutdown, this author tried to access a NASA website, only to see the following message: "Due to the lapse in federal government funding, this website is not available.
This prompted further searching.
Their flagship mission, the Mars Science Laboratory and its Curiosity Rover, is apparently still active, operated by team members who work for JPL or Caltech or other participating institutions other than the federal government.
The government shutdown means they are forbidden to do any work.
For the past few weeks, we've had intensive discussions with colleagues around the world about the science this telescope will be able to do.
You are welcome to continue to e-mail me, but I might not be able to respond until the federal government opens for business."
