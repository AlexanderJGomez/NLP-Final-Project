"These malicious allegations are totally without foundation," Brown's official spokesman said in a statement Saturday.
"It is categorically not the case that the Cabinet secretary asked for an investigation of the (prime minister's) treatment of Number 10 staff," his office said in a statement.
Before the publication of the excerpts from the book, there were rumors it would allege that Brown had hit staffers, which he denied Saturday.
One of the top strategists in Brown's Labour Party, Peter Mandelson, declined to deny that Brown had a temper, but painted his personality as a virtue.
He's demanding of himself, he's demanding of people around him," Mandelson said on the BBC's "Andrew Marr Show" on Sunday.
"He's a very good, colorful writer, but that's it," Mandelson said.
