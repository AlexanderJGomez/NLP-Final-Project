But a state investigation into the claims -- which date back to the 1950s and 1960s -- found insufficient evidence to prosecute any former workers at the Dozier School for Boys in Marianna, Florida.
The FDLE investigated allegations made by a group of men who said they were beaten and sexually abused when they attended the school about five decades ago.
The claims provided here are an example," he said.
Colon said he was sent to the school for stealing cars, and went to the "white house" 11 times during his 30 months there, where he suffered unimaginable beatings.
The FDLE said its investigators interviewed six former staff members from Dozier and more than 100 former students and their relatives.
"There was little to no evidence of visible residual scarring," the report said.
Crist also asked the agency to look into 32 unidentified graves on the school grounds.
Some of the accusers said the graves -- marked only by white steel crosses, rusted with the passage of time -- contained the bodies of boys who were beaten to death by school workers.
He wanted to save the boy, Colon said, and tried to talk himself into being brave.
Do it!
But the FDLE report said there were inconsistencies in the story and a lack of evidence.
Colon said angrily.
Tidwell refused to cooperate with the FDLE investigation, the agency's report said, because his cooperation could result in a criminal prosecution.
He said the boys at the school who misbehaved were "spanked."
Colon says the FDLE's report about what happened at the school is wrong, and he wants to do his own investigation.
