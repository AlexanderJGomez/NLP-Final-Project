(CNN) -- One of the most enduring mysteries of the 20th century has been put to rest: DNA analysis of bone fragments has proven that two of Czar Nicholas' children believed to have escaped were killed with their royal family during the Russian Revolution.
Researchers wanted to confirm their findings by comparing DNA from the remains with that of living Romanov relatives.
At the time, many thought that Alexei and Maria might have escaped -- leading to hopes among royal supporters that one or both Romanovs were still alive.
But clues left by one of the family's assassins led investigators to the grave where the remains of Alexei and Maria were unearthed in 2007.
DNA tests showed she was not related to the Romanov family.
