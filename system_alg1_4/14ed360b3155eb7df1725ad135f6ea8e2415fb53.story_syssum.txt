Readers have his latest book to digest.
The idea that "The Labyrinth of Osiris" could be his last book is all the more poignant, because reviewers and editors alike say it's his best -- even Sussman agreed.
But after Sussman's most recent book was complete, his editor says he changed his tune.
Taylor remembers Sussman riding around London on his motor scooter, with a publicist in tow, on his way to interviews to support his books.
"In some ironic way, it (his death) got a little bit more attention for the book in the UK," says Morgan Entrekin, president of Grove/Atlantic, Sussman's U.S. publisher, "as people wrote about the tragedy of his death and the fact that this was going to be his last book."
She says she yearns to talk to him each time she finds one of the inside jokes he scatters throughout "The Labyrinth of Osiris."
Sussman also wove his wife into all of his stories.
"I think one of the really, really difficult things about losing someone is the conversation ending," Alicky says.
"All of those things that you would normally talk about," she says.
His agent says she has a manuscript Sussman wrote more than 10 years ago.
It's the story of a 100-year-old man who decides to kill himself, because he thinks he's lived long enough.
"It's an absolutely hilarious book," says Laura Susijn, his longtime agent and friend.
His literary team also worries that introducing a new work too soon after his latest crime thriller's release could distract readers from the marketing campaign around his existing books.
As they mull over sharing his unpublished work with the world, his colleagues and friends find that Sussman lives on through his books.
"For me, he's very much alive," Susijn says.
She says she would also be keen to publish her husband's early manuscript -- in time.
"That's basically his legacy," Susijn says.
