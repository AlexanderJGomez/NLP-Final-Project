We will be vigilant and we will be relentless," the President said in televised remarks.
ISIS is believed to be holding a number of Americans, including Sotloff, a U.S. official told CNN.
Calling ISIS a "cancer," Obama said across the Middle East there has to be a common effort to put an end to the group.
As the President spoke, the Pentagon confirmed the United States carried out 14 airstrikes against mobile ISIS targets in the vicinity of the Mosul Dam, which Kurdish forces recaptured from the terror group with the support of American airpower.
A plane carrying the first load of humanitarian aid as part of a multiday operation to help hundreds of thousands of displaced people in northern Iraq has landed in Irbil, the U.N. refugee agency said.
The first Boeing 747 to land carried 100 tons of aid, he said.
On Tuesday, U.S. airstrikes helped Kurdish and Iraqi forces take control of the key Mosul Dam, fighting back the militants who had seized it.
Now that the dam is cleared of ISIS militants, Iraqi forces are moving to grow their area of control, the Defense Department said.
The official would not say where the troops would go, but there are two publicly known locations for American personnel working in Baghdad -- the U.S. Embassy and Baghdad International Airport.
