(CNN) -- Notes left behind by film director Tony Scott did not provide a motive for why he may have taken a suicidal plunge Sunday, a Los Angeles County coroner's spokesman said Friday.
Scott, 68, wrote two notes before his death, including a message left in his Los Angeles office that was apparently for family members, a coroner official said this week.
It will be weeks before the findings of a Monday autopsy are made public, the coroner's office said Tuesday.
"I did talk to the family ... and according to his wife, he did not have brain cancer as reported, and (she) does not know who told ABC that information, which is absolutely false," Winter said.
Tony Scott became a household name in 1986 as director of the mega-hit "Top Gun," starring Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis.
"Tony was my dear friend and I will really miss him.
Murphy described Scott as a "wonderful collaborator" and said he will be missed.
"He put Denzel Washington, Will Smith and Tom Cruise in movies where one man overcomes all struggles, triumphs over struggles, and yet it appears he was not able to write that story for himself," he said.
Scott cemented his reputation for big-budget action films with 1990's "Revenge" starring Kevin Costner and "Days of Thunder" with Cruise.
Reaction to Scott's death poured out Monday, with directors, actors and fans mourning the news.
"Tony Scott as a friend and a mentor was irreplaceable.
RIP," director and producer Joe Carnahan said on Twitter.
"Tony always sent personal, handwritten notes & always drew a cartoon caricature of himself, smoking a cigar, with his hat colored in red," Carnahan said in a post.
The ball cap, Wolf said, was his trademark.
"So very, very sorry to hear of the death of Tony Scott," actress Martha Plimpton, who appeared in "The Good Wife," said via Twitter.
