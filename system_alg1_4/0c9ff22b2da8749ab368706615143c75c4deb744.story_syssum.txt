(CNN) -- Police are investigating reports that Zahra Baker, the 10-year-old disabled girl who was killed in North Carolina, may have been raped prior to her death, according to police search warrants that were unsealed Tuesday.
The tipster also told police that Zahra had been raped by both men and that she had blood on her private area and legs, the search warrant said.
In one search warrant, dated October 27, police say they were looking for "latex gloves used while the body of Zahra Baker was dismembered."
Elisa Baker has been arrested on an obstruction charge after police said she admitted to writing a fake ransom note found at the family's home in Hickory.
Police have said she has been cooperating with investigators, including going with them to a search site.
