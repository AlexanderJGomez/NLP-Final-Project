The London Fire Brigade's Kingsland Station Manager Nick Harding said about 720 people were inside when a section of the ceiling collapsed on the theatergoers, taking parts of the balconies with it.
"You initially thought it was part of the play and then you could feel things on you," said an older woman.
Within an hour, a spokesman for the fire department said everyone, including those who had been hurt, had been evacuated from the building.
The Apollo is located next to Piccadilly Circus in the Soho district, which is usually packed with tourists, shoppers and diners at theater time.
The initial police assessment of the collapse was that it was an accident.
Outside the Apollo, the street was packed with dozens of police, fire and ambulance vehicles as well as well-dressed theatergoers, some of their faces darkened with dust.
It was not immediately clear whether the ceiling was part of the restoration of the building, which is owned and operated by Nimax Theatres.
