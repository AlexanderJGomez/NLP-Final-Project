(CNN) -- A smoky fire broke out aboard an empty Japan Airlines 787 Dreamliner in Boston on Monday in the latest glitch for the much-heralded Boeing model.
Batteries used to start the auxiliary power unit, which provides electricity for ground operations, are located in the small area in the belly of the plane.
Everyone had disembarked when the fire was discovered, the airline said.
Monday's incident is not the first mechanical problem for the 787 series, which was delivered to airlines starting in 2011 after years of manufacturing delays and cost overruns.
In 2010, fire caused a 787 test flight to lose primary electrical power while flying from Yuma, Arizona, to Laredo, Texas.
"The 787, being a new airplane, does have teething problems," John Goglia, a former member of the National Transportation Safety Board, told CNN.
Boeing said it was investigating the incident and noted it was too early to draw any parallels.
"It's one of our 'most wanted list' issues, fire in transportation," Eric Weiss, a board spokesman, said.
