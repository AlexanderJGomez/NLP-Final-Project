Gwenyth Jackaway started to wonder if Donor-X passed on a genetic component to her son, Dylan, who is autistic.
So she contacted California Cryobank, one of the largest sperm donor banks in the country.
What she couldn't know then is that her son would have autism.
Most experts believe that genetics are a component, making a child predisposed to autism or responsive to an environmental trigger.
"We wouldn't be able to screen a donor for autism because we don't yet know the specific genes that are contributing to autism," Dawson said.
"When you're handed a diagnosis of some sort of developmental disorder, you have to let go of the child you thought you were going to have," Jackaway said.
Jackaway says she had to accept that "I don't have that child I thought I was going to have.
Two years ago, she visited Theresa Pergola in the New York area; she had given birth to triplets using sperm from Donor X.
There seemed to be eye contact issues," recalled Jackaway, who immediately suggested screening Joseph for autism.
She says Jackaway reassured her that wouldn't be the case.
In six families Jackaway contacted that had used Donor X, three of the children are autistic, and one is showing signs of autism.
Our children don't have autism; they are autistic.
There is currently no way to screen for autism, and in a statement, the company said in part:
"... per CCB policy, the donor's samples were removed from the general catalog.
In fact, Theresa Pergola says she's still uncertain about an autism screening process, if and when it ever becomes available.
