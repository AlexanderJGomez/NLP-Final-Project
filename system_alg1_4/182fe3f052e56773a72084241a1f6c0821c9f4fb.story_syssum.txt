Earlier Friday, the country's tourism minister said on Al Hayat Egyptian TV that authorities had located the kidnappers and were negotiating with them.
A group of armed Bedouins had blocked the road on which they were traveling.
The hostages were released after a day, the news agency said, after Egyptian authorities intervened.
Hours after he survived the deadly incident, Eid said he learned of the kidnapping of his two child cousins.
He declined to explain how the children were returned to their parents.
