Dr. Mitra Roses of the Pan American Health Organization said some hospitals were performing between 30 and 100 amputations a day after the earthquake.
"We're having a generation of amputees," said one medical worker.
"What I fear is that if I can't walk, I can't go to school and I can't go to church," said a boy who lost his foot in the earthquake.
Amputees may have trouble getting to work, she said, and the problem is compounded if those people perform manual labor, which requires greater use of their limbs.
They also can't play with their friends or enjoy the activities they used to, and they may be too young to understand why, Stuart said.
Stuart said.
Even before the earthquake, he said, "we were only really touching the need at the time."
There were about 800,000 Haitians with handicaps and disabilities before the earthquake, Doubt said.
Used prosthetics will be particularly beneficial in Haiti, where manufacturing artificial limbs is likely to be difficult, said Heather Mills, a U.N. Association goodwill ambassador.
"What I'm trying to do is appeal to people to ... contact Physicians for Peace and take back any limbs that they're not using," Mills told CNN's "Larry King Live."
"I'm fully aware that they're not going to need the limbs for weeks, but it takes weeks to coordinate," Mills said.
Handicap International is also expanding its staff to around 100, and they will train local prosthetic technicians to meet the needs of amputees in the long term, Stuart said.
"Prosthetics need to be fitted -- they're not off the shelf -- so you need technicians there," Stuart said.
