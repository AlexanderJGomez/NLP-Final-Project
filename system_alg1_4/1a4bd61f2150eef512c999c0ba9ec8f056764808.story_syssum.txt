The 397-meter long vessel was running on a low-sulfur fuel while in port, something its owners say reduces toxic sulfur dioxide emissions by 85%.
"The bigger the ship the lower the fuel consumption, that's one thing," said Thomas Riber Knudsen, Asia Pacific CEO of shipping line Maersk.
Our biggest financial cost is fuel consumption; (cutting it) happens to be very good for the environment so probably there is shared interest there."
So far the most toxic of pollutants from ships, like sulfur dioxide, have been the main focus of the IMO program and also other regional regulations.
Its Green Shipping Initiative offer incentives such as reduced port fees for ships in return for using low-sulfur fuel.
Some believe that retrofitting ships with equipment like "scrubbers" that remove harmful emissions from vessels could help the industry to clean up its act.
"I would say a good 95% of (shipping industry green initiatives) is incentivized or is driven by international regulations," he said.
"I don't expect fuel prices to go down but if they did and still the industry as a whole had become a lot more efficient, I think that efficiency will stay with us," he said.
