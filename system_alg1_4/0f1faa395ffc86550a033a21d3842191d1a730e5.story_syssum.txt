Perhaps they took a wrong turn; perhaps there was foul play.
A car that appears to be theirs was spotted in a creek just half a mile from the girls' intended destination near Beresford, South Dakota, reported CNN affiliate KTIV-TV in Sioux City, Iowa.
His funeral was Saturday.
Removing the car from the creek could take days, KSFY said.
Last week, authorities found two cars, with human remains inside, at the bottom of an Oklahoma lake.
Investigators said one car may have belonged to a teenager who disappeared with two friends in 1970.
