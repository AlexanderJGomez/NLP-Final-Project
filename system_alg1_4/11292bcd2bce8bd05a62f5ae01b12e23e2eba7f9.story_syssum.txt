By 1990, I had seen over 500 patients die from a disease that we just couldn't treat.
HIV/AIDS treatment was then, and remains today, a true game-changer in saving lives.
At that time, 85% of the burden of disease was in sub-Saharan Africa and less than 5% of the treatment capability was there.
With the world's largest number of people living with HIV and AIDS (5.6 million), South Africa has always been on the front lines of the epidemic.
The South African government, with support from the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis (TB) and Malaria, has saved hundreds of thousands of South African lives.
As South Africa's battle against AIDS has evolved, so has PEPFAR's support.
As U.S. funding shifts increasingly to HIV prevention, health systems strengthening and technical support -- South Africa is expanding its own investments in the care and treatment of HIV and TB.
Thanks to the dedication of President George W. Bush, President Obama and bipartisan support from the U.S. Congress -- what a difference a decade has made.
