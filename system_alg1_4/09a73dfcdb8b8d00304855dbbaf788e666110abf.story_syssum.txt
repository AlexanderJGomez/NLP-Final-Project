(CNN) -- While the eyes of golfing world were on rising star Rory McIlroy on Thursday, two surprise names claimed the first-round lead at the British Open.
The Dane, 11 times a winner on the European Tour, has made the halfway cut just twice since his father passed away in May following a long illness, but at the windswept English links course he rediscovered the form that earned him two winning Ryder Cup appearances.
I have been finding golf extremely difficult but I did a lot of work with (coach) Pete (Cowen) yesterday and some things just started to make a bit of sense.
His father Brian, a former tour professional, named him after five-time British Open champion Tom Watson -- who was one of the Englishman's playing partners, with the 61-year-old American ending the day equal 71st after a 72.
"It was really great out there today," Lewis told reporters.
Glover, who won the 2009 U.S. Open, finished with three successive birdies while Simpson -- still seeking his first professional title -- picked up shots at the last two.
McIlroy, playing for the first time since winning his breakthrough major at the U.S. Open three weeks ago, battled back from a bad start to card a one-over 71 for a share of 51st.
"On a day like this you can shoot a high number and put yourself out of the golf tournament, so it was nice to go out and shoot a decent score.
Donald, who like Westwood has never won a major, is one of the favorites following his victory at last weekend's weather-shortened Scottish Open.
