Martelly's dreams of leading Haiti were all but dead.
It's an image that Martelly said he cultivated solely for the stage.
Martelly, they said, was a fresh face in politics, untainted by the corruption that has marred many a presidency in Haiti.
"To Haitians, particularly the legions of young and jobless, Martelly is an outsider who can bring change to Haiti," longtime Haiti observer Jocelyn McCalla said on Twitter.
On the streets of Port-au-Prince, thousands turned out to chant one of his most popular nicknames: "Tet Kale," which means bald head in Creole.

The people know him, he said.
"People are fed up here," he said.
Martelly exuded confidence that he could bring change to Haiti.

Irwin Stotzky, a University of Miami lawyer who has studied human rights in Haiti, said Martelly hardly had the credentials to run the country and did not see much hope for the immediate future.
"Well," he said.
