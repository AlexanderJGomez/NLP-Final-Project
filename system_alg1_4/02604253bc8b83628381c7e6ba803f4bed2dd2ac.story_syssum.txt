(CNN) -- Millions of people are expected to go to Washington to celebrate Barack Obama's inauguration on January 20, but with a troubled economy and pocketbook issues on the mind, the president-elect must be careful to set the right tone.
"A lot of it is about tone and making sure that the celebrations that do take place are not over the top, that they don't appear to be insensitive to the pain people have right now," said Ryan Alexander, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense.
Watchdog groups say there are some things Obama can do to take control of the tone.
When Franklin D. Roosevelt took office, he also faced a financial crisis.
As inauguration organizers work to keep the tone in check, they are speaking out against those trying to make money by scalping tickets to the event.
Organizers of the inauguration say it violates the spirit of the event and could spell disappointment for people who buy tickets for the ceremony.
We understand some people want to make a buck, but for those people thinking of buying tickets, it's buyer beware," warned Howard Gantman, staff director of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies.
