Kang, who was vice principal at Ansan's Danwon High School, was rescued from the sinking Sewol ferry.
There were no pallbearers carrying the coffin -- only a quick walking procession of his family members and what appeared to be about a hundred others dressed in black following the car through the parking lot.
His family members -- one son, two daughters and his wife dressed in all-black traditional Korean wear followed the hearse.
"As the one in charge of the safety of the students, he was suffering from guilty feelings," another teacher had told Korean media.
Police have confirmed the contents of a note, which Kang left behind.
He said he could not live not knowing where his students are.
During this period, several students from the high school came to the funeral home to pay their respects to Kang's family.
Outside the funeral hall, some of them spoke about Kang.
"The vice principal really liked students," she said.
I don't think anyone should be blaming him."
"We are so sorry..." tweeted Kim Min Hyuk, a senior at the high school, who tweeted the name of the vice principal along with the names of other dead teachers from the ferry tragedy.
The hearse carrying his coffin traveled a few miles east and pulled into Danwon High School, circling the campus for one last time -- signifying Kang's last visit to his school.
