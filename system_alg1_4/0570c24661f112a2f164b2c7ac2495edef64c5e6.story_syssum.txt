I wasn't sure what to expect, but I did not want that experience to influence how I approached the country and its people.
When I was assigned to Rwanda 18 years later, my first thought was the genocide -- this is probably true for most people.
But when I asked friends and colleagues who had lived there for advice, they spoke highly of the country and her people.
The beauty is reflected in the people: Rwandans are incredibly friendly and hospitable.
For anyone who has spent time in Africa, it's incredible to see people actually wearing helmets on motorcycles, drivers and passengers alike, both in Kigali and in the countryside.
During the last Saturday of each month, citizens do some type of community work in their neighborhood, like picking up garbage or cutting the grass.
Four months after my arrival, I was ready to see the Kigali Genocide Memorial.
You almost weep when you realize they will never identify them all.
One room tells the tale of other genocides or "cleansing" events in history around the world, reminding us that the international community has not been diligent about the oft-quoted pledge, "Never again."
But I know from what I had seen, and from my organization's work, that it is possible.
Could I ever confess and ask for forgiveness?
Looking at Rwandans today with a certainty that such an atrocity can never happen again, you wonder "How did this ever happen in the first place?"
The lessons from Rwanda still echoing in my head, I was compelled to say "yes" to a country being torn apart by intercommunal fighting, just as Rwanda had been.
My time in Rwanda has shown me the limitations of what the international community will do in situations like this, but also taught me lessons and given me hope.
And we can, with a little influence and a lot of political will.
