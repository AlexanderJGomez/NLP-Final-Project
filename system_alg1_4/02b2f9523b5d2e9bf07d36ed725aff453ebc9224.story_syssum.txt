In "a recommendation for dismissal" filed in court Monday, two prosecutors in the Manhattan district attorney's office laid out their arguments for requesting that numerous charges -- including attempted rape and sexual assault -- be dismissed, citing fresh evidence and questions about the accuser's credibility.
In the document, the district attorney's office notes that DNA testing indicated semen on her dress matched Strauss-Kahn and shows there was a sexual encounter.
Kenneth Thompson, who represents Diallo, addressed reporters after meeting with prosecutors Monday afternoon for less than half an hour.
"Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance has denied the right of a woman to get justice in a rape case," Thompson said.
Thompson had said before the meeting Monday that he believed Vance was going to drop the charges.
Diallo, who has conducted high-profile interviews about the case, and her attorneys have said Strauss-Kahn attacked her, and that her case should go to trial.
And in a rally after the district attorney's court filing Monday, some of her supporters urged prosecutors to still pursue the case and warned about the message sent by dropping charges.
That prompted the alleged victim's motion filed Monday, which cites allegations of "abuse of confidence, unfair treatment and bias and prejudices" by Vance that, Diallo's attorneys claim, should disqualify him from the case.
"This is not a 'he said, she said' case," Thompson said Sunday.
"If you go back to the hearing on May 16, when (an assistant district attorney) called the evidence against Strauss-Kahn 'substantial' and he said the medical exam (of Diallo) supports her account, this is not a 'he said, she said' case.
But he said that no one involved in the case "comes out of it looking very good."
"This is a case that looks like it has nothing but losers -- the alleged victim, the defendant, and the prosecutor," Toobin said.
