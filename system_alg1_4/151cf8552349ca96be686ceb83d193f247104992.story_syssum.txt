New York (CNN) -- The father of a 4-year-old boy tortured and beaten to death in New York will be freed from jail to attend his son's funeral, authorities said Thursday.
"I'm letting you out to go give your son a proper burial," New Jersey Superior Court Judge Michael A. Donio said Thursday.
A memorial service for Myls will be held Tuesday night at First Corinthian Baptist Church in Harlem.
"The father's family -- Myls' grandmother and grandfather -- have been participating in preparations and will be flying the baby's body for burial in a family plot in his native South Carolina," said the adviser, Tony Herbert.
Kryzie King, 27, was indicted in connection with the boy's death in Manhattan criminal court Wednesday.
In a statement last week, King's attorney, Bryan Konoski, said: "My client is not charged with homicide at this time and she is presumed to be innocent of allegations against her.
Also on Wednesday, Myls' body was claimed from the morgue in New York.
King told police that Myls' father dropped the child off for her to watch December 17 and that she was the "child's primary and sole caretaker" until the time of his death, the complaint said.
"And god forbid when they happen, it is our job to learn from them and try to every time do better so we can reach more children."
