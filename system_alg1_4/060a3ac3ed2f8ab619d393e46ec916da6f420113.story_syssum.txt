Debbie Rowe said she married Michael Jackson to avoid the taboo of having childrien out of wedlock.
A close friend of Rowe said she has been grieving Jackson's death -- grief made more painful by paparazzi hounding her and media reports vilifying Rowe by depicting her as a heartless woman who would trade her kids for cash.
"Debbie's a very caring, wonderful, warm person," said Marc Schaffel, who met first met Rowe when he worked for Jackson.
"He was upset because he really wanted to be a dad," Rowe said.
That is when I looked at him and said.
Please let me do this.
The couple divorced in 1999 with Rowe giving Jackson full custody while she got a $8.5 million settlement, according to court documents.
Rowe gave up parental rights to Jackson in 2001, but she changed her mind more than two years later and sought temporary custody of the children.
She said the children don't call her "mom" because she did not want them to.
"She spends time with all of her horses and her dogs," Schaffel said.
"Debbie doesn't run out to all of the social events," he said.
Debbie is just as happy at home in her very modest, humble, horse ranch."
"She doesn't react well with the paparazzi," he said.
"Ms. Rowe has not accepted -- and will not accept -- any additional financial consideration beyond the spousal support she and Michael Jackson personally agreed to several years ago," Eric George said in the letter.
Rowe also filed a lawsuit this week against a woman who claimed in a TV interview to have e-mails from Rowe saying she didn't really want to raise the children.
