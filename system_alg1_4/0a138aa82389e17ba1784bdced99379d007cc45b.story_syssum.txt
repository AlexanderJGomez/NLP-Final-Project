Rick Perry's decision to send up to 1,000 National Guard troops to the southern border is the latest move in a controversy over the influx of migrant youths from Central America, many unaccompanied, streaming into the United States.
The National Guard will be a "force multiplier" to aid state law enforcement to reduce crime from cartels, traffickers and criminals crossing the border, Perry said.
If unaccompanied children approach the troops, however, Texas Adjutant General John Nichols, who is head of the Texas National Guard, said they will "get on the phone" to a border station so that the children will receive water and medical care.
So what will the border patrol do?
What won't they do?
How much will it cost and who will pay for it?
The former head of the National Guard and a former commissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection bureau have said Perry's plan is limited in scope.
When will this take place and for how long?
Perry is asking the federal government to hire and train an additional 3,000 border patrol agents to replace the National Guard.
Perry has some reconciling to do within a Republican Party that has used the current border crisis to move to the right on the issue.
Has the National Guard been sent to the border before?
What is the situation on the border?
At the same time, resources for border security have steadily increased: More than 18,000 agents patrolled the border in 2013 compared to 10,000 a decade ago.
