(CNN) -- Qatar's government says it's investigating complaints that sprinklers and alarms weren't working during a fire at an upscale Doha shopping mall that killed 19 people, most of them children in a nursery.
Elementary school-age children were eating at some of the restaurants and no one was trying to escape, she said.
She said she left when the smoke became "too much."
Qatar's interior minister, Sheikh Abdullah Bin Nasser Bin Khalifa Al Thani, said the civil defense office reviews safety standards for commercial buildings before they grant a license.
Along with the children and teachers, two would-be rescuers died in the blaze, Interior Minister Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa Al Thani said in a statement posted on the ministry's Facebook page.
"Obviously, there are some very serious questions that will need to be answered," said Key, who did not identify the children or their parents.
Al Thani said everyone was believed to have been accounted for late Monday.
