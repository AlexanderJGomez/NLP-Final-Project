Opposite the Burlington Arcade, right at the heart of the art establishment, on gallery row itself, African art formerly seen as a niche interest, now officially playing with the big boys.
It would appear that women are at the vanguard of raising the profile of contemporary African art.
Yet the message of these women is not a gendered manifesto but a simple statement of fact: contemporary African art exists.
Art was what our ancestors did.
Yet African art is alive.
The art coming from Africa today is as varied, vibrant, exhilarating and bewildering as contemporary art from anywhere in the world.
This unfolding success story of contemporary African art comes at a good time for the continent.
To the female curators at the forefront of the movement, I salute you.
