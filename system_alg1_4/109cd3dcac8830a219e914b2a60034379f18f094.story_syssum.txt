(CNN)  -- Darren Tuck, the man who gave police a tape depicting the rape of a 3-year-old girl, turned himself in Sunday to Nye County, Nevada, authorities.
Police said he had the tape for at least five months before turning it in.
The four-year-old videotape shows the 3-year-old girl being raped in Las Vegas, Nevada.
"The mother has cooperated with us," De Meo said.
A  resident of Pahrump, Nevada, he remains at-large, De Meo said.
Stiles was a distant friend of the girl's family, De Meo said.
"She's what you'd expect a little girl in elementary school to be like," he said.
Allen said he never witnessed Stiles physically assault anyone.
De Meo addressed Stiles directly on Saturday: "Turn yourself in to your local law enforcement agency," he said.
The FBI is also seeking Stiles on state charges of sexual assault and lewdness with a minor under the age of 14 in a separate matter, De Meo said.
