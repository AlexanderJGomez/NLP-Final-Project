"I definitely felt a little sluggish today, but it was fine, and it was good to get that win," Williams told reporters after winning against the 19-year-old wildcard entrant to register her 25th victory in 26 matches.
To think someone would still want to be like me is kind of awesome," the 30-year-old Williams said.
"It was a great experience -- it was really good to match up against that level and see what's out there," said Gibbs, who was appearing in the main draw of a WTA Tour event for the first time.
Williams was full of praise for her opponent too, adding, "I think she played really well -- she moves really well and she doesn't quit, and I think that's the best quality you can have as an athlete, and especially as a tennis player.
"Serena will definitely be a challenge, but I'm ready to go out and just enjoy it," said Scheepers, who lost to Williams in straight sets in their only previous meeting.
