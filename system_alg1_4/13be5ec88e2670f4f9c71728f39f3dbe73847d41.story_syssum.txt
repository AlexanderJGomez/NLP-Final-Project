The university opted to halt all social and new-member activities on the South Carolina campus after the death of a student and a "high number" of reported incidents involving fraternities.
"It is especially prudent to suspend fraternity activities given the tragic death of Tucker Hipps," she said.
An autopsy revealed the teen likely fell, according to CNN affiliate WHNS.
Tanner Parsons, a freshman at Clemson, says he met Hipps briefly at a fraternity pledge event this year.
Hundreds of students came together Tuesday night to remember Hipps at a candlelight vigil on Bowman Field at Clemson, according to CNN affiliate WLTX.
