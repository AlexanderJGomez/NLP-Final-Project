Yet another one of the names floated to replace outgoing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has removed themselves from consideration for the role.
Flournoy is the third big name to remove themselves from the consideration process, after the President announced Hagel's resignation on Monday.
But an aide to Levin tells CNN that the retiring Armed Services Committee chairman has not been approached by the White House yet and he is not interested in the job.
But a source familiar with the search process tells CNN that neither are being considered.
The development that Flournoy had removed herself from consideration took several officials by surprise.
