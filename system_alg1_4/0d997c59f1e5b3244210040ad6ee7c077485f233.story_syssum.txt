Cooper.
A retired law enforcement officer brought a tip to the FBI about a year ago, said Fred Gutt, a spokesman for the FBI's Seattle Field Office.
The FBI's lab started looking for evidence that might prove the dead person was the man who skyjacked Flight 305.
Gutt said the FBI knows Cooper had handled certain papers, including his plane ticket, and touched plane seats, but many fingerprints were found on those items.
Cooper.
"Cooper was a quiet man who appeared to be in his mid-forties, wearing a business suit with a black tie and white shirt," the FBI said in a summary of the case on its website.
When the flight landed in Seattle, the hijacker exchanged the flight's 36 passengers for the money and parachutes, the FBI said, keeping several crew members on board.
"The pilots landed safely, but Cooper had disappeared into the night and his ultimate fate remains a mystery to this day," the FBI said.
"We've run down thousands of leads and considered all sorts of scenarios," the FBI said in 2007.
Absolutely."
"We originally thought Cooper was an experienced jumper, perhaps even a paratrooper," said Special Agent Larry Carr in 2007.
Agents also believe Cooper had no help on the ground.
"But Cooper simply said, 'Fly to Mexico,' and he had no idea where he was when he jumped," authorities said.
Carr said in 2007 he believed it was unlikely Cooper survived the jump.
Duane Weber, who claimed on his deathbed to be Cooper, was eliminated by DNA testing, the FBI said.
Even so, Gutt said the FBI always follows up on any new tips on the case.
