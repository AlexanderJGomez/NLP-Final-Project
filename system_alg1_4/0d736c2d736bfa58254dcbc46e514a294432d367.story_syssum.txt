(CNN) -- Getafe became the third Spanish football club to pass into foreign ownership on Thursday after signing a deal with Dubai's Royal Emirates Group.
The group said it was heavily involved in sports in the United Arab Emirates and abroad.
"Royal Emirates Group plans to invest heavily in inducting new blood and promoting the team in the region," he said.
Since replacing coach Miguel Angel Portugal with the club's former boss Marcelino, the Cantabria-based team is four points above 17th-placed Malaga.
