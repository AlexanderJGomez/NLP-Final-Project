(CNN) -- In brief remarks to the media just after returning to her hometown of Seattle, an emotional Amanda Knox thanked those who believed in her and supported her fight to overturn her murder conviction in Italy.
Being with her family, she said, is "the most important thing to me right now."
Knox's mother and stepfather, Edda and Curt Mellas, also thanked those who have supported their family, as well as the Italian attorneys who fought on her behalf.
Knox supporters in Seattle said they planned a rousing welcome.
"You have well deserved, and will well deserve, all the joy and warmth and fun of your normal life returned to you."
Asked what she'll say when she sees Knox, Ralph told KOMO, "I won't say anything.
Whitney said she "cried with joy" when Knox's conviction was overturned.
Welcome home!"
Jordan Adams said he thought Knox was guilty, but he was willing to accept the decision to overturn the conviction.
But later, another resident walked up to a CNN crew to say that she could not "care less about Knox returning home" and that she believed Knox committed the crime.
