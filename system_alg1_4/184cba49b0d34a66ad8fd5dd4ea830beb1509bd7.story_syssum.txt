"It's very, very important to keep that place open, giving good services" to the people of Juarez, De La Vega says.
But her journey from El Paso, Texas, to Juarez has seared some painful images into her mind.
Despite the violence, De La Vega's hospital and its staff -- which treats about 900 patients daily, regardless of their ability to pay -- have remained unharmed.
Why would they be against that?
De La Vega, who is married to a prominent businessman from Juarez, lived there for decades, but the escalating violence, murder, crime and corruption recently forced her to move to El Paso.
De La Vega says she has lost friends and neighbors in the conflict, but she insists she's not afraid -- and she's determined to help the people of Juarez continue receiving the medical care they need.
De La Vega has always been passionate about health care, volunteering with the Red Cross when she was 8 years old.
One of De La Vega's first clinics was built in the early '70s where the Hospital de la Familia sits today.
With a staff of 144 doctors and 192 nurses, Hospital de la Familia performs emergency care as well as routine and specialized surgeries for adults and children.
And De La Vega is always looking for ways to provide more services to the community.
The Hospital de la Familia is just one of the organization's many health care facilities.
For De La Vega, who frequently visits patients and is active in administrative, operational and financial aspects at the hospital, her work not only saves lives but has given meaning to her own life as well.
This is what gives me meaning to my life."
