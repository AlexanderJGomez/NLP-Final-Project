That blueprint will focus on manufacturing, energy, education and middle-class values, according to a video released on the Obama's campaign website and Democratic sources who have been briefed on the address.
The president will continue to challenge Congress over the ongoing gridlock that blocked most elements of his jobs bill and embroiled Washington in a debt fight last summer.
One Democratic official said the president will offer to work with Congress if Congress agrees to work with him.
Democratic sources told CNN on Sunday that the bullet points of Obama's blueprint will focus on American manufacturing, including "insourcing" -- or bringing back jobs from overseas.
The address will include new proposals to prepare American workers and students for the jobs of the future.
Obama will also suggest job training for the long-term unemployed and veterans, the sources said.
"We can go in two directions," Obama said.
The day after the speech, the president will begin a three-day swing to states that are expected to be battlegrounds in the upcoming election.
