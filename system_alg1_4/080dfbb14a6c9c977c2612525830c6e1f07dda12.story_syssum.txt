"She's pretty cut up," said a performer who saw the violence at the "Gathering of the Juggalos" in rural Hardin County, Illinois.
The performer said a mob of hundreds chased Tequila from the stage and surrounded the trailer where she sought refuge.
Tequila eventually escaped, but only after windows in her SUV were smashed, he said.
The witness, who was standing in the rear of the stage, said the crowd of about 2,000 was immediately angry toward Tequila and she was unable to turn them around.
The rocks and bottles flew harder and faster when Tequila bared her breasts, he said.
Tequila continued to perform even after her face started bleeding, he said.
This was not  the only violent incident at the festival early Saturday, Seiner said.
