(CNN) -- J.C. Chandor is one of Hollywood's hot new names.
He spoke to CNN about how the film came together, the challenges of building tension and his promising future.
J.C. Chandor: Attaching actors was actually not really the challenging thing with the film.
He's been characterized as the villain.
Any we'd recognize?
Chandor: I never was a very prominent commercial director, to say the least.
Amazingly, this has been sort of the cherry on the sundae.
The film was very well received for what it was, which has allowed me to direct again, and everybody made their money back, so I've been pretty blessed from that standpoint.
