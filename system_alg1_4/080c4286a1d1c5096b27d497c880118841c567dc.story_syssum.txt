Sidney Frank, shown accepting an honorary degree in 2005, gave $100 million to Brown University.
Frank -- who left Brown after one year in the late 1930s because he couldn't afford to stay -- gave the school a $100 million endowment in 2004.

As for the Brown scholarship fund, he started it because he saw that Brown had changed the course of his life, Halstead said.
"What he did is a catalyst for a lot of great things, and I'm indebted to him to do the best with the education that I've gotten here to help people in any way that I can," Reyes Castro said.
