It is.
Why is that?"
Part of that goal involves moving Zappos to holacracy -- an organizational system that throws out all job descriptions, job titles, management (as we know it), and the organization chart, and starts over.
Since Zappos' announced this move, people have wondered whether holacracy is just another fad or something to be taken seriously.
The title you have probably doesn't reflect what you do, unless you own the company.
Your manager knows nothing about what you do much of the time, and yet makes decisions that determine your success.
Holacracy was pioneered by Brian Robertson and outlined in his upcoming book, "Holacracy: Evolution for Organizations."
Circles have regular governance meetings in which people talk about roles, accountabilities, authority and policies.
To date, Zappos is by far the largest adopter of holacracy.
So, will it work at Zappos?
If this description isn't your company, then holacracy will not be a great fit.
Holacracy is not coming to a company near you, at least not in its current form.
Many don't work at all.
Holacracy may just surprise us.
