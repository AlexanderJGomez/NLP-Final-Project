Tanner was 95 and died of pneumonia, said Dick Darnall in a telephone interview.
For the next few years, Tanner stayed in Hollywood, where he did studio work, Darnall said.
Tanner was also working with the ABC Orchestra, where for 16 years he played with the likes of Leonard Bernstein, Andre Previn and Arturo Toscanini, Darnall said.
"She was accused of chopping off everybody's heads," Tanner said in an interview in 1997 that is posted on his website.
Though Tanner did not invent the device, "He enhanced on it and made it easier to play," his widow, Jeanette, said in a telephone interview.
During his teaching years, Tanner wrote a number of textbooks, and his classes proved popular, his widow said.
Tanner wound up giving his Electro-Theremin to a hospital, where it was used to measure hearing, she said.
Tanner's first wife, Alma, died in 1981 or 1982 after four decades of marriage, according to his family.
