("You can kind of shake it up and we start all over again," Romney senior adviser Eric Fehrnstrom told CNN this week.)
But the picture of two "serious" presidential candidates wandering the trail with an old-school toy as a prop can lead to only one conclusion: This is getting silly.
Sure, they're conflicted: hard-line conservatives and evangelicals will never love Romney.
But he will get there nonetheless.
Then they would take to the airwaves and offer their full-throated endorsements, turning their attention to seeking the defeat of President Obama.
One prominent tea party group says, well, I suppose we can live with Romney if that's what we have to do.
First of all, the old-time power brokers don't have much to offer anymore.
The political power within the GOP has moved away from any organized structure toward two force fields: the populist guy in the street and the rich guys who can write multimillion-dollar checks.
Party organizations can't deliver them anymore, and Romney isn't exactly the guy they were wishing for when the tea party came on the scene in 2010.
"People feel they can make this decision on their own," Oklahoma Republican Rep. Tom Cole, who hasn't yet endorsed, tells me.
At some point, the voters will get restless.
Granted, Gingrich and Santorum don't like Romney much -- and the longer they run against him, the less they like him.

Romney knew how to end it the right way in 2008.
Knowing how to lose is the hardest part of running.
