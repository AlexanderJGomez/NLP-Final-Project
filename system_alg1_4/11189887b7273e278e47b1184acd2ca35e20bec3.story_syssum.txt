With one vote on Friday, the Republican-led House launched the latest spending battle in Congress -- one that could bring a government shutdown in less than two weeks.
"The American people don't want the government shut down, and they don't want Obamacare," the Ohio Republican said to applause and cheers.
"It's up to Senate Democrats to follow House Republicans and show some responsibility," Cantor said.
Government shutdown: Again?
Cantor said Friday the House would consider a one-year debt ceiling measure next week that contains other conservative-backed proposals, expected to include postponing implementation of Obamacare for a year and approving the Keystone oil pipeline from Canada.
Obama, however, rejected playing politics with the debt ceiling, which is the limit for how much the federal government can borrow to pay bills it owes.
In addition, the White House said Thursday that Obama would veto the House spending resolution defunding Obamacare if it reaches his desk.
The result would have been what legislators call a "clean" final version that simply extended current levels of government spending for about two months of the new fiscal year, allowing time for further negotiations on the debt ceiling.
On the House floor on Friday, legislators warned of the serious consequences of a government shutdown.
Instead, the Senate is expected to strip the measure of all provisions defunding Obamacare and send it back to the House.
"They're simply postponing an inevitable choice they must face," Reid said of House Republicans.
asked Democratic Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan.
Meanwhile, Democratic resolve is bolstered by surveys showing most people oppose a government shutdown and more would blame Republicans if it happens.
