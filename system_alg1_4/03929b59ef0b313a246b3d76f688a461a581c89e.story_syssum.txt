(CNN) -- College costs too much, both for students and for society as a whole.
Earlier this week, U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan addressed some of these concerns in a speech where he urged colleges to get serious about their cost problem.
Indeed, the typical successful university president views his or her key constituencies not to be the customer (students and their parents who pay tuition charges or the granters of research funds), but rather others -- the faculty, important alumni, key administrators, trustees and occasionally politicians.
They give the alumni successful intercollegiate athletic programs that are expensive and usually financed off the backs of students.
Like health care, prices are rising rapidly for higher education because of the predominant role of third-party payments -- federal student loans and grants, state government support for institutions and students, private philanthropic gifts and endowment income.
And the nonprofit nature of institutions reduces incentives for colleges and universities to be efficient.
Customers are ignorant of college outcomes because we do not measure in any coherent and consistent manner what students actually learn, how well they do after graduation or whether they think better in a critical manner as a result of the college experience.
If information and incentives are provided, innovation will come.
Already, we know several online and other innovations can work to deliver high-quality education services at potentially lower prices.
According to my analysis of the data, more than 17 million college graduates were "underemployed" in 2008.
Like it or not, American higher education is in for big change in the next generation.
