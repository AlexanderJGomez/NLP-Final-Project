Jonathon Walters didn't know where to begin.
It is only hard the first time you do it.
Walters received his high school diploma through home schooling in 2006.
His father's death motivated him to lose 200 pounds in the last nine months, and he says he isn't looking back.
Walters was despondent.
It hit him that he too would "eventually run out of tomorrows."
I was done feeling pain every second of every day.
"I was done quitting everything I started.
Walters made a doctor's appointment for the next day.
He had no idea how he would do it, but he was determined to lose weight without surgery and knew he needed help.
He left the doctor's office and started exercising the next day.
Soon, he was up to 3 miles a day and was down 50 pounds.
Walters now runs 10 miles a day, lifts weights and works out on machines at the gym.
Terri Hartman, a nurse practitioner who worked with Walters early on in his diet, said she's thrilled with his progress.
This time, Walters is determined not to quit.
... Imagining my sons and wife without me, makes every ounce of effort I put in worth it."
