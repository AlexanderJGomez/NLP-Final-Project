NEW YORK (CNN) -- For someone who claims to be incredibly laid back, Jason Mraz is certainly piling up the accomplishments.
"To have the music shared all around the world, and to be acknowledged by communities like this ... it's inspiring."
The tour's quirky title was inspired by a wholesome San Francisco, California, restaurant Mraz loves.
Mraz shared tales of his avocado farm, as well as what it's like to get the cold shoulder from Simon Cowell, when he sat down with CNN recently.
What's that like?
Yes, the trees give me avocado and fruit that we sell and we eat tons of, but I feel like I have a role to play back to that, too.
Mraz: At least two.
Mraz: I do.
Mraz: I prepare.
Mraz: Well, I bring tons of backup supplies with me.
Mraz: I loved it.
I was like, "What does he think?"
Mraz: It is really tough.
I just don't know that I could commit myself to something like that.
Mraz: Very surprised.
Where were you?
What were you doing?
Mraz: This year we're going to explore South America, which I've visited as a tourist, but I've never taken my music down there.
I hear the crowds turn up in masses, so I really want to see what that's like.
Mraz: No, but I have the Rosetta Stone.
