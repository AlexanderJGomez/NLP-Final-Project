Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- The alleys and archways along Rashid Street in central Tripoli were plunged in darkness this weekend, as the Libyan capital struggled to cope with widespread shortages of electricity.
My father's neighborhood hasn't had electricity for five straight days," said one Libyan man who asked not to be named, for fear of attracting the ire of government authorities.
Some residents complain pumps have stopped channeling water to their apartment buildings, leaving them without both water and light.
"Surely a large country like Libya doesn't depend on one power station," the Libyan man said.
In an e-mail to CNN, NATO military spokesman denied accusations that the alliance targeted Libyan electrical power lines.
That is roughly the equivalent of 13 dollars for a gallon of gasoline, a huge price surge in a country long accustomed to cheap, heavily subsidized fuel.
Hopes for a reprieve in the fuel shortages were dashed this week when the regime in Tripoli announced rebels somehow seized control of the fuel tanker ship Cartagena off the coast of Malta.
"The age of piracy is coming back to the Mediterranean because of NATO," Kaim concluded.
A NATO spokesman in Naples, Italy, wrote to CNN, "On the afternoon of 3 August a NATO warship established visual and voice contact with the MT Cartagena and found the crew cooperative.
Abdullah said the power outages began within the last two weeks.
One man carrying a shopping bag stopped to accuse foreign journalists of being the cause of the crisis.
"The government is lying and the rebels will be in Tripoli soon," one man said nervously, before quickly walking away.
