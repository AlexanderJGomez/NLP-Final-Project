The region's three big players -- Etihad, Emirates and Qatar Airways -- announced orders for 393 new commercial planes.
The Abu Dhabi based airline Etihad was the first to lay down a marker at the event: a $25.2B deal for 56 new wide-bodied Boeing aircraft, including 25 777X planes, 17 of the biggest 777-9X variants and eight of the 777-8X version.
But it was Dubai's Emirates that revealed the largest order with a $76B deal  for 150 Boeing 777X planes, plus an additional 50 Airbus A380s, worth $23 billion, to bring its order of the superjumbo up to 101.
Doha-based Qatar Airlines added to the impressive figures for Boeing's 777X with a $19B order for 50 of the aircraft.
"With around $100B worth of orders, this makes it the largest aviation product launch," said Boeing Chairman and CEO Jim McNeary.
Finding room for the new aircraft in Dubai should not be a problem as the Al-Maktoum airport is the city's second international hub and predicted to be the world's largest when completed.
Hogan predicts passenger numbers for Etihad to grow by 14% annually for the next five years, while Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al-Maktoum, Emirates' CEO, believes the numbers will come as more countries open up.
"Some countries may be scared (to open up their markets), but they really have to open up."
