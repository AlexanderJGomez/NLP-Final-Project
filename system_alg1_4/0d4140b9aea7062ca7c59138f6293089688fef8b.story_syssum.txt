W: I've been doing hair for 17 years off and on since I was in my early 20s.
With over 2,000 stylists I can't do it myself anymore but I train a team that does it so I'll do a lot of demos for them too, which I love, to get my hands back in hair because I have such a strong passion for hair.
W: We have so many, like "life is too short to be somewhere lame," "pretty is as pretty does," I heard that my whole life growing up.
Being yourself is one of them, we want our stylists to feel really empowered to be who they are.
W: I try to.
W: Sometimes people get a little like uh-oh.
Women really get into it, a lot of chatter on Instagram about you know, what style did you get?
It's all a part of making it an experience and a fun place to hang out.
