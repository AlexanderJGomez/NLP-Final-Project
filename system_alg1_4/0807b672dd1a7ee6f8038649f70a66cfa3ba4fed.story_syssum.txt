(CNN) -- Liangqiao, a small collection of huts and farms in southern China, is known as a cancer village.
"He said don't eat the rice and don't drink the water."
Jingjing Zhang, an environmental lawyer who is working the villagers who want to sue the government, said the Dabaoshan mine has been polluting the Hengshui River for decades.
Pollution is a serious problem throughout China.
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the United States imported $4.1 billion worth of seafood and agricultural products from China in 2006.
CNN talked to the mine's director who acknowledged environmental issues with the mine, but said it wasn't a problem that could be solved overnight.
About 1,700 Yuan ($200) for the whole village, Zhang told CNN.
Water tests from Huanan Agricultural University have concluded the Hengshui is indeed too toxic for any human use, in stark contrast to what Jingjing said the government told the villagers.
And last week China announced a joint campaign with the European Union to clean up China's two largest river basins.
She said that after he got cancer he was unable to work and he reluctantly went for medical treatment.
"They have no other choice," Jingjing said.
