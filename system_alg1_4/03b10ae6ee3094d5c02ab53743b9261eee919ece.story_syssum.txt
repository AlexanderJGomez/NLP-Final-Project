A NOAA satellite image shows Hurricane Jimena off the coast of Baja California, Mexico, on Tuesday morning.
Also on Tuesday, Tropical Storm Erika formed in the Atlantic, 390 miles east of the Leeward Islands, the National Hurricane Center said.
On its current track, Jimena's center will approach the peninsula's southern portion later on Tuesday and central Baja California peninsula by Thursday, the weather service said at 11 a.m. PT.
People in his town of Los Cabos, at the very tip of the peninsula, were preparing for the storm and were getting a precursor as winds and rains began to pick up, said resident Cuauhtemoc Morgan on Monday.
Authorities were setting up shelters in schools and trying to devise a plan to protect the homeless, he added.
