(Financial Times) -- Facebook is working with a controversial data company called Datalogix that can track whether people who see ads on the social networking site end up buying those products in stores.
Facebook said it is paying Datalogix for the data-matching.
Marketers are eager for more data to see how their Facebook ad campaigns perform, but some said they still are figuring out how to evaluate the new data.
Facebook users are automatically included in the advertising studies conducted with Datalogix, and cannot directly opt out through their Facebook account.
Facebook and Datalogix said individual-level purchasing data were not shared with Facebook or its advertisers.
