Chris Christie built his keynote address to the Republican National Convention on the theme of telling tough truths to the nation.
The rate is higher than on the day Christie took office in 2010 and nearly a full percentage point higher than earlier this year, when Christie's State of the State address exultantly and repeatedly claimed that a "New Jersey Comeback" was under way.
No wonder Christie omitted "New Jersey Comeback" from his keynote address.
Most important, from a political perspective, Christie had a smooth launch onto the national stage, talking more about Chris Christie -- much more -- than about the man of the hour, candidate Mitt Romney.
Though Obama called Kerry's name 13 times in that speech, Christie mentioned Romney only seven times.
Voters, like supermarket shoppers, want as much as they can get for as little as they can get away with paying.
If the tough-talk message helps Romney win the White House in November, Christie is assured a bright future on the national stage.
