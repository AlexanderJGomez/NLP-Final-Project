Baghdad (CNN) -- A pair of suicide attacks Wednesday morning in Iraq's Diyala province, north of Baghdad, killed at least 16 people and wounded nearly 100 others, authorities said.
The attack in al-Ghalbiya killed at least three people and wounded 26 others, including al-Husseini.
That strike killed at least 65 people and wounded 160 others.
Diyala was an al Qaeda stronghold until 2008, when Iraqi security forces, backed by U.S. troops, conducted major military operations in the province to push the militants out.
