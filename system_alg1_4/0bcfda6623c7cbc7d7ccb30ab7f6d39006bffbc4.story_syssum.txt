(CNN) -- Jebb Graff isn't turned off -- yet -- by Carnival Cruise Lines' recent troubles.
Graff said he would definitely take another Carnival cruise.
But the company has to prove it is tackling the recent spate of mechanical issues faced by four Carnival ships, the most serious of which left more than 4,000 people stranded for days aboard the Carnival Triumph last month.

As the biggest cruise company in the world, parent company Carnival Corp. has a strong reputation in the industry and among its regular customers, said Kimberly Wilson Wetty, co-president of Valerie Wilson Travel.
"Despite considerable attention surrounding the Carnival Triumph, we had been encouraged to see booking volumes for Carnival Cruise Lines recover significantly in recent weeks," said Micky Arison, chief executive officer of Carnival Corp.
"For those who are consistent cruisers and know Carnival, I don't think it's going to change their buying habits.
That being said, I will stay on land from here on out," wrote one CNN.com commenter.

Still, Connie Hammond is one of those Carnival fans who isn't giving up on the cruise line.
She's already booked her next Carnival cruise, taking her 79-year-old mother and a girlfriend who has never been on a cruise.
