Pedro Zapeta was "very, very happy" when he learned about a federal appeals court ruling that says he is entitled to recover some of the money, said attorney Robert Gershman, who handled the financial end of Zapeta's case.
Because Zapeta had not done so, he was detained, and his money was seized.
"Even though he is not a citizen, it shows he has equal rights."
"The government always acted as if the money was their own," Gershman said.
Zapeta said last year that he had saved the money to build a house for himself and his family in his home village in the Guatemalan mountains.
As Zapeta's case was publicized, U.S. residents donated money to him, and Gershman set up a trust.
