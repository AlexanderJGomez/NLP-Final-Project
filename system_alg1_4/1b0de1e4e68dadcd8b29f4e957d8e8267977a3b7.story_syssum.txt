New York (CNN)  -- Ren√©e Fleming's new album "Dark Hope" has found the light, having earned the operatic soprano a spot on the Billboard Top 200 chart for the first time.
"I've devoted my life to classical music," says Fleming, 51.
With the exception of Peter Gabriel's "In Your Eyes" and Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah," Fleming wasn't familiar with any of the songs she interprets on "Dark Hope" (Decca).
Rock image aside, recording "Dark Hope" was a family affair for Fleming.
In fact you can see the whole family in the "Endlessly" music video.
They have great taste -- eclectic taste -- in music."
