Earlier, federal sources said that whether to support an out-of-state change of venue, a move that has happened rarely in recent years, appeared to be an ongoing point of disagreement within the Justice Department.
A trial also could be held in Arizona outside of Tucson, those sources said.
Federal sources say Silver -- if asked to move the trial -- would consult with officials of the 9th Circuit, the federal judicial region that includes nine Western states, including Arizona.
Federal prosecutors have the discretion to object to any proposed move out of state for any criminal trial, but they would have no authority to block it.
The prosecution of the suspects in the 1996 Oklahoma City, bombing was moved to Denver at the defense's request.
Federal judicial sources said they expect any consideration on the Arizona venue question to be several months off, at least.
