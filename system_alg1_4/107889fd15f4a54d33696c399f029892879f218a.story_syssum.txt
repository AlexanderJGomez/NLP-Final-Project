Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan must report to jail by June 17 to begin serving a 120-day sentence for a necklace theft charge, a judge ordered Wednesday.
Lohan likely qualifies to serve her sentence in home confinement, instead of a jail cell, but the probation officials will decide that, Whitmore said.
But the judge rejected Deputy City Attorney Melanie Chavira's request for substance abuse counseling for Lohan.
"I have already started my community service at the Downtown Women's Center and thank everyone there for their warm welcome," Lohan said.
Sautner said she's asked Los Angeles police to keep the paparazzi away from the center while Lohan performs her service.
