Dickinson is the latest of a handful of women who have accused Cosby of sexual assault -- allegations the comedian has repeatedly said are untrue.
Cosby attorney Martin Singer called Dickinson's story "a lie" and said it contradicts her own autobiography and a 2002 interview she did with the New York Observer.
"That interview a dozen years ago said, 'she didn't want to go to bed with him and he blew her off,' " Singer's statement said Wednesday.
Bowman claims she was drugged, then raped, though she said she never saw drugs.
On Saturday, NPR broadcast an awkward interview with Cosby in which he didn't utter a word when repeatedly asked about the claims about him.
