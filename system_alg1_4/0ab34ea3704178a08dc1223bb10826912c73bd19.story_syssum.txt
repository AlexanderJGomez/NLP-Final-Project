Sotomayor issued an order that, for the moment, stayed a requirement under the sweeping health law for certain religiously affiliated groups to ensure that employees receive coverage for contraception at no cost.
While Sotomayor's emergency injunction or any follow up to extend it or seek the opinion of her fellow justices for additional review may seem like a blow to the politically charged health care law, it isn't.
She did not overturn Obamacare," CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said.
Toobin said Sotomayor acted "based on her view of the law" in holding up the rule in this case.
