District Court Judge Jackie Glass sentenced four O.J.
The four -- Charles Cashmore, Charles Erlich, Michael McClinton and Walter Alexander -- all turned on Simpson and cooperated in the case against him.
The four apologized to the state and the victims in the case before their sentences were read in court Tuesday.
Stewart received a sentence similar to Simpson's but will be eligible for parole in 7Â½ years.
Glass ordered Fromong removed from the courtroom Tuesday after he made a comment during the sentencing of McClinton, who admitted brandishing a gun in the hotel room.
He'll remain jailed while an appeal is pending.
