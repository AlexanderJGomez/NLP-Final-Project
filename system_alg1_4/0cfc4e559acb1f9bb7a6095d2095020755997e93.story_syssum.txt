(CNN) -- The 2011 Arab uprisings presented the United States with a historic opportunity to take a clear stand on the side of freedom and democracy and strengthen its own standing in the process.
But once the dictator fell, America should have made a much stronger case for the fundamental principles of liberal democracy.
But Obama could have done much better.
But it went too far, ignoring the fundamental principles of democracy that America should have kept at the forefront of the agenda.
Occasionally, American officials spoke out, as when the ambassador to Egypt, Anne Patterson, told a small group in Alexandria that "democracy needs a healthy and active civil society."
The Obama administration has been so timid, so eager to stay out of the fray, that a few weeks before the verdict against the pro-democracy activists, Secretary of State John Kerry passed up the opportunity to take a stand for the workers, and for democracy, by quietly waiving the human rights preconditions of U.S. aid to Egypt and thus allowing $1.3 billion in aid to go forward.
But in the case of the Arab uprisings, America's ideals and interests overlap.
It's not too late for a course correction.
