Concern is growing for the well-being of four journalists, three of them American citizens, apparently detained in Iran this week, according to The Washington Post.
An Iranian official confirmed to CNN that Rezaian and Salehi are among three journalists being held by authorities.
The Committee to Protect Journalists said it was alarmed by The Post's report and urged Iran to release the four journalists.
The Iranian mission to the United Nations in New York is following up on the case, spokesman Hamid Babaei said.
His wife, an Iranian citizen who has applied for U.S. permanent residency, is a correspondent for the UAE-based newspaper the National, The Post said.
According to CPJ research, there are 35 journalists in prison in Iran.
The organization also highlights past instances in which Iran has detained international journalists, including the case of U.S. freelancer Roxana Saberi.
