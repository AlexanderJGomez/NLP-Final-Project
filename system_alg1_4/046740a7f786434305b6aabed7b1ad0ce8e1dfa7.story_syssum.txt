Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad lashed out at President Obama on Thursday.
Unofficial reports suggest the number is much higher.
Obama has said Iranians must be free to demonstrate peacefully, and his administration Wednesday withdrew invitations to Iranian diplomats around the world to attend U.S. embassy Fourth of July parties.
"A sizable percentage of the Iranian people themselves ... consider this election illegitimate," he said at a White House news conference.
Ahmadinejad said Thursday that even 5- and 6-year-olds would not allow insults to the Iranian nation, telling Obama: "We hope that you will avoid interfering in Iran's affairs and somehow express your regret so that the Iranian nation can become aware of your regret.
If there is real change, the Iranian nation will welcome it."
