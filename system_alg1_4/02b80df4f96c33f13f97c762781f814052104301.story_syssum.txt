Prince Bandar bin Sultan served as the Saudi ambassador to the United States for 22 years until 2005, and was appointed the chief of General Intelligence in 2012.
Bandar took on the thorny task of building and implementing Saudi Arabia's policy on Syria.
"Bandar was extremely hawkish on Iran even before he had this official position," said Dickey.
A senior administration official told reporters after President Obama's face-to-face meeting with Saudi's King Abdullah that the United States and Saudi Arabia are "very much aligned" despite recent policy differences over Syria and Iran.
The United States and Saudi Arabia have a longstanding history, an alliance forged most notably by oil and most recently by the rise of al Qaeda-affiliated networks in the region.
