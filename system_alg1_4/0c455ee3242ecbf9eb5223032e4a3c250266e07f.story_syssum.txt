WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Army and Marine Corps are allowing convicted felons to serve in increasing numbers, newly released Department of Defense statistics show.
Pentagon statistics show the Army granted 511 felony waivers in 2007, just over twice the 249 it granted the year before.
"There was a rapid rise in 2007 in the number of waivers the Army and Marine Corps granted to recruits convicted of serious felonies," Waxman said in a letter Monday to David Chu, the under-secretary of defense for personnel and readiness.
But the Pentagon statistics showed the Army allowed 106 convicted burglars to enlist in 2007, up from 36 the year before.
The Air Force said it granted no felony waivers in either year.
