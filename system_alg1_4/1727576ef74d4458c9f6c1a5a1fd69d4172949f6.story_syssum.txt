So are they worth it?
Imagine that the Apollo moon landing had not succeeded.
So NASA says it made a big purchase of a relatively new technology -- the integrated circuit, the technology behind what we now know as the microchip.
GPS technology, which is now powering the next phase of the information revolution, was originally developed by the U.S. military.
But it was only after the 1983 Soviet shooting down of a Korean Air Lines flight that the Reagan administration said it would share the technology so that civilian airplanes would not wander into restricted and dangerous territories.
The impact on the economy of human genome sequencing from 1988 to 2010 was estimated by Battelle at almost $800 billion -- enough to support more than 310,000 jobs in 2010 alone.
The United States has dominated the world of basic science for years, even decades.
As scientist Neal Lane points out, China is on course to surpass the United States in the percentage of its gross domestic product it spends on research and development in just a few years.
"The remarkable thing is that although basic research does not begin with a particular practical goal, when you look at the results over the years, it ends up being one of the most practical things government does.
Americans used to understand that moonshots inspire us, but that they also power America's future.
