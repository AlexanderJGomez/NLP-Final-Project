The male acquaintance, also 30, witnessed the kidnapping of Denise Louise Huskins from the Vallejo home, and he is not a suspect in the case, said Vallejo Police Lt. Kenny Park.
Huskins, who has been living in Vallejo the past year, is from Huntington Beach in Southern California, police said.
A cousin of Huskins, Amy Mattison, told CNN affiliate KPIX that the 30-year-old man is Huskins' boyfriend and she was abducted from his residence.
Authorities don't know when her vehicle was moved, police said.
Vallejo police asked the FBI to help their investigation.
