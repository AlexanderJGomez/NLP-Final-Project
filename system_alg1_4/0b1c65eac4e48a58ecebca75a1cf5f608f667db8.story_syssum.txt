Obama headed for the G-20 summit by first stopping in Sweden where he directed his pitch for military action against Syria to the world leaders he will soon meet in Russia.
On Tuesday, members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee made it clear they wanted no ground forces to be part of any military action in Syria.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee gave Obama some momentum on proposed military action in Syria, but not before rewriting his plan.
Kerry told one House lawmaker that he expects Obama to address the nation on military action.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday in an interview that he "doesn't exclude" backing a U.N. resolution for military action, though only if there is irrefutable proof Syria's government is behind the latest attack.
So far, the politics of seeking congressional approval have favored bipartisanship even though it's far from certain whether Obama's wish for military action will be approved.
A White House statement on the Senate committee action said America is stronger when "the president and Congress work together" and promised to "build on this bipartisan support" for limited military action.
There was, however, one pointed criticism of Obama on Wednesday by House Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Ed Royce, who said the president's policy on Syria has been adrift for two years.
