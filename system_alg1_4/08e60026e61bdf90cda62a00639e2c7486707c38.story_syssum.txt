(CNN) -- Samuel Eto'o has rejected claims his move to Anzhi Makhachkala is all about money and claims he wants to transform the Russian club into a "big" team.
At a press conference Eto'o, who has won the European Champions League three times, told reporters he was excited by his new challenge.
"It was always important for me to be happy -- and now I am happy.
I came to Anzhi because it is a new project and they are starting from scratch.
The Togo striker spent part of last season at Real Madrid, where he scored eight times in 22 games.
