Loganville, Georgia (CNN) -- This is not a movie.
With two telephones to his ear, he listened to his wife, Melinda, as she fled into an attic of their Loganville home.
On another line was the 911 operator Donnie Herman had called for help.
Relax," Herman said, trying to calm his wife.
Melinda Herman fired a six-shot revolver at the intruder, hitting him five times, in his torso and in his face.
They remind people that Melinda Herman had only a six-shot revolver.
Otherwise she would have been in trouble and she would have run out of ammunition," said Erich Pratt, director of communications for the Gun Owners of America.
Donnie and Melinda Herman own two guns for protection at home, but until two weeks ago, she had never fired a gun.
Her husband told sheriff's department investigator's that he took her shooting so that she'd be familiar with the family's guns if she ever had to use one.
On the phone, Donnie Herman calmly instructed his wife about the use of the weapon she had practiced on.
She's shooting him.
...
Donnie Herman said as the 911 dispatcher listened.
Walton County Sheriff Joe Chapman -- whose office responded to the shooting at the Hermans' home -- said he believes the mother and her two children were in a life-and-death situation and she had no choice but to exercise her constitutional right to self-defense.
Despite being shot five times, the suspect, identified as Paul Ali Slater, still managed to get back into his SUV, but he drove off the road and crashed a short distance away.
But Donnie Herman has told people he's not interested in being a poster boy for anyone.
She did what she was supposed to do as a responsible parent and gun owner," Herman told CNN affiliate WSB.
Experts also say that simply having a gun for self-protection does not guarantee safety.
They say the fear is that many people will take part in what might be considered a feeding frenzy by purchasing a gun, but not learn how to properly use it.
Don't waste your time," he told CNN.
