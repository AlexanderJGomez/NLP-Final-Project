(WIRED)  -- Microsoft showed off a host of visual and search enhancements to its search engine Bing Wednesday, in hopes that better packaging will help it eat away at Google's online dominance.
You can also easily make reservations via OpenTable and take a virtual tour of a restaurant's interior when a restaurant shows up in map search results.
Traditional search also got a slight makeover, with visual changes being made to how results are returned for musical artists, destinations and movies, among other types of search.
Bing now has 11.8% of the U.S. search market, a 48% hump growth since Bing replaced Live search in the summer of 2009, according to Nadell.
For instance, if you search for "how to quiet a baby" and one of your friends on Facebook has liked one of the articles that shows up in the search results, you will see their picture next to that result.
When you search for say "Tron", Bing actually looks into what your friends are interested in, finds stories they have liked via little "Like" buttons all over the net, and then inserts that into the top results -- even if that story wouldn't have shown up in Bing's natural search results.
Since Google's design sense heavily relies on minimalism, that leaves lots of room for Microsoft (and its search partner Yahoo) to experiment with alternative, graphics-heavy designs.
Microsoft didn't announce anything today on par with Google's recent announcement of "Instant Search," a huge engineering feat that lets users see search results before even finishing typing their query.
