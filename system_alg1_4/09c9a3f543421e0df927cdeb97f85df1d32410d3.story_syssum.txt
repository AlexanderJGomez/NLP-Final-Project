The man Junger met was Ahmad Shah Massoud, the "Lion of Panjshir."
Watch how images of Massoud are everywhere in Afghanistan Â»
Massoud had a reputation for integrity and strength, says Junger, who traveled to Afghanistan in 2000 to profile Massoud for his book, "Fire."
Massoud had a reputation as a fierce nationalist who would not allow any outside group -- the Russians, Pakistan, the Taliban, even the United States -- to control Afghanistan, says Zieba Shorish-Shamley, an Afghan native and founder of the Women's Alliance for Peace and Human Rights in Afghanistan.
Massoud became Afghanistan's most famous resistance leader after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979.
Shorish-Shamley, the women's rights activist, says Massoud was assassinated just before the 9/11 attacks because bin Laden feared Massoud.
"If they [al Qaeda leaders] were hiding under a rock, he would have found them,'' Shorish-Shamley says.
After the Soviet army left Afghanistan, various Afghan resistance leaders cobbled together a coalition government to run the country.
They really didn't do any good for the Afghan people."
Marcela Grad, author of the book "Massoud," says he was the only Afghan resistance leader who never left the country to live abroad.
"He had tranquility about him," says Grad, who journeyed to Afghanistan to talk to Massoud's friends for her book.
Junger, who had interviewed Massoud the year before, says he was crushed by Massoud's death.
A year after Massoud's death, he was named a "National Hero of Afghanistan."
"I want to follow in my father's footsteps," Ahmad said.
