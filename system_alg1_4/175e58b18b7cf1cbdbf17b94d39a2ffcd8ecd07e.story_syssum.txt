BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- The U.S. State Department's renewal of Blackwater's contract to provide security in Iraq "is bad news," an adviser to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said.

Al-Askari said he would push for the Iraqi government to contest the contract renewal.
Al-Dabbagh said the Iraqi government still wants Blackwater to come under the jurisdiction of Iraqi law and its courts.
"The U.S. informed us that the FBI investigation is still not done, and if Blackwater [personnel are] ... convicted, then the contract will be reviewed."
Starr said new rules and an agreement between the State Department and U.S. military have improved coordination and the supervision of contractors.
Blackwater must work under the rules of the Iraqi government, he said.
It will be important to see whether the FBI finds Blackwater itself criminally responsible, or merely a few of its employees, Starr said.
I think the U.S. government needs protective services."
