(CNN) -- Virginia Tech will be fined $55,000 for waiting too long to provide timely warnings about a shooter on the loose during a 2007 rampage in which 32 people died, the U.S. Department of Education said Tuesday.
Federal officials said the $55,000 for two violations of the act is the maximum allowed.
Larry Hincker, associate vice president for university relations at Virginia Tech, said Tuesday the school "respectfully disagrees" with the fine.
But it was not until 9:26 a.m. that the university first notified students and staff by e-mail about the shooting.
It did not mention that there had been a murder or that the killer had not been identified," the Department of Education said Tuesday.
"Because Virginia Tech failed to notify its students and staff of the initial shootings on a timely basis, thousands continued to travel on campus, without a warning of the events at" the residence hall, the education department said.
But in its letter to Virginia Tech, the Department of Education said the school did not meet timely warning rules that were in effect on the day of the rampage.
