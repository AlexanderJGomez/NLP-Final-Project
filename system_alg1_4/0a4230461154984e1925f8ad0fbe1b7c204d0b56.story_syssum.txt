Columbine High School promised to be a safe and secure place of learning.
Scars remain from that day that no one can see.
They make my heart beat faster when I hear the blades of a helicopter overhead.
But our epidemic of gun violence is creating a culture of fear in our schools, where students are anxious about safety and intruders.
The other day, I was explaining to my third graders that we were going to practice a lockdown just in case a bear happened to be on the playground -- a real scenario for our Colorado school.
I felt kicked in the stomach when I heard this question.
I teach at a wonderful school, which has done everything within its resources to keep our students safe.
I believe a comprehensive approach can help ensure a safe learning environment.
â€¢ Our children deserve enhanced school security: This includes identifying who is in the school and sensible steps to keep the building secure -- without bringing guns into the place of learning or turning it into a fortress.
What is to stop the next person who chooses from doing just that?
I think I can speak for all of us that the murders at Columbine High School, the Aurora movie theater, Sandy Hook Elementary, and so many others shocked us to our core and created lasting feelings of sadness.
We need to take action now.
