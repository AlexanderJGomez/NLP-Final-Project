His comments inspired Twitter users to tweet the hashtag #YesAllWomen: They shared examples of what "women must fear" even if "not all men" engage in those behaviors, according to the person believed to have created the hashtag Saturday.
#YesAllWomen is the latest Twitter hashtag to draw attention to violence against women in a global conversation that has spread from social media to college campuses and into the White House.
More unique is the conversation's focus on misogyny and its negative impact on women and men, Maxwell said, pointing to tweets from men as evidence.
#YesAllWomen's forebears include #everydaysexism, which evolved from the website Everyday Sexism.
The hashtag highlighted examples of victim blaming and was tweeted more than 67,000 times.
Celebrity boost aside, #YesAllWomen's universal appeal springs from "bottom-up" personal stories instead of a single omniscient voice in an op-ed, Maxwell said.
In fact, Rodger's killing spree shows that men can also be victims of hostility toward women: Four men were among those killed, including his two roommates, "the biggest nerds I had ever seen," Rodger said.
I'm the perfect guy and yet you throw yourselves at these obnoxious men instead of me, the supreme gentleman," Rodger said in a YouTube video posted the day of the killings.
Despite its grim origins, #YesAllWomen advanced conversation around issues that dominate feminist circles, feminist writer Soraya Chemaly said.
"I don't know how anyone can look at this information and not see how densely matrixed all these factors and events are," Chemaly said.
It created a virtual space for women to share their stories, Chemaly said.
