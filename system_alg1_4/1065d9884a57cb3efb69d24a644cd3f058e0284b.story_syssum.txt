New York (CNN) -- Two Mexican brothers have been extradited to the United States to join a third brother to face sex trafficking charges in New York as part of a complex collaborative effort to combat human trafficking, federal officials said Monday.
"The sex trafficking of young girls and women is modern-day slavery we will do everything in our power to eradicate," Lynch said in a news conference Monday.
The mother was involved with the Carreto family sex trafficking ring, officials said.
Under the initiative, "the United States and Mexico have collaborated to bring high-impact prosecutions under both U.S. and Mexican law to more effectively dismantle human trafficking networks operating across the U.S.-Mexico border," Monday's news release said.
