The scene was somber, sullen and mostly silent outside the Turkish coal mine.
"Let this mine take my life, too!"
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday as many as 120 more were trapped inside the mine, though that was before rescue crews grimly hurried a series of stretchers -- at least some clearly carrying corpses -- past the waiting crowd.
Rescue volunteer Mustafa Gursoy told the CNN team at the mine that conditions inside the mine were abominable -- hot, smoky and filled with carbon monoxide.
These stiff challenges notwithstanding, rescuers haven't given up hope that some miners reached emergency chambers stocked with gas masks and air.
But Yildiz, speaking earlier, said "hopes are diminishing" of rescuing anyone yet inside the mine.
The trauma from what already looks like the worst mine disaster in Turkish history has left Soma and the rest of Turkey in shock and, in some cases, in anger.
In some incidents three people died, in others, five, said opposition spokesman Aykut Erdogdu.
Erdogan questioned Ozel's version, and said the mine had passed safety inspections as recently as March.
Not everyone in Soma, at least, has sided with Erdogan, who canceled a trip to Albania to tour the rescue effort and speak to relatives of dead and injured miners.
While not focused on mine safety, such demonstrations railing against Erdogan and his government have been commonplace in Turkey in recent months, as has the police responding with water cannons and tear gas.
After what's happened, he said, he'll never work in a mine again.
