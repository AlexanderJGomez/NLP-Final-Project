Aaron Sofer was reported missing on Friday by a friend who he was hiking with in the Jerusalem Forest, Israeli Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told CNN.
The friend "lost contact" with Sofer while walking with him and reported the disappearance to the police, Rosenfeld said.
"I actually was over there today on site," he told CNN's Jake Tapper.
Republican Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey said the U.S. Department of State was helping Israeli authorities in the search for Sofer.
"There are concerns, as we all know, about the possibility of abduction," Smith said, according to CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey.
