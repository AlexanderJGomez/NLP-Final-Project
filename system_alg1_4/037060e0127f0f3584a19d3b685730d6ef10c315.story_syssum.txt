Marc Marquez held off Valentino Rossi to claim the opening MotoGP race of the season in Qatar on Sunday, picking up where he left off last year.
"I enjoyed a lot that race, especially after the injury," Marquez told BT Sport.
But yesterday I had a good feeling and today the last lap with Valentino, I didn't think about the leg and the injury.
The 21-year-old, who lost his pole advantage seconds after the start, saved his fastest lap time for the end.
Rossi told BT Sport.
The two-time MotoGP world champion -- and last year's winner in Qatar -- crashed in the first lap after a blistering start that saw him move to the front.
I made a junior mistake."
