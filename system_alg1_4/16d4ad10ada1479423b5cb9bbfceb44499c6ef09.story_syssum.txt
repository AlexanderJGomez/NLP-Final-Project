Marcos scaled a ladder, broke through a screen, forced open a window and carried the boy to safety.
The Oregon teen received a national award in Washington on Monday, picked in part by people who've won the prestigious Medal of Honor.
Marcos was the youngest person to receive the award, according to his high school, which hailed the news on its website.
"The honorees we celebrate today ... are seemingly ordinary Americans, but far from it, really," said Jim Miklaszewski, the award ceremony's emcee and the Pentagon correspondent for NBC News.
He "has gone above and beyond to improve the lives of the homeless in Southern California, and by example throughout the United States," award organizers said.
The annual awards, which officials from the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation started giving out in 2008, do make a difference, Brandon Wemhoff said.
As he prepared to head to Washington to receive the prestigious award, Marcos told The Oregonian newspaper that he'd told only a few of his friends.
In some ways, he's still a typical high school student.
