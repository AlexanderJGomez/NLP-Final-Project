Last year, North Carolina's jobless rate fell to a five-year low after Gov.
The reason for this, wrote Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a former economist for the George W. Bush administration, is that unemployment is "intricately linked to the length of unemployment benefits."
One, it provides an economic rationale for resisting benefit extension: Jobless insurance discourages people from taking available work.
Jobless insurance isn't a cause of unemployment.
But the more important reason why North Carolina's unemployment rate went down is plain to see: People stopped looking for work.
Why?
But a low participation rate is bad for the economy and for everyone.
The Republicans no doubt fear that if they agree to an extension of unemployment benefits, or compromise on any safety net program, that they won't get the credit.
And unlike the Democrats, who would be rewarded in this year's midterm elections, the Republicans would be punished by voters who believe welfare is, as one congressman put it, "legalized plunder."
But if the economy on its own is incapable of creating the 7.4 million jobs needed to return to "normal," what does such a formulation mean?
