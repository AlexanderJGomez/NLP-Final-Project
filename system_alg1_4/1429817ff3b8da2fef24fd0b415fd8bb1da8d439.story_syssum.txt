It uses a system designed by Amazon subsidiary Kiva that keeps track of all inventory so the robots know exactly what is on each storage unit.
"The robots job is really to move inventory from storage to the work station," said Brian Lemerise VP of third-party fulfillment at Quiet Logistics.
This is made possible by the bar codes they drive over and the cameras on the bottom of the drive units, which together communicate where the bot is driving to.
"The software will allocate a certain number of spots to a specific robot; that's what keeps the robots from hitting each other"
But they do make it easier to get the job done.
