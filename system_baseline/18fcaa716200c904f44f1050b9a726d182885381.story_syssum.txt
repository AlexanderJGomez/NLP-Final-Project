New Orleans (CNN) -- The legendary Chaka Khan, dressed in a regal purple and blue blouse and slacks, glides into the CNN Red Chair Interview room.
I respond that my stepdaughter is also named "Chaka."
"People usually name their dogs after me," she whispers, as though we are girlfriends sharing a funny secret.
The one thing she recalls from way back when, however, is that she always wanted to be an anthropologist.
She loves life and each moment God gives her, she says.
After our conversation, she won't leave the room until she sees a picture of my little Chaka.
We also want to know the biggest pivotal and "aha" moments of their lives.
