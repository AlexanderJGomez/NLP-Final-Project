But, during a phase-in period that now has stretched over 18 months, very few travelers have been referred to secondary screening, the report from the Homeland Security department's inspector general's office found.
The federal Customs and Border Protection agency, though, contends that the program is working, adding that it believes it is better to encourage compliance gradually then to enforce it right away.
Along the southern border, compliance has been spottier, with an average of 93 percent of travelers having required documents.
The inspector general says the non-compliance rate could spell trouble when Customs and Border Protection seeks "full compliance" with the law, saying the latter agency does not have the resources to process large numbers of non-compliant travelers through secondary screening.
The agency said the program is working, adding that it believes it is better to encourage compliance then to enforce it at this time.
