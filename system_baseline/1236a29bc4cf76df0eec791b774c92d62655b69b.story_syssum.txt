But Weston Cage's mother, Christina Fulton, is asking his doctor to recommend her 20-year-old son be kept at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center for another two weeks, she told CNN Friday.
Weston Cage, in a statement delivered through his father's lawyer Friday afternoon, said that he did not want his mother to be involved in his care.
Fulton blames Nicolas Cage for what she said is her son's downward spiral since he turned 18 and was no longer under her legal guardianship.
A member of that team of caregivers was Kevin Villegas, whom Fulton hired as her son's personal wrestling coach when he was in high school.
Cell phone videos, which have been posted online, indicated that the violence started when Cage attempted to kick Villegas when the trainer objected to the food he wanted to order at a restaurant.
Fulton, who separated from Cage after their son was born, said the father was rarely around for her son growing up, while she dealt with his medical and psychological issues.
After Weston's 18th birthday, his father "orchestrated" his son's removal from her care by convincing the employees she hired to work for him and giving him his own home and money, Fulton said.
"Ms. Fulton comments about Mr. Cage are absurd and it's very unfortunate that she would lash out like this because her son does not want to have anything to do with her," Singer said.
You know, 18 years of being successful, 18 years of watching my son respond to all the medical intervention that I have given him and all the support.
My son needs to be home."
