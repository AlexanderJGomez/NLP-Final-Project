"It's not just a Bhutanese architectural loss but for the whole Himalayan region," Dasho Karma Ura, president of the Thimphu-based Center for Bhutan Studies, said by telephone on Tuesday before visiting the site.
The fire started Sunday afternoon and burned through the night, consuming the dzong, which not only housed temples but served as the seat of administration for the district.
Although an investigation is still under way, a short circuit in the wiring is believed to have caused the fire, according to the minister, adding that the dzong was 95% built of timber.
The Taktsang, he wrote, "is in fact more cherished and revered today because the fire awakened all of us to the fragility and vulnerability of this most precious heritage."
With its contours built into the ridge 1,350 meters (4,430 feet) above sea level, Wangdue Phodrang is inaccessible on three sides save for a narrow path in the front, Dasho Karma of the Center for Bhutan Studies pointed out.
This week's fire will prompt Bhutan to shift its policy to protect its centuries-old dzongs, the home minister said.
Such policies would include ensuring a high quality in the electrification of the dzongs, adequate fire-extinguishing equipment, alternatives to timber which comprise most dzong construction -- and multiple exits.
He hoped the king would rebuild the fortress, "which will inspire future generations ... in the same way that the founder of Bhutan did," he added.
