And though he doesn't take Spock with him, he and Spock remain inseparable.
Nimoy often insisted otherwise, especially as the show went from canceled outcast to global phenomenon.
He even wrote a book with the title, "I Am Not Spock" (1977) that was bought by millions of readers who didn't buy the title for a nanosecond.
Nimoy had a hand, so to speak, in creating one of Spock's most indelible traits: The "live-long-and-prosper" split-finger salute that Nimoy had borrowed from an approximation of the Hebrew letter shin, the first letter in the word Shaddai, one of the Hebrew names for God.
He could not stop smiling, not even when one of the reporters asked him about a scene in the film that catches Spock in an impromptu grin.
He looked like a man who knew he was going to soon have a lot more money than he'd had a week, or a day before -- though anyone with a brain knew he wasn't going to squander any of it on trivial things.
