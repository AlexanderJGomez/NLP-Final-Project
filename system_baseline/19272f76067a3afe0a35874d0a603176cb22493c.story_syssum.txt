(CNN) -- The fight to block construction of the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline through east Texas stepped up Monday as protesters locked themselves to machinery.
All of the blockade protesters were removed from the construction sites by 2 p.m. and 12 of them were arrested, he said.
While construction of some segments of the proposed 1,700-mile pipeline has not been approved, the Texas government and courts have cleared its path through that state.
"The pipeline has come to symbolize something much, much bigger than just one energy project, it's come to symbolize what is our energy future, and what President Obama is going to do on climate change," said activist Jane Kleeb of the anti-pipeline organization Bold Nebraska, in a state where the Keystone XL project would cut through predominantly agricultural areas.
