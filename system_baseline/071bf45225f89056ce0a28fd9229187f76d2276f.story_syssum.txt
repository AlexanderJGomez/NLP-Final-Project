"The airlines are basically trying to squeeze out more fees in the face of higher costs, and it is inconveniencing a lot of passengers," said Hobica.
The charges for window or aisle seats in the front half of the plane, costing as much as $29 each way on U.S. domestic flights and $59 on international flights, are the latest of a raft of passenger fees introduced in recent years as the airline industry looks to generate new streams of revenue.
The implementation of end-of-row seat fees is part of a broader airline trend to charge for amenities previously included in the standard fare, such as movies, water, pillows and blankets.
Kate Hanni, of passenger rights organization FlyersRights, said the aisle and window surcharges made air travel an even more daunting prospect for families.
Hulme said that the number of rows in which window and aisle seats were set aside as "preferred seating" varied from aircraft to aircraft, but did not extend through the entire plane.
Many of those who traveled in groups were leisure travelers who tended to book their fares in advance, and should encounter few difficulties being seated together, she said.
