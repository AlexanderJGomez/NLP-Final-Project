When John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr worked through a dozen or more takes of a song to get one they and producer George Martin liked, they likely hoped fans would never hear their mistakes.
The British government, following the change in European copyright law, implemented a law last month providing "that if a record label is not commercially releasing a track that is over 50 years old, then the performers can request that the rights in the performance revert to them -- a 'use it or lose it' clause," the government's website said.
No doubt many hardcore Beatles fans around the world are bingeing on the 14 outtakes from three 1963 studio sessions, and the 44 songs from the dozens of BBC radio shows the group performed on when their fan base was mostly limited to the British Isles.
The Beatles got only three complete takes of "I Saw Her Standing There" out of nine attempts during that marathon first session.
Two takes of "Misery" -- the first and seventh recording that afternoon -- are included.
"George is to play the first bit of the instrumental, isn't he?"
"Thank You Girl," a song written as a tribute to their already dedicated female groupies, is next.
The band seemed to struggle in that March session with "Hold Me Tight," a song they later said they never cared for.
The recording quality, none in stereo, varies from show to show, since the BBC was not trying to save the performances for later release.
"For the moment the majority of the Beatles fans are in their hometown of Liverpool, and I have a very strong suspicion that it won't be long before they're all over the country," the announcer said as he introduced their performance of "Love Me Do" on the BBC's "Easy Beat" show on January 26, 1963.
