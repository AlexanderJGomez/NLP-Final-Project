More than 20,000 homes were inundated after the normally subdued Brisbane River turned into a raging torrent as weeks of rain pushed it to more than 4 meters at high tide early Thursday.
Residents in Brisbane were being urged not to enter floodwater because of the risk of illness after sewage plants along the river were inundated.
That represents the biggest deployment of ADF personnel for a natural disaster since Cyclone Tracy devastated the northern Australian city of Darwin on Christmas Eve 1974, killing 71 people.
The Brisbane River, which slices through the city, peaked Thursday at 4.6 meters (more than 15 feet), about a meter below predictions and below the level set by the last major flood in 1974.
"There's a lot of heartache and grief as people start to see, for the first time, what has happened to their homes and their streets," Bligh told ABC News 24.
She predicted that Brisbane's Central Business District was "largely operational," and will likely be fully operational next week, when power is expected to be restored to 10 office buildings.
Some rowed out on inflatable boats, surfboards and whatever else they could find.
By late Thursday, the brown, murky water had risen more than half a meter above the second floor.
They were among more than 1,000 people who slept Wednesday night on inflatable mattresses at the center.
Elsewhere in the city, floodwater rose to rooftops, submerging houses and creating a logistical and financial headache for homeowners waiting for the water to drop so they could check the damage.
