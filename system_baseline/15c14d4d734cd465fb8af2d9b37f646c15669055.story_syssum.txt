Spencer Elden, the underwater infant pursuing a dollar bill on the cover of 1991's "Nevermind," is doing swimmingly these days, having graduated a year early from a Los Angeles-area high school.
"Stuff happens like random cool situations where I get paid $500 just to go hang out," Elden said.
Elden has snagged an internship with street artist Shepard Fairey, creator of the ubiquitous Warhol-esque red, white and blue Barack Obama posters.
A Hollywood film role might be in the works, but Elden and his father, who is also a designer and artist, aren't revealing any details.

"The musical ideas that Nirvana was about were so powerful they couldn't help but spread."
