Boyd, a fourth-generation black farmer himself, tells CNN that he wants Congress and the Obama administration to "step up" and deliver the money needed to fund the settlement.
The 1997 Pigford v. Glickman case against the U.S. Department of Agriculture claimed that black farmers were systematically denied government farm loans and support from federal programs because of the color of their skin.
Then-Senator Barack Obama sponsored a measure in the 2008 Farm Bill that reopened the case, known as Pigford II.
"I decided to drive my trusty tractor here -- Justice -- all over Washington, so people can see what a real farmer looks like," Boyd said, adding that he wants political leaders to understand "the lives they're affecting when they deny justice.
It's about a group of people who've proven their case in front of a court, who've won time and time again in Congress.
And this isn't the first time he's mounted a somewhat unique, farm-oriented action in the U.S. capitol, either.
And deep down I know it's because he watched how damn bad I suffered with the government and how bad the government treated us, you know with getting loans and things of that nature.
Boyd says he'll put his question to leaders of all stripes: "Why can't we get this done if we have the support they say we do amongst Republicans and Democrats and the president?
"It's time for Congress and leaders in the Senate to start working for the American people and that includes the black farmers, too."
