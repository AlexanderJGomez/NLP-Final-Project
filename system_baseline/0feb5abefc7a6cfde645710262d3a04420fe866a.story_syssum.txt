(CNN) -- The silly season is upon us: the time during an election year when those trying to muck up the other side throw all sorts of nonsense about a candidate onto the public wall.
The latest craziness comes from Matt Drudge, who publishes the Drudge Report, the political equivalent of an online supermarket tabloid.
Take, for example, his tweet about Hillary Clinton, which caused something of a media firestorm.
People Magazine did a story on Clinton, and the photographer taking the picture for the front cover asked Clinton to stand by a lawn chair, grab the top, and lean into the camera.
The idea was to portray her as physically unfit to be president and save the right a billion or two of negative advertising in 2016.
Referring to Clinton's comparison of his aggressive actions in the Ukraine to Hitler's with Poland, Putin ironically said, "When people push boundaries too far, it's not because they are strong but because they are weak."
His "It's better not to argue with women," clearly shows Putin learned from his domestic encounters.
Being weak is not a Clinton hallmark; some Obama supporters cautioned him to hire a food-taster if Clinton joined his Cabinet.
I'm sure that on some issues it will provide clarification, and on others, controversy.
And, unfortunately, I'm also sure some in the media will be right there with some tweetle-dumb about it.
