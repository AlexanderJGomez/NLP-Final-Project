(CNN) -- Temporary calm returned to Rio de Janeiro on Saturday as anxious residents remained locked in their homes, awaiting developments in the week-long conflict that has turned their picturesque city into a de facto war zone.
Gangs continued to torch buses and exchange fire with police Friday throughout the city's northern neighborhoods as more than 800 federal troops arrived to support Rio's civil authorities who are often outnumbered and outgunned by the powerful criminal groups.
Residents trapped in the crossfire and unable to go to their jobs have waved white flags outside their homes asking drug gangs to spare them, as criminals spray police with semi-automatic weapon fire and military artillery.
If the conflict spills over to Rocinha, residents there are ready for violence, he said.
Brazil's Defense Minister Nelson Jobim said that in addition to the 800 federal troops, other reinforcements in support of local police are being directed to Rio amid fears that the crisis could spill over to neighboring states.
