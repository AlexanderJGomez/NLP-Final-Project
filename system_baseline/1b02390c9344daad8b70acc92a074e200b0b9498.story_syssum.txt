McWilliams represents a growing segment of America that has embraced public transit from coast to coast in communities like Seattle, Dallas, Nashville and Los Angeles.
Statistics released Monday from the American Public Transportation Association show that 2012 ranks as the second-highest transit ridership year since 1957.
Last fall, Superstorm Sandy shut down some of America's largest transit systems, resulting, according to the transportation association, in a loss of an estimated 74 million trips.

"We look at riders as customers and try to design the experience from a customer's point of view," said Valley Metro's Susan Tierney.
Utah's young rail system showed a nearly 15% gain on both its light rail and commuter rail lines in the Salt Lake City area.
This year, two more light rail lines are expected to open for business.
Millennials, age 18 to 34, like McWilliams are more likely to use public transit than older Americans, according to surveys.
