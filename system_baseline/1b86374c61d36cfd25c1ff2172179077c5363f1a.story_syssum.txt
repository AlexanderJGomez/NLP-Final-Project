It's easy to forget that we're volunteering basic information about ourselves in return for free e-mail, social networking and other digital services.
"So much that's geo-political, so much cybercrime, so many struggles of various types are being played out in terms of information security today," said Wade Williamson, a senior security analyst at Palo Alto Networks.
"Properly implemented strong crypto systems are one of the few things that you can rely on.
Many major websites offer the option of using a secure connection all the time.
There are also tools like HTTPS Everywhere, a free extension for Chrome and Firefox browsers, that encrypt your connection with most major websites.
But for people who are really worried about their e-mails being intercepted -- and that's always just an unsecured network and an eager hacker away -- Williamson suggests buying encryption software.
There's some free disk encryption software floating around in the open-source community, but for most folks this, too, will cost some cash.
To summarize, there are lots of encryption and other security options out there.
To find a level of security you're comfortable with, start by poking around with security settings on your browser, e-mail client and favorite websites.
