(CNN) -- Jean Lindsay, a spunky 67-year-old with two masters' degrees, panicked after she failed to land a job in the garden center of a Lowe's home-improvement store.
A few days later, though, she tossed on a red sweater, plopped down in front of her computer, flipped on her Web camera -- and, suddenly, while streaming her story onto the Internet, things seemed OK.
At a time when the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says that 1.07 million people 55 and older are unemployed and looking for work, the Internet is an increasingly useful tool for older people looking for jobs and a sense of community, said Deborah Russell the AARP's director of workforce issues.
"It's a great way of being able to network with people who are either in a similar situation or who may have some resources to help you," she said.
Her brother intended her to use the Web cam mostly to communicate with family members who are spread out across the country, she said.
Her most popular video -- in which she talks about depression while wearing a plaid nightgown -- has been viewed by more than 140,000 people.
This economy can push people into depression and mental illness, she said, and she wants people to know they're not alone.
And the job search is not always successful -- it's dealing with a lot of rejection, especially when you're older."
If nothing else, the online videos market her computer skills, she said.
"She's gotten so much response to it, and I'm wondering whether she might try to make something out of that," he said.
Lindsay, who said she needs a job because she has home-improvement debt and can't sell her house in this slumped market, said she is able to keep hunting for jobs partly because of her creative outlet online.
She plans to apply to an office-supply store, an electronics store and for a telecommunications job she could do from her home in western New York.
We're probably fooling ourselves that we can go on and do anything," she said, "but we can't live that way."
