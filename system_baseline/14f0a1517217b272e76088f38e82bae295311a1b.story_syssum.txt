(CNN) -- Three of the best-loved leaders in the history of the Roman Catholic church will be united this weekend when Pope Francis makes his predecessors, Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II, saints in a special ceremony in St Peter's Square.
But instead, 100 days into his reign he took the surprising -- and courageous -- decision to try to shake up the church, calling for the Second Vatican Council (better known as Vatican II), which he hoped would modernize Roman Catholicism, bring unity and improve its relations with other faiths.
When John XXIII's death was announced, the crowds wept for "Il Papa Buono" ("The Good Pope"); more than 40 years later, when John Paul II died, thousands cried "santo subito!"
For John XXIII also, the rules have been changed; he is credited with just one miracle, rather than the two which would usually be required for him to "qualify" as a saint.
Cardinal Paul Poupard, former president of the Pontifical Council for Inter-religious Dialogue, who knew both men, says Pope Francis is hoping to repair that rift by canonizing the two men who have come to represent the two opposing views.
"The pope is going to bring together in one ceremony the father of the council and [the one] who put it into action," he explains.
