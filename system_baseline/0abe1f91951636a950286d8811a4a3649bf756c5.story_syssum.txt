So, in the last of many flash-forwards in this finale, Ted went to the street in front of Robin's apartment and showed up with that blue French horn, the same one he stole for her in the first episode.
Marshall and Lily, pregnant with their second child in the present day, went on to have a third, but Lily was heartbroken when Robin decided she couldn't be as much a part of their gang anymore, due in part to Barney continuing to be, well, Barney around her.
Of course, the big Robin twist didn't exactly sit well with everyone online (people such as Rocco Horvath @RoccoRacingAMA, who tweeted, "It took me so long to get over the fact Ted and Robin weren't going to end up together and now this?!
Mixed Emotions"), and the finale seems to have split viewers more than any since "Lost."
Do you wish Tracy had stayed alive and Ted didn't ultimately end up with Robin?
Let us know in the comments and give yourself a self-five for making it all the way through nine seasons.
