Several victims in the assaults were women he arranged to meet at local hotels through online escort services, police said.
Police said that when New York state troopers tried to pull over the vehicle Lewis was driving for a missing license plate, he fled, crashing into a river.
The suspect was released on bail after his initial court hearing and ordered by the court to wear a GPS monitoring bracelet.
Two days after the North Carolina assault, police said, Lewis returned to his family's home in Massachusetts, where he allegedly beat and robbed his stepfather.
Carlos Dingui said Lewis handcuffed his stepfather to prevent him from calling police.
The firearm that police recovered from Lewis after his arrest Tuesday night matches the description of the one taken from his relative's house.
