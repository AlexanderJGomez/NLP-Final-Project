The measles outbreak that began when unvaccinated Amish missionaries traveled to the Philippines has more than doubled in size in 10 days, Ohio health officials reported Friday.
So far all the cases are within the Amish community and have been contained to six Ohio counties.
The measles outbreak began with a group from Christian Aid Ministries, who went on a mission to the Philippines earlier this year.
"This year represents the highest number of cases reported in the United States during this time period in 18 years,"  Dr. Greg Wallace, head of measles activities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an e-mail.
This week's numbers, including the latest tally from Ohio, will not be verified and compiled by the CDC until next week.
