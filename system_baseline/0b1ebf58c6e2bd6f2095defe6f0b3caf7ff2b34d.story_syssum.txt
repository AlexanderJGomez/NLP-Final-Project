(CNN) -- Imagine a woman dying under a rain of stones while buried in the ground to the top of her breasts.
Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani , a 43-year-old woman, had been sentenced to be stoned -- although after an international outcry, Iran has issued a statement saying she will not be punished in that way.
Consequently, women and the right to their bodies became the focus of the Islamic laws in Iran.
The young judge looked at me with compassion and pity and said, "Sister, don't you utter this statement somewhere else!
In a situation where people are enslaved by ruthless laws, human rights and women's rights advocates began to ask for help from the international community.
In spite of the efforts of human rights and women's rights advocates to raise awareness about the systematic and comprehensive violations of human rights in Iran, stoning remains a legitimate punishment for adultery in the Islamic Penal Code.
For as long as the world neglects the human rights situation in Iran, more women and men will have to face their horrifying destiny, as determined by unjust laws, all alone.
