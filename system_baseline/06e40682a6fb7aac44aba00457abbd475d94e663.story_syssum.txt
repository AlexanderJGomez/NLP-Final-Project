"I developed a term that is used in the game right now called sacking the quarterback," Jones is quoted on NFL.com.
Dressed in a black leather jacket, Jones marches into a bar and recites a poem about the virtues of the beer, and then warns, "and if you don't believe me, I'm gonna break your nose."
The numbers alone tell the tale: The 6-foot-5-inch tall Jones piled up 173 sacks during a 14-year career with the Los Angeles Rams, the San Diego Chargers and the Redskins.
Then there was the head slap -- the brain-jarring swipe of a defensive lineman's hand or arm against the helmet of his opponent.
Along with fellow icons Rosey Grier, Lamar Lundy and Merlin Olsen, Jones formed one of the best defensive lines of all time: the Fearsome Four.
"His eyes were as red as fire, and after he took his stance, he was pawing his leg in the dirt like a bull," remembered Rayfield Wright of his first NFL start.
And in 1999, Sports Illustrated named him the "Defensive End of the Century."
In later years, Jones worked as a radio host, served as a spokesman for the blood-pressure drug Atacand and started the Deacon Jones Foundation to mentor inner-city high school students.
