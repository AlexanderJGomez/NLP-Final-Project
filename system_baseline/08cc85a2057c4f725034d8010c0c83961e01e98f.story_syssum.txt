Golf's European Tour insisted it should be following the death of Alastair Forsyth's caddie Iain McGregor on the final day of the Madeira Islands Open Sunday.
To see that happen to someone in front of your eyes -- I don't know how or when you get over that," Forsyth told the European Tour's official website.
But while Forsyth welcomed the European Tour's decision to play on, it was a move that did not prove to be a unanimous one among the Scot's peers, with Sweden's Joel Sjoholm, who had previously worked with the caddie, leading the way, expressing his disbelief that the event had continued.
Brooks, however, was unable to bask in the glory of his maiden European Tour win, given the day's tragic events that had occurred earlier in the afternoon.
