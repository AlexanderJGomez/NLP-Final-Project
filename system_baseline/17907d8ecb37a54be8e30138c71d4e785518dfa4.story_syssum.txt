"If you ask me this question in 10 years' time I will tell you less, because two championships are more than I could dream," the Formula One driver told CNN.
A return to Renault in 2008 saw him slip from third place to fifth in the drivers' championship -- a season that will be forever remembered for the so-called "Crashgate" affair -- and a year later Alonso registered just one podium and finished ninth overall in his worst showing since debuting for Minardi in 2001.
"These were four very demanding and important days to give us something to work on over the coming days in Maranello," team principal Stefano Domenicali told Ferrari F1's official website.
"We are discovering every day new things about the car and new possibilities, so I think the potential is there," he said.
We have to be honest with that, you know, with our fans and ourselves first of all.
The flying Finn, who won his only world title driving for Ferrari in 2007, makes up one half of the most interesting Formula One pairings in recent times, and one which will test both men's skills on the track and their powers of diplomacy off it.
"I think he's very talented so that is a huge help and a huge motivation for myself first and also for the team, because the team knows it has to deliver a good car because Kimi will deliver a good result," Alonso said.
Alonso's quest for a third drivers' championship title begins in Melbourne on March 16.
