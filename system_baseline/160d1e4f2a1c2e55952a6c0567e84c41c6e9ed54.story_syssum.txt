BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) -- Flights into Thailand have been thrown into chaos Wednesday after explosions at two Bangkok airports wounded four people and triggered the closure of its main international gateway -- a major hub in the region for travelers, authorities said.
Three protesters also entered the airport's control tower, demanding the prime minister's flight schedule, The Associated Press quoted Group Capt.
The other blast occurred at 6:40 a.m. Wednesday (2340 Tuesday GMT) at the Don Muang International Airport, wounding three people, police said.
The clash started when the anti-government group People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) was mobilizing supporters near the Don Muang airport, which the government is using as its temporary office.
The case was one of several lodged against Thaksin, who protesters want to return to Thailand to face trial.
Thaksin stayed in the United Kingdom for much of this year before British authorities revoked his visa.
