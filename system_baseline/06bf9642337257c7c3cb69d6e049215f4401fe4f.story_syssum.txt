The zone has been caused by a flood of nutrients, such as agricultural fertilizers, which boost algae production in the sea.
The UN report also warned that the number will continue to increase as intensive agriculture spreads around the world and that they are already having a significant impact on commercial fish stocks.
But the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly becoming a concern for environmentalists across the world.
A huge increase in the amount of synthetic chemicals being used in the Philippines over recent years has caused substantial environmental damage to the country's water supplies, according to a 2008 report by Greenpeace.
As well as causing an increase in the algal blooms that can cause "Dead Zones," agricultural nitrates have been identified as a factor in the growth of toxic "red tide" algae and high levels in drinking water can also pose a health risk to humans, especially children.
According to Chinese state officials 10 per cent of farm land in the country is polluted posing a "severe threat" to food sources, with excessive agricultural chemical use being blamed, along with industrial effluent and solid waste.
But many environmentalists see a solution with increased incentives for organic farming, which uses fewer chemicals and, argue groups such as the UK Soil Association, with no appreciable decrease in yields.
