In Lebanon, even the most basic services are hard to come by as the small country staggers from the flow of refugees from its larger neighbor.
I met mothers and children who have witnessed unspeakable acts of violence, including the death of loved ones.
We traveled to a cement factory, where some Syrian mothers were renting tiny rooms to house their entire families.
When I asked about what happened, I was told that she became ill after playing in the factory's toxic waste.
But for the kids I met, and millions more like them all across the region, politics is the farthest thing from their minds.
UNICEF still needs $172 million this year to assist Syrian refugees across the region, which means programs to support these children are threatened.
What's at stake is an entire generation of children who are carrying the emotional and physical scars of war.
They need our help to stay alive, to go to school and to be kids again.
