The Bahraini Crown Prince, Salman bin Hamad al Khalifa, informed Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone of the decision by telephone after days of unrest in the Gulf kingdom.
"Bahrain's priority is on overcoming tragedy, healing divisions and rediscovering the fabric that draws this country together to remind the world of the very best that Bahrain is capable of as a nation once again united.
British newspaper The Times reported that it cost Bahrain race organizers $40 million to secure a place in this year's calendar, plus another $20 million to ensure it was the first of the season.
He said: "The recent situation in Bahrain has been difficult for the country.
We feel the decision taken by the Crown Prince is wise and we fully support it.
