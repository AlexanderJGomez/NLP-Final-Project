(CNN)  -- The turboprop plane that crashed in New York state, killing all 49 people on board and one on the ground, was one of the safest and most sophisticated aircraft of its type, according to an aviation industry expert.
Stressing that the cause of Thursday's crash in near Buffalo was still unclear and could be caused by mechanical failure for example, he said the potential for ice was there because it was short and the plane would have been flying at a relatively low level.
Daly said the pilot appeared not to have reported problems with icing, but this was not unusual because planes were designed to cope with these conditions.
About two minutes later, the air traffic controller came back, with stress in his voice.
Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) permanently grounded its fleet of Dash 8s after three crash landings during a two-month period in 2007 that were blamed on the aircraft's landing gear.
Air expert Daly said though that in Thursday's crash the landing gear of the Continental plane was unlikely to be down because it was far from the airport.
