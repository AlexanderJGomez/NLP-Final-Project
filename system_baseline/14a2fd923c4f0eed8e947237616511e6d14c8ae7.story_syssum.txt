Legislators in the capital of China's restive far-western Xinjiang province passed a law Wednesday to prohibit residents from wearing burqas in public, state media reported Thursday, highlighting the government's continued campaign against religious extremism.
The ts.cn story mentioned the Urumqi law was submitted to the provincial legislature for final approval before it could be implemented.
On Monday, a court in Urumqi convicted more than a dozen suspects with Uyghur-sounding names for their roles in two separate violent attacks in the city earlier this year.
Eight people were sentenced to death, while five others received suspended death sentences.
