(CNN) -- President Bush had a "relaxed" and "friendly" meeting with President-elect Barack Obama after he and first lady Laura Bush welcomed their successors to their future home Monday, a White House spokesman said.
Obama and Bush were not expected to speak on camera after their meeting.
Bush hosted President-elect Bill Clinton after the 1992 election, the two talked for nearly two hours.
"It's clear that we need to stabilize the economy, to deal with the financial meltdown that's now spreading across the rest of the economy.
Podesta said Obama will push Congress to enact "at least part" of an economic package before he takes office in January, but said the problems Americans face need short- and long-term approaches.
"When I called President-elect Obama to congratulate him on his historic victory, I told him that he can count on my complete cooperation as he makes his transition to the White House.
"I'm sure that, in addition to taking a tour of the White House, there's going to be a substantive conversation between myself and the president," he said at a news conference Friday.
He has not officially been named the incoming press secretary, but he is widely considered the top contender for the position.
Cutter said that after Laura Bush gave Michelle Obama a tour of the residence, the first lady and her successor discussed raising daughters in the White House.
