Three months earlier, over dinner, I'd learned about a doctor in Sudan's Nuba mountains, Dr. Tom Catena, who was treating thousands of people -- many of them children -- who'd had limbs blown off in the Sudanese government's bombing raids.
But when I got home and looked up Dr. Catena, I read about one of the patients he'd treated: Daniel -- a 12-year-old boy who, in attempting to protect himself from an aerial attack, wrapped his arms around a tree.
In that moment, I realized I couldn't just close the computer, get a glass of water and go to bed.
There was no way I could get my head around that.
Mind you, at the time I knew very little about 3-D printing, and even less about prosthetic arms.
The motion of the wrist (up and down) or elbow (side to side) then pulls on the cabling and draws the fingers to a close.
Despite the heat (which kept melting the printing filament) and the bugs (which kept jamming up the 3-D printer motors), I managed to get the 3-D printers working and set about making an arm ... for a real boy, now sitting five feet away from me.
Every time I got frustrated, or something wasn't working right, I just had to look over at Daniel and nothing else mattered.
He wasn't yet strong enough to make the motion that would make the hand clench -- that would come later -- but he could manipulate the hand to his mouth.
He turned back, looked at the small crowd that had gathered around him, broke into the biggest grin you'd ever seen, then went back in for more.
The big picture is just too unwieldy, too incomprehensible and seemingly immovable.
By the end of the week, I was in Sudan's Nuba Mountains where Dr. Catena's hospital continues his work.
With a steady stream of solar power, I gathered a roomful of locals -- some invited, some not -- and taught them how to 3-D print.
