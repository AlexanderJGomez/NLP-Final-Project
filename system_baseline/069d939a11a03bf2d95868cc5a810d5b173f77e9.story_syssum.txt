(CNN) -- As investigators are determining whether a skull and bones discovered behind an abandoned Central Virginia home on Saturday are those of Hannah Graham, the lone suspect in her disappearance has been indicted in an assault from almost a decade ago -- a case that police say forensically links him to another female college student who vanished from the same area as Graham.
The footage showed her leaving the Tempo Bar around 2 a.m., followed by a man investigators think to be Matthew.
As far as the skull, everything looked to be intact to me."
Furthermore, police now consider the Graham case "a death investigation," said County Police Chief Steve Sellers.
The Albemarle County Police Department said it didn't know how long it will take for the forensic results to come back.
