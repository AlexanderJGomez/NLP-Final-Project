Chantal Ka-Hor-Rury, a coffee trader and head of a collective that helps farmers bring their crop to market, is committed to helping Burundi expand its coffee industry.
Coffee accounts for 80% of Burundi's export revenues but with market prices slipping to their lowest level since 2009, according to the International Coffee Organization's index, profit margins are thin.
Mauricio Galindo, head of operations at the International Coffee Organization, said that Brazil and Colombia are the only coffee-growing countries that have successfully managed to export roasted coffee, but even then with great difficulty.
Every stage counts, according to Galindo, from the altitude at which coffee is farmed to the temperature in storage.
However, he expressed a positive outlook for the future of African coffee producers by adding: "It's only recently that we've seen the comeback of African countries, so I think there is hope, no doubt.
