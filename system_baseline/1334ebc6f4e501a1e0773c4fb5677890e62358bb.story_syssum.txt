But many were disappointed by the countless features the smart watch did not include.
At the device's glamorous launch, JK Shin, president of Samsung's IT and Mobile Division, said that the "Samsung Galaxy Gear benefits consumers by integrating smart device technology even deeper into their everyday lives, and bridges the gap between the mobile device and fashion worlds to create truly wearable technology."
Christoph Behling, lead designer for Tag Heuer watches, shared Oxholm's criticisms, saying that in his view the Galaxy Gear will not serve as a replacement for regular watches, because it is lacking in two fundamental aspects: both in its form and its function.
Behling says that Samsung's decision to tie the Galaxy Gear to a mobile phone means it cannot act as a proper cell phone substitute.
Through all the fevered commentary, technological enthusiasts continue to draw up their own visions of what a smart watch should be.
Many now rest their hopes on Apple to deliver the device they are waiting for, with countless speculative designs being proffered by the vast community of "Macolytes."
