(CNN) -- One of the oldest existing man-made structures, more than 2,000 years old and a world-travel icon that ranks alongside the pyramids of Egypt and Stonehenge -- the Great Wall of China should be on every traveler's bucket list.
DON'T spend less than two or three hours exploring the wall.
DO consider signing up for a day tour at your hotel's activities desk.
DO visit either Badaling or Mutianyu if you have mobility concerns; they both have aerial cable cars.
Apollo astronaut Alan Bean said he tried to spot it, but that no man-made object is visible once you leave the Earth's orbit.
