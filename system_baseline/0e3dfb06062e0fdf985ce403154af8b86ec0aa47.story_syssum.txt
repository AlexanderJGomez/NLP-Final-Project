Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The copyright to a home movie of Marilyn Monroe "just sitting around" with friends will be offered through an online auction this week, according to a man who found the film while researching the actress' death.
"It's a side of Marilyn that no one has ever seen before," he said.
The woman who made the film asked that CNN use only her first name, Gretchen, to protect her identity.
Gretchen retained the copyright, which Morgan is helping her sell through an eBay auction expected to begin Thursday, he said.
