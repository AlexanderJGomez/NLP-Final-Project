Now 19-year-old Yaasmeen Castanada is fighting for her life inside a California hospital's burn unit, suffering from an allergic reaction that's so severe she has large open wounds all over her body.
"When she took the medication, she started having a hard time breathing, and she told her mom that her lips were burning, her throat, her eyes, they got so red that she couldn't talk.
Her prognosis is good, even though the disease has a high mortality rate, according to Dr. Victor Joe, the center's director.
On a website created to raise funds for Castanada's care, her mother said the harrowing ordeal began soon after her daughter took the medicine.
Now, Corona says she's hoping to spread the word so others don't make the same mistake.
She also advises parents to find out what their children are allergic to -- before it's too late.
Photos on the fundraising website show Castanada lying in a hospital bed, with openings for her eyes cut from the bandages that cover her.
Mortality for those suffering from Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis can be as high as 25% in adults, but tends to be lower with early treatment, according to the Merck Manual.
"In fact, most of the time you do have some sort of side reaction to medication, just not this severe."
