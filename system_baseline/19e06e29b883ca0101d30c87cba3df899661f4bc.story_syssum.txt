Wenjian Liu was remembered Saturday at Aievoli Funeral Home in Brooklyn, where Mayor Bill de Blasio, Police Commissioner William Bratton, local officials and throngs of uniformed police officers and firefighters gathered at his wake in a sign of the diversity and unity of the nation's largest city.
On Sunday, a sea of dark blue drawn from the police forces of New York and beyond is expected to find its way to the funeral home for Liu's funeral at 11 a.m.
The message was directed at a large group that attended the funeral for Ramos last week and turned their backs on de Blasio as he gave his eulogy.
Tens of thousands had taken to the streets in the wake of the death of African-American man Eric Garner during an encounter with white officers.
"It stole the valor, honor and attention that rightfully belonged to the memory of detective Rafael Ramos's life and sacrifice," his memo read.
He expressly said there'd be no punishment for noncompliance at Liu's funeral but made sure the request was heard by all.
Before killing the two men, he had tweeted messages that he would kill police officers in the wake of the deaths of Garner and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.
Holding back tears, his father said that as a young officer, Liu once bought a meal for someone he pulled over before guiding him home, he told the Daily News.
His widow gave a brief statement on the day of Ramos' funeral, thanking members of the community for their support and sending condolences to the Ramos family.
More than 25,000 police officers from across the country and Canada attended.
