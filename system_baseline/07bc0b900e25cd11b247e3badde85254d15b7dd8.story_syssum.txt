Park officials used 10 tracking dogs to hunt for the brazen black bear, which wandered into a heavily-populated campsite overnight.
Officials had said earlier they would have to kill the bear, pointing to the bold and aggressive behavior it exhibited when it wandered into the site with so many campers.
The teenager was taken to a hospital in nearby Leadville, Colorado, Hampton said.
The boy, identified as 13-year-old Rick Voss, told CNN affiliate KUSA that the bear stop attacking him and ran after another camper who ran away.
Hampton estimated that there are 12,000 black bears on Colorado's 23 million acres of public land.
