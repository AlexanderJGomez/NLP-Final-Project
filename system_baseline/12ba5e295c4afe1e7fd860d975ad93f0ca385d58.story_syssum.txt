It sure would be handy to request an emergency ammo drop from the black-helicopter guys.
It would be no trouble to traverse that distance if there weren't eight feet of snow piled outside your door.
Yes, wireless networks often go down during disasters, but they also can come back online (at least in spots) before power has been restored to buildings.
So your nasty neighbor who won't share his drinking water might be chatting away to his daughter in Seattle while you're kicking yourself for not powering down your phone two days before.
Joire noted, "It's very refreshing to have a phone in your car that can only do three things: make calls, do text messages and set alarms.
The Motofone F3 is a very thin (about 9mm thick) candy bar-style phone with a small e-ink display -- a technology with extremely low power requirements, since it mostly draws power only when the screen changes.
According to Joire, the phone's lithium ion battery "lasts for a month or more on standby, with something like 200 hours of talk time."
While there's no official cell service in remote Black Rock City, some attendees may set up ad-hoc wireless networks.
Joire tweets at Twitter/tnkgrl, and you can tweet via text message, so it's possible she may tweet from Burning Man via her F3.
Consult local, state and federal emergency preparedness agencies to find out which numbers you should program into the phone, for both calls and texting.
Better to give them a head start early than a head shot later.
