(CNN) -- Lego boss Jorgen Vig Knudstorp, who pulled the iconic toy brand back into profit, says Europe needs to face up to its harsh economic reality.
"I think we are moving from a 30 year period of just borrowing more and more money at the government level and also at the household level," Knudstorp says.
At Lego, Knudstorp will be focused on ensuring the company adapts to the changing economic conditions, which he believes are crucial to ensure survival.
"A lot of productivity is lost inside the company when things get complicated."
