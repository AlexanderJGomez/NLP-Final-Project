Hassan Rouhani, who won the presidency over the weekend, said in his first news conference Monday, however, that the Islamic republic has no intention of ending its uranium-enrichment program.
Even in the West, they are facing economic problems and dilemmas, and they themselves know the sanctions are to the detriment of the West," Rouhani said, adding that Israel was the only country benefiting from them.
Rouhani did not elaborate on how he would make the country's nuclear program more transparent, but he insisted that the Iranian nuclear program was lawful.
After his victory was announced over the weekend, Rouhani spoke of reforms without threatening Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, or the country's institutions -- of which he is a product.
As a former nuclear negotiator, he said, he would reduce the high tension between Iran and the outside world by addressing the sanctions.
That distinction belongs to Khamenei, who has been Iran's supreme leader since 1989.
While he has represented Khamenei on Iran's security council since 1989, he has avoided being perceived as a pushover and has taken exception with the supreme leader on being too rigid toward the international community, according to an Iranian scholar at Stanford University.
Nor did they include Ahmadinejad's aide and protege Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, who was among those excluded by the Guardian Council.
