The freshman comedy, about a successful African-American family man's struggle with cultural identity, made its debut on the network Wednesday night to impressive ratings.
"I guess for a kid from the 'hood, I'm living the American dream," Anderson's Dre says in an opening voiceover.
And at work, Dre is faced with eye-rolling questions from colleagues on "how a black man would say good morning," and the possibility that he was promoted to head the agency's "urban" division because of his race.
"Even in a better season, ABC's provocative and very funny 'Black-ish' would stand out for its broad and biting satire of an uneasily post-racial society seen through a very modern-family prism," said TV Guide.
As one of the few comedies on a major network with a predominantly African-American cast, it has to navigate the issue of race in America.
'Black-ish's' nuance is promising -- it's aware that there's not just one way to be black -- and the sheer level of execution suggests it has staying power," he said.
