(CNN) -- Early Sunday, a massive fire at the Kiss nightclub in southern Brazil killed more than 200 people.
The commercial director of the facility, who was accused of ignoring safety measures, fled Russia to Spain, where he was arrested in September of the following year.
Nearly five years later, the country's Court of Justice sentenced the club owner to 20 years in prison.
Authorities said the Utopia club had no license to operate, no sprinklers and poorly marked exits.
Most of the victims were revelers suffocated by smoke.
