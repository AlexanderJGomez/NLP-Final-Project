Michael Martin, the House of Commons Speaker, has tendered his resignation.
He proposed a review of expense claims of the past few years by an independent panel, and the introduction of an outside agency to regulate expense reimbursements, which Parliament currently does itself.
Brown also paid tribute to Martin and added that he had chaired a meeting of party leaders Tuesday afternoon to discuss an overhaul of the expenses system.
But part of the reason MPs are now focusing their anger on Martin is that his office also handles expense claims.
The governing Labour Party also cut ties with MP Elliot Morley, a former Cabinet minister, over his expense claims.
London's Metropolitan Police announced shortly before Martin's resignation that they would not investigate the leaking of the expense reports to the press.
"The leak of documents is not something that the (Metropolitan Police) would condone," they said in a statement, but felt it was unlikely they would obtain the evidence they need to launch a successful prosecution.
