(CNN) -- World number one Serena Williams put her recent controversies to one side as she cruised past Mandy Minella of Luxembourg 6-1 6-3 in the first round at Wimbledon.
The past week certainly hasn't been as smooth as Serena would have liked after becoming embroiled in a row with Maria Sharapova and having to defend comments made in an article that appeared in Rolling Stone magazine.
The American has since apologized to the Russian after the article included a veiled reference to the latter's relationship with Bulgarian player Grigor Dimitrov in addition to controversial comments about the rape of a 16-year-old girl in Ohio.
The 16-time grand slam winner is in the form of her life at the age of 31 and may be reassessing how long she has left at the top following the feats of Kimiko Date-Krumm, who Williams could meet in the third round.
But if I do too much, I feel tired," she said.
In other highlights on Tuesday, the home crowd had a match to savor on Court One as 19-year-old Briton Laura Robson knocked out tenth seed Maria Kirilenko, who made the quarterfinals last year.
