For most of my career in the Navy, I lived two lives and went to work each day wondering if that would be my last.
So many simple things that straight people take for granted could have ended my career, even a comment such as "My partner and I went to the movies last night."
I didn't want to have to lie about who Lynne was or have someone conclude that we were more than casual friends.
77 slammed into the Pentagon and destroyed the exact space I had left less than eight minutes earlier, killing seven of my colleagues.
During that process, we realized that the "don't ask, don't tell" policy was causing us to make a much bigger sacrifice than either of us had ever admitted.
I have every confidence that our military will easily adjust to this change and that with strong leadership, we will ultimately be stronger and better for it.
I have great love and respect for our country, but I know we can do better than "don't ask, don't tell."
