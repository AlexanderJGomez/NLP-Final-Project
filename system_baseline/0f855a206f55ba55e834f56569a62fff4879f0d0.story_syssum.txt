Wainstein was hired this year by UNC to do another internal investigation, since past investigations pinning the sole blame on Nyang'oro have not satisfied questions and curiosity from the community and from critics of UNC who think the scope of the fake classes was much bigger than UNC admits.
That all makes the cooperation of Nyang'oro a game-changer in the quest to find answers, and Woodall said last week that is the reason he had been considering dropping the charges.
But in the last few months, a flurry of reporting has called that into question.
Wainstein said last week that his team has so far collected 1.5 million e-mails and documents, talked to 30 people in the athletic-academic areas of UNC and is looking at athlete transcripts going back to the 1980s.
"...Theres no doubt in my mind about cooperation of friendly faculty and the cover-up and the excuses of this kind of behavior that has gone on in the university.
"It's quite likely that if it is shown that this is a long-term systematic scheme on the part of the university that UNC will need to vacate wins," Gurney said.
