(CNN) -- Germany's government has asked America's top spy chief stationed in the country to leave.
A German official confirmed that person was the CIA's station chief and that the agency's director, John Brennan, has talked multiple times with his German counterpart.
He based his remarks on the essential value of Germany's cooperation with U.S. intelligence agencies to fight international terrorism and complained that spying spoils the relationship.
The NSA scandal has also prompted prosecutors to set up a new special committee to investigate and criminally prosecute cyberspying by foreign intelligence.
To understand Germany's particular hurt over spying allegations, one need only to look at the country's history in the 20th century, when oppressive fascist and communist regimes spied on citizens in order to persecute them.
As a result of the Nazi past, democratic, postwar Germany has instituted very strict privacy laws that prohibit government agencies, companies and private individuals from gathering or passing even simple information about citizens without their express consent.
Otherwise, administration officials have countered their German counterparts' candor with lips as sealed as those at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.
