Walker said a woman, about 20 to 25 years old, dropped off Jenkins at the motel on Friday in a silver Chrysler PT Cruiser with Alberta tags.
Earlier Sunday, Canadian authorities said they had credible information that Jenkins was in Canada and called on him to turn himself in.
Law enforcement sources have told CNN that Fiore was identified through the serial numbers on her breast implants.
According to court records in Las Vegas, Nevada, Jenkins was charged in June with battery for allegedly striking Fiore in the arm with his fist.
51Minds, which produced "Megan Wants a Millionaire," said Thursday in a written statement that it "was not aware of Ryan Jenkins' record when it cast him.
51 Minds is investigating what went wrong and taking steps to ensure that this sort of lapse never occurs again."
