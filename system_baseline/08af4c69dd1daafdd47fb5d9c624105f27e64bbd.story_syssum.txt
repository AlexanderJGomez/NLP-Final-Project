"It is a very serious case and a very serious incident and we are going to do our best to get to the bottom of it," Dunkley told reporters Wednesday afternoon.
Authorities have been investigating the death of Guang Hua Liu, whose body parts were found in mid-August in several places.
Wednesday's discovery of the suitcase came one week after a woman's torso was found in the Canadian portion of the Niagara River.
The Niagara River case is not related to Liu's death, police have said.
