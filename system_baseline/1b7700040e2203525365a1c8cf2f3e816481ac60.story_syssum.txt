But less than 90 minutes after it started, Ukrainian officials reported  mortar shelling at a military post near Zolote in the Luhansk region.
Ceasefire monitors said they were blocked from traveling into the town.
In a statement, defense spokesman Andriy Lysenko said that since the beginning of the ceasefire, "enemy forces" initiated fire from artillery, grenade launchers, mortars and small arms against Ukrainian military positions in the area near the towns of Debaltseve and Shyrokine.
The peace agreement signed in Minsk, Belarus, comes with questions over how it will be implemented and whether it will stick.
Shelling rocked two eastern Ukrainian cities Saturday ahead of the ceasefire, raising fears that the deal to end the bitter conflict might be in jeopardy.
Under the deal, both sides were expected to start pulling back their heavy weapons from the front lines Monday, creating a buffer zone at least 50 kilometers (31 miles) wide.
However, Svyatoslav Tsegolko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian president, said that those responsible for shooting down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine last summer will not be given amnesty under the Minsk agreement.
The Kremlin has said it hopes to see the latest peace plan succeed, but reiterated Russia "is not a participant" in the conflict.
