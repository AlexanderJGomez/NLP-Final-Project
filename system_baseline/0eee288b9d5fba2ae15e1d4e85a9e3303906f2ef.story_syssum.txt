The New York police's story -- as related by spokesman Christopher Pisano -- is that officers were called Thursday to her abode in Manhattan's theater district after her building manager reported the 27-year-old was smoking an "illegal substance" in the lobby.
Her story is that she was "sexually harassed by one of the cops the night before last" -- the same police officer who, she wrote, ended up arresting her.
"The cop sexually harassed me, they found no pot on me or bong outside my window," Bynes tweeted.
She has a DUI case pending in Southern California, while a pair of separate hit-and-run incidents against her were dismissed late last year.
Earlier this month, the actress was sentenced to three years probation for driving on a suspended license.
