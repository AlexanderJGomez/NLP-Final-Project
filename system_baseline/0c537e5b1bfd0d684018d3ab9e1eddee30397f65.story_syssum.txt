If he does so, the celebrations will come with four races to go -- putting Vettel narrowly behind his legendary compatriot Michael Schumacher, who set the standard in 2002 when he clinched the fifth of his record seven world titles with six of the 17 races remaining.

And in this respect we have had a terrific year so far and I hope it will not desert us for the final races."
The climax to the 2011 season is in stark contrast to last year's finale, when Vettel leaped from third position heading into the final race at the Yas Marina Circuit to overhaul teammate Mark Webber and Ferrari's two-time world champion Fernando Alonso to claim glory.
"I think it will be a great race for everyone," said Button, who recently signed a new deal with English-based McLaren.
If Vettel fails to clinch the championship this weekend, the title race would roll on to the Korean Grand Prix on October 16.
