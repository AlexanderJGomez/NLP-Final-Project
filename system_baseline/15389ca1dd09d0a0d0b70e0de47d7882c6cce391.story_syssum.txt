Cuomo called for a "societal deep breath" and a "cooling off period" this week in a radio interview Monday on New York's WNYC, calling the heated, inflammatory rhetoric that engulfed the city this weekend unproductive.
Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani tied the police murders to "intense, anti-police hatred" among leaders and activists reacting to the non-indictment of two white police officers who killed two unarmed black men in separate instances this summer.
"I think Mayor de Blasio is doing the best he can under very difficult circumstances to hear all sides of the matter.
You have two different points of view that right now are seemingly irreconcilable."
Cuomo added that "there are legitimate points" in Garner's case.
