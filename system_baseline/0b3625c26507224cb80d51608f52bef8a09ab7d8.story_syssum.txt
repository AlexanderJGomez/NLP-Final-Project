LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Perhaps Ryan Seacrest said it best at the top of the "American Idol" Tuesday night when describing Adam Lambert and Kris Allen, the show's final two contestants.
"I think 'Mad World' is kind of symbolic," Lambert told reporters after the show.
Round two featured a tune hand-picked by "American Idol" creator Simon Fuller, where Lambert ditched the black overcoat and belted out Sam Cooke's "A Change Is Gonna Come" while sporting a shiny silver suit.
Cowell told the 27-year-old afterward that "you have been one of the best, most original contestants we've ever had on the show."

"He's always giving me stuff to change about mine ... to make it better," Allen told reporters.
Allen and Lambert will return to the stage Wednesday night and find out, along with the rest of the world, who will be crowned the next "American Idol" at the two-hour finale.
