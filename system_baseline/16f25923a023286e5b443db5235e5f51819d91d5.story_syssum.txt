The ban would have applied to restaurants, movie theaters, stadiums and mobile food carts.
Mayor Michael Bloomberg's proposal was met with fierce opposition by the industry and public outrage at the loss of "liberty," the so-called "nanny state" run amok.
No one would disagree that government should act, but how?
Second, sugar is high in calories, promotes fat storage in the body and is addictive, so people want more.
Those who cry "nanny state" in response to almost any modern public health measure (think food, alcohol, firearms, distracted driving) demand a standard of proof that lawmakers don't have to meet in any other field.
He went so far as to call the ban "fraught with arbitrary and capricious consequences" and filled with loopholes.
Bloomberg did what every other politician does: balance public health and safety with realpolitik.
It assumes that unless public health does everything, it can do nothing.
In any event, the Board of Health has authority over the food supply and chronic disease, which is exactly what it has used in this case.
The fingerprints of the food and restaurant industries, with their clear economic conflicts of interest, are all over the public and judicial campaign to block the soda ban.
We are used to fierce lobbying for personal gain in America, but that doesn't mean we should be duped by industry propaganda.
There is really no great burden posed on individuals, only a little nudge in the right direction.
