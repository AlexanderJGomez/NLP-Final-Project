If you're a business traveler in Europe, you'll no doubt have complained at length about the regions' airlines, be it the cost of a plane ticket, the quality of the food or the delays.
Tyler argues this disparity is in part down to sluggish economic growth in Europe; crucially, however, it can also be impacted by what he calls "onerous" EU regulation and legislation.
The additional costs don't end there either: air traffic control costs are roughly double in Europe than they are in the United States.
"Just look at what's happening now in Spain with Iberia for example; very difficult to do the necessary restructuring in that environment".
He argues they can start by helping to control cost, by adding more runways, and repelling "some of the excessively onerous consumer protection regulation."
