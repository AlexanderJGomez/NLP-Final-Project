We want to hear more.
Romney would agree with the president's current foreign policy, then attack him on the same foreign policies that he just agreed with, then present his own foreign policy, that amazingly is exactly the same as the president's.
On Syria, Romney has cried that we are not doing enough.
And Mitt said again it was the wrong course to take.
The GOP nominated the worst candidate in history.
Romney gave long answers but ended up agreeing with President Obama on most points.
That when Romney is snarky and aggressive, the Repubs loved it and said it made him presidential, but when President Obama pushes back it makes him look snarky, aggressive and un-presidential!
Romney does sweat!
Editor's note: It's not every day that DJ Casper's "The Cha-Cha Slide" is cited as a critique of a presidential candidate's positions.
He failed for 4 straight years.
Obama spoke for 1 hour, 30 minutes without saying a word.
Romney talks more presidential.
UNEMPLOYMENT remains near 8% ... and Obama has had 4 years to fix it ...
This president hasn't even passed a budget in over 3 YEARS ...
Syria is a mess, Egypt is a mess, Iran is on the verge of NUKES ...and in Benghazi, Libya, this administration played politics and attempted to COVER UP to avoid political damage!
