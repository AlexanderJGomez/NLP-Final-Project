It's a look that has been sought after by some of the world's leading ladies, from style icon Jackie Onassis to actress Renee Zellweger and comedian Tina Fey, who stepped out in a navy Herrera gown at this year's Oscars.
Here, Herrera speaks exclusively to CNN about style, business, family and getting ahead in a man's world.
You might be the best designer and you are so creative and new, have the most beautiful ideas, but if they all stay in your room and they don't go out to be worn by someone, then you are not in business.
I have a team, a fantastic president who takes care of the numbers of the company.
You have to have somebody very capable to run the business side.
But a style is something that you do that is totally different from the other or something that you're wearing that is the same as the other person but it looks different on you.
I see my husband say 'why are you doing all these at the same time?
Because women, we are able to do that.
You can be dressed by Carolina Herrera New York, but you can have the accessories from CH and it's like a lifestyle.
Sometimes you see women that don't realize that age is changing your style, and they don't change.
The white shirt is one of the easiest things to wear, because you can dress it up or you can wear it with jeans or you can wear it with a ball gown.
When I don't know what to wear, I say a white blouse.
The inspiration comes from things that you have seen all your life.
That means fashion is a repetition of ideas.
Second you have to remember that it's not going to be easy.
You have to do it even if it doesn't work and you have to keep going.
