Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN)At least 15 people, including two members of Parliament and a deputy mayor, were killed Friday when militants attacked a hotel frequented by government officials in the heart of Somalia's capital, police said.
"I saw ... several people burned by the flames of the explosions lying on the blood-filled ground inside the hotel," said Mustaf Mohamed, who runs a small shop nearby.
Since emerging in the mid-2000s, Al-Shabaab has been intent on taking control of Somalia, one of the world's poorest countries, with a gross domestic product per person that ranks 226th out of 228 countries.
The Somali government, helped by allies including the United States and African Union, has managed to strike significant blows against the group, including a 2014 U.S. operation that killed Godane.
But Al-Shabaab has continued its campaign of violence in attacks such as a suicide blast last month on a Somali army convoy in Mogadishu, the bombing of a bus carrying Kenyan teachers in Galkayo, Somalia, and an attack on an African Union military base.
