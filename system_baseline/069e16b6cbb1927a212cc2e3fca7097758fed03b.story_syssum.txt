Sure, the metaphor has a perfection all its own, given Romney's penchant for redrawing policy lines.
But the picture of two "serious" presidential candidates wandering the trail with an old-school toy as a prop can lead to only one conclusion: This is getting silly.
If this were another time, the establishment power brokers would step in with a vision.
Then they would take to the airwaves and offer their full-throated endorsements, turning their attention to seeking the defeat of President Obama.
And tea party favorite Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, stops short of endorsing Romney but grudgingly allows that "I think we all need to look at this presidential primary and encourage the candidates to do a little self-reflection here -- what's good for our country."
The super PACÂ sugar daddies -- simply by virtue of their money -- are the reason the campaigns continue.
Party organizations can't deliver them anymore, and Romney isn't exactly the guy they were wishing for when the tea party came on the scene in 2010.
The establishment is in disrepute as far as they're concerned; those are the people who bungled the economy.
Yet the final decisions will have to come from the men running.
But here's the final consideration: "You don't want the blame for losing," Cole says.
After Super Tuesday, he saw the handwriting on the wall and embraced John McCain.
Knowing how to lose is the hardest part of running.
