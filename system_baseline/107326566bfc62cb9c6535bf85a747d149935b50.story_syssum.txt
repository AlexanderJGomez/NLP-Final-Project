The ousted President was convicted on charges of violence and inciting violence and sentenced to 20 years in prison for the torture of protesters outside the presidential palace in December 2012.
But Ramy Ghanem, a civil plaintiff lawyer representing one of the torture victims, said the conviction was fair.
Hoda Nasrallah, a lawyer representing two torture victims, called the outcome of the case typical for Egypt.
We wish we could see the trial of a regime when it is in power, not after that."
At various points in the trial, Morsy said that he was still the President of Egypt and refused to recognize the court as legal.
Attorney Mohamed Selim El-Awa cited constitutional articles to the court that stipulated the steps for removing a president and putting him on trial -- something that required the approval of two-thirds of the parliament and a special court made of the country's top judges.
But by reaching the court, the court examined the documents from the legal aspect and saw that they were innocent of accusations of murder and guilty of other charges.
In that trial, Morsy and his 130 co-defendants, who include 71 Palestinians tried in absentia, are accused of collaborating with the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas and the Lebanese Shia group Hezbollah to break into several prisons across Egypt in January 2011 and facilitating the escape of Morsy and 20,000 others.
In May, Morsy is scheduled to start a fifth trial -- this one on charges of insulting the judiciary.
