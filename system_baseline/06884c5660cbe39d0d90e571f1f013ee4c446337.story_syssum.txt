The three-point margin falls within the poll's sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points, meaning the two candidates are statistically tied less than two weeks before Election Day.
In the Senate race, CNN Director Keating Holland said Nunn's ability to make the race competitive in a reliably red state -- no Democrat has won a statewide election in more than a decade -- is a surprising show of strength.
Nunn has a particular advantage over Perdue among likely women voters, 56%-38%, and among likely voters who live in the all-important suburbs that dominate much of the state's political scene, Holland added.
But the poll's likely voter model can only estimate the November electorate, as a runoff election can draw a smaller and different crowd than the general election.
