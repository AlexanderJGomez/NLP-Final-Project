(CNN) -- Among the entertainers who have donated their energies to the USO in recent years are Stephen Colbert, Jon Stewart, Scarlett Johansson, Kid Rock, Queensryche, Toby Keith, Lewis Black and Robin Williams.
The "Colbert Report" host, who has attested to his interest in Iraq in such venues as Newsweek magazine (he was a guest editor last month), expressed interest in going, a request that made its way up the chain of command to Gen. David Petraeus, the former leader of coalition forces in Iraq.
"We try to keep our footprint small," she said, noting that the organization is reliant on the military to feed and house its guests.
"We're primarily a volunteer organization," he said, noting the USO has fewer than 400 paid employees and 25,000 volunteers.
Jamie Masada, the owner of Los Angeles' Laugh Factory comedy club, said the organization is close to his heart.
The group was given advice from several notable comedians, including Tom Dreesen and Paul Rodriguez, and the winner received cash, gift certificates and a performance at the club, complete with name on the marquee.
"There aren't enough words to describe just how grateful I am to our nation's troops," said Keith in a press release before this year's tour.
At its core, Phillips said, the USO remains dedicated to the needs of U.S. service members.
