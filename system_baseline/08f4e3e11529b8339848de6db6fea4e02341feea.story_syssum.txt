In experiments with the material in shrimp shells, called chitosan, and material from silk, known as fibroin, researchers at Harvard's Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering put the two together at a nano level.
"We can get the range of different properties of plastics by changing how we fabricate these."
Shrilk, on the other hand, is fully biodegradable, says Ingber -- a necessity if the product is to succeed.
There's plenty of raw material, says Ingber -- the seafood industry has so much shrimp shell discard "that they have to pay to get it cleared away sometimes" -- but there's still a ways to go.
"They are so rich in nutrients that you could put seeds in them, just in the broken down material, and a plant will grow," says Ingber.
