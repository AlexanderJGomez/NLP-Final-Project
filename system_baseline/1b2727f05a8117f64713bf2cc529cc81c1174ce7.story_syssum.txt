Altemus, who was chief engineer at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, believed the agency was under "incredible pressure and scrutiny" for allegedly high budget costs.
"The environment was a sense of uncertainty and chaos and redirection," Altemus told CNN last week on the phone.
The conversation that followed, the engineer said, was a "moment of inspiration -- instigated by my son."
"I said, 'What if we unleashed the power of engineering, and did things our way, and were not deterred?
Altemus then took his crusade to a higher level, briefing officials at NASA headquarters.
All we had was this commitment to do engineering in a lean, affordable way."
At first, "a whole lot of political fallout came trying to squash the project," Altemus said.
But it resulted in an offshoot project called the Morpheus planetary lander.
Mainly Morpheus serves as a testing platform for new technologies that could take both unmanned and manned spacecraft to other worlds.
"The technologies demonstrated on Morpheus are directly applicable to future robotic, and eventually human missions," Morpheus Project Manager Jon Olansen told CNN via e-mail.
Today, the latest version of the Morpheus lander "is a centerpiece for the agency to show what a fantastic team it is, and what incredible things can be done with just sheer willpower to imagine," said Altemus, who in 2013 ended a 25-year career at NASA to start an engineering products business based on space technology.
It opens up areas for exploration that were once considered too dangerous even for robotic landings -- like the north and south poles of the moon, which are riddled with craters.
Amazingly, NASA planners hope to design a robot spacecraft that would capture an asteroid and haul it into a stable orbit near the moon.
"If there's water in the soil you would harvest the water and break down the water into oxygen and hydrogen.
As long as there are planets in the sky that are unreachable, somebody's going to try to reach them."
