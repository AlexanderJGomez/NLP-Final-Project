Bradley Manning, suspected of leaking classified information to the WikiLeaks website, is being moved to the Joint Regional Correctional Facility at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, defense officials said Tuesday.
Among those arrested at a demonstration protesting Manning's conditions last month were Daniel Ellsberg, who leaked the Pentagon Papers in 1971 to the New York Times and retired U.S. Army Col. Ann Wright who resigned to protest the U.S. invasion of Iraq.
Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, released a statement Tuesday after news of Manning's pending transfer broke, promising to demand written assurances from Defense Department officials that Manning's rights will be protected.
Last month, the Army notified Manning that he faces 22 more charges in connection with the alleged downloading of secret information from computers in Iraq, bringing to 34 the total charges in the case.
A statement from the Army said the prosecution team "has notified the defense that the prosecution will not recommend the death penalty," but technically it is up to the commander overseeing the case to make the final decision.
