A day after the first protest blaze was put out, prisoners in the same prison once again set fires in the dormitories, this time injuring 42, according to the semi-official Anatolian Agency.
The latest prison fire occurred Tuesday in the southern province of Karaman.
Ultimately, we were 14 people living in the room," said Cemal Babaoglu, who spent three months in the prison last year awaiting trial.
But Turkdogan maintains that 41% of all prisoners in Turkey are either awaiting trial or a decision from an appellate court, a situation made more problematic, he says, by the fact that over half of appealed convictions are eventually overturned.
Experts who are in the best position to identify and prevent hazardous conditions are thus unable to make firsthand observations, reducing pressure that might otherwise accelerate improvements to basic necessities such as medical care and infrastructure.
After his requests for a transfer were denied, an inmate who lit himself on fire in protest of living conditions died in July 2010.
