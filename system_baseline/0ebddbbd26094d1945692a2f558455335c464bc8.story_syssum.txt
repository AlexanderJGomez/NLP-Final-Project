Both Labour and the ruling Conservatives have for the past few years had to defend their policies on Europe and immigration.
Westminster is controlled by the three main parties, with a smattering of seats going to regional parties from the far reaches of the UK, and just one to the Green Party.

Geert Wilders' PVV, in the Netherlands, appear to have lost votes, but not seats.
It should also be noted that the far, far right British party, the BNP, lost both of their MEPs and will have none in the new parliament.
