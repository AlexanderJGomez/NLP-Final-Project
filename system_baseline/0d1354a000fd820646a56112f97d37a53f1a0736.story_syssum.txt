We may have seen the bodies of the dead scattered across the Eastern Ukrainian countryside, distorted, rotting, a dog running from the crash site with something in its mouth.
And we joined the OSCE monitors as they gathered around the train being used to transport the dead from this militia controlled so called Republic, and balked with them at the stench, the hacking, repulsive, gut wrenching smell as the refrigerated train door opened to reveal desperate, bagged and reeking cargo.
But standing in front of a family who lost two of their children, ten year old Miguel and nineteen year old Shaka Calehr.
As journalists we are often fickle and fleeting in our gaze, but we remain proud and committed to impartiality.
We stood together, in front of the camera and then behind it, and we mourned too.
