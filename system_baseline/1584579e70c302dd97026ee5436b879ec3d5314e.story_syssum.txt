(CNN)The greatest sports franchises in the world all share one thing in common: superfans so passionate they will travel far and wide to watch their teams exult in victory.
Instead, the Knicks are on course to have their worst season in franchise history with a 5 -- 36 record at the halfway mark.
"If it were possible I would have left the team about 10 years ago," he says, referring to an era that included crippling player contracts along with an in-house sexual harassment charge against then-coach and general manager Isiah Thomas.
In London, he will attend his first English Premier League football match at his adopted team of Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday.
Rather than sport a lucky jersey like most super fans, Doyle wears an unlucky jersey, Carmelo Anthony's number 7, which he bought after the third game of the season when the Knicks had a record of 2-1.
After talking it over with his sister Kelly, a life coach in Charlotte, North Carolina, Doyle paid $3,500 for a season's worth of middle-tier corner seats at Madison Square Garden and began plotting his six month odyssey.
Doyle, who says there was "an element of relief" in getting fired, is using the time off to hone his writing skills on his travel blog and has already signed with a book agent.
Although the Knicks often trail by double figures early (the Bucks took a 14-0 lead on Thursday, and were ahead by 20 points in the second quarter), Doyle says he tries to remain focused at least until the end of the third quarter.
"At a certain point, it's like watching a small animal get tortured and there's no reason to continue to subject myself to that kind of pain," he says.
"That's a lot more hardcore than I am," says Ziad Al-Essa, a 35-year-old Milwaukee Bucks faithful, who flew in from Kuwait and spent $750 on a floor seat to see the London game.
"I don't think I'll be able to afford it," he shrugs.
