There were three children -- all cousins -- at the home at the time of the incident,  said Detroit Deputy Chief Rodney Johnson.
There was an adult present in the house, but that person was a family friend and unrelated to the children, Johnson said.
In New Orleans, a 5-year-old girl died June 23 after she came into contact with a .38-caliber revolver and accidentally shot herself in the head while her mother was at a store, police said.
According to the Centers for Disease Control's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, 703 children under the age of 15 died in accidental firearms deaths between 2001 and 2010, the latest year for which data are available.
