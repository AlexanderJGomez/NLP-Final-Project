Forget feature wall, think feature fossil -- and a 17-meter long one, at that.
Author and painter Errol Fuller, who is curating the exhibition and sale, says Misty was found in 2009 by the then 11 and 14-year-old sons of paleontologist Raimund Albersdoerfer.
She was named Misty, Fuller said, after the site itself was branded the "mysterious quarry" because it had gone from being an area of which not much had been expected to one of great potential.
It would take two or three people about a day to take it down and another to put it up again and Summers Place could arrange supervision of this, Fuller said.
Designing it, he said, would have been "a conceptual puzzle" because the skeleton couldn't be arranged without the armature and it was hard to design the armature without knowing the exact size it needed to be.
There are quite a lot of safety considerations because you don't want pieces falling off."
Evolution will open for viewing on November 23, ahead of the November 27 auction.
