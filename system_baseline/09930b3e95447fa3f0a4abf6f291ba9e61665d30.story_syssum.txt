So is it any wonder that within hours of Warner Bros. announcing the actor was going to play Batman in the upcoming "Man of Steel" sequel, Twitter immediately tried to recast the part using the hashtag #BetterBatmanThanBenAffleck.
He recovered from that valley slowly but surely, and went on to direct and star in standouts like 2010's "The Town" and 2012's "Argo," the latter of which won an Oscar for best picture.
"He has the acting chops to create a layered portrayal of a man who is older and wiser than Clark Kent and bears the scars of a seasoned crime fighter, but retain the charm that the world sees in billionaire Bruce Wayne."
... (A)fter more than a year of rumors and speculation that he would be directing their Justice League ensemble (movie) and/or possibly playing the Caped Crusader in it, this seems to be an equally interesting announcement."
That idea is probably making several Bruce Wayne fans cringe as they hurry to sign a petition begging Warner Bros. to drop Affleck from the role.
