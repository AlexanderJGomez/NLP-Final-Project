I couldn't figure out why we could only do one week or one night," says the 63-year-old Warfield, who escorts tours through the spooky mansion all year, even when summer is in full swing.
For those who relish the macabre and dressing up, October 31 doesn't have to spell the end of the fright season.
Being a year-round operation gives the massive store, which also houses a warehouse for its online business, an edge over the flurry of temporary shops that pop up during the Halloween season.
"I don't think it's everywhere but I do see more and more types of retailers carrying this type of product in the off-season."
Patrick Konopelski, president of the Haunted Attraction Association, an organization representing more than 2,500 haunts, links the ever-growing popularity of Halloween to the desire to be entertained.
It just isn't financially feasible for large attractions, which can be expensive to run, to stay open all year, Konopelski says.
Up to a dozen people might help out around Halloween, but for the rest of the year, he's a one-man show.
Standing in the parlor, he begins telling the history of the house of horrors in his gravelly voice.
I hope to be doing this when I'm 95 years old."
