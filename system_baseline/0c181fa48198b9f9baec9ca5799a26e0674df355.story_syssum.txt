''The second explosion happened at 8:17 a.m. outside the Governorate Building where a suicide bomber blew up a car bomb loaded with 500 kg of explosive material," the Interior Ministry said in a statement.
The blasts highlight the escalating crisis in Aleppo, Syria's most populous city, which has morphed into a major battleground between government and rebel forces.
Opposition groups later reported that "a number of regime forces" had been killed following the shelling of a Syrian military center near the town of Tal Abyad.
At least five people were killed and 10 injured when a shell landed on a house in the Turkish town of Akcakale, near the Syrian border, the town's mayor said Wednesday.
The United Kingdom will provide an additional 1 million pounds ($1.6 million) to help Syrian refugees through the Turkish winter, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said Wednesday.
The supplies this extra funding will deliver will go some way to helping them through this difficult time," Clegg said in a written statement.
