With violence raging throughout the country as French and Malian forces fought to take back control of areas seized by Islamist rebels earlier this month, we had no time to waste.
But we're working together with local authorities, U.N. agencies and nongovernmental organization partners to gain access to previously unreachable areas and ensure that critical health and nutrition needs are being met.
Most of the town's residents had returned by the time we were allowed in to assess critical needs, and life was beginning to return to normal.
Similar threats of unexploded ordinances and remnants of Islamist rebels will persist throughout Mali, even as military operations begin to wind down.
The town's school remains closed, but health and nutrition services have started reopening with the support of local NGOs.
Timbuktu is one of the three northern regions controlled by Islamist rebel groups since an April 2012 coup that effectively split Mali into two.
To help us help the estimated 4.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in Mali, donate to our emergency response fund.
