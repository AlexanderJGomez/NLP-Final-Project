The league said the agreement with You Can Play cements pro hockey's reputation as the world's most inclusive sports league.
The move doesn't affect the NHL's policy on discrimination based on sexual orientation, which has been part of its contract with players since 2005.
But the league ran into criticism from New York's attorney general, among others, in February after NFL prospects said that they had been asked questions about their sexual orientation.
You Can Play was co-founded in 2012 by Philadelphia Flyers scout Patrick Burke, the son of hockey executive Brian Burke.
