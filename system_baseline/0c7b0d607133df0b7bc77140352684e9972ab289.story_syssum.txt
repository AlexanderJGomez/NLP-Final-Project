(InStyle) -- On August 25th, Claudia Schiffer -- the youngest of the crop of so-called "original supermodels" who made their mark on fashion in the late 1980s and early 1990s -- will turn the big 4-0.
She represented Nars, Ralph Lauren, and Prada, appeared in music videos for Madonna, Michael Jackson, and the Notorious B.I.G., and dated Mike Tyson, Robert DeNiro, and Eric Clapton.
A face of Revlon, Donna Karan, and Versace, she famously told a reporter in 1990 that she and her supermodel colleagues "don't get out of bed for less than $10,000 a day."
Then: A leggy blonde Australian known within the industry as "The Body," Macpherson appeared on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue a record five times.
This year, Turlington -- who's married to actor/director Ed Burns -- released a documentary, "No Woman No Cry," about at-risk pregnant women around the world and co-starred with models Karen Elson and Natalia Vodianova in Louis Vuitton's Fall 2010 campaign.
