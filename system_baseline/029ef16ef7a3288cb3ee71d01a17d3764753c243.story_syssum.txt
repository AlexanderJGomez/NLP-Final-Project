His death triggered protests in Flatbush, a community in Brooklyn where distrust of the police runs deep.
And for the past couple of days, the bell hasn't rung."
According to police, plainclothes officers were on patrol in their car in Flatbush when they saw a group of men gathered on the street at about 11:30 p.m. Saturday.
The officers were taken to a hospital and treated for what the department described as trauma and tinnitus, a ringing in the ears.
Most people in the city likely don't believe what police say happened Saturday, said Councilman Charles Barron, who appeared with the teen's mother at the news conference.
But the hope for a peaceful crowd faded when about 30 young men showed up across the street from the vigil, he said.
Community leaders started shouting for everyone to calm down and asked anyone taking pictures to stop so they could talk to the young men and calm things down, the photographer told CNN.
"Those kids really know the streets, and they're spreading out and going down side streets away from the main street."
"As a black man growing up in Flatbush, you just expect to be harassed by the cops, pulled over, arrested and now just straight up killed," said Shanduke McPhatter, a 35-year-old former gang member who works with young men in the neighborhood.
And kids are doing it to themselves to -- they doing the crime, too -- and you got cops who don't live here coming in here so hard, too hard.
"And for the cops, they just need to take that badge away and talk, talk to us like human beings.
Otherwise, this is just going to keep happening."
