While their countrymen prepared to attend to the Olympic ideals of "citius, altius, fortius" -- faster, higher, stronger -- two Russian thrillseekers traveled to China to put at least one of those to the ultimate test by scaling the as yet unfinished Shanghai Tower in the city's financial district.
Peering over the side, the upper floors of the distinctive, 492m Shanghai World Financial Center and the neighboring Jin Mao Tower (421m) can be seen in the video, peeking through low lying clouds.
Upon reaching the very top of the crane, one examines his hands, grimy from the long climb, and the pair high-five each other before taking the ultimate Facebook profile pic - one unlikely to ever be replicated.
Makhorov's blog says that the pair waited until the Lunar New Year holidays, when construction teams had left the site.
