The film, according to the festival's website, is about a retired couple in their 80s and how their bond is severely tested after the woman, Anne, "has an attack."
Another contender for the top prize was "Moonrise Kingdom," a film by Wes Anderson that tells the tale of two young lovers who reunite and run away into the wilderness in 1965 after a year apart.
"My point of view about it was the memory of feeling that way is so strong for me," Anderson told CNN earlier this week.
And British rock start Pete Doherty, the on-again, off-again lead singer of the Libertines, also made his acting debut in "Confession of a Child of the Century," which screened at the festival.
Last year's Palme d'Or prize went to "The Tree of Life," a film from American director and writer Terrence Malick.
