(CNN) -- The suspect in the killing of Yale pharmacology graduate student Annie Le appeared in court in New Haven, Connecticut, Tuesday, but did not enter a plea, his attorney told CNN.
Clark is not a Yale student, but has worked as a lab technician at the university since 2004.
A motive in Le's killing was unclear, but police said they were treating the case as workplace violence.
"You were born in my loving embrace," said Le's mother, Vivian Van Le, reading a poem she'd written in Vietnamese to those gathered for the funeral at Holy Trinity Catholic Church in El Dorado Hills.
All the dreams and hopes of your future gone with you to your resting place," Vivian Van Le said, according to her son.
