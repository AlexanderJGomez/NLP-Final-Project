(CNN) -- A couple of hours before President Obama's prime-time speech on ISIS, Republicans Mitt Romney and Chris Christie took the opportunity of the New Jersey governor's birthday party to blast the President on his foreign policy.
Still, Romney encouraged the audience to "support" the President as he takes his next steps in fighting the militant group in Iraq and Syria.
"You were wrong, Mitt Romney is right, and the world is suffering because of it."
While they sang each others' praises Wednesday night, it was less than two years ago when many of Romney's supporters were saying that Christie cost Romney the election.
"This is a guy who cares about the people in this great state, he cares about the poor, he cares about the middle class.
"Wouldn't our country be a hell of a better place if this man were the President of the United States?"
