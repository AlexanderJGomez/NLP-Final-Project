There are buds and blooms adding color all over the capital, from the quaint Old Town to the bustling city center to the massive concrete apartment blocks left over from the communist era.
But it's the older Warsaw -- faithfully restored and full of churches, palaces and parks -- that seems to attract the most visitors.
To get a feel for the city that was known as the Paris of Eastern Europe before World War II, stroll down Nowy Świat Street, lined with restaurants, cafes, bookstores and small shops.
It's probably most famous for perfecting the Polish version of the donut: Fist-sized balls of sweet, fragrant yeast dough fried until they're golden-brown and covered with icing.
This historic center of Warsaw -- which Nazi troops almost completely destroyed in 1944 and which was carefully rebuilt after the war -- is designated as a World Heritage site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
It's here that you'll find the entrances to Warsaw's Łazienki Park, once the summer residence of Poland's royalty.
Among the many other pleasures: Watching the playful red squirrels roaming in the grass and taking in the colorful plumage of the peacocks strolling the grounds.
They're all unforgettable reminders of the city's painful past and how much it has overcome.
"Fall in love with Warsaw," the capital invites visitors in a slogan printed on posters all over town.
