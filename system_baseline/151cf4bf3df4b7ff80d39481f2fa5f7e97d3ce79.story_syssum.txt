Argan oil, crushed from the seeds of the short, spiky argan tree, has been used for centuries as a medicine and staple ingredient in local cooking -- drizzled on salads and couscous or mixed with almonds and honey to make amlou, a dip for bread.
But times have changed, and according to the Argan Oil Society, all the co-operatives are now staffed and run by local women.
Ethnic Berbers -- the indigenous inhabitants of North Africa whose culture predominated in the region prior to the 7th century Arab invasion -- were among Morocco's earliest inhabitants, and government figures show that at least one third of the country's population of 32 million speak a Berber dialect.
"The purpose of this work is to preserve the argan tree, because it was in decline," she said.
Besides the Argan tree's various human uses, UNESCO notes, it has had an historical role as a buffer against northern expansion of the Sahara desert.
This is then kneaded to extract the oil, leaving a solid block that is sent off to a mechanical press where even more oil can be extracted.
