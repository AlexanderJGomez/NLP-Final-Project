According to Morrissey, he's had a cancer scare, although in talking about the disease, the singer doesn't seem that scared at all.
I am aware that in some of my recent photos I look somewhat unhealthy, but that's what illness can do.
Over the past few years, Morrissey has canceled tour dates for reasons like food poisoning, bleeding ulcers, pneumonia and a sickness he blamed on his opening act, but this is the first time the usually candid rocker has uttered the C-word aloud.
The singer also joked about an upcoming Las Vegas concert, writing, "If there's an audience of any kind in attendance, I just might die with a smile on my face, after all.
I've been to so many hospitals lately that there's hardly any point in my leaving."
Whatever the diagnosis, Morrissey is back out on the road, and NME reports that the singer's backing band is proudly donning shirts that say "F*** Harvest" as a nod to his record label after the label released Moz's new LP "World Peace Is None of Your Business."
