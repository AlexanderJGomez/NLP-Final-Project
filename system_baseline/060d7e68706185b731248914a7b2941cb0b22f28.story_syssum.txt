Riding the explosion of interest in social-media services and mobile technology, the fest has a reputation for hosting some of the biggest names in tech and helping launch some influential start-ups.
Twitter's ascension meant many more start-ups began trying to use the festival, which is filled with influential early adopters, as a launching pad for their products.
All those extra bodies stuffing panel rooms and downtown parties at the festival have marked a shift in the culture of South by Southwest, and prompted a lot of soul searching by festival organizers.
Hugh Forrest, the SXSW Interactive director who has headed up the fest since it began, acknowledges that he and his staff are working hard to balance what he calls "start-up mania" with more community-focused parts of the event.
The tension between what's good for the online world (and the world at large) and what products can make money is at the heart of a lot of the festival's official programming.
For the first time, the festival will give out a Hall of Fame award at its Interactive Awards ceremony.
Last year Interactive got attention for a community effort that was completely unplanned and that didn't spring from the fest itself: After earthquakes and tsunamis devastated Japan on the opening day of the festival, attendees launched "SXSW4Japan," which raised funds for relief efforts.
With more than 2,600 speakers and hundreds of topics, there's plenty of room for discussion about everything from the future of health care and the increasing role of technology in government change to good app design and the role of social media in Occupy Wall Street-style protests.
The festival may be unsure where it will end up, but it's convinced it knows how to get there.
