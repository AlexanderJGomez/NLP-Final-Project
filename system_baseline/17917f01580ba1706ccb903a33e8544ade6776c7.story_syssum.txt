A teenager in Ireland recently found the bottle and message he tossed off the Florida coast last year.
"The goal was to basically see how the ocean currents work and how the Gulf Stream flows, and eventually it landed in Ireland," he said.
Hall tracked him down through Facebook and sent him a message with the incredible news.
But he said the fact that it travelled thousands of miles ensured he learned a lesson from the experiment -- more than a year after taking part in it.
