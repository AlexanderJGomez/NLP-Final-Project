While official state media has given cursory coverage to the trial, Chinese netizens fed an online frenzy of commentary about the case, which was the top trending topic Thursday on Sina.com's Weibo, a Chinese Twitter-like microblogging site.
"While it's difficult to say whether Beijing censored the material -- foreign journalists were not allowed inside to cover the trial, so it's unclear how closely the official remarks hewed to what actually went down in the courtroom -- it is certainly China's first live-microblogged show trial," noted Isaac Stone Fish in Foreign Policy.
According to posts by the court, Bo contested the claim that he had taken bribes from Tang Xiaolin, a businessman in the northeastern industrial city of Dalian, where Bo used to be mayor.
Because he did not go too far to condemn other leaders or reveal some other problems; this is probably what worried some of the leadership the most," Li said.
But he didn't know that those who misuse the power which granted by people will be severely punished according to the discipline of the Party and the law of the country."
But the court's feverish stream of dispatches on Thursday had slowed significantly on Friday, adding to the belief that the outcome of the trial in China -- where only 0.1% of cases return a not guilty verdict -- is of little doubt.
