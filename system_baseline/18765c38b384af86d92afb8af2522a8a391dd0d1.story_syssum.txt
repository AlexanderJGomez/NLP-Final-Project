Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- The Libyan opposition has rejected a "road map" proposal by the African Union to bring an end to fighting between them and the government of Moammar Gadhafi, opposition leaders said Monday.
Gadhafi had agreed in principle to stop all hostilities in his North African nation and allow outside forces to help keep the peace, his government and African Union mediators said Monday in a joint statement.
The agreement, which the statement said Gadhafi had signed off on, states that the final resolution must consider "the aspirations of the Libyan people for democracy, political reform, justice, peace and security, as well as social ...
"Leader Moammar Gadhafi expressed his full confidence in the African Union and its ability to successfully carry out the peace process in his country," the statement said.
But she said there also must be, among other things, a resumption of water, electricity and other services to Libyan cities that have been "brutalized by Gadhafi's forces."
The talks come as violence continues in the North African nation, where pro- and anti-Gadhafi forces have been engaged in bitter fighting since February.
Amnesty International said Monday that it had fresh evidence of extrajudicial executions apparently committed by forces loyal to Gadhafi near Ajdabiya in recent days.
At least eight people were killed and 22 injured in fighting Saturday between the pro-Gadhafi forces and the rebels, according to medical sources in the city.
