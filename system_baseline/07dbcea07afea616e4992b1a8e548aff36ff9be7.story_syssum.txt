The little girl watching it from inside the Oscar ceremony has traveled all the way to Los Angeles, California, from her small Indian village with her dad -- and it has been an incredible journey for Pinki Sonkar.
Like millions of other children born with the lip deformity in developing countries, Pinki simply had to live with it and suffer the social consequences.
Pinki is now a real pistol, full of energy and confidence, and she has a fantastic smile too -- thanks to the Smile Train charity.
Pinki just happened to be one of the chosen candidates for surgery and was also chosen to be the subject of the documentary.
For Pinki and her dad, being able to see the film's director win an Oscar would be a thrill.
