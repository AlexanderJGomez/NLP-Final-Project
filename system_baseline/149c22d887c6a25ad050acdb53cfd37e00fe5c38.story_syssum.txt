A warrant issued for Lindsay Lohan apparently stems from her 2007 drunken driving convictions, police said.
Sandi Gibbons of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office told CNN on Sunday the warrant is believed to be in connection with a possible probation violation.
"Since her case was resolved, Ms. Lohan has been in compliance with all the terms and conditions of her probation and all orders of the court," Holley said in a statement.
Police said Saturday they were not actively seeking Lohan, as they would not usually go after a person to take them into custody in such cases.
A judge sentenced Lohan to three years probation after she entered guilty and no contest pleas to the charges.
