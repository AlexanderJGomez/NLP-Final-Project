Busy couples don't always get to do what their single counterparts can take for granted -- date.
While their three boys lived at home, the entrepreneur and her husband would make sure to head out for date nights at local restaurants -- just the two of them.
Whether you're facing an emptier nest once the kids go back to school, or even if you don't have children, you can take tips from the three "T's".
That means booking a babysitter, or enlisting family members to watch the kids, while you and your spouse go out.
Cooking is a hobby that's allowed them to focus on each other, rather than other distractions, when they're together.
But spending time together is only part of the process.
Her husband of 24 years points out that learning to communicate when the kids live at home paves the way for a harmonious empty nest.
Getting together with a partner once a week to talk about financial decisions, big and small, can help keep couples calm.
"That gets people out of the pattern of only talking about money when there is a crisis," she says.
She says that couples need to realize that they'll be in their relationship for the long haul.
"You can't say that the person you are right now is going to be the same person that you're going to be in five years."
She says their secret is learning to ebb and flow together, rather than apart.
"We really focus on each other, and try to tune everything else out."
