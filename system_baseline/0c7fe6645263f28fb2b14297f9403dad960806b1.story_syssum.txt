The four -- Charles Cashmore, Charles Erlich, Michael McClinton and Walter Alexander -- all turned on Simpson and cooperated in the case against him.
Before announcing the suspended sentences Tuesday, Glass said the actions of Cashmore, Erlich, McClinton and Alexander were "stupid but also criminal" when they accompanied the former football star to the Palace Station Hotel and Casino on September 13, 2007.
The six men confronted the dealers in a hotel room, brandishing weapons but not firing them.
Glass still has to decide restitution in the case a schedule a hearing on that for Friday morning.
He'll remain jailed while an appeal is pending.
