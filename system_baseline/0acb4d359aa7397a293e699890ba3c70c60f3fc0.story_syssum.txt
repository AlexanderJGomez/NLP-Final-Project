The jury of five women and one man deliberated for slightly more than a day before deciding on the amount, attorneys for both sides said.
That case involved Dr. Howard A. Engle, a Miami Beach pediatrician and smoker who served as the lead plaintiff in the class-action suit.
"From beginning to end, this case was marked by legal rulings that should be reversed on appeal, including allowing this jury to rely almost exclusively on findings by a prior jury that have no direct connection with the plaintiff in this case."
"We're more than happy to keep trying them," he said.
