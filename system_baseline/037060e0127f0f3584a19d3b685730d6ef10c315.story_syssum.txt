Marc Marquez held off Valentino Rossi to claim the opening MotoGP race of the season in Qatar on Sunday, picking up where he left off last year.
The lead changed hands a few times until Marquez led entering the final lap -- and Rossi couldn't get close enough to pass him again.
The 21-year-old, who lost his pole advantage seconds after the start, saved his fastest lap time for the end.
"But starting from 10th, second is a great result.
The two-time MotoGP world champion -- and last year's winner in Qatar -- crashed in the first lap after a blistering start that saw him move to the front.
The second race of the season takes place April 13 in Austin.
