His Article 32 hearing is part of the military's process of determining whether he should face court martial.
He testified that in December 2009, Manning was late for duty and they sat down in a conference room so Padgett could counsel him.
Padgett testified said he did not discuss the outburst with the major who oversaw the intelligence analysis officers, the company's first sergeant nor the company commander.
Manning is accused of stealing and leaking nearly three-quarters of a million classified documents from the State Department and the Defense Department to the WikiLeaks website, which published many of them.
Keay said he often saw soldiers listening to music in the office where classified materials were analyzed.
Even though he called only two, Coombs had requested 48 witnesses, ten of whom were already on the prosecution witness list.
Additionally, the likelihood of stopping charges from going forward is non-existent in this case so there is little value in telegraphing to the prosecution information the defense may possess but might not yet have revealed," said Zaid.
Witnesses for the prosecution have characterized Manning as being troubled by Army discipline and testified that he allegedly bragged on the Internet about the leak of classified documents.
On Tuesday, a convicted computer hacker from California who became a confidential informant for the Army testified about six days of online chats that he had with someone he believes was Manning.
Lamo testified that based on an e-mail he received from Manning, as well as an examination of Manning's Facebook page, that Bradass87 was Manning.
