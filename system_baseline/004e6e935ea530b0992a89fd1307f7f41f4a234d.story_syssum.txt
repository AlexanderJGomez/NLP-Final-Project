Rea Carey, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, was in the room as Obama signed the order and said it was an emotional moment.

"While we don't know the full implications of this executive order, I am disappointed that this administration persistently violates the freedom of conscience for religious organizations that provide necessary relief for the poor and endangered," Moore said.
Obama also noted that a majority of Fortune 500 companies have policies in place against discrimination based on sexual orientation.
But the measure, which exempted religious groups from the would-be-law, did not make it to the House floor where Republicans opposed it.
