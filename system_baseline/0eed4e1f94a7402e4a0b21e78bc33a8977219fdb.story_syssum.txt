"The confidence of the markets had been rattled," former BP CEO Tony Hayward said in his first interview since he resigned, indicating how close the company was to collapse.
Hayward told the BBC the company was "not prepared" for the fallout from the spill and that he understood why he was "demonized and vilified" by the American public.
U.S. politicians and officials castigated him and occasionally referred to the company as "British Petroleum" rather than as "BP," underscoring that a foreign-based company was at fault for the disaster.
One bad decision after another, failed tests and other shortfalls show that the three companies involved in the disaster need to be overhauled, the co-chairman of the presidential commission investigating the incident said.
On Monday, the commission reported that workers aboard the Deepwater Horizon were pushing to complete the well, but no "conscious decision" to cut corners on safety had been discovered.
The disaster began April 20 with an explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drill rig, which was completing the well for BP at the time of the blast.
Tuesday's testimony included discussion on BP's plan to temporarily cap the well before another rig would move in to start collecting oil.
"I think it would probably be much more effective if [training] drills were regularly conducted along these lines on the rigs that were doing the operations with the crews."
BP and Halliburton have drawn criticism about flaws in cement that was poured to reinforce the well.
