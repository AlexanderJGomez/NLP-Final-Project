We have been bringing the world the simple idea of women's liberation by means of sexual emancipation as expressed in highly visible acts of political protest.
The third element of the patriarchy is the sex industry, which has been responsible for women's sexual servitude and is in fact the most ancient form of female slavery.
From what we have related above, naturally the most hated institutions are those that stand for one of these three things or a mixture of them.
For having published in Facebook topless pictures of herself with "F*** Your Morals" written on her body, Amina suffered severe criticism and death threats, and was kidnapped, beaten, and subjected to humiliating treatment.
A few hours after Femen activists attacked the president of Tunisia shouting "Where is Amina?"
At the heart of Islamism lies the enslavement of women based on control over their sexuality.
A mass sexual protest inspired by our example will serve as the first step toward women's recovering their own nature and will be a turning point, sparking the dissolution of the Sharia and the return, to women, of control over the conditions of her existence, from the sexual to the political.
