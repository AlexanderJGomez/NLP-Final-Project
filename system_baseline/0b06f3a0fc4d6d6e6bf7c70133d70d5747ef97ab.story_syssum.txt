A sneak peek of tracks "Black Skinhead" and "New Slaves" on "Saturday Night Live" suggest that he's been listening to a lot of DMX, while his collaborators include Daft Punk, Skrillex, John Legend, members of Odd Future, No I.D., Pusha T and Chief Keef.
For the 20th anniversary of "Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)," the Staten Island hip-hop group has a new and possibly final album, named after their 1997 track, "A Better Tomorrow."

has said on Twitter that there are "no collabs" on this album, although she worked with producers Hit-Boy and So Japan, whose Kyle Edwards told MTV the album has "a lot more bounce to it."
The lineup at Bumbershoot includes fun., Death Cab for Cutie, MGMT, Bob Mould, The Breeders, Matt & Kim and Heart.
Those farther south on the coast might want to hit up Outside Lands in San Francisco August 9-11 which will include Red Hot Chili Peppers, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Vampire Weekend and Willie Nelson.
Folks on the East Coast should try their luck at the Governor's Ball in New York June 7-9, which Kanye West is headlining (Guns N' Roses are slated to make an appearance, but you never know with Axl Rose).
And then there's the comedy lineup, featuring David Cross (in case you didn't get enough of him in the new season of "Arrested Development"), Ed Helms (ditto for "The Hangover III"), and Bob Saget, who will probably work blue.
Does that mean we'll have to wait a little longer for her new album?
