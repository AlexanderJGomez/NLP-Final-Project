But in mid- to late summer, the heavier rains seem to sidestep the coast and, more often than not, sunshine blinks from behind the clouds.
Florence has a charming old-world downtown, the Siuslaw River curves along its edges, offering spectacular natural views, and it is located along what is arguably the most beautiful and diverse section of the Oregon Coast.
Today, this restaurant is one of the best places to watch the river crawl by while swilling a Mango Mint Fizz -- a sublime mixture of rum, mango juice, lemon juice, simple syrup and soda.
Another historical building that found new life in Florence is the Edwin K Bed & Breakfast, a two-story 1914 craftsman-style charmer with six bedrooms and a private apartment.
One of the best times to explore Florence is in May, when the city celebrates its annual Rhododendron Festival, a tradition for more than a century.
This is the place to be when the weather turns gloomy and the gas stove is roaring in one corner.
Visitors may take an elevator down 208 feet into what's touted as the largest sea cave in America, roughly the length of a football field and 125 feet high.
The sea lions are most likely to congregate in the grotto during the fall and winter, whereas they take full advantage of the sunnier spring and summer weather to frolic on the rock formations just outside the caves.
The delightful Victorian-style home features an expansive view of the Pacific, an acre of well-maintained grounds, six distinctive rooms and a hearty breakfast selection.
Even if you're not in the mood to get muddy, grab a blanket and a hot beverage and relax along the shore as you watch the bobbing lights of the clam diggers blend in with the stars.
