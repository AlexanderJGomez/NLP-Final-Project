Washington (CNN) -- Groups representing federal air marshals and flight attendants -- outraged over the Transportation Security Administration's decision to allow small pocketknives back into aircraft cabins -- say they will ask the TSA to reconsider the policy.
Box cutters and razor blades are still not allowed inside the passenger cabin.
Some experts say security improvements since the attacks -- most notably reinforced cockpit doors, better intelligence and motivated passengers -- have made the strict prohibition of small pen-knives unnecessary.
"It's not just the (Federal Air Marshal Service), it's all of my guys," he said, noting that law enforcement officers are allowed to carry weapons during commercial flights.
Pistole said his agency consulted with its federal air marshals and other experts before making the change, and that led to the continued prohibition of the sturdier knifes with short blades.
Although it was widely reported that the 9/11 hijackers used box cutters in their attack, the weapons were not recovered, and investigators believe other types of knives were used.
"Our best working hypothesis is that a number of the hijackers were carrying -- permissible under the regulations in place at the time -- permissible utility knives or pocket knives," a commission staff member said at a January 2004 hearing of the 9/11 Commission.
On occasion the TSA has expanded the list, as it did after a liquid bomb scare in August 2006 when it prohibited bringing large containers of liquids and gels on board aircraft.
