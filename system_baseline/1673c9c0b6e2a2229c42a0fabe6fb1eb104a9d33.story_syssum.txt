No thanks for the memories: The scientific study applied mild electric shocks to hermit crabs to determine if they could 'feel' pain.
Hermit crabs are known to prefer some species of shells to others and it was found that that they were more likely to come out of the shells they least preferred.
"We know from previous research that they can detect harmful stimuli and withdraw from the source of the stimuli but that could be a simple reflex without the inner 'feeling' of unpleasantness that we associate with pain.
"Such trade-offs are seen in vertebrates in which the response to pain is controlled with respect to other requirements.
But Professor Elwood says that in contrast to mammals, little protection is given to the millions of crustaceans that are used in the fishing and food industries each day.
"There is no protection for these animals (with the possible exception of certain states in Australia) as the presumption is that they cannot experience pain.
