LONDON, England (CNN) -- In the developing world millions of people struggle to operate machinery, read from a blackboard, or just see the world around them, because they don't have access to the eyeglasses they need.
That makes it incredibly difficult for ordinary people to visit an optometrist, without which it's impossible for them to get glasses.
Silver has been developing the glasses for over 20 years and continues to research the technology at the Center for Vision in the Developing World (CVDW) at the University of Oxford.
"If I can train people from existing networks to dispense glasses, and they can spare one day each week or month to dispense the glasses, then they can see 50 to 100 people in a day -- and that's a way to reach a lot of people," White told CNN.
But for the program to be sustainable, White says the next step is to train his dispensers to become trainers themselves, so that he builds a growing network of people in developing countries who can distribute the glasses.
The glasses are currently functional, rather than fashionable, and that may limit their uptake, but more cosmetic versions are being developed.
There's an immense amount of interest in solving it and self-refraction is one route that can assist with that."
