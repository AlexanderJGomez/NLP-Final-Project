In response to a report that his health was failing and that he had been rushed to the hospital, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said Thursday that he had the best proof that his recovery from chemotherapy is advancing fine.
The Nuevo Herald, citing two unidentified sources who said they were witnesses, reported Thursday that Chavez had been taken to a military hospital on Tuesday because of kidney complications.
Being in the barracks for too long is not good for a man who's used to being at the forefront.
Asked by a U.S. reporter what type of cancer he has, Chavez -- who said he was recuperating from his last round of chemotherapy, which ended 11 days ago -- would not specify.
"It's normal now, but it could be lower," he said.
I'm doing light exercise, but when I start to run and to hit balls and steal second base ..."
The disinformation is part of a campaign that "many media outlets, including some represented here," were part of, he said.
The president also revealed that he had been one of the voices calling for the release of two American hikers in Iran.
Chavez said he considers Penn a friend, and after the two spoke about the hikers, he agreed to add his voice directly with the Iranian president.
Last week, a representative for Penn confirmed a report that Penn had flown to Venezuela months ago to speak about the hikers' plight with Chavez.
