(CNN) -- The reaction to the death of 23-year-old baseball player Christopher Lane has been swift and far-reaching, stretching from America's heartland to his home in Australia.
That range of emotion is palpable on a website created to raise money for Christopher's family to fly to the United States and take his body back to Australia.
I also pray for our leaders that they find the strength and morality to implement gun laws that prevent such senseless acts and, lastly, for our youth who do not value life, are devoid of compassion, and have no humanity."
Another contributor, Richard Kimpel, put the blame for the "senseless tragedy" on "a society that allows so many young boys to grow up without being taught respect for life.
"The first thing that you would notice about Chris was his strong Australian accent, which would just draw people toward him, especially in Oklahoma where most people have never heard it other than in the movies," he said in a statement.
Chris was a charming guy, a genuinely good person, with great character and had a love for life," he said.
It just breaks my heart knowing how much more he could have brought to this world as a husband, father, son, brother and friend."
