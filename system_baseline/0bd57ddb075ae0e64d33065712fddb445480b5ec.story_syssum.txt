(CNN) -- Ousted Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's hometown of Sirte will fall soon, perhaps within days, commanders of the anti-Gadhafi operation told U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on Friday, according to a senior U.S. defense official traveling with him.
We are the official governing body and the efforts of the revolutionaries that fought for the liberation are appreciated but the command must be centralized," Mohamed Sayeh told CNN.
Gadhafi's men control tall buildings in the city center, where they fire on their foes from rooftops.
The International Committee of the Red Cross evacuated three wounded people from Ibn Sina hospital in Sirte to a field hospital on Thursday.
"We even saw entire families leaving on foot, bringing their small children with them, without any food or water," Red Cross delegate Ghafar Bishtawi said.
Gadhafi, wanted by the International Criminal Court in the Hague for alleged crimes against humanity, has not been seen in public in months.
