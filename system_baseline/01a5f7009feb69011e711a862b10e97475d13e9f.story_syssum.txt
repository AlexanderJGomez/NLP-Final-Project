For his graduation project, he expanded his portfolio to include antique-style versions of several cult classics, including "A Clockwork Orange," "Inception" and an array of Scorsese and Tarantino movies.

They were impressed when they saw the finished product, however, and Palta, since graduated, has moved on to display his work (he's gearing up for an exhibition in Florence, Italy at the Vaia Balekis Contemporary Art Gallery).
