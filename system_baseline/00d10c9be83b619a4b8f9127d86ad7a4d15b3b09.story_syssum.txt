Seattle romped 43-8 by playing a suffocating defense and taking advantage of four Denver turnovers, including two interceptions thrown by quarterback Peyton Manning, the NFL's most valuable player for the season.
Seattle's defense was so strong that Denver managed only 27 yards rushing, compared with 135 for Seattle.
The second half started out bad for Denver, with Seattle's Percy Harvin running the opening  kickoff back for a touchdown.
Jermaine Kearse caught a 23-yeard pass from Russell Wilson with 2:58 left in the third quarter for another touchdown.
Some fans lost cable service for a period and missed part of the second half and the halftime show, starring Bruno Mars and the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
A man was shot several times during a Super Bowl party at a residence in Denver, police said.
