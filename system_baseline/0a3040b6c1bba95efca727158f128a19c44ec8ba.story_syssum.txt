What Domingues did was legally register the trio as a "stable union," a civil union that extends all of the benefits of marriage, though there is debate about what rights the threesome will actually enjoy.
Brazilian law defines marriage as a union between two people, so it is impossible for a civil union of three to be granted the rights of a marriage of two.
"The institution of family cannot be defended with the approval of actions that seek to distort its definition," the religious, conservative Plinio Correa de Oliveira Institute said in a statement.
The controversial civil union "is proof that there is a plurality of familiar relations, though not all deserve judicial or legal standing," Rolf Madaleno, director of the Brazilian Institute for Family Law, said in a statement.
Brazil is known for its progressive social policies and openness, as reflected in the status conferred to the trio, though the country is stereotyped, too.
The trio considers themselves a family and is entitled to be seen as such in the public record, Domingues said.
The trio from Rio, having been rejected by other public notaries, found their way rural Sao Paulo state and to Domingues because she is a student of polyfidelitous relationships -- ones involving more than two partners, but where there is fidelity between the members.
Her dissertation, she said, is about "how you can love more than one person at the same time."
Other polyfidelitous groups have reached out to her seeking the same civil union status.
