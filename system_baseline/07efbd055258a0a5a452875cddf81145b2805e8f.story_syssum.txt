While the president has made light of the controversy, the question remains political red meat for some of his critics.
Dr. Chiyome Fukino, a former director of the Hawaii Department of Health and a Republican, told CNN in her most extensive comments to date that she has "no doubt" Obama was born in the state.
Fukino went one step further, taking advantage of a state law that allows certain public officials to examine a person's actual birth certificate if there is a "direct and tangible interest."
Waidelich, like Obama in 2008, was given a certification of live birth in response to his request.
"Under the system that existed back then, there was no avenue for people to submit information that way.
Indeed, as CNN confirmed, all birth announcements at the time came directly from hospital birth records.
Obama could file a Freedom of Information Act request to view his original birth certificate and make copies.
"Of course, we had no idea at the time that the future president of the United States was that little boy, that little baby," Abercrombie recalled.
"She said, 'When I had Maya, it was a lot of more difficult because Indonesia doesn't believe in painkillers while you're giving birth.
... Of course, in the United States, giving birth to Barry (Obama's childhood nickname) was quite different and much more comfortable,' " Dewey recalled.
"No matter what you do or say, it make no difference," she said.
That, the evidence suggests, may be easier said than done.
