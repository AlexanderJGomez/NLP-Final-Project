Under the Khmer Rouge, everything belonged to the Revolution â€” and picking up anything from the ground without their permission was a crime.
My experience is a mere footnote to the millions of other Cambodians who suffered and died at the hands of this regime, but it is illustrative of the ongoing struggle to find justice and closure.
While the occasion marks an enormous achievement in Cambodia and the international community's long struggle to assert the primacy of human rights, peace, and the rule of law, it is a victory that can only be marked with somber contemplation.
Many estimates found that more than a million people died under the Khmer Rouge between 1975 and 1979 from execution, disease, starvation and overwork.
Achieving true justice in these circumstances is an impossible feat for mankind, and an altogether late endeavor at best.
While our efforts in applying due process in the punishment of genocide and mass atrocities deserve recognition and respect, we should not overlook the paramount need for preventing such crimes before they occur.
If only the international community would exercise the courage and resolve as the man in prison did for me, the world would need fewer verdicts.
