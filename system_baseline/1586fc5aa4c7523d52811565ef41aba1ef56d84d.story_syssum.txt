FFP is designed to prevent clubs spending beyond their means and posting unsustainable yearly losses, but Dupont believes the sanctions are "completely illegal" because they restrict competition -- a key principle of European Union law.
" As such, there is no doubt that the rules have democratic legitimacy since they were the product of an inclusive and democratic process.
Dupont believes FFP raises further competition concerns by entrenching the status quo, by not allowing clubs like City and PSG to challenge the established football order in future.
To back up his argument, Dupont cites an academic article by professor Nicolas Petit on EU competition law and FFP.
Dupont argues clubs won't risk taking UEFA on in the courts because it might lead to their expulsion from the Champions League or the Europa League and disrupt their transfer activities.
And even more so since this threat aims at enforcing a rule that, itself, violates competition law."
Intriguingly, Dupont urged the supporters of the nine clubs sanctioned by UEFA to become involved in the battle against FFP.
"They are free to join the complaint lodged by my client, player agent Daniel Striani, with the European Commission and the civil action he has launched in the Brussels court.
Whether it change European law for a second time remains to be seen.
