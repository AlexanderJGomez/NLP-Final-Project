Let's cut to the chase: There would be no special prosecutor had thousands across the national not mobilized, organized and took to the streets to demand justice for Trayvon.
Would the 911 tapes be released showing admitted trigger man George Zimmerman calling Trayvon suspicious, and owning up to following him?
Would the Department of Justice have launched an investigation into the case, as well as the Sanford Police Department?
Go through history and you will find many examples of cases not being investigated or, if they were brought to trial, prosecuted or judged atrociously: Scottsboro Boys.
As a result, we've had to live by the admonition of former slave and abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who said, "Agitate!
This wasn't about a ridiculous bounty on the head of Zimmerman by the New Black Panther Party.
It should pain our heart when the prosecution withholds evidence in a case that could exonerate someone.
No one should be condemned for taking to the streets and letting their voices be heard.
We all should call them exactly what they are: true Americans.
