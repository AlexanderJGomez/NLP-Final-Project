The chic women's store is named H. Audrey after her maternal grandmother, who was the first wife of the late country music icon Hank Williams.
With heels on, she's about 6-foot-3 -- all tanned legs and long, blonde hair.
Most of the 11 tracks are self-penned, and she sings them with emotional honesty in a smoky, soulful voice.
About three weeks before my release, I was looking over to see who else was coming out that day, and it said, "Hank Jr." -- and I'm going, "Is this something my manager planned?"
And it's just so random, because out of the 52 weeks of the year, it just happened.
CNN: Your mother doesn't seem jaded by the music industry at all.
My single out right now is called "Mama" that I wrote ... is kind of a thank-you song, because she was always the most positive influence -- had so much light.
Williams: The songwriting hit me at a very young age.
And in the U.S., I just took my mom's Suburban and followed everyone from Train, John Mellencamp, Billy Bob Thornton -- everyone's bus -- and just did any show I could, whether they paid or not.
I had a very happy childhood, but it was very introspective about this broken marriage, and I wanted Tiffany or Debbie Gibson to cut it.
I could write a decent song, but I couldn't sing that well at that age.
So I was really left to my own devices to find music on my own.
And when I heard Hank Williams Sr.'s name mentioned from those people -- from Leonard Cohen to Bruce Springsteen -- that's what really brought me back around to learning more about my grandfather.
It's a struggle in this economy, but we make enough to pay our payroll and buy the clothes.
I would love to play in arenas -- but what I really want to build is a core fanbase, and just hopefully build a place in the Williams family.
