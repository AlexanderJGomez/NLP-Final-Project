Proposed four-day furloughs would affect nearly 12,000 people, which includes workers at the Miami-based National Hurricane Center, from July 1 to September 30, in time for what is expected to be an active hurricane season.
"Unfortunately, after much serious deliberation, in order to help address current budget shortfalls, we are moving forward ... to implement furloughs across the agency ... unfortunately, furloughs are necessary to help close the gaps," Ciaran Clayton said.
"It is not an average job; you can't tell a tornado to wait 10 minutes because you are doing something else," said Daniel Sobien, president of NWSEO.
Sobien said that it would be impossible to fill every shift because 10% of NOAA's positions are vacant and the number is forecasters is down significantly.
Where once there were 10 forecasters per office, now many operate with four or five, he said.
