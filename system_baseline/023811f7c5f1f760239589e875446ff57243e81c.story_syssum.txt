"If I didn't do something about my health, then I was concerned I'd never live long enough to get married and have children or be healthy enough to spend quality time with my future family," the Evansville, Indiana, man said.
"I tried to buy fresh fruit and vegetables every three days, along with lunch meat sliced from the deli section of my local grocery store," he noted.
Once he hit the six-month mark of his lifestyle change, he added more rigorous activity to his daily routine, like using the treadmill.
Dr. Melina Jampolis, CNNHealth's Diet and Fitness expert who's a physician nutrition specialist who practices in Los Angeles and San Francisco, California,  said Schmitt has shed his weight in a safe and effective manner and she salutes him for making smart choices.
Schmitt's family doctor, Dr. Michael Allen, said he was comfortable with the pace of the weight loss, since he was a young male and didn't have  major health issues, beyond his high blood pressure.
"I have to constantly reinforce the fact that it was a lifestyle change for me, and not a fad diet or surgery that caused me to lose so much weight," he added.
Schmitt said his family members, with their various health issues, have closely watched his transformation, and he hopes his new healthy life will inspire them to make their own changes one day.
