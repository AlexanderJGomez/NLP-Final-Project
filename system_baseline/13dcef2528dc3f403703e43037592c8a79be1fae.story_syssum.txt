Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Bangkok turned into a war zone Wednesday as Thai military forces cracked down on anti-government protesters, ending a tense standoff that has troubled the capital for weeks.
Thailand's prime minister sought to calm public fears with a televised address in which he expressed confidence that peace would soon be restored.
The government considered the demonstrators to be terrorists, and army Col. Sansern Kaewkamnerd said that growing violence necessitated the use of force.
He said the government had regained full control and Red Shirt leaders had fled or were taken into police custody.
Sniper fire and explosions were heard after the leaders spoke of calling off the protests, said George McCleod, a witness and freelance journalist in the area.
Officials asked protesters, residents and foreigners to head to a nearby stadium if they wanted to leave.
"We Thai people never experienced this kind of situation before," said Sirinun Siripanich, the assistant secretary to the Bangkok governor.
From his self-imposed exile abroad to avoid a trial on corruption charges, Thaksin released a statement Wednesday saying he was not the leader of the United Front for Democracy, the formal name of the Red Shirt opposition, and that their movement calling for new elections is not on his behalf.
Thaksin also accused the Thai government of defaming him by saying he was the mastermind behind the violence in the country's ongoing political crisis.
But on Wednesday in Bangkok, as bullets rang out, black plumes of smoke rose and soldiers crept forward toward a showdown, it seemed that the time for talking had passed.
