World powers have been outraged at the violence, and at least 54 countries are backing a tough resolution on Syria that was to be issued Wednesday at the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland.
In its draft joint statement about Syria, the U.N. Human Rights Council noted that more than 1,000 people "peacefully protesting for democracy" have been killed.
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan met for nearly three hours with the envoy, who was expected to provide an assessment of the refugee situation and the wider political unrest in Syria, according to an official from Erdogan's office.
Turkey fears a repeat of the enormous Kurdish refugee exodus from northern Iraq in 1991, and the country has spent the past decade promoting warm relations and lucrative economic ties with Syria's al-Assad.
"We hope that Syria changes its attitude toward the civilians to a more tolerant one and realize its steps for reform in a more convincing way for the civilians," Erdogan said last week, according to the semi-official Anatolia news agency.
Many of the refugees have fled from a region that includes the northwestern town of Jisr al-Shugur, seized by the Syrian military over the weekend, a network of human rights activists said.
Adnan Mahmoud, the information minister, said the Cabinet urged citizens "who were forced to leave their homes to come back after calm and security were restored in the area," SANA said.
Wissam Tarif, a human rights activist based outside Syria, said he had not received reports of people returning to their homes.
"Arbitrary arrests, detention and torture, including of protestors, of human rights defenders, of representatives of the media, political dissidents, and young children must cease immediately," the statement said.
