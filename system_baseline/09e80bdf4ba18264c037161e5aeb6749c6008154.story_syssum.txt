Sadly, Chrissie studied with me for only one term, as her parents could not afford the school fee of $6.
When I travel through my country and talk to the people, I see myself and Chrissie in the children I meet, who are bursting with intelligence and creativity and joy.
But when I take the stage at the United Nations to represent my country, I also represent the parents of Malawi's children, the women who fear the dangers of giving birth and the men who search desperately to find work to pay for their families' basic needs.
The health of our women in particular is central to many of our development challenges, and is an issue to which I have been devoted since I almost lost my life delivering my fourth child.
Women who can choose when to have children and how many they will have are more likely to complete their education, start small businesses and participate actively in society.
I will do everything I can to make sure that women's reproductive health remains a central focus.
