(CNN) -- He didn't win the 14th stage of the Tour de France but Chris Froome's Saturday at cycling's most prestigious race was better than his Friday.
A "really big test," as Froome put it, comes Sunday as the 15th stage is the longest of the Tour and concludes at the summit of Mont Ventoux.
Italy's Matteo Trentin made it two stage wins in a row for Omega Pharma-Quick Step when he came from behind to beat Switzerland's Michael Albasini by half a wheel in a sprint finish.
Hopes of a first French stage winner this year were dashed when Julien Simon was caught near the end.
"Today we had one chance, and then in the Alps we are on terrain that is not favorable to us."
