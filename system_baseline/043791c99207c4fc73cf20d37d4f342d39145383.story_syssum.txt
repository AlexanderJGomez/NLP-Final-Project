Howard, who premiered the follow-up in Rome, Italy, this week, said there was "residual antagonism from 'The Da Vinci Code,' " but Vatican officials ignored the movie by not responding to suggestions that the church was offended.
"I was just talking with some people yesterday, I know friends of mine working in the Vatican, and they were surprised to learn that the movie was premiering in Rome.
"In 'The Da Vinci Code,' there were serious issues, such as who Jesus Christ was or the nature of church in the course of history, but none of them is taken in 'Angels & Demons.'
"I think there's some residual antagonism from 'The Da Vinci Code,' " Howard said.
"We've even invited certain groups, members of the church, for example, to see early rough cuts, because I wanted to share it with them and know what they thought, and I felt they'd find it not as offensive as they'd imagine," he said.
The film, which like "The Da Vinci Code" stars Tom Hanks as symbolism professor Robert Langdon, takes the audience inside the Conclave, where cardinals meet secretly to choose a new pope.
"One thing that was important to me and to all of us was to be as authentic as we possibly could be about what Conclave was like, that period when they're trying to elect the pope," Howard said.
"I wanted to represent for the audience that with as much detail as I did going to the moon with 'Apollo 13,' " he said, referring to his 1995 movie about the aborted space mission.
"While I haven't read Dan's next installment of the Robert Langdon adventures, I'm dying to," he said.
"Angels & Demons" opens in U.S. theaters May 15.
