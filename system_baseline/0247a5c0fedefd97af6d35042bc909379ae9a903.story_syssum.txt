To do so, they often rely on "data brokers" -- companies that collect and share our personal information and label us based on what they learn.
And they do this mostly without our knowledge.
The data broker industry has been booming in recent years, due to new technologies that enable the collection of massive quantities of our personal information.
Most Americans don't even know that data brokers exist, let alone that they collect and trade a staggering amount of our personal data.
The Federal Trade Commission, a bipartisan agency that works to protect consumers, is seeking to shed light on this largely unknown industry.
And consumers have little if any window into this process, let alone meaningful control or choice about how their data is shared among businesses.
We need better transparency into how data brokers collect and use our personal information to help ensure that we not go down a path that leads to unfair exclusion, but rather one that widens opportunities for all consumers.
