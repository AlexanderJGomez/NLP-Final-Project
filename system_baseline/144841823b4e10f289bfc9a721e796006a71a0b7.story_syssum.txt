When I was 1 month old I started having seizures, and when I was 4 years old I went to Dr. Weiner and he gave me brain surgery to stop my seizures.
Now I have 10-minute seizures but I only have one every 14 days or so.
We had to raise a lot of money and wait almost a year to meet her and then we had to drive from Virginia to Ohio to get Mindy.
When I first got Mindy it was pretty hard because she didn't listen to me, but now she does and she knows a lot of commands.
Epilepsy can also be bad, though, and I've heard about some seizures that can kill you!
