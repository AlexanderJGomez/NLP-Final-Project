Eric George, who represents Debbie Rowe, the biological mother of Jackson's two oldest children, demanded Tuesday that the New York Post retract its report that Rowe had agreed to take $4 million not to challenge Katherine Jackson for custody.
"Ms. Rowe has not accepted -- and will not accept -- any additional financial consideration beyond the spousal support she and Michael Jackson personally agreed to several years ago," George said.
A child custody court hearing, which had been set for this week, was delayed until next Monday at the request of lawyers for Jackson and Rowe, a court official said.
"It would be easier to identify those few background facts that are accurate than to catalog the number of blatant falsehoods in your story."
"He was upset because he really wanted to be a dad," Rowe said.
You are such a great friend.
Rowe claimed in the 2003 interview that she still had "some influence" over how Jackson raised the children, citing his practice of covering their faces in public as her idea.
She said the children don't call her "mom" because she did not want them to.
Rowe, 50, lives on a horse farm in Palmdale, California, about 60 miles north of Los Angeles.
