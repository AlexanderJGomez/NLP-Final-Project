(CNN) -- One person was killed and 16 others hospitalized Saturday afternoon when a sports bar tent collapsed during a storm that swept through the St. Louis area, fire officials said.
While the tent had received a city permit, manufacturer guidelines called for it to withstand winds of up to 90 miles per hour, said building commissioner Frank Oswald.
Up to 150 fans may have been under the tent, built of aluminum poles and guy wires, when the storm struck shortly before 4 p.m. (5 p.m.
The tent came to rest on a railroad trestle.
Inspectors were on site after the permit was issued earlier this month, according to Oswald.
They are certainly not designed to any stretch of the imagination to handle a severe weather event like this.
