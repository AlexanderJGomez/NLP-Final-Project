Powerful mobile devices connected to broadband-speed cell networks are now an everyday reality, and it's going to take more than a bigger screen or faster processor to make an impact this year.
Microsoft has been very candid about "missing a generation" of mobile innovation after Apple introduced the iPhone, and 2012 was all about the results of a furious catch-up effort: the company launched the completely rethought Windows 8 for PCs, Windows RT for tablets and Windows Phone 8 for smartphones.
Apple found success in 2012 by introducing an iPhone with a bigger screen and an iPad with a smaller screen, but it'll have to focus on software in 2013 to stay ahead of the competition.
Most of my peers in the industry have done the same.
That was an obvious shot at Apple and the iPad, but Amazon's real competitor may well be Google, especially as the market for books, music and movies moves entirely online.
There's no way Amazon wants people searching Google to find content and products from multiple sources.
That's not a small undertaking, but Amazon is one of the few companies with the scale, infrastructure and resources to make it happen.
But CEO Mark Zuckerberg has to answer to his investors now, and the pressure to cross that line will increase every day that Facebook isn't making money in mobile.
And that's a huge problem for Google.
Google also has to find a way to limit the influence of wireless carriers on Android.
These are just five of the many interesting things to look out for in 2013, from the future of TV to the rise of wearable computing.
