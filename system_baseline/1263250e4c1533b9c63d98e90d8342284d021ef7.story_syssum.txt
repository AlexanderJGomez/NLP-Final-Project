(CNN) -- Most Pakistanis told pollsters they disapproved of the U.S. military operation that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and the direction their country was headed, according to a poll released Tuesday by the Pew Research Center.
But a survey taken just after the raid found no material change in Pakistanis' views of the United States when compared with results from a survey taken before the raid.
Those surveyed said they were confused about the role of the Pakistani government in the U.S. military operation in Abbottabad, which is located about 35 miles outside the capital city of Islamabad.
Slightly more than a third (37%) said they support using the Pakistani army to fight extremists in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and the Kyber Pakhtyunkhwa region, which used to be called the North-West Frontier Province.
The first was carried out April 10-26 and included 1,970 Pakistanis who were part of a 23-nation poll.
The pollsters said there were few differences between the first and second surveys, implying that bin Laden's killing had little impact on public opinion in Pakistan about the United States or other issues covered by the survey.
Despite the criticism endured by the military over its absentee status during the U.S. raid on bin Laden's compound, 79% of Pakistanis described the military as a positive influence on the country.
But support for U.S. drone attacks remains minuscule, with 97% of those who had heard of them saying they are bad and 65% saying they are very bad.
More than half (61%) said they are unnecessary and 89% said they think they kill too many innocent people.
