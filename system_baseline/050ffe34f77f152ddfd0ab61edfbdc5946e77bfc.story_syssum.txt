"I would say it was surreal, both of us couldn't believe what was happening," Weeks told CNN in his first national televised interview since the June 10 shooting.
What went terribly wrong is that white supremacist James von Brunn allegedly walked into the museum and started firing his rifle, shooting security officer Stephen Johns in the chest.
"This was terrible," Weeks said softly.
"First thing I thought about, I have an 11-year-old," the officer said before breaking down.
McCuiston said the 6-foot-6-inch, 300-pound Johns was a "gentle giant" who was always friendly to colleagues and museum visitors.
"A lot of people are going to be saying what they have been saying, 'You are a hero, you're this, you're that,' " McCuiston said.
"Everyone knows when you lose someone, death is one of the worst things, even though it is reality," McCuiston said.
