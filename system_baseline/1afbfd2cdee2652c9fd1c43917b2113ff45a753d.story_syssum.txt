Republicans and Democrats have urgently pressed President Barack Obama to do something to stem the flow of child immigrants crossing the southern border -- and fast.
"There's widespread doubt about whether this administration can be trusted to enforce our laws and it's going to be difficult to move any immigration legislation until that changes," House Speaker John Boehner said in February.
"No amount of resources or changes will be effective in stemming the surge of illegal border crossings if President Obama continues to ignore the law," he wrote in a statement, resurrecting the common refrain when immigration reform was still a possibility.
But Democratic strategist Maria Cardona said Republicans are trying to have it both ways -- ask for a solution and criticize the President.
While Democrats indicate they support Obama's request, they want more details before signing off.
"We just can't just trust the President and say we are going to give you exactly every penny you want," Rep. Henry Cuellar, whose South Texas district is one heavily impacted by the current crisis, told CNN.
While the White House says it will ask Congress to give the Homeland Security Department more discretion to send such immigrants home, it's unclear if Obama will request changes to the anti-trafficking law.
Even some Democrats want more information, especially regarding asylum for trafficking victims who may be fleeing abuse or life threatening situations in their domestic surroundings.
