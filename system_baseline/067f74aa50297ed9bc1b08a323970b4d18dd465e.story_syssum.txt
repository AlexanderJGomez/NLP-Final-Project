Like smartphones, this new breed of tablets will run Android, an operating system developed by Google.
From the website, users can beam the app to any number of phones or tablets connected to their accounts.
In Apple's controlled habitat, the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad share information and apps via a central hub in the iTunes software.
But the synchronization features will mean little if Google can't persuade smartphone customers to purchase upcoming Android tablets.
The new Android software includes improved multitasking functionality, so you can see a window of what apps you were previously using looked like when you closed out of them.
Google's partners showed a game called "Monster Madness," which is based on a game originally developed for the PlayStation 3.
Google also attempted to woo attendees and people watching the event's online video stream with a slew of new apps designed specifically for tablets.
You'll need 3-D glasses in order to see the video on the tablet's screen.
T-Mobile and AT&T also announced more information on new Android phones this week, none of which will run the Honeycomb software at first.
