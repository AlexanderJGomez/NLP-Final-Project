Obama's performance Tuesday night was stellar (but not perfect) because of two techniques that I push to my debate teams ad nauseam.
He lacked passion in the previous debate, but when answering the first question from the audience Tuesday night, Obama brought the heat.
I guarantee you this one answer -- the "one-point plan" -- will be talked about more than any other (aside from that silly "binders full of women" distraction), partially because the president was memorable here, but mostly because of the primacy effect.
If a team I coached ever concluded a debate without using their opponents' language against them, I'd want to make them run laps.
"This plant kills" (from a Romney quote illustrating his flip-flop on coal plants); Romney's assertion that promoting a lower tax rate for the most wealthy Americans "grows the economy;" "I'll get back to you on that," his spokesman's initial response on Romney's stance on the Lilly Ledbetter bill, which makes it easier for women who have been discriminated against over equal pay to sue employers.
He followed this by reminding the audience of Obama's perceived shortcomings on these issues.
I expect the president to get a bump in the polls from this debate, but it could have been worse for Romney.
Think about it: If we simply reversed the order of the debates, the race for president would look very different right now.
