That they were filed under the copyist's name, not Franklin's, may explain why they were overlooked by historians until now, said a curator at the British Library, where the letters are held.
The letters are important in large part because they offer a "wealth of new details" that affect modern understanding of Franklin, writes Alan Houston, the political science professor who discovered the letters in the spring of 2007.
The letters cover Franklin's success in dealing with British Gen. Edward Braddock, who had been sent to Pennsylvania in 1755 to defeat the French at Fort Duquesne, in modern-day Pittsburgh.
Franklin went all over Pennsylvania trying to persuade farmers to lend their horses and wagons to Braddock and his men.
When Franklin was sent to London in 1757 as a representative of the assembly, he brought with him a collection of letters detailing that success.
This collection of letters, which Franklin referred to in his autobiography as his "quire book," was never found, however -- until now.
"Birch undoubtedly found Franklin's quire book captivating, and he appears to have copied anything that remotely interested him," Houston writes in the journal.
They form part of the massive Birch Collection containing the hundreds of volumes of his copies that Birch bequeathed to the library on his death, said Shaw.
