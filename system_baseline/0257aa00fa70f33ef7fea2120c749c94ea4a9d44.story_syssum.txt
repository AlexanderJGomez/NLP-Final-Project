Bush and his wife, Barbara, made an impromptu visit to the White House's press briefing room and told reporters how much they'll miss the building.
Barbara Bush, who was first lady from 1989 to 1993, said the hardest part of the night was saying goodbye to the White House residence staff a second time.
She added that she and her husband are looking forward to attending Tuesday's inauguration of President-elect Barack Obama.
