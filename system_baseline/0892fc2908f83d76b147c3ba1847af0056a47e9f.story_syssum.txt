"While other airlines on the list like Southwest and JetBlue have done a very good job of satisfying fliers, Virgin America is a cut above in the eyes of our readers," said Amanda Walker, a Consumer Reports senior editor, in a statement.
Spirit Airlines ranked at the bottom of the list for its check-in, cabin service and seating.
Consumer Reports bases its airline ratings on a survey of 16,663 subscribers conducted by the Consumer Reports National Research Center.
The full report is available to subscribers online at ConsumerReports.org and in the July issue of Consumer Reports magazine.
