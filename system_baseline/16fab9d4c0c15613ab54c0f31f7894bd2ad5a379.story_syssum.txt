Once in the front yard of the home, police said, he drew a gun and shot the victim several times, then in the head, execution-style.
At the time, Gonzales had no idea that videotape would break open a case that has frustrated local and federal authorities for a decade.
"Just walks right up to these guys, shoots them and then just walks over and stands over them and shoots them each in the head and casually walks away."
"We had pictures of him constantly on our dashboard so that there was no question if we saw this guy we knew who he was," Chavarria said.
He's eluded police for years, and has reportedly made statements that he plans to kill a police officer if they ever find him and arrest him, according to the FBI's Most Wanted Web site.
Now, authorities are hoping the video from October 2008 will help them get one step closer to the man who they say terrifies those who know him just as much as his victims.
