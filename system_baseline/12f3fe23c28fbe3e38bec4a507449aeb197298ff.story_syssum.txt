Scotland's Paul Lawrie, playing in the Ryder Cup for the first time since Brookline 13 years ago, claimed Europe's second point of the day, thrashing FedEx Cup playoff winner Brandt Snedeker 5&3.
While that victory was met with loud cheers, the joy was short lived as England's Justin Rose showed nerves of steel over the final three holes to see off four-time major winner Phil Mickelson.
Germany's Kaymer took a one-shot lead on the 17th and then produced the defining moment of the 39th Ryder Cup -- holing the crucial putt on the last to defeat Steve Stricker and ensure the U.S. could not reach the winning target of 14 1/2 points.
That left Europe on 14 points and Italian Francesco Molinari secured the half point needed to win the cup outright after finishing level with 14-time major winner Tiger Woods.
We never took this for granted.
