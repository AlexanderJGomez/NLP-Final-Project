(CNN) -- A fire truck escorted the funeral procession of Shannon Stone, the veteran firefighter and Texas Rangers fan whose death at a baseball game prompted a national outpouring of condolences.
Stone stuck out his glove and reached for the ball, but lost his balance and flipped over the railing of the outfield seats.
As he went by me I tried to grab him again and I missed and ... it looked like he was in slow motion as he was going to the ground.
Rangers president Nolan Ryan, a Hall of Fame pitcher, said earlier that the club would review the height of railings at the stadium, even though they currently exceed the city's code limits.
The Rangers held a moment of silence before Friday night's game against the Oakland A's.
The team has set up an account accepting donations in Stone's honor with the Texas Rangers Baseball Foundation.
