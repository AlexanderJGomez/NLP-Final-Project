Jamie Tunnell, Hyde County spokeswoman, said the fireworks were to be used for the annual Fourth of July show on Ocracoke Island, and the five people were members of the crew setting up the display.
Joseph Chestnut, 16, was working at the Ride the Wind kayak-rental stand in Ocracoke when he heard the explosion across the harbor.
"I saw all these fireworks blowing up," he said.
The island, which is part of the Cape Hatteras National Seashore, can be reached only by ferry, private boat or plane.
