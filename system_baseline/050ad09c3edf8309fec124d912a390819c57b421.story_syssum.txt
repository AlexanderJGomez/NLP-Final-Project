(CNN) -- Whoever is running the social media strategy for the New York Police Department needs to be fired because that person has no idea how to follow the rules of social media.
Twitter is a great tool to read breaking news, research prospective clients, connect with friends, discuss live events or gain access to your favorite celebrity.
Twitter users are the youngest demographic of all major social media outlets.
Tweets are like roaches; once you spot a contrarian or sarcastic reply, you know there are hundreds more right behind it, and there's no way to exterminate them.
Even Starbucks, one of the most dominant brands in the United States, is probably publicly hated more than it's praised.
People on social media are ruthlessly honest, way more so than they would be in person.
Despite the overwhelming success of viral positive news websites like Upworthy or Inspire52 (disclaimer: I'm the founder), most content that gets shared online is negative, funny or sarcastic.
Unfortunately, common sense, safe driving and social media rules are a lot like deodorant, the people who need it the most don't use it.
