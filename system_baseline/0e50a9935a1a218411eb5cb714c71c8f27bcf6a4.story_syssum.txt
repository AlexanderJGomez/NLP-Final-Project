(CNN)The fianc√©e of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez has been granted immunity, compelling her to testify at his murder trial, according to a decision released by the trial judge on Tuesday.
He has also pleaded not guilty to weapons charges.
Prosecutors suspect Jenkins of following instructions from Hernandez to get rid of the murder weapon from their home by removing the gun inside a box, putting it in a black trash bag, and borrowing her sister's car to take the bag to a dumpster and throw it away.
Prosecutors said Jenkins, Hernandez's high school sweetheart, lied to a grand jury several times about the presence of guns in their North Attleboro home, among other issues.
Prosecutors allege that on the day after Lloyd's killing, Jenkins got a coded text message from Hernandez.
A home surveillance video shows Jenkins leaving the house about an hour later carrying something "rigid" she described as a box, court documents state.
Hernandez's lawyers have argued there's no way of knowing what was in the box.
"It could be drugs, it could be something that was connected to this crime that he knew about, that he was covering up for somebody else after the fact.
Callan suggested that if Jenkins is put on the stand as a prosecution witness and repeats her grand jury testimony that she threw out the item without knowing what was inside and can't remember where she disposed of it, she could put herself in greater legal jeopardy.
