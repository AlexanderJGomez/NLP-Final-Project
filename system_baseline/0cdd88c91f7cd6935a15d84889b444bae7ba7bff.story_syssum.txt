But New Zealand immigration authorities say the visa was denied because the man "no longer had an acceptable standard of health," that his ability to work was in question and that there is potential "high cost" of his healthcare.
They settled in the city of Christchurch and Buitenhuis found work at a restaurant, the Cashmere Club, where he became known for his "curry of the day."
The agency stated in a media release that obesity alone is not enough to fail the country's required health screenings.
The agency's medical assessors "have to consider to what extent there might be indications of future high-cost and high-need demand for health services."
"I see no problem with potential immigrants being screened for risks to either national health or maybe becoming a financial burden on the taxpayers," he said.
Now 75 pounds lighter, Buitenhuis said he was never warned about not meeting an "acceptable standard of health" until about a year ago.
Since May, the couple have had to stop working because they are considered illegal aliens -- which has thrown their lives into turmoil.
"We also feel that this situation is treated very lightly while it should be abundantly clear to the officials involved with our case that the situation is urgent."
"I think governments are looking for ways to reduce the health care cost burden on the population on the taxpayer," he told CNN.
More than a quarter (28%) of New Zealanders are considered obese, which is considerably lower than the United States (35.7%).
"There's always been a restriction on immigration based on health issues, so the basic principle has always been, if you've got a major health problem that's a drain on the state, that counts against you in immigration," Jim Mann, professor of medicine and nutrition at University of Otago in New Zealand, told CNN.
"If someone says to me, 'is your risk greater from a whole range of medical issues because of obesity?'
