Washington (CNN) -- A Washington lawyer has filed a lawsuit in federal court, claiming he is the father of basketball star LeBron James.
He said his memory of the encounter resurfaced more than 20 years later, "after being asked whether I had a son, and I then systematically explored all of my past for that possibility."
"I have some limitation considerations that caused me to want to file the suit before the end of June," he said.
The lawsuit states Gloria James was 16 at the time of the alleged encounter, but Stovell said she told him she was in her early 20s.
Public records show Stovell is a former government attorney with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Federal court records show the case was settled when the commission paid him $230,000, while not admitting fault.
