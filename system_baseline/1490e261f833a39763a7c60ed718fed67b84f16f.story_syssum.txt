(CNN) -- The dispersant used on the massive Gulf of Mexico oil spill appears to be breaking up within weeks and is less toxic than similar products, according to preliminary testing by the Environmental Protection Agency.
The group is calling for an immediate end to BP's use of dispersants in the Gulf.
The EPA acknowledges that's much more than has been used before in responding to an oil spill.
It initially tried to force BP to use another dispersant on the spill, but the company said no safer products were available in large enough quantities.
