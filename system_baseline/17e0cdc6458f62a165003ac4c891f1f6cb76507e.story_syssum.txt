The acts -- which the Chinese government has not confirmed -- would bring the total number of reported self-immolations by Tibetans in China during the past year to more than 20, according to estimates from advocacy groups.
Radio Free Asia cited Kanyak Tsering, a Tibetan monk with connections to Kirti Monastery who lives in Dharamsala, the Indian town where the Tibetan government in exile resides.
The Chinese authorities closed the market following the act and still hold Tsering Kyi's body, Brigden said, attributing the information to three unidentified people in the area, including one who said they witnessed the events first hand.
Chinese state-run media have confirmed that some self-immolations have taken place in the provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai in recent months.
