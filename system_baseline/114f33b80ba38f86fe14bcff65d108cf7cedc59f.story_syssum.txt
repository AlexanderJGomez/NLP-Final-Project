(CNN) -- A Spanish nurse's assistant who left the hospital Wednesday after beating Ebola said she was still weak but gave thanks to God and the health workers who cared for her that she was still alive.
Romero spent 30 days at the Carlos III Hospital in Madrid, the same hospital where she contracted the illness while helping to care for an infected missionary who had been brought back from West Africa.
"I felt myself isolated, I didn't have contact with the exterior apart from Javier."
Limon followed his wife's statement with a pointed reproach to the Madrid authorities who decided to destroy the couple's dog, Excalibur, out of concern that he might have been carrying the Ebola virus.
"Everyone can be assured that there is no danger whatsoever of her being contagious," he said.
Authorities announced October 19 that tests showed that Romero no longer had Ebola, but she remained in the hospital while further tests were carried out and she recuperated.
