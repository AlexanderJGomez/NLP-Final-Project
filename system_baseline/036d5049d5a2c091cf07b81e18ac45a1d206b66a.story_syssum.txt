A few days later, Clinton called for a temporary extension of President George W. Bush's tax cuts, including those for the wealthy, and then on Thursday said he was sorry for doing so.
When some of Obama's supporters charged that Bill Clinton was subtly playing on racial tensions in the South Carolina primary to stir up white voters, the anger between the two camps intensified.
One strategy, which has been the preference thus far for President Obama, is a campaign of "articulation," a campaign in which a candidate lays out a clear set of themes and ideas to distinguish himself from the opposition.
On the other side of the aisle, Ronald Reagan ran this kind of campaign in 1980, when he stood by the ideals of conservatism, insisting that the right offered a better path forward for a broken nation.
He focused on his personality, his background in Georgia and the argument that voters in the post-Watergate age could trust him.
In essence, he stole the mainstream part of the Republican agenda and made it his own.
The danger of triangulation is that it dampens the enthusiasm of base supporters who are needed to help raise money and bring out the vote.
Obama's best bet is to stick with a campaign in which he focuses on defining a Democratic set of principles and offering voters a reason why his party would be better over the next four years, especially on the economy.
