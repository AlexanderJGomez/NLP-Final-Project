The Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant -- the subject of a battle between state authorities and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission over its continued operation -- uses one of 23 U.S. reactors built with a General Electric-designed containment housing known as the Mark I.
Stephen Hanauer, a former top safety official at what was then the Atomic Energy Commission, warned in 1971 that in an accident in which the core slowly loses coolant and overheats, the Mark I containment "would overpressurize.
Hanauer agreed with that decision, which GE and plant operators have pointed out.
One of those was a 1989 push for utilities to install a vent system that would release steam from the containment during an emergency.
The NRC has rejected a petition by anti-nuclear groups to immediately shut down all reactors using the GE Mark I containment.
But he said the NRC "punted" in the face of industry resistance by calling only for utilities to install vents.
But he noted that at Three Mile Island, the worst U.S. accident to date, there were "essentially zero emissions" from its much larger containment structure.
But he added, "The GE Mark I containment structure design is a proven, reliable technology.
"We need still a little bit more time to find out what really happened," said John Lee, a nuclear engineering professor at the University of Michigan.
The reactors are of a different design than the GE plants at Fukushima Daiichi and in the United States.
