Boston (CNN)The death penalty trial of accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev -- long delayed by painstaking jury selection, crippling snowstorms and last-ditch appeals to move the case someplace else -- is on track to get underway here next week.
The jurors first will decide whether Tsarnaev is guilty of using weapons of mass destruction to kill people at a large public event.
The defense, claiming it couldn't find an impartial jury in Boston, tried three times to persuade O'Toole to move the trial.
Opening statements and the first witnesses originally were slated for January 26, but it took longer that anticipated to question the prospective jurors for this high-profile case.

No cameras are allowed at the Tsarnaev trial.
