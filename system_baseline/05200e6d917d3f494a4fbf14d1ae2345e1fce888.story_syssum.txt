There were 18 people aboard the helicopter when it went down, about 30 nautical miles from St. John's.
The debris filled a six-mile area, said Jeri Grychowski of the Rescue Coordination Centre in Halifax.
Those aboard should have have been wearing survival suits that would have kept them dry and were equipped with lights and personal locator beacons, but the suits have not helped searchers.
Early in the day, high winds and seas hampered the search, but by late afternoon, the weather had improved, though seas were still about 13 to 16 feet (4 to 5 meters) and winds were at about 40 knots (46 mph).
The helicopter had been heading to the Hibernia offshore oil platform when it went down in what Grychowski called a controlled emergency crash landing.
