But Hantuchova held serve twice to seal one of the biggest victories of her career and set up a meeting with 2009 champion Svetlana Kuznetsova in the last 16, after she beat Canadian Rebecca Marino 6-0 6-4.
After Wozniacki's exit, and Kim Clijsters defeat on Thursday, the trend for upsets continued as Australian 8th seed Samantha Stosur was beaten by unseeded Gisela Dulko.
The Argentine set the tone by taking the first four games of the match, and though she dropped the second set, Stosur's 35 unforced errors counted as Dulko wrapped up the match.
Elsewhere, defending champion and fifth seed, Francesca Schiavone, from Italy, had no such trouble making the fourth round after her Chinese opponent Shuai Peng retired hurt with the score at 6-3 1-2.
