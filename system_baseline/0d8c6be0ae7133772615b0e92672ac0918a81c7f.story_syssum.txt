Government forces took the area in a surprise attack early Sunday, the head of Sri Lanka's army announced.
Troops crossed a lagoon and entered the town of Mullaittivu before encountering heavy resistance from Tamil fighters, according to the government-run news agency.
In recent days, the military has made significant progress in its campaign to recapture rebel strongholds.
The recapture enabled the government to use a highway linking the mainland to the peninsula to move troops and supplies.
The United Nations is "calling on the ... Tamil Tigers to meet their international responsibilities and guarantee that these very large civilian populations to move freely and then can move away from the conflict and to areas where they can receive appropriate assistance," Elder said.
"The Sri Lankan authorities are doing little to ensure the safety of the country's media, or to prosecute those responsible for murdering or attacking them," Amnesty International spokeswoman Yolanda Foster said in a written statement on Friday.
