(WIRED) -- Research In Motion is preparing to release its much-awaited response to the iPad, the BlackBerry PlayBook tablet, a month behind schedule.
Even though Flash Player 10.2 for Android is now available in the Android Market, the version meant for Android 3.0 Honeycomb (which the Xoom runs) is a prerelease version with significant limitations and lots of instability.
That was an early version of the tablet, but choppiness in one of its key features doesn't bode well.
Last year RIM drummed up Flash support for the upcoming PlayBook, saying that it was going to deliver the full internet experience.
Adobe and RIM didn't respond to a request for comment on this story.
