To compound the issue, star striker Samuel Eto'o looks likely to receive a retrospective ban after television cameras showed him head-butting opponent Bostjan Cesar in the chest late in the first half.
"It's clear that after a defeat no-one is happy, the only thing I can say is that we worked very hard today and our reaction in the second half on a terrible pitch showed great character," Benitez said, AFP reported.
Pazzini opened his account after eight minutes and doubled his tally shortly before halftime from the penalty spot.
Andrea Caracciolo gave Brescia the lead after 20 minutes when he converted a penalty, but two second half goals within three minutes of each other from striker Alessandro Matri and midfielder Daniele Conti.
Palermo move up to seventh in the table after beating Cesena 2-1, while bottom placed Bari lost 1-0 to 10-man Catania after Christian Terlizzi scored a late winner.
