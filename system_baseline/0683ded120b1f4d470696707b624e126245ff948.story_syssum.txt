Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- The alleys and archways along Rashid Street in central Tripoli were plunged in darkness this weekend, as the Libyan capital struggled to cope with widespread shortages of electricity.
Others sat silently in doorways, their presence only marked by the glow of a cigarette butt.
Frustration could be felt at a recent government press conference, when a Libyan man repeatedly pressed Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim on why some Tripoli neighborhoods had power while others suffered black-outs for days.
"There is no evidence to suggest that if the country's power lines have been damaged, such an event could be linked to a NATO strike," the spokesman wrote.
a taxi driver yelled on Saturday, as he thumped a plastic jug full of fuel sitting in the back passenger seat of his car.
The Reuters news agency has distributed video filmed Thursday of the tanker Cartagena sailing into the Libyan rebel capital of Benghazi.
"The MV Cartagena was outside Maltese territorial waters," an official from the Maltese Foreign Ministry wrote to CNN in an e-mail, after being asked about allegations of the ship's capture by rebels.
Meanwhile, tempers were flaring at the Ghot al-Shaal shopping district in western Tripoli, where almost all the shops were dark and stifling hot due to the lack of electricity and air-conditioning.
At a nearby fruit and vegetable bazaar, some passersby yelled pro-Gadhafi chants and vowed to stand strong against rebel and NATO attacks.
One store owner decided to deal with summer heat and lack of electricity by simply closing shop early.
