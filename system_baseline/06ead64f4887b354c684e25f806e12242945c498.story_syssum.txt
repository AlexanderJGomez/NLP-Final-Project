It has led his former Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie to question the wisdom of the lack of match practice, but McIlroy was adamant Tuesday that his approach worked for him.
"It might not work for other people, but I feel as if it's the best way for me to approach a tournament.
McIlroy tees off at Royal St George's in the 140th edition of golf's oldest major at 9.09 local time with Ernie Els of South African and fellow young gun Rickie Fowler of the United States.
He will be looking to match the spectacular 63 at last year's British Open at St Andrews which gave him the first round lead, but not the second round 80 which ended his chances of victory.
"As soon as you get that one win, it kind of opened up the door, gave me a lot of confidence, and I've been playing very well since then," he added.
