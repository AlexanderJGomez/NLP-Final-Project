Investigators in the case have uncovered a series of text messages between Obermiller and her boyfriend, identified by police and by Obermiller's parents as 20-year-old Robert Young of Norwalk, that appear to be coordinating when she would be picked up from her grandparents' home in the early morning hours of June 7, Fulton said.
The last text message from Obermiller appeared to direct Young to her location, Fulton said.
In it, she tells her "bestest friend" that she won't be able to talk for a while so "don't forget me," according to Fulton.
"We do believe that Bobby does know where she's at, he just doesn't want to tell us," Obermiller's mother, Rose Obermiller, told HLN's "Prime News" on Monday night.
"But as it went on, he was telling her, 'No I don't want you to be class treasurer; no, I don't want you to go to New York with your choir; no, I don't want you to see these friends and relatives," Obermiller said.
