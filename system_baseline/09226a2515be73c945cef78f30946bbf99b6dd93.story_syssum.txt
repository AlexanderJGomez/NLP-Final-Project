The Dubai-based airline is aiming for the high-end business traveler with a new luxury private jet service.
The front of the aircraft has a dining area and executive lounge designed to seat 12 people.
While the world's super-rich may still be able afford their own private aircrafts, the chartering of executive jets is a growing market.
Although hampered by lack of airspace and facilities, in the coming years China is expected to see a 15% increase in number of private jets flying in its skies, according to Bombardier.
David Velupillai, marketing director of executive and private aviation for Airbus says that their jets -- from A318s to superjumbo A380s -- can be fitted out according to their clients' needs.
