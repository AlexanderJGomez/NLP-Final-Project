Goto covered big news stories for years, hoping that by telling them he could make a difference in the world.
According to Yukawa's friend Nobuo Kimoto, Goto passed along insights on how to survive in Syria and introduced him to rebel fighters, who are distinct from ISIS though both are fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces.

Speaking out for the first time Thursday, Goto's wife, Rinko, said her husband "was taken from me October 25" although she didn't know it until a December 2 message from his captors landed in her inbox.
Now, after working "tirelessly behind the scenes," she went public to "beg the Jordanian and Japanese governments to understand that the fates of both (Goto and  al-Kaseasbeh) are in their hands."
While Goto's decision to go to Syria surprised his mother, his rationale did not.

I want to pass on his thoughts to people around the world."
