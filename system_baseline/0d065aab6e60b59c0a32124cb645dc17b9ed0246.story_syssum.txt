Washington (CNN) -- The Phoenix VA, where dozens of veterans died waiting for care and were placed on secret wait lists, was in total "chaos" with patients needing urgent care and often unable to get it, officials from the VA's Inspector General's Office testified at a Senate hearing Tuesday.
The VA system might need as many as 28,000 doctors and other medical staff to help fix the problems and provide proper and timely care to veterans, said McDonald, who also testified.
In addition the report found 17 other "care deficiencies that were unrelated to access or scheduling," and of those 17 patients, 14 died.
The IG report at the heart of the hearing described what Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who is chairman of the Committee on Veterans Affairs, called "inexcusable" practices in Phoenix.
"This report cannot capture the personal disappointment, frustration and loss of faith individual veterans and their family members had in the health care system that often could not respond to their mental and physical health needs in a timely manner," said Griffin.
McDonald said that as of August 15, the Veterans Health Administration had contacted more than 294,000 veterans and had decreased the electronic wait list nationwide by 57%.
"We are trying to demonstrate to young people studying in the medical profession that VA's where they want to work," McDonald said.
His questioning hinged on a line in the report that indicated that the delays in care could not be conclusively linked to the deaths.
Griffin explained that he hoped to have the results of the 93 additional site reviews completed by the end of the year.
He told the senators there is a new push to have many changes made before Veterans Day in November.
