(CNN) -- Writer and producer Larry Gelbart, most known for his work on the hit television series "M*A*S*H," died Friday morning in his Beverly Hills, California, home, his wife said.
"I never had any aspirations of [a] literary career, but writing for radio seemed to be a natural extension of being such a radio fan," Gelbart told CNN in 1999.
Later, he joined the staff of Bob Hope's show and jump-started his own television career as a TV writer for the star.
In 1972, Gelbart helped create the Korean War comedy drama "M*A*S*H." The show went on for another 11 years, although Gelbart only wrote and produced "M*A*S*H" for the first four seasons.
And once the war stopped we didn't start feeling really terrific right away, if we ever will again about that situation."
Gelbart continued steamrolling through the industry, with works including the 1982 hit film "Tootsie," "Oh, God!"
