On the eve of the reboot of the franchise, with a younger and more realistic Lara, the life president of Eidos told me about that snowy night in March of 1995 when he reluctantly decided to travel to Derby England via car from Birmingham.
For a generation, video games had been 2-D worlds with the action moving across the screen.
Eidos bought Core Design and in 1996 Lara Croft, with her short trousers and large bust, hit computer screens.
They got the exclusive European distribution rights to the board game on the back of ordering just six copies of D&D, according to Livingstone, and the set about trying to sell the games to stores.
"We had to live in a van for three months as we tried to get people to understand this strange role-playing game," Livingstone told me.
Now, with a CBE in the pocket and the honor title of Life President for Eidos -- a brand name now owned by Square Enix -- Livingstone is more of a advocate for the British video games and film graphics business.
Livingstone and Alex Hope, of Double Negative, were asked to make recommendations to the government to transform the school curriculum to teach people how to program, and not just use, video games.
And realism goes to looks, behavior, and everything about the woman is real."
But not be raped, Livingstone told me, recalling a misstep by an employee who said last year that one scene could be seen as the prelude to a sexual assault.
The player has the tools to overcome the man and kill him within seconds, Livingstone said.
Lara lives on.
