Unlike the last time they elected a president, the result of this election is a foregone conclusion.
Morsy's former defense minister, el-Sisi, who removed him from office after substantial protests almost a year ago, and the Nasserist contender, Hamdeen Sabahi, who came in third in the last presidential elections.
Sabahi will struggle tremendously -- if he were to win even 25% of the vote, it would be a respectable showing in the circumstances.
The first theme relates to a number of radical violent groups, such as "Ansar Beit al-Maqdis," which have been targeting police officers and military personnel over the past year.
Sisi's non-Islamist opposition may acquiesce to the electoral result -- but they could still prove to be an additional thorn in the government's side, agitating for progressive change.
The military's top brass generally supported el-Sisi's retirement, in order for him to run for the presidency, and for the time being at least, that institution will back him.
If el-Sisi does not tackle the weighty problems concerning the economy, security (including security sector reform), and corruption, he should expect there to be a reaction.
