More than 700 of the iconic animals starved or otherwise died on the mountainsides during an unusually harsh winter, and more than 1,600 were shot by hunters or sent to slaughterhouses in a disease-control effort, according to National Park Service figures.
Government officials say the slaughter prevents the spread of the disease brucellosis from the Yellowstone bison to cattle on land near the park.
"The plan requires all of us to do two things: protect a viable wild bison population and reduce the risk of transmission of brucellosis from bison to cattle.
There is no documented case of the disease passing from bison to cattle, they said.
Last month, two women chained themselves to a railing inside the park's visitor center to protest the policy.
When the weather becomes too harsh and food becomes scarce, they often roam outside the park.
That's because just two cases of brucellosis would trigger stringent limits on export of cattle from Montana.
"Montana has spent millions of dollars over the years to get brucellosis eradicated from our livestock," said Martin Davis, who has a cattle ranch within roaming distance north of the park.
Under the management plan, rangers and cowboys hired by various government agencies try to harass stray animals back onto park property.
(Ranchers are not permitted to kill wild bison).
"The Montana cattle ranchers don't want the competition for grass," he said.
"The reality of the situation is that whether you have 4,000 bison or whether you have 200 bison, bison are a nomadic species and they will always be looking out to the horizon and expanding their boundaries," said Tim Reid, chief deputy ranger at Yellowstone.
"The Yellowstone bison population is healthy, it's strong, it's vibrant.
