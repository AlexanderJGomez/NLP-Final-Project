The election, which opponents charge was rigged, was followed by street demonstrations and civil unrest that led to the deaths of at least 20 protesters and the arrest of more than 1,000, according to Iranian state-run media.
Some Iranians collaborated with enemies, the president said.
"With this election, we have entered a new era ... in domestic spheres and on an international level," he added.
He said experts have been invited to help the government achieve progress.
