Davenport, who is a Tea Party activist and an elected member of the central committee of the Republican Party of Orange County, said she felt the e-mail was a joke, CNN affiliate KTLA reported.
"I am an imperfect Christian lady who tries her best to live a Christ-like honoring life," the statement said.
Scott Baugh, chairman of the Republican Party of Orange County, said he was surprised by the e-mail.
"There's still consequences for what she's done and what she's done will continue to bring controversy to my party so I'm inclined to think at this time that she should still resign from the committee."
