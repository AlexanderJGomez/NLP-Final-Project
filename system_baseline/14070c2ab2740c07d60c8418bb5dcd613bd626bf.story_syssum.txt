Columbus, Ohio (CNN) -- Teaching Mandarin is a growing trend across schools in the United States, where the number of students enrolling in Chinese language and cultural programs has tripled in recent years.
The funds will be used, school officials say, to support their visiting teacher from China and to foster the newly formed relationship with their sister school in the southern Chinese province of Kunming.
During his visit to the United States this week, Chinese President Hu Jintao plans to visit one such program at the Walter Payton College Prep school in Chicago.
Her son is a sophomore and has taken a serious interest in the language.
But the program doesn't sit that well with everyone, in part because of the Chinese government's role.
"A lot of Americans don't really know much about Chinese culture so they see it as alien so it's bad.
Outside Los Angeles, the Hacienda La Puente Unified School District was set to receive similar funds from the Chinese government through the Confucius Classroom network.
School administrator Hank Langhals stressed that a relationship, however small, between China and the United States will be mutually beneficial in the long run.
"We don't agree with everything, how the system works in China, but hopefully as it opens more and more, which it certainly has, they will become more democratic, they will become more open with less censorship, so you hope that's all there," Langhals said.
I think the more you're exposed to another culture, the more you understand each other, you're just a more well-rounded person.
