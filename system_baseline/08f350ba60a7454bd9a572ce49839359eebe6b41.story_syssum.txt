(CNN) -- "Borderlands 2" wants to raise the stakes and improve upon its signature art style and outlandish weapons while broadening the story on the planet of Pandora.
This time, Maya the Siren has the ability to trap foes in a force field hovering in midair, making them easy targets for damage.
The art style remains the same as in the original, with its familiar hand-painted look and dark outlines.
"A lot of it is drawn right on to the texture models themselves.
Why is that so much more important than finding a Vault (the final object in the first game)?"
Senior producer Sean Reardon echoed those sentiments and said community involvement in the first title and its three downloadable updates was important in figuring out what gamers liked and what worked best.
Reardon built his development team out of people who had worked on the series as well as new talent that he felt were the best at what they do.
More than 200 unique types of creatures will be in the way of players as they work their way through the game quests and other missions.
Gamers will have to wait until September 18 to find out if this game is more enjoyable than the first.
