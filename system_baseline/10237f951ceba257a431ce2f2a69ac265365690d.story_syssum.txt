Even most of those who agree presidents can't do much to lower gas prices acknowledge they must be perceived as doing everything they can to ease the suffering.
If President Obama can't change the perception that he can't do anything about it, he could find himself pumping his own gas after November.
They will come to see his energy policy -- calling oil "the fuel of the past," and slowing the permit process for drilling in the Gulf -- as crafted to please his friends in the green movement.
President Obama can argue that changing his policies would not dramatically increase domestic oil supplies in the short run.
President Obama seems to be leaning toward dipping into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which may or may not work since that move does not actually increase production.
The president is right that drilling alone will not satisfy our domestic needs.
It will be environmentally responsible because production of oil under U.S. environmental standards is among the strictest in the world.
If gas prices don't retreat soon, Americans will cancel their vacations, the seasonal industries that depend on those vacations will wilt, consumer spending will slow and the administration's hopes of showing concrete signs of an economic recovery by Election Day will fade.
