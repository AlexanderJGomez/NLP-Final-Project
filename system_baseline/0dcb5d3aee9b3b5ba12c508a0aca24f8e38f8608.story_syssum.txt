So, it sparks a little incredulity when -- on the heels of five players' arrests, the indefinite suspension of a premier running back and the deactivation of two of the NFL's biggest stars -- yet another NFL player is alleged to have exacted violence against loved ones.
It was the latest public relations debacle for the NFL, as Dwyer brought the total number of players facing domestic violence or child abuse charges to six, after July incidents in which police say he broke his wife's nose with a head butt and punched her in the face.
Peterson then took a leave of absence and Goodell placed him on the exempt list, which gives the team the opportunity to continue to pay him while he deals with his legal issues.
Hardy played one game then was deactivated as the outrage against the NFL grew over how it was dealing with domestic violence issues.
Trent Crump, a Phoenix police spokesman, said it would be reckless to identify the victims.
The woman didn't allege any violence until last week, when she called from another state, where she had moved with the child.
The players' union has complained that Rice didn't receive due process from Goodell, who suspended him in June to a two-game ban, then increased the penalty to an indefinite suspension.
Neither the team nor the league has levied any discipline in the case, and the starter at left defensive tackle played the first two games of the season.
Enunwa was charged with simple assault after a woman told police he pulled her off a bed at a hotel, causing a head injury, ESPNNewYork.com reported.
