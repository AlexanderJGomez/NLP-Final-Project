Some lava is flowing, and the volcano is spewing a cloud of steam and ash that has risen as high as 28,000 feet, said Schneider, at the observatory in Anchorage.
"It's a pretty good size, but not high enough to affect overflying aircraft between America and Asia," he said.
The eruptions of both volcanoes compare to those in the past, where activity lasted for weeks or months before dying down again.
"Our best estimate of what is going to happen is similar to what's happened in the past -- this level of activity and some level of ash."
