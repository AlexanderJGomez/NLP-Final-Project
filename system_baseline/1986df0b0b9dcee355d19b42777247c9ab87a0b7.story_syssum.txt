(CNN) -- Ten years ago, Blair and Estelle Hunt entered the wine business with nothing more than a bare plot of land.
And, it was the first time a vineyard outside France took Decanter magazine's top prize for best pinot noir over Â£10.
They sold their house in Sydney and moved to rural New Zealand to search for something to keep them occupied in later life.
"We knew that from research on record we had good soil types and in relative proximity we could see grapes growing.
Every weekend they'd drive up into the hills from their home in Balclutha, South Otago to tend their vines.
Until June, Blair Hunt was working full-time as the Chief Executive of the local hospital.
We used to spend a lot more time in the vineyard but as time went by we discovered that there was more and more paperwork to be done."
Blair is quick to correct the suggestion that their success is anything other than the result of hard work by a dedicated viticulturalist and his team, as well as an expert winemaker.
But underneath it all is a shared philosophy, which is to do everything in the vineyard and winemaking to make the best wine possible.
At Bald Hills, there are two wind-machines on standby if the temperature starts to plummet.
And, despite the scarcity of the product -- there are only 100 "uncommitted" cases left -- the Hunts have not put up the price -- yet.
At the end of the day you're talking about long term viability and sustainability rather than short-term gains," Blair says.
