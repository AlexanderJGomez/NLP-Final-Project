The Food and Drug Administration has little authority to regulate bottled brands, according to a U.S. Congressional report released recently.
The nonprofit advocacy organization surveyed the labels and Web sites of nearly 200 popular bottled-water brands and found that less than 2 percent disclosed three important facts that can affect safety: the water's source, purification methods, and chemical pollutants in each bottle.
Reaching for the most popular bottled brands isn't necessarily a solution.
In fact, the EWG report found that some of the best-known brands -- for example Whole Foods and San Pellegrino -- are the least likely to report where the water comes from and what it contains.
In recent years, some reports have suggested that tap water could be contaminated by trace amounts of pharmaceuticals or other substances.
Lately, recalls of spinach, sprouts, peanut butter, and, most recently, cookie dough have made many consumers start to question the safety of the items they find on grocery-store shelves.
Only changes in the current regulations would make it mandatory for manufacturers to make those kinds of records public, he says.
The proposed Food Safety Enhancement Act covers many aspects of food safety, including better preventive control measures by food manufacturers, more frequent inspections of facilities, and greater FDA authority over food recalls.
