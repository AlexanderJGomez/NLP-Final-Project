DENVER, Colorado (CNN)  -- On a historic night for America, Barack Obama secured the Democratic Party's nomination for president and emerged for the first time on stage in Denver with running mate Sen. Joe Biden.
On Thursday, the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I have a dream" speech, in the culmination of the Democratic National Convention, Obama will address an estimated 70,000 people at Invesco field in Denver.
Former President Bill Clinton reflected on the significance of the moment in his address before the Democratic National Convention.
President Clinton and Biden, two of the party's elder statesmen, lavished praise upon the newly crowned nominee and did their best to paint Republican rival Sen. John McCain as a candidate who would lead the country down a dangerous path.
According to a new CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll, 78 percent of registered voters said they believe McCain can handle the responsibilities of commander in chief, compared to 58 percent for Obama.
The ex-president had been one of the most vocal critics of Obama during the protracted primary season.
Clinton seemed to change that narrative as he declared his support for Obama.
"As we gather here tonight, our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history.
Biden, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is widely believed to have been chosen for the Democratic presidential ticket based on his foreign policy credentials.
