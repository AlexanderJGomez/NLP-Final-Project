(Travel + Leisure) -- The Web is an essential tool for travelers, but as booking engines and trip forums evolve and multiply, you have to know where to look -- and whom to trust.
Decide how much you want to spend and when you want to travel, and Getaway Maps will overlay the lowest fares pulled from more than 500 airlines (most of the major U.S. carriers, as well as many international ones) for a select range of cities.
A supplementary service called FareGuard ($10) covers the difference if they tell you to wait for a price to go down and it rises instead.
Search hotels by ratings in your city of choice, and the site turns up an impressive mix of reduced rates on rooms at luxury properties.
Preview seat maps including where to find the power outlets as well as that extra inch of legroom for 73 models of aircraft on 39 different airlines.
Along with all the basics (hotel, restaurant, and entertainment ideas), get tips on what to read before you go.
Research almost anything about 60 different cruise lines and gather advice on everything ship-related -- from buying travel insurance to using onboard slot machines.
Maps feature pop-ups with descriptions and pictures of the desired destinations; directions include estimates about what you'll spend on gas; they even tip you off to speed traps.
The standout stuff: live feeds of traffic conditions and street views of major U.S. cities (only slightly creepy); addresses, phone numbers and Web sites for what you're mapping.
(Information is culled from the state departments of the U.S., Canada, Australia and the U.K.) Also included: tips on local customs and transportation.
