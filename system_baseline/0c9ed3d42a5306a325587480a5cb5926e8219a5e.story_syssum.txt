Iran suspended the death by stoning after there was international outcry over the sentence, but may reinstate it in coming days.
In a letter written to the International Committee against Stoning and sent Saturday to CNN, Kian argued the Iranian judicial system has mishandled Ashtiani's case.
"Because of morality and ethics, I cannot go into the details of the crimes, but if the public knew, they would understand the criminal nature of them," he said, according to IRNA.
"Now that Iran is under this international pressure, they have brought the case up that convicts her of the murder of her husband," Ahadi said Saturday.
Ashtiani's other lawyer, Mohammad Mostafaei, is being protected by European diplomats after he fled to Turkey from Iran.
