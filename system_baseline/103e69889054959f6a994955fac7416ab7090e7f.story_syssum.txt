Perhaps now -- after becoming the first British man to win Wimbledon for what seemed an eternity, Andy Murray will finally feel loved.
He cried tears of pain and anguish -- showing a part of himself of which very few ever knew existed following his final defeat.
That defeat in the final to Roger Federer was a turning point -- not just in Murray's career, but in his relationship with British tennis fans.
Fast-forward 12 months and with the U.S. Open title already in the bag and the experience of winning Olympic gold on the very same court, Murray produced his finest hour.
It was the year that Jesse Owens won four gold medals at the Munich Olympics, the year when the Spanish Civil War began,a time when King Edward VIII abdicated the throne to marry Wallis Simpson and Franklin D. Roosevelt was reelected President of the U.S. following a landslide victory.
His dramatic five set win over Djokovic at the U.S. Open last September came on the back of his Olympic triumph and gave him the belief he belonged at the very top.
In his quarterfinal tie against Fernando Verdasco, he came from two sets down to triumph, while he also trailed in his semifinal before fighting back to claim victory.
There was fight, there was passion, but there was also a vital component of coolness in the heat of the battle which gave him an extra edge.
Once again, Murray was forced to call upon his powers of recovery, using even muscle and straining every sinew in a bid to level the set.
Each time, with the pressure growing and the specter of failure on the horizon, Murray held firm.
The rocky road to love might have been a long one but this love affair between Murray and the British public could be just beginning.
