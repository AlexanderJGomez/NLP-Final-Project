After winning the Colombian pageant, she quickly found work as a lingerie model in Mexico and other countries.
Interpol had issued an arrest warrant against her in December of the previous year after she was connected to a 21-year-old woman who was arrested just before she was to board a flight to Cancun, Mexico, from Buenos Aires carrying 55 kilograms of cocaine (120 pounds).
After being convicted in early November, Sanclemente is speaking from prison for the first time.
Four men and two other women were also arrested in connection with the case.
She says her Argentinian boyfriend and his uncle, who are also in prison, were indeed involved in drug trafficking, but not her.
Now 32 and sentenced to six years and eight months behind bars, the promising career she once had seems like a vanished dream.
In an interview shortly after being dethroned, she spoke about the consequences of not listening to the woman who raised her as single mother.
