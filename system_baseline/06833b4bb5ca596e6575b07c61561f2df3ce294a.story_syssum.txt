The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives this week for the first time made public the tests it has done on a model of handgun called the Liberator, made using 3-D printer technology.
The fired round traveled 8 to 11 inches into a piece of gelatin molded to simulate human soft tissue; by comparison a commercially available .380 pistol fired a round 18 inches in the same simulation.
Another pistol made from a plastic called Visijet didn't perform as well in ATF tests.
The group Defense Distributed says it exists "to defend the civil liberty of popular access to arms as guaranteed by the United States Constitution and affirmed by the United States Supreme Court, through facilitating global access to, and the collaborative production of, information and knowledge related to the 3D printing of arms."
"Think about this: there is the possibility that (if) this legislation is (not) renewed and it expires in early December ... plastic guns could not be detected by metal detectors (and) could be smuggled into a variety of places.
A handful of lawmakers are backing bills in the House and Senate to try to extend the detectable firearms law but there's no indication they'll get a vote in a Congress that is bitterly divided on many issues, including gun safety laws.
