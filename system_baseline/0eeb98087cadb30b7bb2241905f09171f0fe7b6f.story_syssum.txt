Martin O'Malley is laying the groundwork for a presidential campaign with the intent of being ready should Hillary Clinton not run, a source close to the governor told CNN.
But outside of Biden, who can probably wait a little longer than most due to his name recognition and certain advantages associated with his office, no one else outside of O'Malley is setting themselves up as he is for becoming Clinton's understudy.
And that may be with good reason, as an O'Malley vs. Clinton race would likely be an uphill slog for the governor.
And for O'Malley, who has little name recognition outside the Mid-Atlantic, the numbers are particularly stark.
In a November 2013 CNN/ ORC International Poll, 2% of Democrats said they would like to see O'Malley nominated for President in 2016.
Money: O'Malley's "O' Say Can You See PAC" announced it raised $1.6 million in 2013, money that was used to help a number of state and local candidates.
And while that would fit his record, there seems to little room in the race for a liberal candidate.
The governor is now, less than a year before he leaves the office, pushing for the cherry on top of his governing record: a raise of the Maryland minimum wage to $10.10.
During the 2008 primaries -- which pitted Clinton against then-Sen. Barack Obama -- O'Malley was outspoken and raised a substantial amount of money.
He was even among the Clinton campaign's "Hillraisers," a group of loyal Democrats who funneled more than $100,000 in donations to the campaign.
