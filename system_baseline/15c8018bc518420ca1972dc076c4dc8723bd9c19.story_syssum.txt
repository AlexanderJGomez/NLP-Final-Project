It led police to the body of a boy, who had been buried there in a shallow grave less than 48 hours earlier.
Police say the Native American or Hispanic boy was between 3 and 5 years old, 38 pounds, 38 inches in height, with brown eyes and dark quarter-inch hair.
Albuquerque Police Department spokesman John Walsh said a preliminary autopsy didn't reveal a cause of death.
Until then, members of the community have spent hours at memorials for the boy -- who none of them knew -- praying for him and raising money.
Her money, and the donations raised by others, will go toward a plaque at the park in the boy's honor, buying extra lights for the playground and to a fund toward finding out what happened to the little "Baby Justice."
