It was a high-profile public media event, but for me it was personal.
As the clock ran out, a trumpeter in the pep band thought it would be cute to mark the demise of the rival team by playing Taps.
He was drowned out by cheers, and by amused laughter at the cleverness of the trumpeter.
Later, Dad explained to me that his strong emotions went back nearly 15 years when he was an officer on Gen. William Woodward's staff during the 104th Infantry Division's assault on Nazi Germany.
Over the course of three days, I held a small tape recorder between us as he talked about his life.
He'd been describing the day he came across a group of Timberwolf infantrymen who'd been caught in a crossfire and slaughtered.
At the Atlanta reunion, I had a chance to relay Dad's appreciation of the infantry to several of the veterans I met -- and I listened as many of them talked about their experiences.
Another said he wrote down his story but hid the manuscript in a safe deposit box for his children to read after his death.
The bodies of 5,000 starved prisoners were stacked like cordwood and the few hundred survivors were like walking skeletons.)
He told me it took years, and the help of several understanding people, to restore in him a semblance of faith.
An experience, I fear, that will be lost forever if more of us don't encourage these men and women to tell their stories for history.
