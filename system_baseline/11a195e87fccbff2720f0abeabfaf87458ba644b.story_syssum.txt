(CNN) -- The Philippine House of Representatives and Senate were meeting Monday to debate the imposition of martial law in the country's south by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in the aftermath of last month's massacre of 57 civilians.
The debate began as elite forces of the Philippine National Police clashed in the town of Datu Unsay with suspected followers of the politically powerful Ampatuan family, which has been implicated in the massacre, the Philippine News Agency reported Monday.
Over the weekend, authorities raided at least one warehouse and ranch belonging to the family.
"But it is taking long to build a case, so I think the government gave us a free hand in arresting those who are suspects, and allowed us to search, even without warrant.
The Maguindanao massacre, however, is the worst politically motivated violence in recent Philippine history, according to state media.
Andal Ampatuan Sr., the father of the accused mayor, saying he would be kidnapped if he filed the papers himself.
