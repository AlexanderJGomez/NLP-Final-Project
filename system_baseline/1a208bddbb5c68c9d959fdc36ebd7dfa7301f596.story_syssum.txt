Errand Frazier of Vero Beach wasn't quite sure what to do at first when he heard purring coming from his Chevy pickup, parked outside his house in late May.
Taking matters into his own hands, he reached for his toolbox, took out some sheet metal cutters and cut back the metal on the side of the truck bed.
In the past, Frazier said, he has rescued stray kittens and brought them to the local Humane Society.
Frazier could see that the cat was under the bed of his truck, lodged in the frame, and he couldn't get to it.
Humane Society staff member Tonya Martinez got under Frazier's truck to try to move the kitten forward, while staff member Maria Valencia put on gloves to catch the kitty and animal care supervisor Robyn Krajewski stood ready with a special carrier, said Janet Winikoff, director of education at the local Humane Society, who posted the story on CNN iReport.
The cat has since been adopted by a family with two teenage girls, adoption counselor Sue Kelly said.
She said it didn't cross their mind to look into repairing it because she knew they couldn't afford it.
On Friday, the couple said they weren't worried about the truck and hoped people would just donate to the humane society to help other animals.
