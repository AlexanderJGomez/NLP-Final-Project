So what's next for the much maligned people featured on the hit site Rich Kids of Instagram?
Many of the images featured on the Tumblr were tagged with keywords on Instagram that made them easy to find, like #wealth, #mansion and #yacht.
Ierna's photos have been featured on RKOI multiple times -- one shows him in front of a large yacht in the Hamptons and another is an image of a Versace gold-plated AK47.
The public's fascination with these kids has not gone unnoticed by Hollywood, where wealthy personalities are a huge draw on shows like "Keeping up with the Kardashians" and the "Real Housewives" series.
"I would consider doing a reality show, it would be a very smart businessÂ decision," said Ierna, who said he has been offered a spot on a reality TV show in the past but turned it down.
Alexa Dell, daughter of Dell CEO Michael Dell, had her social media presence quickly scrubbed from the Internet after a photo of her brother on a private plane to Fiji, feasting on a spread of fruit 3-feet deep, made it to the RKOI blog.
Between her active Instagram and Twitter accounts, Alexa Dell was leaving a trail of information, including locations and timing of trips, that could have been used by kidnappers or burglars.
He is proud of his hobby -- he has 300 hours of flight experience and wants to be a commercial airline pilot when he's older.
Morales thinks the interest in the Rich Kids of Instagram blog is because "people cant find anything else to do with their lives so they stalk other people's photos and make a big deal out of it."
"I think it accurately represents my lifestyle to some extent," said Ierna of his photos.
