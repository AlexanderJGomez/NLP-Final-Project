Standing about 5 feet tall with an average wingspan of 8 feet, it soars over the Boragaon landfill like a great protector.
The Boragaon landfill is located in the city of Guwahati, about 300 miles from Bangladesh near the Bhutanese border.
The greater adjutant stork initially drew Bouldry to Boragaon, but he became connected with the people.
"They don't look at the things they're doing as being unsanitary or unhealthy or unsafe," Bouldry said.
Their homes are constructed by recycled materials, with sometimes several families living in one shanty at a time.
Bouldry lives and works inside the La Chureca landfill in Nicaragua, one of the largest landfills in the world.
In addition to his photography, he teaches English and yoga classes a few times per week.
"This is my 'thank you' to the informal recyclers of the world," he said.
