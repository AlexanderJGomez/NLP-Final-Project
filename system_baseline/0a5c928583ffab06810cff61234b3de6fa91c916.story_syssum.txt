The Seminoles (13-0) outscored the Tigers (12-2) 24-10 after halftime to win their third national title.
The Tigers appeared to be on the verge of their second title in four seasons when Tre Mason scored a go-ahead touchdown on a determined 37-yard scamper with 1:19 left in the game.
After an early FSU field goal, Auburn scored three straight touchdowns to take a 21-3 lead.
The only score in the third quarter was a 41-yard field goal by FSU kicker Roberto Aguayo.
He was 14-for-27 for 216 yards and one interception.
