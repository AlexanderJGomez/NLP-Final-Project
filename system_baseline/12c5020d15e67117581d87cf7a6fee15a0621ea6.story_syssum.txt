Iran is developing a new drone aircraft with a range of more than 600 miles.
Recently in Massachusetts, a man was arrested for plotting to place explosives on a drone aircraft and fly it into the Pentagon or the Capitol building.
Military planners are developing technologies for autonomous drones, aircraft that are supposedly "intelligent" and can make their own decisions on when to unleash lethal force.
Any development that makes war appear to be easier or cheaper is dangerous and morally troubling.
The use of drone aircraft perpetuates the illusion that military force is an effective means of countering terrorism and resolving political differences.
The U.S. government claims that drone strikes are an effective tool against al Qaeda leaders, but most of those being killed are low-level militants.
Nor do we have legal authority to launch military strikes in Yemen, Somalia and other countries where the United States is not officially engaged in armed hostilities.
Those who are conducting these raids operate in secret beyond the restraints of military discipline and are not subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
Rather than pushing ahead to develop more of these systems, our government should pause to consider the consequences of this new revolution in military technology.
