They were here to see "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview," a documentary of sorts that's now playing in a handful of U.S. cities.
The master copy of the interview was lost in transit, but director Paul Sen had secretly kept a copy on VHS tape, Cringely said.
Over the course of one month while pitching the idea to Landmark Theatres, Cringely and a small team shot an introduction and tacked on a brief text recap that runs without sound at the end.
NeXT was purchased by Apple the next year, and soon after, Jobs was again running the company he founded with Steve Wozniak in his parents' Silicon Valley garage.
Cringely, then a technology columnist, managed to score a coveted interview with Jobs because NeXT desperately needed the attention and because Cringely and Jobs had a prior relationship.
Jobs reminisced about his early days with Wozniak, including the time they made a prank phone call to the Vatican and asked for the pope.
He also expounded on the importance of a strong leader but added that companies are not just about one person.
