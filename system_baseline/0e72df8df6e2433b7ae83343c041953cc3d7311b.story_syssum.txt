(CNN)  -- E. Lynn Harris, the author who introduced millions of readers to the "invisible life" of black gay men, was a literary pioneer whose generosity was as huge as his courage, friends said Friday.
In books like "Invisible Life," "A Love of My Own," and his New York Times best-selling memoir, "What Becomes of the Brokenhearted," Harris virtually invented a new genre: books that depicted black gay men living double lives.
He eventually became one of the nation's most popular writers with an estimated 4 million of his books in print.
Tina McElroy Ansa, author of "Taking After Mudear," met Harris at the beginning of his literary career when he was selling his first book "Invisible Life."
"I had never seen homosexual love in African-American men portrayed that way," she says.
"'For me, my 20s and early 30s were spent just hiding and running, because there was no one to tell me that my life had value and the way I felt was okay.''
She said Harris had been a cheerleader in college "and a spirit of joy followed him through his life."
In his 2003 memoir, he wrote about enduring abuse by his stepfather and an attempted suicide in 1990.
"He always said 'I'm not a James Baldwin,'" Boykin said, referring to the openly gay black author from the 1960s.
"He was hurt by some of the criticism from some black gay men who felt he wasn't portraying them accurately and others who thought he was telling too much," Boykin said.
Due said there has traditionally been a lot of pain associated with homosexuality in the black community.
