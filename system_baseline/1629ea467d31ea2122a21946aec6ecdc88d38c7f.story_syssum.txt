-- three other guests: "workers" from factories in China that manufacture Apple's phones and other consumer electronics under allegedly inhumane conditions.

On "SNL," the three bloggers grow more apologetic and uncomfortable until the skit ends with Applegate inviting the Chinese workers to complain about an American product.
