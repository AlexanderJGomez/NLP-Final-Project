New Delhi (CNN) -- India's ruling Congress party has suffered a crushing defeat in local elections that are considered a litmus test for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government.
The outcome is a personal setback for star campaigner Rahul Gandhi, who struggled hard to revive the Congress party.
"The Congress (party) needs to wake up and smell the anti-incumbency that's rising nationally against the UPA government, fueled by rising prices, poor economic management and corruption," the Times of India wrote in an editorial.
An icon of the Dalits, once known as "the untouchables" and the lowest rung in the Hindu caste system, the 56-year-old has been widely criticized for her alleged extravagance while heading one of India's poorest parts.
An influential local leader, Okram Ibobi Singh, was credited for retaining power for the Congress party in the far-flung, insurgency-wracked Manipur province.
