Washington (CNN) -- It has long been the dream of many a liberal advocate: to have an unabashedly outspoken, cleverly articulate justice who can take on the conservative majority and inspire young progressives for decades to come -- a "Scalia for the Left," as many have called it.
Sen. Arlen Specter, D-Pennsylvania, quizzed Kagan on a favorite topic of his-- allowing cameras in the Supreme Court, which most justices oppose.
Kagan found that in the folksy, clever phrasing of Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, who asked her about her 1995 statements criticizing past Supreme Court confirmation hearings as a "vapid and hollow charade."
On another occasion, Kagan was left giggling by an exchange between Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and committee chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont.
Grassley had asked the nominee about a paper she wrote as a college student that took a critical look at how judges decide cases.
"You know if I accept your answer, it is going to spoil a whole five minutes I had here," Grassley responded.
Late in the day, conservative Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, said he would ask Kagan a "softball" question.
"Sen. Graham, that is an undecided legal issue, which well, I suppose I should ask exactly what you mean by that," Kagan began.
To be fair, the members of the court usually labeled liberal -- Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor, and the retired John Paul Stevens -- all display great legal minds but not much sharp-edged humor or the willingness to engage in spirited debate for which Kagan is known.
On the conservative side, friends of Justice Clarence Thomas -- who almost never speaks at arguments -- note he has a great wit and a hearty laugh.
