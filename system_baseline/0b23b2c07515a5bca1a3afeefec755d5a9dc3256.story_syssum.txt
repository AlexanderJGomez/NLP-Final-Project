Taking a wider view, for the first nine months of 2013, 12.8 million visitors flocked to the British capital, an increase of 12% compared with the previous year.
According to the MasterCard Global Destinations Cities Index for 2012, London narrowly beat out Paris for the top spot with 16.9 million visitors.
Top London attractions such as the Tower of London and St. Paul's Cathedral said visitor numbers were "through the roof" last summer, with an increase of 17% on 2012, the London Evening Standard reported.
That's just Paris bashing, one of those Socialists, Paris's deputy mayor Anne Hidalgo, retorted.
"Like it or not, while London may have attracted more visitors around the Olympic Games, Paris remains the number one world tourist destination, even if we only include foreign visitors and not national ones," Hidalgo said.
We are more rational in our communication when speaking about Paris's strengths," Hidalgo said.
Parisian spluttering be damned, London and Partners has used its figures to promote a new video campaign, The London Story, in which well known Londoners reveal what they most love about the city.
"There's nowhere better in the world to eat than in London," says Ramsay.
