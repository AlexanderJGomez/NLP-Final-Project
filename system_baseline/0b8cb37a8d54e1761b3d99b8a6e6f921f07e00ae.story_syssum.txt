(CNN) -- Suspected cop killer Eric Matthew Frein appears to have left handwritten notes in the Pennsylvania woods in which he chillingly describes his ambush of two state troopers last month, State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Wednesday.
His legs were visible and still," the note reads, according to Bivens.
Authorities said a search of Frein's bedroom turned up a variety of black and synthetic powders -- material consistent with what was used to make the two pipe bombs.
After the shooting, Frein supposedly wrote, "I ran back to the jeep.
Bivens quoted the suspect as writing that he "did a k turn a quarter mile from them and pulled into a development I knew had unfinished access road.
Frein has been described as a survivalist and military reenactment enthusiast with a hatred for law enforcement, authorities say.
