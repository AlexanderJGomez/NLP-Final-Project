Within a half-hour of his release, he was on a plane leaving the isolated East Asian nation.
Now in Ohio, Fowle wonders why it didn't happen sooner and why he was let go first, despite the fact Bae and Miller were detained before him.
For Bae, it has been nearly two years.
Euna Lee, who was released from North Korea in 2009 after being detained for 140 days, said she wanted to return not just to her home, but to normal.
A year later, he established "Nations Tour," a China-based tour company that specialized in tours of North Korea.
And Miller got six years of hard labor in September for "acts hostile" to North Korea, all because he had ripped up his tourist visa and shouted his desire to seek asylum after arriving in the country, the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported.
"What they really need is people around them (and in the public who) can continually give them positive attention, until they are fully recovered from this attention and isolation," Lee said.
Still, he believes that both Bae and Miller -- if they can survive months detained in North Korea -- can survive and thrive in their return home as well.
