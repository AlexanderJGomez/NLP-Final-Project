The severity of the injuries varies, but many of the injured have been treated for burns, Spanish Red Cross spokeswoman Olivia Acosa said.
The aircraft, an MD-82, has two jet engines, both at the rear.
A survivor told Spain's ABC newspaper that she and other passengers heard an explosion as the plane was taking off.
"She said they could see the fire, ... and then it was not even a minute or so they heard [something] blow up," reporter Carlota Fomina told CNN.
After contacting families, the airline published the names of those aboard on its Web site.
Barajas Airport closed after the crash but reopened more than two hours later, allowing a limited number of takeoffs and landings, an airport official said.
The airport, eight miles (13 km) northeast of central Madrid, is Spain's busiest, handling more than 40 million passengers a year.
