The congressman had a conversation with the official, described as a whistle-blower, about the affair and national security concerns involved in the matter, he said.
Petraeus' affair came to light when an FBI investigation looked into a complaint that his biographer, Paula Broadwell, was sending harassing e-mails to another woman close to the retired four-star general, a U.S. official told CNN on Saturday.
The FBI interviewed Petraeus, said the official, who stressed that the CIA director was never the target of the investigation and his communications were never compromised.
According to a congressional aide familiar with the matter, the House and Senate intelligence committees weren't informed that there was an FBI investigation into the situation until Friday.
"If there was an official investigation that was looking, at least in part, at information that was compromising the CIA director, then I think there's a solid argument to say that the committee leadership should have been notified to at least some level of detail."
The FBI investigating e-mails, the e-mails leading to the CIA director, and taking four months to find out that the CIA director was involved.
A senior U.S. official said Petraeus' departure wasn't connected to the Benghazi hearing.
He helped turn the tide against insurgents while commanding forces in Iraq and Afghanistan and literally wrote the book on counterinsurgency techniques by overseeing the development of the Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Manual.
Earning praise from both sides of the political aisle, the retired four-star general took the helm of the CIA in September 2011.
