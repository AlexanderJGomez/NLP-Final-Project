(CNN) -- Facing the world after an isolating and traumatic experience is often stressful, especially for those who have been away for a long time.
The situations of Dugard and Chekevdia are extreme cases of people emerging from isolation and returning to the real world.
"While this case is obviously the rarest of things, other children are certainly exposed to many traumas that have meaning connected to this," Lebow said.
"She's going to have a lot of mixed feelings about returning to her family of origin because she's spent almost two decades with a different family," said Margo Napoletano, a child and family psychologist in San Diego, California.
Learning to live with and even like the perpetrator has survival value, Napoletano said, and also explains why someone like Dugard probably would feel somewhat torn about returning to her original family.
Police said Phillip Garrido, one of her alleged abductors, is believed to be the father of her two daughters, and his relationship to Dugard -- whether he framed their alleged sexual encounters as violent or seductive -- will influence her feelings about leaving that situation, Tabin said.
Her family members may have constantly wondered what they could have done differently to prevent the kidnapping, Tabin said.
The situation is likely also difficult for Dugard's two daughters, born to her in captivity, who have never met Dugard's family before, Napoletano said.
A recent survey of military spouses of deployed Army soldiers with school-age children found that the return from deployment is the most stressful, according to three-quarters of respondents.
In the military, bonds of brotherhood form as people face dangers together, Tabin said.
She also stressed that a family should try to normalize the life of the service member who has returned from war.
