ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- For more than a year, the criminal justice students jotted details of Chandra Levy's final movements onto a huge timeline taped to a classroom wall, culled the Internet and public records for scraps of information, and pored over the model skeleton laid out on a table in their lab at Bauder College in Atlanta, Georgia.
But on Saturday, the text and phone messages began to fly.
A week ago, the police chief in Washington, D.C., called Levy's parents and told them a suspect in the 2001 slaying soon would be arrested.
For the Bauder College students, the break in the case was no cause for self-congratulations.
Even though they couldn't name their suspect, or even discuss details of what they found, they didn't carry themselves like people who had missed the mark when they met with CNN on Monday.
For Naomi Barkley and La-Shawn Bates, the case got personal when they met Susan Levy.
Yes, Levy said, it's true, adding that she was grateful to the students for keeping people focused on her daughter's case, McCollum recalled.
McCollum worked as a victims' advocate in the criminal justice system in Fulton County, Georgia, for 25 years before taking a teaching job at Bauder College.
Auburn students examined crime scene and geographic details, while Faulkner students delved into the victim's profile.
It seemed to carry special meaning for the students.
"With Chandra, she was a criminal justice major at one time, and she had aspirations of going into the federal government; a lot of our students do as well," McCollum said at the outset of the project.
