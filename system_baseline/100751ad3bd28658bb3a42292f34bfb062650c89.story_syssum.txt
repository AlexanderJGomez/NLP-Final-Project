Philadelphia (CNN)Hazel Donnelly was taking her husband to the doctor when they got a call that their apartment building was on fire.
Once she arrived home, Donnelly implored firefighters to get her cat, but they were busy trying to control the blaze.
"When (someone) loses everything in a fire, they shouldn't then be forced to lose their pets -- their family members -- as well," Leary said.
She would often arrive at a disaster scene and see traumatized survivors struggling to care for their pets.
"There just wasn't anyone there to help the other part of the family."
After a devastating fire in 2011, Leary formed her organization and teamed up with the local chapter of the American Red Cross.
"I'm allowed into situations that other people might not be," Leary said.
Through a network of 400 volunteers, boarding facilities and veterinarians, the group provides emergency transportation, shelter, pet supplies and medical care to any pet involved in a disaster -- all for free.
When families are reunited with their pets, they receive a kit of supplies.
Red Paw cared for the Donnelly's cat for more than three weeks.
For Leary, helping families and their pets is what her work is all about.
