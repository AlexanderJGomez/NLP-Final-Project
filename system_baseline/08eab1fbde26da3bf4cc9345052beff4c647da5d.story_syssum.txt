At least five helicopters whirred above the historic landmark, which has been a rallying spot for anti-government demonstrators in recent weeks.
The crackdown comes a day after Bahrain's King Hamad imposed a three-month state of emergency and two days after Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates dispatched troops to the Persian Gulf island nation to "protect the safety of citizens," the Bahraini government said.
Security forces blocked highways leading to the capital and formed a ring around the country's main hospital, Salmaniya Medical Complex, not letting people enter or leave, witnesses said.
"We are asking for the security forces to please stay outside the hospital.
Haji said two people had died in the hospital Wednesday morning, and she feared for the other patients there because the doctors were not able to work.
Reporting from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates Jamjoom said two Bahraini information ministers came to his hotel and told him that the rest of the CNN crew was welcome to stay, but he was not.
"I was then escorted to the airport and made to leave the country," Jamjoom said.
It was unclear whether the attacks were carried out solely by Bahraini forces or included foreign troops who arrived in the country earlier in the week to help quell the demonstrations.
The Bahraini government denied the allegations and said foreign troops had been dispatched to secure specific installations, not participate in the crackdown.
The king's decree mandates that security forces should "take the measures and procedures necessary to preserve the safety of the nation and its people,"  a government statement said.
