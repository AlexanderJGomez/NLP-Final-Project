It's about what the camera is shooting: Greengrass sets up and stages organically detailed situations that he then films as if he were making a documentary.
He pioneered that method in "Bloody Sunday" (2002), his spectacular drama about the 1972 Northern Ireland massacre, and he carried it into his two Bourne films (making the most far-fetched espionage potboilers seem genuine) and, of course, into United 93, the galvanizing post-9/11 dramatization that let you feel like you were right on board that doomed plane.
The film then cuts to Somalia, a land of dust and poverty, where the pirates are recruited for their mission as if they were migrant farmworkers lining up to be chosen for that day's labor.
As soon as they climb aboard, evading the spray of water hoses that are the crew's only ''weapons,'' we know we're seeing a clash of two cultures: the privileged Western world, with its power and bounty (all symbolized by the vastness of that ship), and the desperate quarters of the Third World, locked outside the loop of technological progress and hope.
Phillips must guard his crew, negotiate with the pirates, and keep his own fears in check, and Hanks acts with a minimalism that speaks volumes: We're wired into his every glance.
It's that the movie, tethered for close to an hour to the strategies and tensions aboard the lifeboat, keeps giving us things to observe, but maybe not so much to discover.
