The images and sound of the couple talking with each other have taken on a decidedly tragic air since the March 2 EF4 twister -- with sustained winds of between 166 mph and 200 mph -- moved through Clark County.
Amazingly, the Hunters' cameras survived the powerful winds that flattened their home.
The Hunters, married 41 years, are heard on the video describing the tornado heading their way.
"It looks like it's heading right toward us," Wayne Hunter is heard telling his wife.
At that point, Hunter said, the couple ran to the center of their single-story home, which had no basement.
"They're going to know who I am," she recalled thinking.
We had arms around each other," Lenora Hunter said Friday, her voice breaking, as she showed CNN how the couple crouched and held each other tightly.
They were the couple's last words to each other.
"I mean my whole body, it was like I was just crushed.
"We just knew we needed to get her out of there somehow," Sipe said.
As softball-sized hail landed, Sipe took Lenora Hunter by the hand, covered her head with a roasting pan, and led her to safety.
On the tape, Lenora initially sounds excited as the tornado approaches.
Wayne's widow intends to rebuild in the same spot where their home once stood and where the couple planned to enjoy the rest of their retirement.
And it will be my home forever," Lenora Hunter told CNN.
Lenora Hunter dabs her eyes.
