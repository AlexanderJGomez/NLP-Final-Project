(CNN) -- As the first airline outside Japan to own Boeing 787 Dreamliner, Ethiopian Airlines has an impressive business record despite the global economic crisis.
As the global airlines continue to suffer from high fuel prices and dropping numbers of passengers, GebreMariam remains confident about the future of the industry in Africa.
Tewolde GebreMariam: Today we got the opportunity to experience what it looks like and what it can offer to customers and to airlines.
From one of side of the airplane you can see the other side.
CNN: I understand you have a 15 year plan with Ethiopian Airlines and the target is to meet ten billion dollars a year in revenue.
We've been growing for 20 to 30% per annum compounded for the last seven years.
So this growth is predicted to continue mainly because we are leveraging and harnessing on our strategic location.
It is not as well developed as the rest of the world so much work is needed there.
But going forward we are building a huge aviation academy, the capacity has grown from 150 graduates to 1000 graduates a year.
When we get the second one we will utilize it on the Washington route.
We'll take delivery of four of them before the end of the year.
