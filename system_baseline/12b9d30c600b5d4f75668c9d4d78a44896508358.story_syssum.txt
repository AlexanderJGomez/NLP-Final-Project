Now that the Concordia is upright, there can be further investigation of the captain's alleged mishandling of the ship.
Such an examination could include divers going deep into the belly of the vessel to examine whether watertight doors sealed properly, and whether automatic generators functioned.
A panel of maritime experts addressed the role of the Indonesian helmsman Jacob Rusli Bin in the accident.
Dragone told the court that those 13 seconds made no difference, since it takes a lot longer than that to change a ship's course.
But Schettino had been the one to order the Concordia to veer more than four miles off course in the first place to do a fly-by salute to a former sea captain who had retired on Giglio.
The trial is expected to last through the fall with a string of witnesses, including passengers, crew members and islanders, who say they saw the captain on shore looking for dry socks before all the passengers had been safely evacuated.
