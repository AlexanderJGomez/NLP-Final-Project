"Al Qaeda in Iraq wants to poison the next generation of Iraqis," said Rear Adm. Gregory Smith during a Baghdad news conference about the release of the tape.
Smith said the military doesn't know how many children al Qaeda in Iraq uses in its operations.
The video indicates that al Qaeda in Iraq was increasingly targeting children and posting propaganda on some of the 5,000 al Qaeda-affiliated Web sites.
A roadside bomb targeting police killed four people and wounded nine others in the south-central Iraqi provincial capital of Diwaniya on Wednesday morning, an Interior Ministry official told CNN.
The U.S. military on Wednesday also reported the deaths of two Sons of Iraq members who were trying to thwart a suicide attack on Tuesday in a town northwest of Baghdad.
The pair died in the strike but "prevented the man from detonating the explosive vest filled with ball bearings in a crowd of local Iraqis.
The operations took place in the Baghdad area, in Mosul, and near Ramadi.
