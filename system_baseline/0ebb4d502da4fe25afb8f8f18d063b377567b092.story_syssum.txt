"We were still on ascent, and the engine blew out," he said.
"We knew there wasn't a lot of time because we were quite close to the ground, and it felt as though the descent was somewhat rapid," said Berretta, who said he was sitting in seat 16A.
"People started praying, and there was a lot of silence, and the realization that we were going in was really hard to take in at that moment," he said.
Some said that as the plane hit, there were extremely loud noises.
Jeff Kolodjay was sitting in seat 22A right next to the engine believed to have caused the plane to go down.
There was a lady with her baby on my left-hand shoulder, and she was crawling over the seats."
"Once people realized that we were going to be OK, everybody kind of calmed down and just tried to get out of the plane to safety."
As Berretta exited the plane, he said that besides a few passengers remaining, the crew and pilot stayed behind to make sure everyone was out.
"I think it was as good of a landing as you can make in a river."
