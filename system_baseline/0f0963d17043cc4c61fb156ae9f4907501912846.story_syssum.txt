That's the claim for First Warning Systems new bra, equipped with a series of sensors embedded in the cups that pick up temperature changes in breast tissue and, says the Reno, Nev.-based company, provide a thermal fingerprint that can alert doctors to the presence of malignant cells.
"Hypothetically, it's conceivable that malignant processes would have a temperature gradient compared to non-malignant tissues," says Dr. Therese Bevers, medical director of the cancer prevention center at the Univ.
The idea of using thermograms to ferret out abnormally growing cells is already being used with an imaging device that takes a temperature reading of breast tissue.
Even if the readings provide a positive result, and if, as the company says, the tumors are at their earliest stages and barely detectable as a mass, it's not clear what doctors can do for women at that point.
Already, the latest data raise questions about the efficacy of mammograms in women in their 40s; the United States Preventive Services Task Force recently recommended that women wait until they are 50 to start yearly screenings, because studies showed that the costs of screening women in their 40s, including additional testing and complications caused by these supplemental procedures, did not save more lives.
Those tests aren't perfect either, but they do have a track record of helping to save lives.
