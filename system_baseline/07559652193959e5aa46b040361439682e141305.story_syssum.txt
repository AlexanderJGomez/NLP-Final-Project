"Of course, I too bear the responsibility for not managing to diversify the economy as much as we wanted," Kudrin said.
"If we are talking about the Russian stock market, it had been growing quickly over the past few years and then dropped rapidly.
Kudrin confirmed Russia would have a budget deficit of 8 percent in 2009 -- its first for a decade -- and will spend more than it takes in for the next two years as well.
"In general, the volume of spending will remain the same, and even slightly increase, which is why the deficit will go up to 8 percent," he said.
Russia's stock markets plummeted by nearly 70 percent in 2008, and the country spent one-third of its gold and foreign currency reserves -- or $216 billion -- defending its currency, the ruble.
That's why, before the end of January, before the devaluation was actually completed, there was a very strong incentive to take capital out of Russia.
