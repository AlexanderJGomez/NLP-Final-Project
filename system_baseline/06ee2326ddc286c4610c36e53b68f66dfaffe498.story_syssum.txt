But like many Americans, that dream was interrupted when they almost lost their home to foreclosure.
After discussing their financials with a mortgage broker, the family was presented with a deal and payments they could afford.
It all seemed like a dream come true, until the couple learned the interest rate on their loan would readjust in just six months, making the loan a short three-year ARM.
To make matters worse, Terese Hicks, a city employee, had to take a 10-percent pay cut in her salary, and the family was burdened with a mountain of medical bills for numerous surgeries their 6-month-old son Jordan underwent to treat a birth-related medical condition.
But they were told there was nothing they could do because they were current on all their payments.
Homecomings acknowledges that the guidelines for modification at that time made little sense, but they were caught in the middle of a "symptomatic" relationship between working with third-party investors and homeowners.
"We advise homebuyers not to talk to a realtor or lender before we can meet with them for a Mortgage Profile Meeting," said Griffin.
During the recent housing crisis, Griffin says people of color have become "easy prey" because they often don't know the right questions to ask about subprime and ARM loans.
It was only after receiving notice that their home was going up for auction that Terese Hicks learned about HomeFree-USA.
Griffin hopes other homebuyers can learn from the Hickses' situation and seek out an advocate early in the process of refinancing or modifying a loan -- before they are caught in a financial storm.
"People don't know where to go and who to talk to," says Griffin.
