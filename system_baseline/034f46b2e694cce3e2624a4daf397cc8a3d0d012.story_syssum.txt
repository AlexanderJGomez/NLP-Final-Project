The post-election lame duck session should be fast-paced as lawmakers work to clear leftover business, including a must pass bill to fund the government, and other bills to arm Syrian rebels and extend expiring tax breaks.
Unlike past orientations, when senators were given heavy binders and detailed briefings about foreign policy, national security, and other current topics, this week's sessions will deal more with the practical matters of operating a Senate office, including hiring, disbursement, and ethics rules.
While the lame duck agenda is packed, one controversial item the Senate may not deal with until next year is approving Loretta Lynch to be the new Attorney General.
However, most Republicans don't want to rush the process, preferring to explore more carefully Lynch's background and views on immigration and other hot-button subjects.
Lawmakers and aides are guessing the President will wait until after December 11, which is when Congress needs to clear that critical funding bill to keep government operating.
Other items Senate Democratic leaders hope to bring to the floor include a package that would extend some personal and business tax breaks set to run out at the end of the year along with the annual Department of Defense bill that will likely include extending approval Congress already gave for training and equipping Syrian rebels.
Senate Democratic leaders are considering a vote on the Keystone pipeline during the lame duck, according to a source familiar with the issue.
New and returning senators will gather privately Thursday morning in the Capitol to elect new leadership for their respective caucuses.
