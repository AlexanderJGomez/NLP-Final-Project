Pakistani police are searching for two youths suspected of shooting a teenage activist for girls' education and the man they believe drove them to the scene, the country's interior minister said Sunday.
Police said last week that they had arrested six men in connection with the shooting, but were still searching for Khan, who was studying for a master's degree in chemistry.
Taliban leaders claimed responsibility for the shooting, but they don't appear to have anticipated the level of condemnation it would provoke.
He'll also meet with the foreign ministers of Britain and the United Arab Emirates, which provided the air ambulance that flew Malala to the United Kingdom.
Malik said she and her parents can stay in the UK as long as needed, "until she is fully rehabilitated."
