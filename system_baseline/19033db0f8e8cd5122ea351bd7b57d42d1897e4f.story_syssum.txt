Acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson said Director Sharon Helman and two other officials at the Phoenix VA have been "removed" from their positions, but he said the government continues to pay federal employees during the sometimes lengthy termination process.
Gibson has toured VA medical centers in three cities in the last week, meeting with hospital staff and outlining his plan to reform the embattled federal health care system that has delayed or failed to provide appointments for more than 120,000 veterans in the past decade, according to an internal VA audit.
Responding to CNN's questions about when long wait times will be reduced, Gibson said his top priority is to ensure veterans receive timely, high-quality health care, but he does not know exactly when all wait lists will be reduced.
"The last thing in the world you want to do is create an environment where people are afraid or unwilling to raise their hand and say 'I think there is a better way.'"
