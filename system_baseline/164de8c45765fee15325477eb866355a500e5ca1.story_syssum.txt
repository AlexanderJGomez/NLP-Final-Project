ISIS, the Sunni Muslim extremist militant group, has been fighting to take Kobani for about six weeks, hoping to add it to the territory it already captured in parts of Syria and Iraq for what it calls its new independent Islamic nation.
Peshmerga troops -- Kurds who defend northern Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdish region -- are no strangers to ISIS, having battled them often this year as the militant group tries to expand its Iraqi territory.
The city has attracted a lot of international media attention, in part because it lies just across the border from Turkey, giving journalists a clear vantage point to report on the battle there.
With ISIS controlling the Syrian land surrounding Kobani, the Peshmerga's easiest path into the city was through Turkey.
The Turkish government also has bristled at the United States' efforts to parachute weapons, ammunition and medicine to YPG fighters.
More than 30 people were killed in cities across the country this month as ethnic Kurds clashed with Islamist and nationalist groups, as well as Turkish police.
