Langman, a shipyard owner and yachtsman, is intent on beating the French-set record within the next few weeks, with the "Wot Rocket," a canoe-style pod with a nine meter-long  rigid sail.
In October last year Langman and his co-pilot crashed when they lost control of the vessel at 42 knots -- over 60 miles per hour.
"But really I feel very safe doing anything on water as that what I've done my whole life.
So I presented it to a group of engineers and said 'this is what I believe.'
It's really about ideas versus science and trying to make it work," Langman explained.
