The sport-crazy country's national team has been humiliated during the Ashes series against an England side they would once routinely embarrass.
On one hand, the hosts will have to make do without captain Ricky Ponting, still regarded as one of the finest batsmen of the modern game, who has been ruled out due to a troublesome fractured finger.
A horrendous run of form with the bat, combined with his team's largely abject displays throughout the series, has seen the 36-year-old receive a mauling from the Australian media.
But for some, the emergence of Khawaja can have a far wider impact than leveling what has been a disastrous Ashes series for Australia.
