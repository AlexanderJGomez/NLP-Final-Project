In one set of photographs by commuter Joey Lepore, taken during a Wednesday rush hour at 7:15 a.m., a guard tilts his head downward and dozes.
Before releasing the photos, Lepore hesitated, knowing it would likely cost the guards their jobs.
Lepore said he later approached the guard, told him he had caught him asleep at his post three times, and said he had the photos to prove it.
The sleeping guards were employees of FJC Security, a security contractor used by the Port Authority, which operates the George Washington Bridge along with all other bridges leading into Manhattan.
The Port Authority welcomes the public's vigilance on matters of safety and security and we encourage our customers to contact us if they encounter anything out of the ordinary," the agency said.
