The idea of reparations -- that the descendants of slaves should be compensated by the national government for the wrongs and the legacy of slavery -- has always been controversial.
And it suggests that before America could ever actually do reparations, America would have to first be able to imagine the necessity of reparations.
But as Coates reminds us, white supremacy was not just about measures of outright racial subjugation; it was also baked into measures intended to create wealth and opportunity, like parts of the New Deal, which contained many devil's bargains with conservative Southern Democrats to exempt African-Americans.
What Coates recounts in painstaking detail is an un-whitewashed history of African-American citizenship.
The closest he comes to a legislative recommendation is to tout a perennially neglected bill that Rep. John Conyers, D-Michigan, introduces every session of Congress, which calls simply for a public study of the possibility of reparations.
To listen to the difference between Americanness and whiteness, and to notice the manifold ways that whiteness was (and is) an identity fabricated from the myth of blackness.
Does any of this answer the question everyone wants to rush to, the question of implementation and how reparations would actually work?
How to begin the process without it leading to the unraveling of every aspect of institutional wealth, privilege and power in our country?
On a topic as charged as race, and as woven into the warp and woof of American identity as whiteness, the temptation is always to speak emphatically from fear or pain.
But if more of us in reaction to reparations simply say, "I do not know -- but I wish to understand," then we will be making true progress.
