The sick passenger and his daughter were taken to a hospital for evaluation.
The possibility of a new case was knocked down later Saturday by the New Jersey Department of Health.
"The symptoms of one individual were found to be consistent with another, minor treatable condition unrelated to Ebola," the health department said.
Dumas said the response was standard procedure with sick passengers, but it was unclear how long the protocol has been in place.
Passenger Rich Burchett told CNN he was sitting next to the sick man.
According to Burchett, a flight attendant asked the man where he was traveling from.
The sick passenger and the girl were taken to the back of the plane, Burchett said.
Nearly two hours after the flight landed, Burchett said, an announcement was made: "Everyone can leave.
"My concern is, if this were something that were highly contagious, we did not seem to have a very good reaction plan," he said.
Costa said he had spoken with the man and his daughter before the flight left Liberia.
The man and his daughter were taken to University Hospital, where the emergency room will not accept anyone else for four hours, CNN affiliate WABC reported.
"If the flight crew of a commercial aircraft arriving in the U.S. becomes aware of an ill person on board which may include a person with Ebola symptoms, the captain is required required by law ... to report the illness to the nearest U.S. Quarantine Station, who will arrange the appropriate medical response at the flight's destination airport," the statement said.
"We've assessed every one of those ... and just this one patient has tested positive ... We expect that we will see more rumors or concerns or possibilities of cases, until there is a positive laboratory test, that is what they are."
