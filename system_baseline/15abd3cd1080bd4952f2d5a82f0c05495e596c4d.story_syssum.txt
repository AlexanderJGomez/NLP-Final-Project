The 40-year-old actor is starring in the musical "Hedwig and the Angry Inch" as the titular German transgender performer, and he's so immersed in his character when on stage that not even an excited fan can pull him out of it.
The Post reports that the audience loved it, but apparently not everyone has.
When the Harris fan confessed her love for the actor on Saturday, Harris worked it into his act as he's supposed to, his rep tells Gossip Cop.
"Hedwig and the Angry Inch," which has been running preview performances, will celebrate its opening night on Tuesday.
