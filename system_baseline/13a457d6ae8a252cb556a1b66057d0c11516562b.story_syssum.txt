That's when Martin Cooper, a vice president at Motorola, stepped onto a New York City sidewalk and made the first known cellphone call in history.
"We knew that someday everybody would have a (cell) phone, but it was hard to imagine that that would happen in my lifetime," Cooper said to CNN last year.
They'd worked for about three months on the model he walked outside with on April 3, 1973.
"I don't remember exactly what he said, but it was really quiet for a while," he said.
The kind of phone Gordon Gekko wielded in "Wall Street," it weighed 2.5 pounds and was about a foot tall.
"Phones have gotten so complicated, so hard to use, that you wonder if this is designed for real people or for engineers."
