The problem, one prominent activist tells CNN, is getting out.
It's the identity the former medical student who helped found an activist group called "Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently" uses to speak out.
Still, al-Raqqawi tells CNN's Brooke Baldwin that won't stop him from sharing what he sees.
"It's the situation forcing me to do this.
Here's a look at some of the things al-Raqqawi has told CNN he and others from the activist group have seen in Raqqa.
"If you are an activist...inside the city of Raqqa, it will take you to death," he says.
And he says his activist group has documented more than 270 cases of girls forced to marry ISIS fighters.
Now, al-Raqqawi says the fresh coats of pink, white, gold and green paint could be a sign that ISIS is trying to make buildings less of a target for coalition airstrikes.
"Yes it's heaven for some of these foreign fighters, because they give them a lot of money.
But for some, it's not the paradise they imagined, al-Raqqawi says.
