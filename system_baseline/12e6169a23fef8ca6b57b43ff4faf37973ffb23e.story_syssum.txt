Mourinho, who has been given a two-match domestic ban for insulting a referee in a Copa del Rey match on Tuesday night, had requested that Zidane be involved in his backroom staff.
The Portuguese coach was sent to the stands during the 5-1 win over Real Murcia after protesting against a yellow card and then insulting the referee.
Meanwhile, Italian club AC Milan may face a striker shortage ahead of this weekend's derby with city rivals Inter with both veteran Filippo Inzaghi and Alexandre Pato sidelined.
"Francesco Totti sent Filippo Inzaghi a greeting of support after hearing of the striker's knee injury and told him he was a great goalscorer and example to all young players," read the statement.
During the 2007 final he scored both goals in Milan's 2-1 win over Liverpool at Athens' Olympic Stadium.
