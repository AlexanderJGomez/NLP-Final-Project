In the third serious airline legroom incident in two weeks, an angry passenger caused yet another flight to divert Monday night.
Local law enforcement removed the passenger and the flight continued to West Palm Beach, Delta said.
Another reportedly irate passenger caused a flight from Miami to Paris to divert to Boston on August 27 after someone allegedly tried to recline in front of him.
Aviation blogger Benet Wilson is surprised there haven't been more incidents in the air as travelers face long security checkpoint lines at more crowded airports as well as less space and fewer amenities on planes.
It doesn't help that the (Federal Aviation Administration) doesn't have an official rule on using (seat-blocking devices), instead deferring to passengers and airlines.
What do you think of this recent spate of airline seat recline incidents?
