Washington (CNN) -- Beginning Saturday and continuing over the next few weeks, some of the nation's most prominent governors will be leaving office as a new crop of state chief executives are sworn in.
Richardson told CNN he is going to stay in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and looks forward to becoming a private citizen after having served as a governor, a cabinet secretary, a United Nations ambassador and a congressman.
Having just returned from a trip to North Korea to help calm recent tensions, Richardson said he intends to stay involved in that issue and other foreign policy matters but doesn't rule out returning to Washington one day.
"It was one of the greatest decisions I ever made because working for the people of California is really was a great pleasure for me, it was a great honor.
"I am very happy we took the power away from the legislators and from the lawmakers, the power to draw the district lines...also all of the environmental laws," such as ones to reduce greenhouse gases and to encourage alternative energy sources.
Even before taking office, Brown has been meeting with state officials and legislators to help find ways of dealing with it.
Before a painful press conference at the state capitol, he went into detail about how he had ventured to Argentina for a rendezvous with a mistress.
One incident of his gubernatorial career will certainly stand out: in 2004 he brought some live pigs into the state house after some of his budget vetoes were overturned, to protest what he considered pork barrel spending.
"If you look at these last 18 months they have been surprisingly productive," he said, pointing to some vetoes of bills amounting to savings of about $260 million.
