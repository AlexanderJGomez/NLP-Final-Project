Keep in mind: Fleck is considered by many to be the premier banjo player in the world.
CNN caught up with him backstage at the Bonnaroo music festival last month, where he played with African kora player Toumani Diabate, to discuss his film and experience in Africa and what prompted him to go.
Bela Fleck: Well, I have loved the banjo since I first heard it when I was a little kid, and after I started to learn to play it I discovered that it came from Africa originally, and that doesn't seem to be common knowledge.
Another important part of the trip for me was putting myself into uncomfortable situations and seeing how I would do, because over the years, as I've gotten more and more successful, I get in control of things, and less and less I was finding myself in situations that were truly risky musically.
[There was also] the brotherhood of acoustic musicians, 'cause we feel something when we play our instruments and the sounds mingle in the air.
The kora is a 21-string harp, and he comes from 71 generations from it being taught from father to son, father to son.
Fleck: My reasons for going to Africa were kind of selfish, because I love the banjo, and I really want to play with the musicians.
People are beautiful, and there is an incredible culture and history there, and I think this film sits on the other side.
It's not a political statement, but it does point out what is beautiful about Africans.
