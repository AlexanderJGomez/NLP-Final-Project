Three older students pummeling a 13-year-old boy in a school bus, leaving him with a broken arm.
If they had been in adult court, the charges would have constituted a second-degree felony, Judge Raymond Gross said.
The prosecution asked to enter the bus surveillance video as evidence to support its argument that the juvenile justice department's proposed punishments don't match the severity of the crime.
The driver of the bus, John Moody, has said he was "petrified" during the attack and has experienced nightmares about it since.
