His move came hot on the heels of news on Wednesday that Portsmouth owner Alexandre Gaydamak had agreed to sell his club to United Arab Emirates businessman Dr Sulaiman Al Fahim -- who was previously instrumental in the Abu Dhabi United Group's takeover of Manchester City.
Short, who saw Sunderland avoid relegation on the final day of the season last weekend, told the club's Web site that he will be sticking to the financial side of the business and allowing former Black Cats striker Quinn to deal with football operations.
