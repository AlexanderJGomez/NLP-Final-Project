They were live and vivid stories of heroism, frailty, failure, fealty, attached to real ruins that real families (including ours) seemed to trudge off to engage with at weekends -- thanks to the National Trust.
If you read the original article it's an erudite, writerly essay that speculates about the national drama that is the royal family, and acknowledges -- much like the spectacle that is playing out at the Vatican -- that the royal family is pure theater with real living human beings playing out these arcane rituals stuck in the middle.
But the fact that the Daily Mail and other conservative commentators have broken out in such a bad case of shrill hysteria in the face of this examination of the author's mixed feelings about the royal family is quite amusing, actually, because it sounds so utterly insincere.
In the absence of any real national culture the royal family is increasingly the obsession of the English -- the Scots and the Welsh would take independence if they could have it.
But the issue about whose nation they represent, and what they are really for remains louder than ever.
