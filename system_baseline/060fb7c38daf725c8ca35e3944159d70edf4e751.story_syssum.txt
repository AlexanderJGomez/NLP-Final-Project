Philadelphia (CNN) -- Philadelphia abortion provider Kermit Gosnell was sentenced Wednesday to life with no parole in the death of one of three babies who died in his clinic.
Judge Jeffrey Minehart, who rendered the decision, also sentenced Gosnell on Wednesday to 2Â½ to 5 years in the case of 41-year-old Karnamaya Mongar, who died of an anesthetic overdose during an abortion at Gosnell's West Philadelphia clinic.
Rather, he said, they were already dead as a result of Gosnell administering the drug Digoxin, which can cause abortion.
In Pennsylvania, abortions past 24 weeks are illegal unless the health of the mother is at stake.
Gosnell's co-defendant, Eileen O'Neill, 56, was found guilty of conspiracy to operate a corrupt organization and two counts of theft by deception for operating without a license to practice medicine.
A grand jury report from 2011 says the "people who ran this sham medical practice included no doctors other than Gosnell himself, and not even a single nurse," yet they still made diagnoses, performed procedures and administered drugs.
The remains of aborted fetuses were stored in water jugs, pet food containers and a freezer at the clinic, the city's chief medical examiner Sam Gulino testified.
