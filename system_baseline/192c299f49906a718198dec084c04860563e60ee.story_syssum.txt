Washington (CNN) -- A company dispatcher who was seated in the cockpit jump seat as Southwest Airlines Flight 4013 landed at the wrong Missouri airport has been placed on paid leave pending the outcome of the investigation, the company told CNN on Tuesday.
The rule is intended to keep distractions from interfering with the flight.
The NTSB plans to interview the pilots and the dispatcher in the coming days, Holloway said.
At one point, after a government investigation disclosed widespread abuse of the privilege by air traffic controllers, the FAA halted the program.
The plane stopped about 500 feet from the end of a runway, said Chris Berndt, the Western Taney County Fire District fire chief and emergency management director.
Southwest said Monday it has reached out directly to apologize to each passenger, refund their tickets and provide future travel credit.
