It's a phrase coined by South African marketing agency The Creative Counsel, describing individuals who live, breathe and promote a brand in specific zones of South Africa.
While the rest of the world is utilizing social media to advertise commodities, The Creative Counsel is utilizing what it calls the "traditional" type of social media -- word of mouth.
In the African market you will find millions of these customers, who might have been overlooked in the past by big multinational businesses.
And to make sure the product will fulfill their needs, these consumers ask a trusted member of the community -- a zonal champion.
They walk the streets and communicate, so they go to taxi ranks and places where people gather and really spend a lot of time promoting the product."
"Zonal champions aren't like normal promoters, they don't usually have working hours ... when you live and breathe a brand and you're passionate about it, you do it 24/7, 365," says Oved.
Neu-Ner says that they found a niche: "We found that there's a whole lot of people uneducated and previously probably unemployable, so to speak, and we found a methodology of training and managing these people so we can actually give them a job as a zonal champion or a brand champion, as someone who can drive a message into their communities.
"It means that if you're a brand that needs to support me in the community, create employment opportunities, gives me real product information, I will support you and buy your product -- one hand washes the other.
