(Mashable)  -- The Samsung Continuum was announced earlier at the New York Stock Exchange, but the phone itself was just unveiled in Times Square.
The ticker can be activated separately from the main display using a unique grip sensor on the sides of the device.
The question is whether Samsung will update to Android 2.2 or go straight to 2.3 (Gingerbread).
