This week Avila -- one of the most well-known women accused of ties with Mexico's drug trade -- pleaded guilty in a Florida court to a charge connected to a cocaine trafficking case.
She faces up to 15 years in U.S. prison after pleading guilty to being an accessory after the fact, according to an agreement filed in federal court this week.
And despite the high-profile accusations against her, authorities have not convicted Avila of any drug-trafficking crimes.
A document signed by Avila as part of the plea agreement in U.S. federal court says she provided "financial assistance for travel, lodging and other expenses" to Espinosa from 2002 to 2004 "with the intention of preventing or hindering his arrest for his drug trafficking crimes."
In an interview with Anderson Cooper that aired on "60 Minutes" and CNN that year, Avila denied the charges against her and blamed Mexico's government for allowing drug trafficking to flourish.
"The government has to be involved in everything that is corrupt."
