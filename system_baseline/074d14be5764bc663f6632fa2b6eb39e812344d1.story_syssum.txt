But we have to admit, Mars rocked the house (or rather stadium) and his obvious joy at performing for what was basically almost the entire world was pretty infectious.
According to Mars, when he was a baby his dad wanted to call him Elvis, so at age 6 the tiny singer became one of the youngest Elvis impersonators in the world.
His turn on "Saturday Night Live" may not have gotten as much attention as, say, Justin Timberlake's, but there was no denying Mars was out of this world when he portrayed an intern at Pandora who has to imitate several artists -- including Green Day, Michael Jackson, Steven Tyler and Justin Bieber -- when the power goes out.
Not only was it hilarious, but his version of Bieber's "Boyfriend" was quite possibly better than the original.
Four of his sisters have formed a singing group called The Lylas, and last year they launched a reality show on the WE network.
While he didn't appear in the first season, his sisters said he offers plenty of advice -- even though when he does, "We pretty much ignore it," they have said.
