"As it relates to crimes against individuals ... the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim's life was not taken."
But what happened to all that "shouldn't expand death penalty to crimes where the victim's life was not taken" language from the Supreme Court?
As with most things, there are exceptions to the rule -- though reasonable minds may differ on the reasoning behind those exceptions.
After all, treason is one of three crimes mentioned in the U.S. Constitution, so there's a good argument that the federal statute authorizing death for treason is "constitutional" -- because it's actually in the constitution.
If you commit an inherently dangerous felony, and a death results, you can be charged with "felony murder," which in some states qualifies you for the death penalty.
According to the Supreme Court, this is constitutional, as long as the defendant significantly participated in the felony and was recklessly indifferent to human life.
While the husband-wife execution of convicted spies (and nonkillers) Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were certainly high profile at the time, the modern reality is that every person executed since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976 participated in a crime in which a victim died.
For crimes against the person, it has to be pretty awful: A killing plus something that makes it even worse than your garden variety homicide.
