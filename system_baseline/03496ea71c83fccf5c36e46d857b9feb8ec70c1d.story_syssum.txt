The eerie find was made after the owner of the site of the former Minus Funeral Home in Dover contacted authorities about 38 small containers left behind on the property, authorities said.
Ultimately, they were ordered or forced to drink cyanide-laced punch after Jones' gunmen killed a visiting U.S. congressman and four others at a nearby airstrip.
Authorities will attempt to track down relatives or make arrangements to dispose of the remains, Chandler said.
More than 900 men, women and children died in what became known as the Jonestown massacre -- the worst mass murder-suicide at the time.
But Jones sent gunmen to a nearby airstrip, where they killed Ryan, an NBC correspondent and his cameraman, a newspaper photographer and one of the departing family members.
Syringes were used to squirt the poison in the mouths of babies.
It is not known who shot him or whether he shot himself.
