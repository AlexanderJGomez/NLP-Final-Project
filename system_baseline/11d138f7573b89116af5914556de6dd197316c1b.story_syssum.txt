Washington (CNN) -- Leaders of the different branches of the U.S. armed forces gave sharply divergent answers to the Senate Armed Services Committee on Friday when asked whether the military's controversial "don't ask, don't tell" policy should be repealed, and what the consequences of a repeal might be.
Gen. James Cartwright, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he believes implementation of a repeal would involve a "manageable risk with regard to military effectiveness."
The service chiefs were summoned to testify in the wake of a newly released Pentagon study which concluded that allowing openly gay or lesbian troops to serve in the military would have little lasting impact on the U.S. armed forces.
Levin said there was greater resistance to allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the British and Canadian militaries than there is in U.S. armed forces today.
Mullen told the Armed Services Committee Thursday that he believes that even among those combat forces, a transition to a new law is possible.
But I believe, and history tells, that most of them will put aside personal proclivities for something larger than themselves and for each other," he said.
With just weeks left for this Congress, the calendar could be the biggest factor weighing on whether the law is repealed or upheld.
"Cloture takes a lot of time and this is only one of many issues on the plate of the lame duck," said Mann, referring to the procedure by which the Senate ends debate on legislation.
"If Obama is worried about getting independents and moderate Democrats back into the fold for 2012, he may give up the fight only because that core constituency will want to see all of his energy devoted to the economy and not distracted by what the public sees as essentially a gay rights issue."
