Parmitano and Cassidy were able to complete the first task in the spacewalk, Humphries said.
Both astronauts were called back into the station after they and mission control personnel noticed what appeared to be water pooling inside Parmitano's space suit, Humphries said.
"It was an orderly situation in which the crew members and the team on the ground reacted per their standard procedures, and determined that they needed to end to protect the safety of the astronauts that were out on the EVA," Humphries said.
Mission managers will determine when to reschedule the other tasks that the astronauts would have completed on this spacewalk.
