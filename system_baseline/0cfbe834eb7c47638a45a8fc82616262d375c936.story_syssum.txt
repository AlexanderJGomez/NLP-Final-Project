Instead, Ramsey told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday, it was about knowing he had lived for a year near the captive women on the city's West Side.
He ran from his living room, clutching a half-eaten McDonald's Big Mac, to the house and helped free a woman identified as Amanda Berry.
Ramsey told CNN he had never seen Berry before Monday, and at first, he could not place the name.
While Ramsey's quick action in the largely rundown neighborhood made him a hero, his colorful descriptions to WEWS helped make him dream fodder for the Twitterverse.
Explaining that he had no idea Ariel Castro, his neighbor, may have had other people inside his home, Ramsey said, "I've been here a year.
He's not doing anything but the average stuff.
He added, "I knew something was wrong when a little, pretty white girl ran into a black man's arms.
Hodge's restaurant in Cleveland posted a message on Facebook saying, "we're extremely proud of our employee Charles Ramsey for not turning his back on the young women.
Our thoughts and prayers will continue to be with the women, their families and their friends."
"You are the guy who decided in 30 seconds to go up and spring a woman from a house of hell that she's been in and was desperate to get out that door with her 6-year-old daughter," Walsh recalled saying.
This broad is trying to break out the f-----g house next door to me, so there's a bunch of people on the street right now and s--t. So we're like, 'What's wrong, what's the problem?'
He then answers the 911 operator's questions about the woman, what she looks like, and what she's wearing.
I'm telling you where the crime was, not my house," he says.
The operator then asks him to check whether Berry needs an ambulance.
