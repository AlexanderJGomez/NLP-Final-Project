Several markets were shuttered in West Bangal, a formerly communist-ruled state seen as a hotbed of union activity, residents said.
Nationally, there was little impact on private services and there was no major disruption in rail services across the sprawling nation.
"We demand the government come out with proposals in relation to our demands," said G. Sanjeeva Reddy, president of the Indian National Trade Union Congress that is linked to Singh's party.
While markets in the city remained open, at least one branch of the State Bank of India in New Delhi was hit hard by the strike, with senior executives picking up the slack.
