The manhunt for Eric Matthew Frein, accused of killing a Pennsylvania state trooper, is over.
Frein, 31, is charged with first-degree murder and other charges in a September 12 ambush outside the state police barracks in Blooming Grove.
His capture ended a lengthy search that burned through some $10 million, according to the county prosecutor, and likely as many nerves.
And he wasn't armed at the time of his capture, according to police, much to the relief of authorities who feared a violent showdown.
Frein was in good physical condition when he was captured, apart from a cut on his nose that he had before the marshals found him, according to Noonan.
His voice was strong as he answered, "Yes I do," to a Pike County judge's question if he understood the charges against him, which include first-degree murder and criminal homicide of a law enforcement officer.
Frein is being held in the Pike County Correctional Institute in Lords Valley.
After his arrest, Frein made statements implicating himself in the shootings, according to a law enforcement official who was briefed on the capture.
Authorities have not discussed a motive but have said Frein has talked and written about hating law enforcement.
"If he got out of those woods, we were very concerned that he would then kill other law enforcement.
At least one community, Barrett Township, canceled trick-or-treating as the search dragged on, instead suggesting children show up at a school parking lot to collect candy under the supervision of local and state police.
Pennsylvania Game Commission Executive Director R. Matthew Hough lifted the temporary prohibition on hunting and trapping activity in all areas that had been affected by the manhunt.
We are so proud of our Pennsylvania State Police, their hard work," another said.
