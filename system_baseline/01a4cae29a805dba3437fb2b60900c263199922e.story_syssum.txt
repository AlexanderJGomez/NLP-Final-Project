Erika Murray was arraigned September 12 on a bevy of charges stemming from the discovery of the dead infants at her home the day before, but she has not been charged in their deaths.
Just how many children lived with them in the vermin-infested 1,150-square-foot home, however, depends on which parent you ask: of the four living children that the state removed from the home on August 28, Murray told investigators that Rivera, 38, only knew about two of them.
"It's a mystery to me how he could have failed to realize that there were two children living under the same roof as him, and he didn't know about it."
Whether based in reality or not, Halpern said Murray was "a prisoner of her own fear" and suggested it was that fear that explains the three infants found dead in her home.
"I feel certain that she did not do anything to harm any of these children," he said.
This was not the first time a 51A had been filed when it came to that home, according to a Massachusetts Department of Children and Families spokeswoman.
"Our investigation will continue for quite some time," said Joseph Early, the Worcester County District Attorney.
