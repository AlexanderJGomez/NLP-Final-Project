Brown's lawyer entered a not guilty plea on his behalf and a judge ordered him to show up at a sheriff's station within a week to be officially booked on the charge, according to a court spokesman.
If it does, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Brandlin could order Brown to jail to serve part of the original five-year jail sentence imposed for the attack on Rihanna.
A woman whose Mercedes was allegedly rear-ended by a Range Rover that Brown was driving on a Los Angeles street told investigators that he "went ballistic" after the traffic accident and screamed at her.
The trigger for Brown's alleged rage was that Gure took a photo of him and his girlfriend, Karrueche Tran, to document the scene -- since he allegedly refused to show her his driver's license, she said.
"My profile pic is the pic I took of the persons car after "the hit and run".
I've made mistakes in the past and have worked hard to be a better person. "
Brown punched Rihanna inside a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street, leaving her face bruised and bloody on the eve of the Grammy Awards in February 2009.
He entered a guilty plea seven months later and was sentenced to serve five years' probation and to spend more than 1,400 hours in "labor-oriented service" for the assault conviction.
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office has "tortured" Brown during his probation more than any client he's ever had, Geragos said.
