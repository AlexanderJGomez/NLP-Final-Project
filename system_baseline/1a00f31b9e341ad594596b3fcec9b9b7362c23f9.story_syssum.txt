There are still some hurdles to overcome and lessons to learn, but it is our belief that mobile advertising will have a long and healthy life in the future.
If we focus on mobile phones - then it is our expectation that mobile media will take no more than 20% of digital revenues by 2016.
Yet if we include tablets within mobile media, we can predict that mobile advertising will surpass traditional digital spending by 2016.
Finally, the plethora of device and operating system choices, make it supremely challenging for brands and advertisers to understand how, when and with what to target their audiences.
This will allow a much more consistent and richer offering around advertising on mobile.
Our research also revealed that one in two mobile media users is happy to receive advertising messages on their mobile phone, as long as those adverts are relevant and bring benefits to the end user, for example in the form of coupons, useful alerts, or location challenges.
Unless the industry works together, addresses complexity and properly understands mobile behaviours, we risk being held at a standstill and never reaching the promised tipping point.
