Self-professed rodeo clown Glenn Beck castigates the Occupy Wall Street protesters, but he's always running off at the mouth about the Founding Fathers and how brilliant they were.
Every American, no matter if you're young or old; rich or poor; red state or blue state; Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, Native American; has the freedom to assemble and freedom of speech, which is at the heart of these protests.
I may disagree with a number of things the tea party advocates, but there is no way I would condemn them for doing it.
What would this world be without protest?
Those brave men, women and children chose not to accept the status quo, and this nation and the world are much better off because they did.
The massive corporate greed that has devastated the wages of the common worker, and seen the pay of a bunch on Wall Street go through the stratosphere for literally making nothing tangible, has been immoral and obscene.
No, Occupy Wall Street is about trying to bring some decency and honesty back to an industry that used to have some.
Are we going to continue to allow ourselves to be held hostage by the big banks?
That mean the young and righteous Davids must protest, march, sit-in, work the halls of Congress and state capitals nationwide, and make it clear that as long as Wall Street, its lobbyists and political protectors continue to mistreat the common man and woman, they are our mortal enemy.
