(CNN) -- Cycling can be the cruelest of sports and just when New Zealand's Jack Bauer was ready to celebrate a Tour de France stage win it was snatched away from him in an instant.
It left the way clear for the sprinters but Bauer looked set to spoil their day with his gallant but in the end fruitless effort.
"This was my first chance to be up the road and with the chance in the wind and the weather, me and Martin realized we had a chance for the win.
Monday is a rest day as the contenders take stock ahead of the challenge of the Pyrenees and the only time trial of the race which may well decide the podium positions.
