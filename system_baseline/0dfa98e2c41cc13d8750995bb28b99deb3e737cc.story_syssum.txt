London (CNN) -- Nearly four decades after he brought an invasion of mutant, flesh-eating rodents to London with his first novel, "The Rats," UK chiller writer James Herbert has died aged 69.
Fans of his books paid tribute to the indelible mark they left on the readers' psyche.
"Sad news about James Herbert -- as a teen, I scared myself silly reading him.
Born in the East End of London, the son of street traders, Herbert grew up in Whitechapel -- where Jack the Ripper once stalked his victims -- in an area badly hit by Second World War bombing raids.
He lived in Sussex, in southern England, with his wife of more than 40 years, Eileen, with whom he had three daughters.
