Livia isn't sick, but doctors fear she might become the 53rd person to contract measles in a recent Disneyland outbreak.
Two days later, the doctor's office called to say that a child with measles had been in the office that same day.
Then the Simons learned from a doctor that the child in the doctor's office had contracted measles because his parents had refused vaccination.
If the rest of the community is immune to disease, it helps keep the disease from spreading to those who are unvaccinated.
A happy baby, she doesn't seem to mind being at home, but it's disrupted the Simons' life and cost them money, as the couple had to miss work for several days and then bring Jennifer's mother in from Houston to stay home with Livia.
