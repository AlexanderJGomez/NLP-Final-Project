And despite the absence of a car-making industry, the city can now boast a home-made electric car all of its own.
"In London they have government incentives to get people to switch from gasoline to electric vehicles," explains Chung, citing the waiver of the congestion charge and free parking for EVs in London as an example.
But according to Chung, the restrictions they have to operate under mean introducing them now into the mass market isn't practical.
Under the rules of the Low Emission Zone, for example, fees as high as $400 can be imposed on trucks and vans trying to enter Greater London that are more than six years old.
That's about education, says Professor Eric Cheng, director of the Power Electronics Research Center at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, whose team was involved in the MyCar project.
Hong Kongers are not familiar with EVs he says, and are concerned about the technology so they need to be shown that EVs are just as good as petrol cars.
The government needs to put a mandatory scheme [in place], to start off with public transport so people can get used to it and see that it is good."
Cheng says the amount of money his department received to design MyCar was nowhere near enough and to him, it told him how important the government view EVs.
"Car-makers want subsidies from the government, as the initial costs are very high.
In the meantime Chung is making plans to sell MyCar in London, her first stop the London Motor Show in July to stir up some more interest.
"We want to come here -- as long as the policy is there to make it happen," says Chung.
