I've consistently faced "random" selections for extra screening at the airport after I decided to wear the hijab, or Muslim head covering.
However, the Transportation Security Administration  is judging me and other Muslims by the way we look.
The TSA uses the hijab to profile Muslim women, and passengers can now expect a full-body pat-down, an appallingly invasive "enhanced pat-down search  that could include the chest and groin, or a planned "mind-scan"  that would track people's reaction to terrorist symbols.
Especially over the past month, I've been shocked at the comments about my faith, and the sometimes-prejudiced support for racial profiling.
For people who aren't affected by racial profiling at airports, imagine this: The TSA implements a new rule to counter drunken driving, which kills over 13,000 Americans every year.
Racial profiling violates the U.S. Constitution, is ineffective and trickles down to the workplace, schools and elsewhere.
There are some people who don't know Muslims and are numb to realizing the effects of profiling.
According to the Pew Research Center, people who know Muslims are less likely to have negative views of them.
There are some Americans who think Muslims are terrorists and some Muslims who think that other Americans are willfully ignorant.
But we need to stop the inflation of procedures that make our society more afraid and less secure.
