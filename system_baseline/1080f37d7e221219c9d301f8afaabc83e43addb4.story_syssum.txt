The stranded freighter had been headed south through the Gulf of Mexico from Port Arthur, Texas, but "lost main propulsion 90 miles southeast of Galveston" and was unable to steer, the Coast Guard said.
On Friday before the storm hit, authorities picked up more than 120 people stranded by rising seas along the southeast Texas coast.
About half of those rescues were done by helicopters out of bases along the coast, said Coast Guard Petty Officer David Schulein.
Three HH-65C helicopters from Coast Guard Air Station Houston rescued more than 20 people and continued to fly rescue missions until weather grounded them Friday evening, said Petty Officer Renee Aiello, a station spokeswoman.
