(CNN) -- Women undergoing in-vitro fertilization should have only one or two embryos transferred during the process, depending on their age, says a study published Wednesday in the British medical journal The Lancet.
These two findings led authors to conclude that women who are 40 and older should have two embryos transferred per IVF cycle, while younger women should have only one embryo transferred, and no patients should have more than three embryos transferred at one time.
In the United States, unlike the United Kingdom, transferring three embryos is more of an acceptable practice if certain prognostic indicators are present.
He says one major limitation of Nelson's study is that the women were lumped in to only two groups: those younger than 40 and then the rest, when in reality the chances of a woman getting pregnant can depend on other variables as well.
You really want to adjust the number of embryos ... to not only maximize the chance of achieving a pregnancy but to counter that with a desire to reduce multiple births."
