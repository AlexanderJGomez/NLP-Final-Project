At 9:15 p.m. Sunday the fire was burning only on the southeast side of the island.
"It's still ripping right now," Austrian said at 5 a.m., noting that the blaze posed "quite a spectacle" with the town of Belvedere in the foreground and the Bay Bridge that connects Oakland and San Francisco serving as a backdrop.
Austrian, who has visited the island at least a dozen times, said he's concerned that firefighters won't be able to douse the blaze.
The island was used as a quarantine station for immigrants suspected of carrying diseases starting in the late 19th century.
