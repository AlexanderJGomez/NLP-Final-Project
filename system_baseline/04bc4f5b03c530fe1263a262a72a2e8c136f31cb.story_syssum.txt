Indeed, Islamophobia is often perpetuated by fear and a sense that Muslims are taking over our jobs, our homes and our lives, thus leading to a polarizing society and the so-called clash of civilizations.
Improving media practices and media responsibility on portraying and reporting fairly on Islam and British Muslims, without bias or discrimination or intent to incite anti-Muslim prejudice, is important.
Indeed, such reporting and representation of British Muslims also helps create the framework for the "othering" of communities and in particular may influence people's perceptions of Muslims, especially when combined with lazy journalism that fails to correctly represent the true facts of each case.
And we also know from previous studies looking at media coverage about Muslims, in particular post 9/11, that the weight of news stories -- even if individually factually accurate -- often stereotypes Muslims in an overwhelmingly negative light.
Now is the time for action to reverse this trend, and as Mehdi Hasan suggests, "sanctions for dishonest and demonizing press coverage of Muslims" might be one way to ensure that we start to see a balanced coverage that does not demonize or stereotype Muslims.
