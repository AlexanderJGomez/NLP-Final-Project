Paris (CNN) -- Investigators trying to determine why an Air France plane crashed mysteriously two years ago have recovered the complete contents of the flight data recorder and the last two hours of cockpit conversation, they announced Monday.
The investigators also recovered two bodies from the fuselage -- after finding only about 50 bodies in the days immediately after the crash.
The bulk of the plane was located earlier this year and contains many more human remains, according to investigators.
The plane slammed into the water while en route from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Paris, falling so fast that air masks did not have time to deploy.
