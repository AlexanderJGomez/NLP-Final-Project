While most women's rights campaigners welcome the progress in education, many are concerned it does not translate into greater equality in the workplace.
However, there's a paradox that we have a lot of women getting a higher education and they are still too absent from the workforce and politics.
The factors driving young women to seek a university education are not also driving them into the workplace, Dabbous-Sensenig said.
Nawar Al-Hassan Golley, Associate Professor in Literary Theory and Women's Studies at the American University of Sharjah, in the United Arab Emirates, said both the high percentage of women in university and their absence from the workforce can be explained in the social upbringing of girls.
"Therefore, for many girls school is their only opportunity to make friends and socialize outside the family, so it is something they look forward to.
While the high numbers of women getting a good education has not yet translated into parity in the workforce, it is a step in the right direction, both women agree.
Al-Hassan Golley added: "I think it will take a long time before women break through these cultural and societal expectations.
