Ertugrul Osman, grandson of Sultan Abdulhamid II and heir to the Ottoman throne, died this week in Istanbul of kidney failure at the age of 97, after having lived most of his life in exile in a humble third-floor walk-up apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side.
"Osman himself was born into a family that still ruled an empire stretching from the Balkans to the Indian Ocean.
In 1922, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the modern Turkish Republic, sent the last Ottoman sultan packing aboard a British warship.
In the early 1990s, after more than half a century outside the country, Osman returned to Turkey at the invitation of a Turkish prime minister.
The hundreds of mourners at Saturday's funeral stunned other surviving members of the Ottoman royal family.
"They are our grandfathers," said a young man named Fatih, who wore the long beard, turban and robes of a fundamentalist Islamic sect.
Hundreds of police officers blocked traffic as Osman was buried in a garden filled with the gravestones of Ottoman pashas and viziers, beside the ornate tombs of his grandfather Sultan Abdulhamid II and another ancestor, Sultan Mahmut II.
