Swedish prosecutors announce the next day that they are reopening the rape case against him, while the molestation charge will be upgraded to sexual coercion and sexual molestation.
On November 20, the Stockholm Criminal Court issues an international arrest warrant for Assange, stating he is suspected of several counts of rape, sexual molestation and illegal use of force.
After a series of hearings in July, the British High Court defers its decision until November, ultimately ruling against Assange's appeal.
The High Court announces that Assange will be allowed to appeal its decision on the legal technicality of whether the Swedish public prosecutor is a judicial authority, a status needed to sign an arrest warrant.
He says Ecuador received written notice from British authorities that they would "assault" the country's embassy in London if Assange was not handed over.
The UK says it is disappointed by the decision and will not grant safe passage out of the country to Assange, who has now been holed up inside Ecuador's embassy in London for nearly two months.
