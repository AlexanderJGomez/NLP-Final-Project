Arora, who shared the video with CNN on Sunday, said he also turned it over to authorities investigating Lisa's disappearance in hopes it will help in the search for the girl.
Lisa was reported missing at 4 a.m. October 4, after Jeremy Irwin came home from work to find the door unlocked, the lights on and a window that had been tampered with.
The attorney for Lisa's parents said the release of the affidavit Friday was "unfortunate," as it could derail the search for the missing girl.
Bradley said in an NBC interview last week that she was drunk the night the infant disappeared and that she had last seen the baby about four hours earlier than initially reported.
And the main fear with that is, if they arrest me, people are going to stop looking for her.
Irwin said it's possible someone could have entered the house without Bradley hearing, as the couple's bedroom is on the opposite corner of the house from Lisa's room and Bradley sleeps with a fan at high speed.
The missing girl has two bottom teeth and a "beauty mark" on her right outer thigh, police said.
