(CNN) -- An unusual movie promotion stunt threatened to turn deadly Tuesday when a World War II-era biplane flipped over while landing near the nation's capital.
"It looked like (Michael) was up on the main gear, and then the nose went down and the tail went up," said pilot Dave Brown, who was directly behind Truschel's aircraft.
The main body of the overturned plane remained high enough off the ground for Truschel and his passenger to release their harnesses and then climb out.
Brown said there was damage to the tail, a wing and the prop of Truschel's plane.
