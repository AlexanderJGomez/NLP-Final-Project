Etan Patz, who disappeared in 1979, was the first missing child featured in the milk carton campaigns of the 1980s.
Etan, like any 6-year-old, argued that all of his friends walked to the bus stop alone, and his parents relented.
The boy's disappearance was one of the key events that inspired the missing children's movement, which raised awareness of child abductions and led to new ways to search for missing children.
Patz lived with this hope until 1982, when he learned of Jose Antonio Ramos' arrest and the surprising connection between him and a former babysitter of Etan's.
In 1982 he was arrested after boys in a neighborhood in the Bronx complained that he had stolen their book bags while trying to coax them into a drainpipe under a bridge, where he lived, said the Patzes and federal prosecutor Stuart GraBois, who spent years investigating the case.
Ramos was released when the parents of the Bronx boys chose not to press charges against him, according to published reports.
According to GraBois, Ramos claimed he released the boy and brought him to a subway station so the boy could go visit his aunt in Washington Heights.
He wouldn't go into detail about what Ramos might have told them, but said he's convinced he's eyeing the right suspect.
