Unlike its counterpart, the 2DS does not have 3-D visual effects, nor can it be folded shut like other DS handheld consoles.
The controls are similar to other Nintendo handheld consoles and screen sizes are the same as the 3DS unit.
"Oh I'm so happy they're creating a 2DS," said @omglazerkittens on Twitter.
The new console may appeal to "parents who want to buy their kids PokÃ©mon and a 3DS at an affordable price," wrote Haziq, a member of popular online video-gaming forum NeoGAF.
"To those who say the 2DS is a kid-friendly option, where does the inability to protect the screen with folding fall into that?"
"Parents will be buying this for kids and that's the point, hence the price," wrote Alpha_eX.
