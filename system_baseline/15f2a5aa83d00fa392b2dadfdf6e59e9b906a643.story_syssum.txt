(CNN) -- Scores of people died Thursday in and around the restive Syrian city of Hama, activists said, corroborating reports of widespread casualties a day after the start of a new military clampdown targeting protesters.
The western Syrian city is the center of the country's anti-government movement, whose efforts have prompted a crackdown by security personnel on the huge demonstrations there in an effort to secure the city.
The resident said entrances of the city were blocked, with no one getting in or out, and snipers were stationed across the city.
Hama, which has seen massive demonstrations by anti-government protesters, was the site of the 1982 bloody crackdown by the Alawite-dominated government against a Muslim Brotherhood uprising.
After prayers, worshipers exited the rear of the mosque to join an anti-government demonstration, but were met by about 24 thugs -- men in civilian clothes armed with guns and batons, the sources told CNN in telephone interviews.
A few militia members entered the front yard of the mosque carrying batons and stun guns and attacked the protesters who were there, the sources said.
The council issued a presidential statement, which carries no enforcement weight.
"The settlement in this country should be carried out by the Syrians themselves without outside interference and should be based on an all-Syria dialogue, which is the only way to resolve the conflict," the ministry said in a statement.
It said an opposition leader in the city reported that the government had launched a series of measures to punish residents.
That's because it is questionable whether the move, absent constitutional reform, could end decades of single-party Baathist rule.
