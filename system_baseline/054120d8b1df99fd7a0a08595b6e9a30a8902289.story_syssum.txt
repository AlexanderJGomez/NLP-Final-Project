The 36-year-old from Atlanta, Georgia, said he tried to convert his analog TV to digital but was turned down for a government coupon.
Richter will have four months longer to make up his mind after Congress voted Wednesday to delay the end of TV's rabbit-ears era.
There's been little made of the people behind those numbers, though, as media reports largely have focused on the mechanics of the switch and the politics of when and how it will happen.
While a person can live without TV, some of the late converts to digital depend on television for information and companionship.
Lawson said she got a coupon to buy the digital converter box for her analog television as soon as they became available.
Some remote areas of the country could lose reception when analog signals stop in June, said Shermaze Ingram, spokesperson for the National Association of Broadcasters, an advocacy group that has been trying to inform people about the switch since 2006.
The National Association of Broadcasters supports delaying the change until June in part because it will cause fewer people to go without TV after the change.
Like Touchine, more than 12 percent of New Mexico households in the Santa Fe and Albuquerque TV market are not ready for the switch, making the area the least prepared in the nation, according to Nielsen.
Richter said he left a bad job as a local truck driver four years ago and hasn't been able to find steady work since.
He said he applied for the free converter about a month ago but was turned down at least temporarily because all of the coupons had been given out.
But if not, he said won't be angry at the government for the delays.
