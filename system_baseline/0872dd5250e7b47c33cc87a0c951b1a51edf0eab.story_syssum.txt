None of them had the H1N1 virus, as swine flu is technically called, but health authorities imposed the lockdown May 1 after another hotel guest from Mexico was diagnosed with the disease.
Dragging luggage and carrying purses and backpacks, they were applauded and cheered by hotel workers and local officials, who formed what looked like a receiving line to send them off.
The quarantine was imposed more than a week ago after the 25-year-old guest from Mexico tested positive for swine flu.
Coincidentally the Mexican patient was released from the Princess Margaret Hospital Friday, nearly an hour after the guests who had been quarantined at the hotel, a hospital spokesman said.
About 100 hotel staff members were also confined to the premises due to the quarantine.
With no pool to lounge by and just one restaurant to pick from, guests milled about in the lobby to pick up food or get their temperatures taken once a day.
