Last season there was shock among fans when singer Jesse Campbell, one of the favorites to win the title, was eliminated by coach Christina Aguilera.
As soon as Green carried out the unenviable task of choosing just one, the other coaches hammered on their buttons and made their pitches to bring the loser onto one of their teams, just like they do in the battle rounds.
"It's nice to throw those elements in to kind of spice things up," Levine said.
"There's a chance that person may go on and win this and that's gonna make me look really stupid.
This is another way of changing somebody's life later on in the show, where they think all hope is lost, they're going home, the next thing you know the button gets pushed and they're right back in the game again.
Only Green holds out on that, saying, "A few memorable things have happened thus far, but season three isn't completed yet, so I don't know if this is the favorite season yet."
"Over time we see how each of us react as coaches, giving such heartfelt advice and attention to these up-and-coming young fresh talents and it's so nice to see," she said.
"We're always going to be connected to each other through this show," he says.
The show will run this year in both the fall and spring seasons, which could result in one or more of the coaches having to take a sabbatical to go on tour.
Green shut down the speculation while nicely summing up the bond among the current four.
