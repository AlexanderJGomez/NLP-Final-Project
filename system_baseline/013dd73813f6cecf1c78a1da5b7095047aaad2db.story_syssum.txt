The judge was forced to halt proceedings several times due to chaos in the courtroom, according to Egyptian state TV.
Outside the courtroom, clashes broke out between police and families of those killed in the uprising that led to Mubarak's ouster.
At least 22 people were arrested and 26 people were injured -- 14 police officers and 12 protesters -- according to the Interior Ministry and the Health Ministry.
The clashes began when the families of those killed tried to push their way into Cairo's police academy, the site of the trial.
It was his third appearance before Refaat, who ordered the trial closed in August -- a ruling partially imposed to protect potential witnesses.
Attorneys for El Adly petitioned the judge Monday to separate the cases.
The elder Mubarak is the first leader since this year's Arab Spring revolts to face a judge.
Meanwhile, Cairo's district courts have indicated they are considering filing individual charges against Mubarak for every person killed by his forces in the uprising.
