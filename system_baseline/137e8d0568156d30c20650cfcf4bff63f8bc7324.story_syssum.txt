Bobby Petrino is no longer calling Hogs at the University of Arkansas, because somebody by the handle of "hoggrad" on that popular woopig.net website for Razorback fans first reported that the Arkansas football coach wasn't exactly watching game film that evening.
As a result, those who run professional sports teams have combined with athletics directors on the collegiate level to use a new approach regarding highly successful coaches, managers and others involved with scandalous situations: They whack them.
It's just that the Petrino situation and others have placed those on campuses in the forefront of it all.
And, in some ways, there's an expectation that the decision should come quicker.
The Des Moines Register ran a photo of the former Iowa State basketball coach drinking beer and kissing women at a party near the campus of the University of Missouri after an Iowa State loss.
The tape came to light at the end of last year, and among other things, it contributed to the end of Fine's 35-year tenure under legendary Syracuse head coach Jim Boeheim.
It talked of parties and gifts for North Carolina football players, and those revelations led to the Tar Heels receiving NCAA probation, vacating two seasons worth of games and the firing of popular coach Butch Davis.
Their firings were in contrast to what university bosses did in the past to guilty but effective employees: nothing.
If that isn't enough, Arkansas plays in the Southeastern Conference, where life revolves around breathing and football.
So, if this were 20, 30 or any of those years before "tweet" meant more than what birds do, Arkansas officials would have shrugged over Petrino lying about being alone, when he left a ditch on the side of a rural Arkansas road with four broken ribs and a cracked vertebra after he crashed his motorcycle.
Woopig.net surely did.
