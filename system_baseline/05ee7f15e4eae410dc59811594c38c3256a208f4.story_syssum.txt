Despite those incidents, a group with suspected ties to North Korea calling itself "Guardians of Peace" was able to infiltrate Sony's computer system, steal an incredible amount of data, and use it to launch the most vicious cyber-attack in history on an American corporation.
Asia Strategist Keith Henry says Sony was taken by complete surprise last month when the cyber-terrorists successfully stole massive amounts of data and used it to devastate the company.
They posted personal information like addresses and social security numbers, private emails that contained embarrassing revelations about top executives and Hollywood stars, insider information about the studio's tactics, and they even posted five Sony movies on file-sharing websites.
He says the Sony network may be more vulnerable because of the large amount of users with varying degrees of access.
Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian Studies at Temple University in Tokyo says the attack reveals lax cyber-security among Sony's ranks.
And they're not really managing this risk very well or very aggressively," Kingston said.
