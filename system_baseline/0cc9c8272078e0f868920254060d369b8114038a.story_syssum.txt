The proposed enhancements to the European Financial Stability Facility would allow the fund to increase its lending capacity from â‚¬250 billion to â‚¬440 billion and buy sovereign bonds in capital markets -- a strategy designed to prop up debt prices and help struggling eurozone countries fund themselves.
The Estonian parliament passed one of two necessary resolutions to ratify EFSF expansion earlier this week, despite attempts by the country's main opposition party to block the changes on the grounds that one of the eurozone's poorer states simply cannot afford to help bailout failing eurozone economies.
One of the eurozone's poorest countries is also the biggest obstacle to enhancing the EFSF -- and members of the governing coalition's refusal to approve the plan means a parliamentary vote may not happen until mid-October.
One of the most vocal opponents of EFSF enhancement in the early going, Finland has now dropped its demand that Greece put up some cash collateral in return for its approval -- a requirement that threatened to derail the bailout fund expansion and further destabilize global markets.
Ratification of the expansion of EFSF powers was included in Italy's passage of highly contentious austerity measures aimed at balancing Europe's third largest economy by 2013.
French banks are among the most exposed to risk due to a potential Greek default.
