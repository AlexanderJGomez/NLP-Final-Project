Bulger eluded federal authorities for more than 16 years before his arrest in June 2011.
Esslinger told CBS' Bill Whitaker that Bulger wrote, "'If I could choose my epitaph on my tombstone, it would be 'I'd rather be in Alcatraz.'
There's even a photo of a smiling Bulger with his then-girlfriend Teresa Stanley dressed in mock prison garb.
"According to (Bulger's associate Kevin) Weeks, Bulger had even taken preliminary steps to track down the overseer of the program, Dr. Carl Pfeiffer ... and assassinate him," English wrote.
Bulger wasn't pleased, so when the baby was born in May 1967, Cyr listed her ex-boyfriend as the boy's father on the birth certificate.
"He helped pay for child care and showered Douglas with toys," wrote the Globe's Cullen and Murphy.
Bulger served nearly four years in the U.S. Air Force, working as an aircraft mechanic and earning his high school diploma.
Nearly every mobster has a colorful nickname, but family and associates say Bulger hated "Whitey," a reference to his white-blond hair as a child.
In his letters to Esslinger, Bulger described that time as "a 16-year honeymoon."
The "unassuming two bedroom apartment" can be yours "for $2,950 a month -- far more than Bulger himself had paid during his rent-controlled stint there," according to  The Hollywood Reporter.
