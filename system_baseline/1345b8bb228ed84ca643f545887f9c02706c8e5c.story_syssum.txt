(CNN) -- Federal prosecutors in California announced a series of actions Friday targeting what they characterized as the "large, for-profit marijuana industry" that has developed since the state legalized medical marijuana for select patients 15 years ago.
Wagner, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of California, told reporters Friday that federal authorities "are not focused on backyard grows with small amounts of marijuana by seriously ill people.
"What today's actions did, if nothing else, is to reinforce the terrific disconnect between the federal government and not only the general population, but the 16 states and the District of Columbia that have chosen to get away from the prohibition of medical marijuana," said St. Pierre.
Authorities said that they also sent out "dozens of letters" in recent days to those who own and hold liens on properties where commercial marijuana is grown and sold.
In some cases, that has included a threat that the properties could be lost and any funds derived from them -- such as via rent payments -- could be lost.
He argued that some industry and dispensary model was needed, saying it wasn't realistic to force sick people to grow their own marijuana or to limit the places where they can get it.
This would be inferior, he claimed, to "a system that most of us are much more familiar with, where you can go lawfully to a retail outlet and purchase exactly what you can lawfully possess."
