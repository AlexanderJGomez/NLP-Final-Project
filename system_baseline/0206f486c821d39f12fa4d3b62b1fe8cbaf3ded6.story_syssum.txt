Mann's character -- "Downtown" Leroy Brown -- is a lovable, sometimes outrageous and always off-the-wall senior citizen who has stolen every scene he's entered in Tyler Perry's plays, movies and TV shows.
"Meet the Browns" is a spinoff of Perry's "House of Payne," a sitcom that has yielded strong cable ratings for TBS, and it employs some of the same characters seen in Perry's movies and stage plays -- including a play and film named "Meet the Browns," which is only mildly related to the TV series.
"If it hadn't been for Cora, Mr. Brown and Madea probably would have killed each other by now," Mann said.
"I use to go to a nursing home and just look at people, watch -- 'OK, that's how they're doing this.'
"The clothes just kind of happened," he said.
"I'm very animated and so I just had to make sure I toned that down for the screen because I'm so used to making sure that the person in the front row can see as well as the person in the balcony," he said.
"Oh, he can come out any time," Mann, speaking as Brown, said.
"What's funny is when people see me out they're like, 'Are you Mr. Brown's son?'
Perhaps the most awkward time is when he is on the set, dressed as Mr. Brown, and he wants to show his wife, Tamela Mann, some husbandly affection.
You can also see Mr. Brown in "Tyler Perry's Madea Goes To Jail," which hit theaters last month and has been a rousing success at the box office.
"She's been to jail a few times, but this time Madea goes to prison -- or as Mr. Brown would say, 'prisnuh.'
