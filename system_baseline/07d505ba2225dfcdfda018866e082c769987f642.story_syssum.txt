Both men were hospitalized and expected to survive, according to David Peterka, who was part of the film crew, but was not aboard the plane.
The plane was headed to nearby Wilson Airport, where most light aircraft land in the Kenyan capital.
Parris crawled out and Lehr, with the help of bystanders, pulled the pilot and the engineer out as the plane burst into flames, Peterka said.
"Before the plane crashed, witnesses said it was flying unusually low," said Francis Mwaka, a Kenyan federal communications official.
