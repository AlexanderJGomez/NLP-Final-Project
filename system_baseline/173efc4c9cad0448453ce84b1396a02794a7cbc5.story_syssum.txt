It's an arrest I saw happen -- along with more than a thousand other people watching a spectacular new stage show that brings Frank's time in hiding to life so vividly that some were moved to tears.
It's hoped the production -- which features lavishly designed sets that revolve and glide across a giant panoramic stage -- will bring the story of the young Jewish diarist to a new generation.
Its creators hope it will become a permanent fixture, attracting some of the visitors who line up for hours to see the original annex inside Amsterdam's canal-side Anne Frank Museum.
The new dramatization aims to present a more faithful image of the ambitious teenager -- whose rebellious nature and adolescent desires were originally edited out of her published diary.
The writers say they tried to strike a careful balance in showing respect for the memory of those involved while still producing an entertaining play.
They should be aware of what happened here -- and not just come to Amsterdam for the drugs."
The Anne Frank Foundation, an educational charity that holds soon-to-expire copyright to the diary, commissioned the play in the hope of reaching out to a new generation almost 70 years after Frank died.
De Levita says judging by the experience of showing the play to his own teenage son and his friends, it hits the mark.
