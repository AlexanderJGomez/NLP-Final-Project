Placerville, California (CNN) -- California's attorney general is "actively reviewing" an animal charity executive who had agreed not to take a higher office with another charity after a state investigation into how her previous employer had spent its donations, a spokesman for the AG's office told CNN.
The former bookkeeper, who wants to conceal her identity for reasons unrelated to her work at Noah's Wish, told CNN that donations came pouring into Noah's Wish soon after Hurricane Katrina.
"There was cash, there were checks, there were cashiers checks, there were letters -- heartbreaking letters from kids who, instead of having birthday parties, they wanted all the money to go to Noah's Wish to help those poor little animals," the woman said.
When approached by CNN at her Placerville, California, home, Crisp told CNN she has "nothing to hide" but refused to answer any detailed questions without permission from the organization's communications director.
She did tell CNN that the Noah's Wish board of directors set her salary and that she is now an employee, not a director, at SPCA International.
The other veterans charity, National Veterans Foundation, raised more than $22 million in donations over the past three years to help veterans yet spent about $18.2 million to pay Quadriga Art, according to IRS 990 forms.
There's no question that a charity needs to spend money to raise money, according to Bob Ottenhoff, president of the charity watchdog group Guidestar.
In addition to its questionable finances, CNN found that SPCA International misrepresented the "Baghdad Pups" program on its tax filings.
Yet the charity admitted that only 26 of the nearly 500 animals transported to the United States from Iraq and Afghanistan were actually service animals.
