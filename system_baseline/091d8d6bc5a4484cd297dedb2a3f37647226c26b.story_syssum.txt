San Francisco, California (CNN) -- Attorneys supporting the voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage in California filed a notice of appeal in the case Thursday, one day after a federal judge ruled that the measure is unconstitutional.
Paul Callan, a former New York prosecutor and criminal defense attorney, said he believes Walker's decision is likely to be upheld there, saying the appeals court "is a very liberal court which is favorable on these issues."
He said Walker's decision treats children as a "mere afterthought when it comes to marriage ... And the court also found that there is no benefit whatsoever for a child to be raised by its own biological parents.
A lot of cases will be decided by the lower courts, and then they'll move in and make the big decision as to whether it's legal or not, gay marriage," he said.
Walker pointed out in his ruling, "race restrictions on marital partners were once common in most states but are now seen as archaic, shameful or even bizarre.
This decision to ensure that our constitutional rights are as protected as everyone else's makes us incredibly proud of our country," said Kristin Perry, a plaintiff in the case along with Sandy Stier.
In a national survey, conducted by Gallup in May, 53 percent of respondents said such marriages should not be recognized by law, while 44 percent said they should.
"With a stroke of his pen, Judge Walker has overruled the votes and values of 7 million Californians who voted for marriage as one man and one woman."
