Last week, a 25-year follow-up of the Canadian National Breast Screening Study was published -- one of the eight major randomized trials of screening mammography.
The allegation of cheating -- purposely putting women whom researchers knew had advanced cancers in the mammography group -- is an incredibly serious one.
The new study provides evidence that randomization did exactly what it is supposed to do: It created two identical groups of women.
For mammographers who need to point to the benefits demonstrated by earlier trials of mammography, this is an odd allegation.
In fact, one of the trials most favorable to screening -- the Health Insurance Plan of New York's -- dates from two decades before Canada's, in the early 1960s, when mammography technologies were primitive.
But many in the old guard are more likely to attack any suggestion that screening doesn't work as well as advertised, characterizing researchers who raise the possibility as "malicious" or "dangerous" and questioning the editorial policies of the journals that publish their work.
To make sense of information the Canadian trial offers, you need to understand its unique design -- specifically what is being compared with what.
In other words, the trial tested the usefulness of adding mammography to a physical exam in an effort to detect abnormalities that are too small to feel.
It is important to recognize this estimate doesn't include the smallest, earliest form of breast cancer found only by mammography -- ductal carcinoma in situ or DCIS.
It's time to get the science back in screening mammography and to recognize that mammographers may not be the ideal source for balanced information.
