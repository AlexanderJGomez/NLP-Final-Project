Officials revealed at the hearing that Ross Dunkley, the editor of the Myanmar Times, faces charges related to torturing and drugging a woman.
The woman making the allegations against Dunkley was at the hearing, and said the editor gave her a drug on two occasions that hampered her memory.
"She admitted that she made allegations during the hearing that she had not made in her initial police interview."
"I cannot say for sure that the cause behind Ross' arrest was driven by business dispute because I was not with him in Myanmar," said Armstrong.
