Desperately trying to hold onto power, Federalists accused Jefferson of all sorts of infidelities to God and country, blasting him as an infidel and intimating that he might be a secret Jew or Muslim.
Into this maelstrom, Jefferson delivered perhaps the most conciliatory inaugural address in U.S. history, "better liked by our own party than his own," in the words of Massachusetts Federalist George Cabot.
... We are all Republicans.
In this address, which according to Frederick Douglass "sounded more like a sermon than a state paper," Lincoln thinks out loud about the ways and means of Providence in the midst of the bloodletting of the Civil War.
The prayers of both could not be answered.
Like Jefferson and Lincoln, FDR delivered his first inaugural address in a moment of crisis, though this time the crisis was economic rather than political or military.
Into this grim situation FDR delivered hope.
But Roosevelt struck the right chord for the moment, and his reassuring words paved the way for the massive overhaul of the federal government now known as the New Deal.
John F. Kennedy's first and only inaugural was a Cold War speech that barely mentioned domestic policy.
... Let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us."
While FDR paved the way for the New Deal, Reagan set the groundwork for its gradual dismantling.
Reagan's first inauguration came on the same day that 52 American hostages were released from Iran.
