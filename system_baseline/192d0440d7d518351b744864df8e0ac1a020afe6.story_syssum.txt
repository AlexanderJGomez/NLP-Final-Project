Republicans in the House had been hit over the head in their districts by ads run by conservative political action committees (paging Sen. Ted Cruz, who appeared in some).
So the plan to defund Obamacare -- and tie it to a measure to fund the government -- was hatched.
Never mind that House Speaker John Boehner was already on the record saying he didn't want to do that.
The Senate passed a clean bill to fund the government, and the rest is history.
But a funny thing happened on the way to the national stage: The president decided not to cave, and Republicans treated this as if it were shocking that he would not gut his single biggest legislative achievement.
It landed with one big thud, which would have been a big problem for the administration, except for this: Nobody was talking about it, because the country was preoccupied with the shutdown.
Scrambling to find ways to re-fund parts of the government to curb public outrage.
So Obamacare had a crashing start, the government is shut down, and the deadline to raise the debt ceiling is a week away.
If you look closely here, you will see that something very profound has changed: Republicans seem to have pressed the delete key on talk of defunding Obamacare.
And some cooler heads I have spoken with are privately making the same point: Wasn't it always unfair to promise people something the Republicans knew they could never deliver (defunding Obamacare)?
In the end, they will probably find a short-term way to fund the government and raise the debt ceiling and continue to argue over spending and taxes.
A study of the newly perverse politics of our time, and how a government was brought to its knees over a fight only a few wanted to wage -- that everyone secretly knew could never be won.
