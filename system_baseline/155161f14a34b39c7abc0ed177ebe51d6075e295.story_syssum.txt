The decomposing body of Elisa Lam floated inside a water tank on the roof of the Cecil Hotel while guests brushed their teeth, bathed and drank water from it for as long as 19 days.
Five days later, she was seen on a security camera video walking into the elevator, pushing the buttons for four floors and then peering out of the opened elevator door as if she is hiding or looking for someone.
Strange things began happening with the hotel's water supply later in the month, according to Sabina and Michael Baugh, a British couple who spent eight days there.
"When you turned the tap on, the water was coming black first for two seconds and then it was going back to normal."
Two former guests, Steven and Gloria Cott, filed a class-action lawsuit against the hotel in late February.
