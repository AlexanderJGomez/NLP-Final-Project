Police found six people -- two men, two women and two boys -- dead in a home in a north Memphis neighborhood Monday, said Memphis police Lt. Joe Scott.
He said there was no sign of forced entry into the home, and evidence at the scene indicated that the killer or killers left the house.
The four dead adults were shot and the two dead children were stabbed, sources told CNN affiliate WMC-TV.
The newspaper reported Tuesday that two of them were in very critical condition and one was in serious condition.
"I heard about six or seven shots," said Wayne Bolden, a landscaper who said he lives across the street from the home where the killings occurred.
Monday, he saw many police cars at the home and heard about the killings, he said.
"There are multiple families affected by this," said Norman, who said he did not want to speak about what led to the killings.
"We just don't know the motive or cause of death, but we do have four adults and two children [dead]," Memphis police Lt. Jerry Guin told the paper.
Neighbor Leo Baker told WMC-TV he has lived nearby for 10 years but did not know the residents of the home.
The newspaper reported that the shooting appeared to be the city's deadliest mass killing since 1973, when 28-year-old David Sanders randomly shot and killed five people before being shot dead by police.
