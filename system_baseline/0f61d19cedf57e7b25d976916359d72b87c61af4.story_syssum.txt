Key said ISIS -- also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) --  posed a threat to stability in regions beyond the Middle East and New Zealand had "an obligation" to help support the rule of law internationally.
"We do not shy away from taking our share of the burden when the international rules based system is threatened as it is today."
Labour leader Andrew Little said his party was opposed to sending troops to Iraq and that it was unlikely they would remain behind the front line.
"Nothing has changed in Iraq, except 'his club' persuaded Mr Key to commit our troops," Peters said in a statement.
The deployment came at the request of the Iraqi government and was likely to be a joint training mission with neighboring Australia, Key said.
Richard Jackson from the National Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies at New Zealand's University of Otago said New Zealand's commitment to the coalition would likely be dangerous for its citizens in the Middle East region.
If they start showing pictures of civilians killed by Western bombing that might involve someone living in Auckland or Canberra or elsewhere who might decide off their own bat to commit an act of violence."
"It's been clear for some time that the government was intending to make a military contribution," he said.
New Zealand's successful pitch to join the United Nations Security Council involved presenting itself as a country that had an independent foreign policy, and may have been a factor in the delaying the commitment, Ayson said.
"Given that there are 62 countries in the coalition it's not like Iraq in 2003.
"We value the contributions and efforts of all partners in the mission as we work together on a multifaceted and long-term strategy to degrade and defeat ISIL," State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement.
