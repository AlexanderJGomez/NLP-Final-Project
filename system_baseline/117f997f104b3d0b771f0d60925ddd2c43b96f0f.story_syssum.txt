(CNN) -- The Supreme Court on Monday took away some of the government's power to tighten emission standards, but preserved the majority of its authority under federal law to regulate greenhouse gases.
But the court majority said the administration was not being hampered too greatly in the end, since EPA can still regulate all but 3 percent of the 86 percent of sources responsible for greenhouse gases.
"Today is a good day for all supporters of clean air and public health and those concerned with creating a better environment for future generations," it said in a statement.
The justices in 2007 agreed with EPA and many environmentalists that greenhouse gasses, including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions, cause air pollution, but that case dealt with emissions from motor vehicles.
Defining "air pollutant" within the context of greenhouse gases and the ability of the EPA to exercise its regulatory authority absent what it says was a clear congressional mandate -- was the issue here.
The justices earlier this year allowed the EPA to measure emissions from an upwind state that is polluting a downwind state, and requiring upwind states to pay for greenhouse gas reductions.
