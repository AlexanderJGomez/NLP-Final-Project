"I've always considered myself a feminist, although I was always afraid of that word because people put so much on it," Beyonce says.
It's just a person that believes in equality for men and women.
To be honest, "I sometimes wish that I could just be anonymous and walk down a street like everyone else," she adds.
That said, Beyonce is never one to play the victim.
There are those who think they'll "lose something when they get married, but it doesn't have to be that way," Beyonce, who's been married to Jay Z for six years, reflects.
It is the most powerful thing you can ever feel in your life.
... One thing that's for sure: The love that I have for music, for my husband, for my child, is something that will last far beyond my life."
