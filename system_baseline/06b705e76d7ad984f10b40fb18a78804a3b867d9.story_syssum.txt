By early Saturday, police were nowhere to be seen in the capital of Cairo, with military forces deployed on streets all around the nation for the first time in more than three decades.
At the same time, the long-time ruler and his regime had a reputation for restricting freedoms and staunchly holding onto power.
"Police have always been violent, but we haven't seen it this way," Sarah Sirgany, a reporter for Daily News Egypt who has been posting regular developments on Twitter, told CNN's Piers Morgan.
There were many other reports of run-ins, and the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights reporting early Friday that the government had arrested more than 1,000 people, including political opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei.
Mansour, the Cairo resident, said he and fellow demonstrators celebrated when they saw troops roll into town, and they were not alone.
In the wee hours of Saturday, with the curfew ostensibly in effect, people continued to come up to friendly army troops, greeting them and posing for pictures by tanks.
"We are one of the richest Arab countries, and we want to live," said a 20-year-old student named Mohammed, whose last name was withheld to protect his identity, from Alexandria.
There, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali left the country after 23 years in power following weeks of demonstrations against his rule.
"We will do more and more, we will continue our demonstrations, and we will do 3,000 times more of what the Tunisians did."
