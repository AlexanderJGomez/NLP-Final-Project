So it is in Istanbul, on the cusp of Europe and Asia, where a serene skyline of domes and minarets looks down on streets teeming with traffic, traders and tourists.
To make the best of Buyukada, the largest of the islands, it's best to escape the town square -- almost permanently inhabited by a flock of dazed-looking tourists -- and head by foot or cycle to more peaceful areas.
The 6th century Aya Yorgi church and monastery, located on Buyukada's highest hill, is one of the island's most significant features.
The reward comes in the form of a magnificent sea view of distant Istanbul, and also the historic Greek church's beautiful interior.
With a few tables set in a garden and an open kitchen area, Sinek's modest menu includes an all-day Turkish breakfast, with sahanda sucuklu yumurta (fried eggs with cured Turkish sausage served in a metal pan) among favorites.
Visible from the ferry to the island, this amazing structure perched on the highest peak and surrounded by pine trees was once a theology school run by the formidably-named Eastern Orthodox Church's Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.
The premises also house the Aya Triada church (Chapel of the Holy Trinity) and a garden with a view so breathtaking that it might makes a pretty convincing case for divinity in its own right.
For lunch or dinner, Heyamola Ada Lokantasi, across from the Mavi Marmara station, is one of the best options with a colorful Aegean decor and meze (cold starters) such as grilled calamari and patlÄ±can ezmesi (eggplant puree).
A faster option is Mavi Marmara, a smaller boat that goes directly from either Kabatas or Bostanci to each of the islands separately on an hourly basis.
