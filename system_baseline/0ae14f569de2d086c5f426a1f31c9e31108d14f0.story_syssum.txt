Wearing a sundress and carrying her suitcase, she got on a Delta employee shuttle without being asked for identification.
"Here I was sitting in the middle of the C Terminal without having to go through security or do anything," Reynolds said.
The airport employee who let her into the secure area told her to go downstairs and go through security as she normally would, Reynolds said.
The police report states that Reynolds "was transported back to her vehicle and allowed to move her car" from the parking lot, noting that the delay caused her to miss her 6:30 a.m. flight to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, then on to Costa Rica.
