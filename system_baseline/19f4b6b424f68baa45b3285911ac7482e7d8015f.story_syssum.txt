Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- After 10 days of mourning and thousands of emotional eulogies and speeches, South Africa finally buried its most famous son, Nelson Mandela, on Sunday at his rural village of Qunu in the Eastern Cape.
Mandela's passing will not herald any shock new direction, but his funeral took place against the backdrop of massive political and economic disappointment, most powerfully demonstrated by the booing of Zuma -- for traditional Africans an unprecedented break with culture -- at Mandela's memorial service at the FNB stadium on December 10.
The economy is in trouble, with growth forecasts cut again and again over the past four years.
Thabo Mbeki, Mandela's successor who was removed from the presidency by Zuma in 2008, said last week that there was increasing frustration among ordinary people about the direction the country was taking.
Ordinary South Africans inured to corruption told me last week that they have no doubt that his hiring was corruptly influenced.
Members of the ruling ANC and society are now asking questions about the current crop of leaders' ability to get South Africa out of its current slump.
Is South Africa about to descend into racial conflagration because Mandela is gone, though?
Zuma's presidency has failed to implement necessary structural changes -- the ANC is in alliance with the powerful trade union federation Cosatu and kowtows to it on labour policy, leading to government paralysis -- to create jobs and economic growth.
However, with Mandela gone and the halo of the liberation era slowly slipping away, coupled with revulsion in many quarters of the rampant corruption and stasis of the current regime, a change is coming.
