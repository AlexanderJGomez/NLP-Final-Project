Christian Lusardi, 42, of Fayetteville, North Carolina, flushed $2.7 million worth of counterfeit poker chips down the toilet in a room at Harrah's Resort and Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey state police said.
It's the first time in Borgata's 10 years that anything like this has happened," Joe Lupo, senior vice president of operations at Borgata, told CNN.
Police say Lusardi introduced the counterfeit chips into the tournament on multiple occasions.
When it was canceled Friday, 27 people remained in the tournament.
