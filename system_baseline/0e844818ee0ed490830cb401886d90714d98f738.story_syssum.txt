He was the fourth Oakland officer to die after a gunman fired on police in two weekend incidents.
"John's courage and strength was enhanced by his ability to perceive the realities of life," the family said in the statement.
We completely and proudly support his decision, and it gives us a great deal of comfort to know that four individuals have received the gift of life because of our selfless and beloved John.
Emergency dispatchers received reports that two officers had been shot and needed help, he said.
The gunman fired on SWAT officers who entered the apartment, hitting two of them before police shot and killed the man, Jordan said.
A fifth officer who was grazed by a bullet was treated at a hospital and released, police spokesman Jeff Thomason said Saturday.
