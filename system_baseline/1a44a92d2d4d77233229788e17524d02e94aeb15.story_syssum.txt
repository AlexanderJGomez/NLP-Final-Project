The 3-D technology that's currently used in movies and other media relies on two visual images, one from each eye, combining in the viewer's brain to produce 3-D's extra layer of depth.
"We have demonstrated experimentally, for the first time, that the same 'special way' in which depth is experienced in 3D movies can also be experienced by looking at a normal picture with one eye viewing through a small aperture (circular hole).
Some experts believe that cumbersome 3-D glasses are a primary reason why the technology hasn't caught on with TV viewers.
Vishwanath suggested that 3-D could one day be produced by dramatically increasing the resolution of images.
