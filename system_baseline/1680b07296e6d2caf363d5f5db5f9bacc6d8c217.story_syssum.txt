Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- South Africans sang and prayed late Thursday outside the hospital where Nelson Mandela is being treated, singing "Viva Mandela!"
Mandela's condition improved, President Jacob Zuma said Thursday, as the eyes of the nation remained fixed on his progress.
"Tata" is the word for father in the language of Mandela's Xhosa tribe.
"Our government has been keeping all of us informed in this regard, and there is no reason to doubt the accuracy of the information they provide to the public," he said.
The ANC is organizing prayer sessions around the country "where all South Africans can come together, hold hands and pray for Madiba, his family and medical team," it said in a statement Thursday.
In South Africa, Mandela is most commonly referred to as Madiba, the name of the Thembu clan to which he belongs.
Police also cordoned off the street outside Mandela's Johannesburg home Thursday, the South African Press Association reported.
Mandela became an international figure while enduring 27 years in prison for fighting apartheid, the country's system of racial segregation.
Obama's schedule does not include a visit with the anti-apartheid icon.The president's trip to South Africa this weekend includes a stop on Robben Island, where Mandela spent a majority of his prison term.
After South Africa, Obama plans to head to Tanzania, his last stop before returning to Washington.
