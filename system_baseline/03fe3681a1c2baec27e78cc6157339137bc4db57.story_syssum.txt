At least that may be the message --and, more accurately, the hope -- of workers at the National Weather Service office in Anchorage, Alaska.
Still, it's no secret that National Weather Service employees -- like other federal government employees -- aren't getting paid as long as the government is shut down.
But there's no telling when that will happen, meaning they could work for days, weeks or months before they take home a paycheck.
