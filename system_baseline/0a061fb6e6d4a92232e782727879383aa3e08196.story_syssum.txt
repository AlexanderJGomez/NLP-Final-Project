(CNN) -- Egypt has agreed to allow two Iranian warships to cross through the Suez Canal in a move that puts the country's new military regime in a prickly position with its Israeli neighbor.
"This is awkward -- at a minimum," said David Schenker, director of the Program on Arab Politics at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
Egypt's decision, analysts said, could show the direction that the military caretakers intend to take the Arab world's most populous nation.
Iran said earlier that the flotilla was on a yearlong intelligence-gathering and training mission to prepare cadets to defend Iran's cargo ships and oil tankers from the threat of attack by Somali pirates, according to the semi-official Fars News Agency.
Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said Israel's allies should pay close attention to the situation.
The Israeli Defense Ministry said it was monitoring the movement of the Iranian ships and alerted its allies.
