(CNN) -- Surveillance footage shows other minors inside a Georgia high school gym at about the same time authorities say Kendrick Johnson suffocated in a rolled-up mat while reaching for a sneaker, an attorney for the school told CNN on Friday.
The next pictures of the teenager are far more horrifying: His body, clad in jeans and layered orange and white T-shirts, is wedged in the wrestling mat.
A Georgia Bureau of Investigation autopsy found that he died from positional asphyxia, and the sheriff's office determined the death was accidental.
And the original autopsy results released by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation May 2 identified "no significant injuries."
