(CNN) -- A Texas woman vanished without a trace after visiting friends in Plano over Labor Day weekend, police said.
Police later found Morris' vehicle in the parking garage, but there was no sign of the woman.
Family and friends on Friday night also retraced Morris' steps, hoping to find answers to her whereabouts, the station said.
"I'm worried sick and will do anything to get any information on the last time anyone has seen or talked to her please help and pray that she is ok," he said in a posting Tuesday.
Anyone with information is asked to call police at 972-424-5678.
