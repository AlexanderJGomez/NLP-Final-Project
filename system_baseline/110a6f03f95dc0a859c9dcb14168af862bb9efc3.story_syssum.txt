Dr. Justin Schechter, a Stamford, Connecticut, forensic and clinical psychiatrist, said that Hayes exhibited signs of depression after his 2007 arrest, but told him, "I would rather they kill me" -- reflecting Hayes' apparent hope that he'd be executed for his role in in the deaths of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters, 17-year-old Hayley Petit and 11-year-old Michaela Petit.
Hayes believed that a doctor was "manipulating" his food and wouldn't eat it, said Schechter, though he did eat food from the prison commissary.
On cross-examination, Dr. Paul Amble said his panel did not address the question of whether Hayes' suicide attempts were sincere.
Hayes described a plan to "look like a monster" to the jury, expressing no remorse, in an attempt to move the jurors to sentence him to death, Amble wrote in his evaluation of the defendant.
In March, Hayes told a psychologist that he no longer wanted to commit suicide "but intended to let the state do it," said Amble, who had been asked by the judge in the case to determine whether Hayes was competent to stand trial.
Her two daughters, one of whom had been sexually assaulted, died of smoke inhalation.
