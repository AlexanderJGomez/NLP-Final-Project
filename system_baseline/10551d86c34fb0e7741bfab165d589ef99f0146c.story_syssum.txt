The news comes as Britain is in a state of heightened security ahead of the London Olympics, which open in three weeks.
The seven men have been detained on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, a police statement said.
Kenny Bell of the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit said: "As soon as the items were discovered in the impounded vehicle, our priority was to protect the public by pursuing and arresting those we believed to be involved."
They include the siting of missile defense systems around the capital and fighter jets on standby at air bases close to London.
The Metropolitan Police is leading the "largest peacetime operation" seen in the United Kingdom as it seeks to keep the public safe, it said, with up to 9,500 police officers from London and elsewhere to be deployed on the busiest days of the Olympics.
"We were all in it together and when you're faced with armed police you can't really do anything else other than follow their instructions."
