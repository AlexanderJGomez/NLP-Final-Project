When I was six years old, he showed me how to complete the task Marine Corps-style and would inspect my work on a daily basis.
My dad was never boring: He often stood on his head to impress his three kids.
For example, he once coaxed us to imagine a trip to the fishmonger's (with its live octopus on display) as a Jules Verne adventure.
Thanks to my father, I don't let self-doubt keep me from achieving my goals.
He showed me how to use power tools, climb on the roof to install a radio antenna, and lift a trailer onto a hitch.
It's good manners, but it's also smart business: After all, if you ever need something, you won't get to the boss unless you're on good terms with the person who handles her schedule.
If you don't hash out problems with your spouse, he said, you might start harboring resentment toward him or cause your friends to view him negatively.
My dad always felt that if he was with a family member or a friend, that person took precedence over whoever might be calling.
The best advice my father ever gave was passed down from his dad: Never try to solve problems at night, because they always seem worse than they do in the morning.
Thanks to my dad's smarts, I know that I should check the average date for the last frost in my region before I start spring planting.
