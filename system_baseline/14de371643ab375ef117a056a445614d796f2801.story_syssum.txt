But for Debbie Fisher, who's legally blind, the visual displays used to play and chat meant they were off limits to her.
After she got an iPhone and iPad, she tried playing some of the downloadable games, but due to her visual impairment, she couldn't find a game that she enjoyed and that allowed her to play with her friends.
But only one game, she says, has let her both play and communicate with friends.

Paul Bettner, general manager of Zynga With Friends, said they didn't intend to make a game for the visually impaired, but are pleased that their game can be enjoyed by people like Fisher.
"I wouldn't have even guessed that I'd be so into that game before I started playing it.
