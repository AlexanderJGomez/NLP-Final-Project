The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland at the base of the neck.
The truth is, it's more like the Muhammad Ali of our body's hormone factories; it floats and appears like a butterfly but stings like a bee.
"Our thyroid, even though it's a small gland in your neck, controls everything," says endocrinologist Karen Smith.
That is probably why doctors such as Smith use a handy tool to help patients identify the problem.
The condition is lifelong, or as Smith puts it, "from the cradle to the rocking chair."
I tell my patients, it's like a forest fire in California, burning everything up, "explains Smith, who just recently found out she suffered from this issue.
It took almost a year for her to figure it out since she had no family history to worry about, and most thyroid problems are usually genetic, even though she displayed all the classic symptoms.
Smith, who is doing much better now, details the options.
"The treatment is very different from hypothyroidism; we are actually trying to slow the function of the thyroid down.
Because there are certain risks with even mild changes in thyroid levels, those considered at high risk, including pregnant women and those with a family history of thyroid problems, need to get tested earlier and more frequently, Smith said.
If she was right and it was not just an overactive hand-to-mouth cake thing, then I better call my doctor pronto to schedule my own test.
