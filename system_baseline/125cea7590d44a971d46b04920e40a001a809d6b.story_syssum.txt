The referendum, expected to be held in 2014, would allow Scots a straight yes-or-no vote on staying in the union.
However, only about a third of all the Scots polled wanted to break away from the United Kingdom.
And the SNP, on its website, says independence "could create an environment where our existing and new private industries can grow more easily," and the party touts a country that retains the British pound, while its future European Union membership creates the benefits of "open borders, shared rights, free trade and extensive cooperation."
The United Kingdom returned some autonomy to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and gave them the right to form their own parliaments, in the late 1990s.
