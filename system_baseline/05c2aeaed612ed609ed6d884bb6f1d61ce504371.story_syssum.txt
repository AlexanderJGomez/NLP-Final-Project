The relatives told CNN that Shaikh's mother had not been informed of his execution, scheduled for Tuesday morning.
But Khan and Shaikh said they are nevertheless "hoping the Chinese government will show some compassion."
"The British Government has been doing and will continue to do everything within its power to secure a fair trial and clemency on the death penalty for Akmal Shaikh," a Downing Street spokesman said Monday.
At every level ... the government has raised its concerns, made clear our opposition to the death penalty, and requested a full mental health assessment.
He would be the first European Union citizen executed in China in 50 years, Reprieve said.
The group says Chinese authorities have refused requests for Shaikh to be examined by a doctor and for his mental condition to be taken into account during his trial and sentencing.
Shaikh said he was given a suitcase to carry by another man who had duped him into believing he was traveling to China to become a nightclub performer, and was unaware that the bag contained drugs.
Okole then told Shaikh he would have to travel on to China himself because there was only one seat available on the plane -- and gave him the suitcase to carry, according to Reprieve.
Schaapveld also examined hundreds of pages of rambling e-mails sent by Shaikh to the British Embassy in Poland and various public figures, including then-U.S. President George W. Bush and former Beatle Paul McCartney.
