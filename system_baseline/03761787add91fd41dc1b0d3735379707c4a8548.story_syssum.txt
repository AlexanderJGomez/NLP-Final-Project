In the spirit of the season, we've put together a tongue-in-cheek guide to getting a date in China that also aims to shed a little light on the pursuit of love in the Middle Kingdom.
Every weekend in China a strange, albeit charming, ritual takes place -- the parents of China's singles frequent their local park in order to match make on behalf of their children.
Nowhere else is this more so than in China, where one of the top assets people look for in a lover (after the oft-cited house and car) is whether they have a permit to the city they wish to live in.
If you happen to have a hukou that allows you to live in one of China's premier cities, be sure to let lots of singles around you know.
When not found in a park trying to "pimp" people out, they will be gossiping with neighbors, friends and co-workers about said person's single status and how to change it.
The result is that supposedly "second-rate" men are being left out of the dating world altogether.
There are now entire villages full of Romeos waiting for their Juliets.
If you see through these labels and the propaganda surrounding them, you'll appreciate that China's cities are full of some of the most savvy, intelligent and interesting women on the planet.
The nation's singles can peruse a buffet of sites, from those that promise to find you the one, to others that are more wired towards one-nighters (although the trend is much more towards the former than the latter).
Take a tour of Taobao, China's most popular online marketplace, and vying for your attention against countless cyber flower stalls and jewelry brands that emerge for Valentine's Day are the stores that offer something more unusual -- fake partners.
Other jewels include dressing better and spending less on the object of your affection (yes, you read that correctly).
