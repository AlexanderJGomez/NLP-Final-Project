Tango grew from the working class port neighborhoods of Buenos Aires to become a global dance and music phenomenon that in 2009 was inscribed on UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage list.
Tango was especially important in Buenos Aires at the turn of the century when immigrants -- especially men without partners -- were looking for a worthwhile diversion.
Boys would sneak out to the dance halls to see the older men (brothers and fathers) dancing.
The prelude to tango begins at the moment that two people stand face to face and listen silently to a few notes of the music, before settling in on the embrace and beginning to dance.
Be aware that dinner shows can be expensive, and some of the more hidden and intimate clubs offer a less expensive alternative -- many charging only for what is consumed.
Generally these milongas open at 11 pm, but Buenos Aires is a nocturnal city and the shows themselves don't normally start until after one in the morning.
Meanwhile, those concerned with the history and culture of tango should stroll to the former fruit and vegetable market area of Abasto in the Balvanera neighborhood, which is very much connected to Carlos Gardel -- the definitive tango icon.

Nothing builds the appetite more than a day of tango and, conveniently, there is a lovely Spanish restaurant on the second floor where hungry bellies are quickly satisfied.
