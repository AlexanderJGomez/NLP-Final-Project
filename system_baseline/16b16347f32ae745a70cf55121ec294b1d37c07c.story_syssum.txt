Republicans have "challenged election officials, and they've filed lawsuits in an effort to thwart these new voters -- our citizens -- from casting their votes on Tuesday.
"In nearly every case that has been reported, it was ACORN that discovered the bad forms and called them to the attention of election authorities, putting the forms in a package that identified them in writing as suspicious, encouraging election officials to investigate, and offering to help with prosecutions," ACORN said in an October 9 news release.
In Lake County, Indiana, nearly half of the 5,000 registrations ACORN submitted in early October were not good.
Indiana's Republican Secretary of State Todd Rokita has requested a criminal investigation, and federal law enforcement officials are considering whether to open a federal investigation based on state reports.
As an attorney, Obama represented ACORN alongside the U.S. Justice Department in suing the state of Illinois to force state compliance with a federal voting access law, the campaign's Web site says.
Former U.S. Attorney David Iglesias said the Bush administration fired him and eight other federal prosecutors in 2006 for political reasons, among them his refusal to pursue election fraud charges against organizations like ACORN.
"It's easy to make accusations, but ultimately a prosecutor has to prove that case beyond a reasonable doubt in federal court," Iglesias said.
