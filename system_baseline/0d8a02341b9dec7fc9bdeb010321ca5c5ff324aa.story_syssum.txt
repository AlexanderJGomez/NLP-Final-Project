Now Jay-Z charts his escape from the hard-knock life, describes the reunion that healed the wounds of his childhood -- and even reveals his personal creed.
Jay-Z also owns a portion of the NBA's New Jersey Nets and founded, with Damon Dash, the clothing line Rocawear.
Once you've let yourself fall that in love with someone, once you put him on such a high pedestal and he lets you down, you never want to experience that pain again.
You know, I've done many shows about divorce, and the real crime is when the kids aren't told.
I don't think he was ready for that level of discussion and emotion.
He was a guy who was pretty detached from his feelings.
I remember telling her, "Don't worry, when I get big, I'm going to take care of this."
Oprah: I've read that when you were 12, you shot your brother in the shoulder.
Jay-Z: Yes -- and my brother was dealing with a lot of demons.
And now I realize why -- it makes all the sense in the world.
Jay-Z: And I guess from that point, she figured out what was wrong with me, and she planned a meeting between me and my father.
And I guess I still had too much resentment and anger.
Oprah: In one of your songs, you wrote that you weren't sure if your father even remembered your birthday is in December.
So when my mom set up this meeting, I told her he wouldn't come -- and the first time, he didn't.
It was your responsibility to see me."
Jay-Z: Yes -- and that's why we were able to mend our relationship.
People would call in the middle of the night and tell him, "So-and-so is out here."
So I understand that the trauma of the event, coupled with the drugs, caused him to lose his soul.
I got him an apartment, I was buying furniture.
Jay-Z: Be true to yourself -- and keep things simple.
Jay-Z: I believe in karma: What you do to others comes back to you.
Oprah: Maya Angelou always says, "When you know better, you do better."
That's an outlet for me.
