(CNN) -- As Hurricane Sandy converges with other storms and threatens to wreak havoc on the mid-Atlantic coast, power outages could make it difficult for residents to get up-to-date information.
For more frequent updates, the Weather Channel is tweeting every few minutes on its Hurricane Central account, which posts everything from recorded wind speeds ("La Guardia airport in #NYC just reported a gust to 58 mph") to photos of surf pounding the coastline.
All the governors of the affected states are on Twitter with regular updates about evacuation plans, highway closures and emergency hotlines.
For air travelers, there does not appear to be a Twitter account that aggregates the status of flights across multiple airlines.
But all the major airlines are tweeting updates about delayed or canceled flights.
