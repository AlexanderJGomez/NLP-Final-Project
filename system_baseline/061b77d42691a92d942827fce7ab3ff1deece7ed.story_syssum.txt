Then, like many of the friends you meet in those horrible, wonderful years, I never saw or talked to him again.
Once we discovered this connection, I turned to look at him, and he gave me a slight head nod as he raised a confident fist in the air and let out one of his characteristic low chuckles.
Though he could be stingy with his words and often spoke in a low, monotone voice that adults often interpret as deep apathy, he was articulate and witty and thoughtful about the many things in the world that interested him.
I admired how he was passionate about a wide range of things, like politics and philosophy and religion and the environment and the Grateful Dead.
I imagine that a common refrain in the teachers' lounge when it came to Brian was that he was smart but didn't apply himself.
I knew he hadn't read the book and hadn't been in enough of the class discussions to fake it, so I offered to study with him.
In the movie version, this is where I would say that he aced that exam and got his act together and excelled at everything he did thereafter, and it was all because of a little help from his friend who was born on the same day.
I don't remember the last time I saw him or the last conversation we had.
When I did finally hear, after the initial shock, my mind kept drifting to all the birthdays he wasn't going to have.
I think about whatever is going on in my life at the time, and how trivial it all suddenly seems.
He wrote in my yearbook junior year, "I'll give you a call over the summer, and maybe we can go play a championship-like tennis match at a court within close proximity.
It's a very strange feeling to see your date of birth written on a headstone.
When I think about him today, I wonder who the other Brians in my life are right now -- am I squandering any opportunities to play tennis with them or see them over the summer?
