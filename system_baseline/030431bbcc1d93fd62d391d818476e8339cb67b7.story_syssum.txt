"If we don't do better with Hispanics, we'll be out of the White House forever," says Republican strategist and CNN contributor Ana Navarro, who was the national Hispanic co-chair of Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign.

"The conservative movement should have particular appeal to people in minority and immigrant communities who are trying to make it, and Republicans need to work harder than ever to communicate our beliefs to them," said Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida in a statement Tuesday night.
They made up 19% of the electorate this time around.
But that was negated by the shrinking of the white vote from 74% of the electorate four years ago to 72% now.
"The youth vote and the black vote turned out once again and that's to the president's credit," Fleischer said.
And in the final weeks leading up the the election, the Obama campaign highlighted pushback by General Motors and Chrysler to a Romney TV ad and a radio spot this past week that claimed both domestic auto makers were sending U.S. jobs to China.
Nearly six in 10 Ohio voters said they approved of the federal government's role in helping the troubled domestic automakers, and according to exit polls, the president won three quarters of those voters.
To a lesser degree, there was a similar push in Minnesota, another solidly Democratic state where public opinion polls tightened last month.
We had a Democratic president, a Republican House of Representatives, and Democratic Senate going into the 2012 election.
Some would argue ... nothing.
