Washington (CNN) -- The United States is biding its time in its effort to get fugitive leaker Edward Snowden delivered to its custody, hoping that Russia wearies of him and Ecuador decides against granting him asylum, senior U.S. officials said Wednesday.
"The sooner he selects his final destination point, the better both for us and for himself," Putin said Tuesday during a visit to Finland.
Ecuador has already granted asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has been holed up in the country's embassy in London for a year after losing a court battle to avoid extradition to Sweden.
Washington and Quito expelled each others' ambassadors in 2011 after an American diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks suggested that Correa was aware of acts of corruption by the police high command, and the United States has criticized recent laws that international observers say limit press freedoms.
The $20 million the United States provides in aid to Ecuador is a relatively small amount, and the administration is holding off on talk of any additional pressure until its government makes a decision on asylum.
