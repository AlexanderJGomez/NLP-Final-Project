Posing as journalists and government officials, the hackers have been working for about three years to get close to their targets, connecting with at least 2,000 people in the process, according to the report from iSight Partners.
The hackers endeavor to build social network connections with friends, relatives and colleagues of their targets, who included senior American military and diplomatic officials, congressional staffers and defense contractors in the United States and Israel.
"The actors have intimated their interest in specific defense technology as well as military and diplomatic information by their targeting," iSight said.
"What we can say is -- based on who was targeted, the types of information they were going after, the infrastructure that was used and where it's registered in Tehran and a number of other indicators -- that we believe there are links to Iranian actors here," Jones said.
The State Department says it has been aware in the past of hackers from Iran using social media websites to investigate targets, including U.S. officials.
