This year's Photo of the Year, taken by Paul Hansen, is a striking image of the bodies of two young children carried through the streets of Gaza City after an Israeli airstrike on their home, the photographer said.
Lyon is the vice president and director of photography for The Associated Press.
"The strength of the pictures lies in the way it contrasts the anger and sorrow of the adults with the innocence of the children.
"I thought it was a prank call," Swedish photographer Hansen said about hearing he'd won.
Two young boys and their father were killed, and their mother was sent to the intensive care unit.
The ability to portray something in a manner that doesn't make the reader turn away takes conscious balancing, Hansen said, adding that it's something for which he strives.
Lyon, the jury chair, said the judges looked at the photograph for its power.
We don't shy away from showing reality."
