As promised by Apple executives, the new devices were lighter, thinner and seemingly faster -- just like many incremental product upgrades from the past.
The iPad 2 kept its number and a spot in stores, where its slightly lower price tag (now $399) might appeal to someone considering a cheaper Android or Windows tablet.
An ad shown at the press conference showed an iPad Air lying flat on a tablet, hiding discretely behind a No.
It is difficult to judge speed increases during a few minutes in a crowded room without proper tests and an equally empty previous generation device to use for comparison.
Part of that is the steadily improving processors inside, but its also the benefit of working on a new device that hasn't been gradually slowed down by pages of apps, hundreds of cat videos and the latest operating system upgrade.
But this upgrade and the new display put the devices on the same level, so picking a smaller screen no longer means opting for the inferior product.
Other companies might throw in price drops, but Apple is comfortable in its spot at the high-end of the consumer market.
Other than an hour here or there, mobile devices makers seem stuck at the half-day mark, a frustrating limitation for people who have adapted by carting around chargers and scrambling to re-up anytime they spot an empty outlet at a cafe, airport or friend's house.
For now, Apple is comfortable enough with the competition to just iterate on its well-designed, popular products, making the usual round of improvements and throwing in the occasional flashy feature to grab attention, such as fingerprints on the iPhone 5S.
The competition will stay close until the first company breaks out of the usual faster, thinner, faster upgrade cycle and solves the battery problem.
