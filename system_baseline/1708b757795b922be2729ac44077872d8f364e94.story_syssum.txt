Klum told the story of the couple's engagement, in which the singer had an igloo built on a mountaintop in the Canadian Rockies, to which he whisked her by helicopter.
When Morgan asked Klum how the couple manages to sustain such a happy relationship, Klum said "I just think because we love each other.
With the ninth-season finale of "Project Runway" coming up, Klum told Morgan she never imagined the series would last so long.
We went to all these different networks and tried to explain to them what we wanted to do was a show about fashion."
When Morgan asked Klum if she grew up dreaming of being a model, the Germany native told the CNN host that as a child, she didn't even know that modeling was a career option.
Klum called her entr√©e into fashion modeling "pure luck" and likened it to "winning the lottery" when she told Morgan the story.
Klum, who also host's "Germany's Next Top Model" in her native country, told Morgan that she counts getting "Project Runway" on the air among her most cherished business successes.
"And I felt that it would be right for me to vote for the next president."
