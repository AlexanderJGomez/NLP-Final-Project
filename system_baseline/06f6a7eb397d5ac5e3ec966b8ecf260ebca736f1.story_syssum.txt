The principal of his middle school remembered how, at Christmastime how Jackson, always jumped up and offered to sing to his class.
Some of the biggest applause of the night came after a video was played of Jackson in Gary talking about his love for his hometown.
As a finale, about 700 people holding candles sang "We Are the World," the 1985 song Jackson co-wrote with Lionel Richie to benefit USA for Africa.
After being surrounded by TV crews and photographers, Joe Jackson made his way to the stage, thanked everyone for attending and said it was good to be home.
