The 34 miners in the Lonmin mine in Marikana, South Africa, died after police opened fire on a gathering of thousands of machete-armed workers striking for higher wages.
The violence exploded when police shot at striking rock drillers in the "Easterns" area of the Marikana mine.
It has gained ground in an environment where workers have been dissatisfied with improvements in quality of life since the end of apartheid, particularly for those in the lower wage brackets.
The stand-off later escalated into violence, leaving 34 dead, 78 injured and 259 arrested on various charges, according to South Africa National Police Commissioner Riah Phiyega.
While union rivalry is being blamed for the friction, it is unclear who triggered the first shots at Marikana, which is one of the country's bloodiest incidents since the end of apartheid in 1994.
"There is also evidence of their continuing to shoot after a number of bodies can be seen dropping and others turning to run.
Late last month, a regional prosecutor charged 270 of the platinum miners with the murder of their colleagues, who are believed to have been shot by police.
He said Mathunjwa's reference to being prepared to die was in response to fears the police would attack.
The NUM is a close ally of the country's ruling African National Congress and its inability to stop the violence and weakened role is expected to drag on Zuma, according to Rosenberg.
The company said last week that a "peace accord" had been signed, but key unions had not agreed to the deal.
The company has previously announced its chief executive Ian Farmer had been diagnosed with a serious illness and was in hospital.
