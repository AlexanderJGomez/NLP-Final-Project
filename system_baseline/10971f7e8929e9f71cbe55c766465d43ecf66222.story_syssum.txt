Maybe this is why residents of Ferguson protested in the first place.
Nixon is taking the precaution in light of the mass protests this summer over how the investigation into the shooting was being handled.
The police were widely criticized for their over-the-top militaristic response, including riot cops in tanks with automatic rifles pointed at the protesters.
Yet, many on social media and some in the mainstream media continue to use the isolated actions of a small number of bad protesters to smear the entire community.
Now, let's turn to white protesters: In mid-October, during the annual Pumpkin Festival in the small New England town of Keene, New Hampshire, some white college kids apparently had too much to drink and turned violent.
The protesters in Ferguson were airing legitimate grievances through mostly peaceful means and yet were denigrated, while the rioters in Keene were merely part of a party that "spun out of control" -- never mind that those in Keene were reportedly drunk and dangerous and disproportionately violent.
The discrepancy is so jarring that none other than Twitchy, the notoriously lock-jawed right wing website, while managing to contort the incident to bash the supposedly liberal media, agreed, "Critics of the media do have a valid point.
The rioters "lit fires, pushed over street lights and threw rocks, beer bottles and other items at police," reported the local news.
The media would be pointing out how they're "destroying their own community" and the right would make assertions about black people not deserving public assistance.
The same year football fans at the State University of New York in Cortland rioted even before the game started.
Why aren't we talking about the epidemic of sports-induced violence among white people?
And if there's any violence from a few angry demonstrators, let's keep things in perspective considering the marauding bands of rowdy white football fans and rioting Pumpkin kids.
