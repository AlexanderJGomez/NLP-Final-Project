The Middle East has been through a lot of change lately, but the region is often eerily quiet on climate change, not to mention that some countries of the region have been considered "obstructionist" in the process.
This has already started, and one only needs to look at the launch of the Arab Youth Climate Movement in a dozen countries earlier this month to see that the region's young citizens, who were so instrumental in the Arab Spring, are calling for their leaders to step up when it comes to the biggest environmental problem facing the Middle East and North Africa.
Agreeing to this peak will also mean that countries which have been big polluters historically, like the U.S., Canada, Europe, Japan and Australia, will have to increase their commitments on carbon emission reductions.
This means that if we don't start reducing our greenhouse gas emissions urgently, it could lead to the collapse of human civilization.
Compared to last year's negotiations, the political climate change leadership in China and the U.S. -- both major emitters with big pull at these talks -- is now certain.
Civil society is expecting these leaders to stand up where it matters -- inside the negotiating rooms of the U.N. climate talks and push toward a fair, ambitious and binding deal that will preserve the future of the planet for generations to come.
