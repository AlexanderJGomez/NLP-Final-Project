In a country where the vast majority of the population lives off the land, scores of smallholders in rural communities tune in to Farm Radio Malawi to get valuable information and share ideas on how to improve their yields -- from fertilizing techniques and cultivation tips to harvesting practices and weather forecasts.
In rural parts of Malawi, farmers often gather at radio listening clubs to tune in and discuss what they've heard.
"We do understand that when farmers come together in a group to listen together to a radio program, thereafter they are able to discuss and dialogue on what they've listened to and then they're able to use that in their various fields," he adds.
He says he expects his harvest to increase this year after following the radio station's advice, which enabled him to plant two groundnut rows on a ridge instead of one.
From preventing the loss of produce to increasing harvests, the broadcasters believe that the lessons learned over the radio airwaves can help fight food insecurity and improve lives in Malawi's rural communities.
