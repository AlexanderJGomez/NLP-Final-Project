Just a couple of weeks earlier, we had reported on Lennon's comeback with the album "Double Fantasy," which marked his re-emergence after five years out of the music business as a self-proclaimed "househusband."
It was my executive producer, John Martin.

Chapman and his wife, Gloria Abe, describe the murder in rare audio recordings that will debut on CNN's "Losing Lennon: Countdown To Murder."
Ono told Rolling Stone she believes this rekindling of interest in Lennon "has to do with the social climate, with wanting some of John's energy, power and conviction."
"And then I tried to imagine what if it never happened, and that's really the question of the song: 'If you just kept walking on your way.'
At the very least, we would have had years more of great music and performance from a man who was truly an artistic genius.
