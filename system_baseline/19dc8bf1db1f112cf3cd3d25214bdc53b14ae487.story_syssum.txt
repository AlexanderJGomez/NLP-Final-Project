Michael Brown's mother says hearing that a grand jury had decided not to indict the officer who killed her son felt like getting shot.
A New York Times video captured the moments after McSpadden heard about the decision not to indict Darren Wilson, the white officer who killed her son, Michael Brown, a black teen.
Neither believes Wilson's version of events, saying their son would never have taunted the officer, nor reached for his weapon.
"He was different, but he still was like any other teenager -- wanted to explore different things, do different things, be around different people," McSpadden said.
He understood exactly what he was doing.
Earlier, he'd said the grand jury's decision changed his view of America.
He asked Michael Brown Sr. how he felt about the prosecutor attacking "the character of the victim."
He said the grand jury's decision was based on evidence and facts, some of which contradicted people who said they witnessed Officer Darren Wilson shooting Michael Brown Jr.
HLN legal analyst Joey Jackson said Wednesday that while there can be discussions about the possibility of bias as a result of his father's death, there is a more fundamental reason he should not have taken the case: the close relationship prosecutors often have with their local police.
A prosecutor should not be disqualified "because he's worked with the cops closely in the past.
If the public did not have faith in McCulloch because of his father's killing, then "maybe because of the level of public distrust, we should have had a special prosecutor," Callan said.
