"This resolution provides a strong and united international response to North Korea's test of a nuclear device," said U.S. Deputy Ambassador Rosemary DiCarlo.
The agreement comes amid rising tension surrounding North Korea, which recently conducted a nuclear test, fired test rockets and threatened U.S. and South Korean ships near its territorial waters.
That resolution provided a "strong, very credible, very appropriate response to the provocative nuclear test that North Korea launched and its subsequent activities," Susan E. Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters at the time.
Nations would be required to notify the sanctions committee at least five days prior to selling, supplying or transferring small arms or light weapons to North Korea.
That test showed a significant improvement in range from North Korea's initial long-range missile test in 2006.
President Obama's special envoy to North Korea, Stephen Bosworth, called "simply groundless" accusations by Pyongyang that its nuclear and rocket tests were in response to American aggression.
