WASHINGTON (CNN) -- House Democrats on Thursday failed to override President Bush's veto of a children's health insurance bill that opponents said was too expensive.
The issue has ignited an intense two-week struggle on Capitol Hill after Bush vetoed the proposed five-year expansion and $35 billion spending increase.
"What we've been working towards is trying to find a way to say that we ought to insure poor children first," said the Ohio Republican.
"The American people support this issue because kids do not need to suffer for what is basically a broken health care system, and this provides those children  with that health care," Emanuel said.
The bill the House and Senate passed in September would extend eligibility for the program to about 4 million more, paying for the expansion with a 61-cent-per-pack increase in the federal tax on cigarettes.
"I made clear that, if putting poor children first requires more than the 20 percent increase in funding I proposed, we'll work with Congress to find the money we need," said the president.
House Republican leaders have complained that Democrats postponed the override attempt for two weeks to use the issue for political advantage.
Meanwhile, of the eight Democrats who voted against the bill in September, only one has said he will reverse his vote and support an override.
Niki Tsongas, the widow of former Sen. Paul Tsongas who won a special election Tuesday to replace Massachusetts Democrat Rep. Marty Meehan, will be sworn in Thursday morning in time for the vote.
