"I think the Masters is something that has brought golf to the American people in a way that no other course and no other golf course could do," the 84-year-old told CNN.
Forty-six years later, Palmer -- then 74 -- received an unforgettable standing ovation as he approached the 18th green for the final competitive time after half a century of contesting the course.
"The location, the geography of the club, the way the course rolled, the condition -- it was always in impeccable condition, the greens were always good, the fairways.
"I was on the course when (then Augusta chairman) Cliff Roberts, a very close friend of Ike's, came out and said the President had said he'd like to play the next day if I had time and would join him," Palmer recalls.
"I'm sure it did not make him unhappy that it was gone," he laughs.
Palmer himself actually hit the famous tree en route to winning one of his Masters titles, but there may be no such trouble in future for one of his grandchildren.
"He's a young man and he's certainly getting some experience on playing professional golf," says his grandfather, who followed him around the course in a buggy.
