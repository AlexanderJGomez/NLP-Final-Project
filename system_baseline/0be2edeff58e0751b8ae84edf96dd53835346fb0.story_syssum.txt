These terms have joined a fast-growing list of keywords blocked by Chinese censors as they try to prevent the public from obtaining news on a prominent human rights activist who recently escaped his more than 18 months of house arrest in eastern China.
Outside a busy Beijing subway station Monday, CNN randomly asked more than three dozen people about Chen -- only two had heard of him and his escape.
They also get creative in Chinese cyberspace to evade censors, especially on the popular Sina Weibo site, where a third of China's more than 500 million internet users share news and information.
CNN, like most other international news media, has followed Chen's story for years and provided extensive coverage on his situation since his escape.
On Netease, one the country's biggest web portals, editors Monday morning posted a clip of a TV news story on the "sudden early arrival" of a senior U.S. official ahead of a scheduled visit by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton later this week.
Since Friday, eight of my last ten Weibo posts have fallen victim to the site's censors.
