Washington (CNN) -- A Democratic measure to temporarily reverse the doubling of interest rates on millions of government-backed student loans fell short in the U.S. Senate on Wednesday, but there was hope a bipartisan deal would be struck soon to remedy the situation.
Far more students take out unsubsidized student loans from the government -- those rates have been at 6.8% since 2007.
They prefer a permanent change to how interest rates are calculated for the millions of undergraduates, graduate students, and parents who take out government loans each year.
Negotiations are aimed at sifting through the various proposals for interest rates, surcharges, and whether to mandate a cap on how high rates could rise, a key demand from Democrats.
"There is a good spirit and I think the interest is in finding a way to yes," the Delaware Democrat said.
This summer's fight is similar to the one that took place last year when Congress acted to avert an increase in the middle of a presidential campaign.
