For the hotels that do play host to traveling sports clubs, although those teams might only comprise a relatively small percentage of a hotel's trade, their reliability makes them an important part of their business.
Mike Jorgensen, general manager of the Westin Copley Place, said about half of the baseball teams that come to town to play the Red Sox stay at his hotel.
"We always have two elevator attendants, so both elevators are used exclusively for the professional sports teams that's coming in."
"I would say that things can get a little complicated when families start to arrive, especially if somebody has multiple ex-wives, kids," said Moniz.
Moniz and Jorgensen agree that hockey players are the most hassle-free guests.
