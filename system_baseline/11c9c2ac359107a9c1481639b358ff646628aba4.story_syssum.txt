He told Liverpool's official Web site: "You can't be absolutely certain of anything but at this stage, if he continues to progress the way he is, he should be fit to play at some stage during the World Cup.
We're anxious not to hurry him along too much because we want the long-term benefit, but we're aware he's got the short-term goal of playing in the World Cup."
"The pain is so great that I would not have been able to perform at my best over the longer term both in training and during matches.
He said: "I am very pleased with the healing process but it is now definitively clear that the World Cup finals for me make no sense.
"I'm leaving him until that date to convince me that he is sufficiently in shape to take part in the World Cup."
