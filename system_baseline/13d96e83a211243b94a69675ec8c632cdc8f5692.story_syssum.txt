This week, Jolie -- a special envoy for the U.N.'s refugee agency -- traveled to the world's second-largest refugee camp, where she spoke to Syrian refugees and documented their stories in a video for CNN.
At the time of the blast, the couple's 4-year-old son, who suffers from a birth defect and cannot walk, was playing inside.
Giving a voice to refugees is arguably the most difficult role Jolie accepted when she agreed to become the U.N.'s special envoy for refugees last year.
"This is undoubtedly the world's worst refugee crisis in decades, and if we don't get off this slippery slope, it will soon become the largest in our lifetime," Kristalina Georgieva, a humanitarian commissioner for the European Commission, told the Daily Telegraph this week.
One woman at the Za'atri camp told Jolie how her life was transformed when her neighbor in Syria showed up at her door, missing a foot.
There have been promises to help from the international community to end the conflict in Syria, but the reality is that nothing changes, she said.
They have conferences and make statements, but it is worth nothing."
