(CNN) -- Ecuador is calling for British authorities to help investigate after officials found a secret recording device planted inside the South American country's embassy in London.
In addition to serving as an office for Ecuadorian officials abroad, the embassy has also been home for more than a year to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who received asylum from Ecuador in August and risks arrest if he leaves the property.
It also comes as Ecuador plays a key role in the global guessing game over the next steps for Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who is on the run after admitting that he leaked classified documents about U.S. surveillance programs.
"Surely, there are risks, yes ... but we are willing to run them when it comes to defending rights," he said.
