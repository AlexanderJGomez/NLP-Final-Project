Three drone associations partnered with the FAA this month to spread the word about the guidelines to safely operate drones -- the Know Before You Fly campaign.
The FAA has already recorded 25 incidents when small drones got too close for comfort with manned aircrafts.
Now, replace that bird with a drone.
The blades on some drones can seriously injure, like when a mistletoe marketing gimmick that involved a drone inside a TGI Friday's went wrong, cutting a photographer.
Anyway, that shouldn't happen as long as you keep your drone within your line of sight at all times, another guideline for drone use.
Don't be a creep.
Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, is already worried enough about the government using drones to invade people's privacy without having to worry about civilian and commercial drones peering into people's windows.
