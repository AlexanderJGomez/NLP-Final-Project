(CNN) -- The top government lawyers from three dozen states sent a letter to Google on Wednesday, expressing "strong concerns" with the privacy policy the Web giant intends to roll out soon.
In Wednesday's letter, the state attorneys called the policy "troubling for a number of reasons," saying that users should be able to use one product without having its information shared with others.
Other tools allow for "incognito" modes and there are other privacy tools that can be used, she said.
They are "trying to make them simpler and more understandable, which is something that lawmakers and regulators have asked technology companies to do," he wrote.
"No doubt many of these consumers bought an Android-powered phone in reliance on Google's existing privacy policy, which touted to these consumers that 'We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent,' " the letter said.
