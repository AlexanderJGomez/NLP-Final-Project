(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal's status as the world's top tennis player may have dimmed slightly with two recent final defeats, but the Spaniard showed again on Sunday that he is the man to beat on clay.
That run saw him beat Ferrer in the final of the Rome Masters, and he again denied the 29-year-old a 1,000-point haul in Monte Carlo on Sunday as he avenged his defeat at the Australian Open quarterfinals in January.
He won against serve in the third game of the second set before Ferrer fought back to lead 5-4, but Nadal broke him again to go 6-5 up and sealed victory when his opponent netted on the second match-point.
Meanwhile, Russia ended Italy's Fed Cup reign by reaching the final of the women's teams event with a comprehensive 5-0 victory on Sunday.
Four-time champions Russia will play the Czech Republic in the final after the other semifinal in Belgium went to the deciding doubles rubber after both teams won a singles tie on Sunday.
Zahlavova-Strycova then paired up with Iveta Benesova to beat Flipkens and Wickmayer 6-4 6-4 to seal a 3-2 win.
