And there on a nearby rocky island were five people on a rocky outcrop off the northeastern coast of Australia, happy to see a helicopter after eight hours of waiting.
They stamped out a large distress signal in the sand, but they knew it was only a matter of time before the tide claimed the signal.
The crew used a winch and basket to bring the three men and two women into the helicopter.
Kross said the five were in good spirits despite being a little dehydrated.
