On Wednesday, an Italian court found Schettino guilty of manslaughter and other charges related to the wreck, and sentenced him to 16 years in prison.
Schettino, 52 at the time of the accident, admitted he had been "showboating" when he sailed the luxury cruise liner so close to the island of Giglio, where submerged rocks tore through the hull.
Schettino has also blamed the ship itself, saying the generators did not work so the elevators did not function, hindering some people's escape.
Cemortan boarded the ship as a passenger but had worked on another Costa Cruises ship captained by Schettino a few weeks earlier.
Costa chairman Pier Luigi Foschi, who retired after the disaster, had said Schettino had never been involved in an accident before.
But Foschi placed the blame for the wreck squarely on the captain, saying it was his choice to deviate from frequently traveled routes in order to "impress the passengers," as Schettino admitted.
He then tells an official he has abandoned the vessel, according to the transcripts, which prosecutors say match those used in their investigation.
As the night unfolds, the coast guard commander repeatedly questions why Schettino, as captain, is not on the ship when passengers are still aboard.
