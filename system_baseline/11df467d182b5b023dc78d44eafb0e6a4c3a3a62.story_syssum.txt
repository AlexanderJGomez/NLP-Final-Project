Here's what she didn't expect on top of all that: sharing a hospital room with a feverish 6-year-old and contracting a nasty bacterial infection her mother says nearly killed her.
The study looked at 10.5 million pediatric patients from 1997 to 2006, of whom 21,274, or 0.2%, had C. diff, as the bacteria are commonly called.
Katie was a healthy 19-year-old avid soccer and volleyball player when she went into a New York City hospital in August 2008 for surgery to correct her scoliosis, or curvature of the spine.
Katie and her parents didn't know it, but her situation was the perfect storm for a C. diff infection.
She was taking massive doses of intravenous antibiotics, which kill the good bacteria in the gut, and C. diff thrives in the absence of good bacteria.
Three years ago, the hospital had 5.3 C. diff infections for every 1,000 hospital admissions, and in the past three years it's had none at all, according to Dr. Alfonso Torress-Cook, epidemiologist for the hospital.
At Pacific, patients at high risk of C. diff are given yogurt because it helps restore the good bacteria in the gut that in turn help fight off bad bacteria.
For babies, breast milk helps protect against C. diff infections.
"And nurses are by the bedside for 12 hours.
C. diff spreads when someone touches the feces of an infected person, and then touches someone else, or touches a surface, such as a doorknob, that someone else will later touch.
Kathleen Roche says they'll never know how Katie got sick, but they wonder if she got it from a feverish little girl who shared a room with Katie during both her first and second hospital stays.
The Centers for Disease Control recommends that a patient with   C. diff have his or her own room.
If you see doctors and nurses aren't gowning up or washing their hands, tell them, Pronovost advises.
"But the reality is it's your child's life on the line, so it's worth taking a risk."
