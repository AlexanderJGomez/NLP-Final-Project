White evangelical Protestants were the religious group most likely to say torture is often or sometimes justified -- more than six in 10 supported it.
It did not include analysis of groups other than white evangelicals, white non-Hispanic Catholics, white mainline Protestants and the religiously unaffiliated, because the sample size was too small.
Roughly half of all respondents -- 49 percent -- said it is often or sometimes justified.
A quarter of the religiously unaffiliated said the same, compared with two in 10 white non-Hispanic Catholics and one in eight evangelicals.
