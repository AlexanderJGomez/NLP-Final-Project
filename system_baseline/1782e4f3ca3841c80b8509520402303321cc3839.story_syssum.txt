ASA had found the Irish airline guilty of seven transgressions in a two-year period, it said on its Web site.
"It is very disappointing, but absolutely necessary, that we have had to take this course of action," said ASA director general Christopher Graham, whose authority last referred a company to OFT in 2005.
In February, Ryanair had to shut down its Web site and call centers for three days while it upgraded its reservations system.
It said 11 airlines amended their sites to make those fees clear, but Ryanair and Ireland's Aer Lingus asked for extra time.
