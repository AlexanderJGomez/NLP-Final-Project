Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court's decision Monday on same-sex marriage brought the issue back into the political mix less than a month before the midterm elections.
But recent polls and the gradual state-by-state legalization of same-sex marriage indicates that it's no longer the wedge issue it once was.
"As a general rule, it won't have an effect on these midterms because I think the issue is fading," said Quentin Kidd, director of the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University in Virginia.
While Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said conservatives are right to be outraged by the courts' action on the issue, he doubts same-sex marriage will become a big force in the elections next month.
Republican Ed Gillespie, who's challenging Democratic Sen. Mark Warner in Virginia, said the Supreme Court's decision has "considerable impact" but did not express overt concern about the issue.
With half of Virginia voters supporting same-sex marriage, according to a Quinnipiac poll earlier this year, a Republican candidate running for a statewide seat would almost need to take a measured approach on the issue.
And with Colorado voters supporting same-sex marriage, 61%-33%, according to a Quinnipiac poll in April, it's no surprise that Gardner may keep quiet on the issue.
Over in North Carolina, where Republican Thom Tillis is working to unseat Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan in the most expensive race this year, neither candidate has commented on the decision.
And in a state with large patches of conservative voters, neither of those candidates are commenting either.
