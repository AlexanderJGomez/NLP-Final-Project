"That's my favorite part of the circus," Dutch photographer Wiesje Peels said.
It's what the majority of Peels' work focuses on, something she calls "in between worlds."

Her book "Mimus" binds together roughly 100 photographs taken at several traveling circuses in Europe.
He's still in costume, his makeup still intact, yet he's off-stage, no longer part of an act.
As a wife and a mother of two, Peels says she struggles to find time to create, and she often seeks solace at artist residencies to focus solely on her work.
Wiesje Peels is a photographer based in the Netherlands.
