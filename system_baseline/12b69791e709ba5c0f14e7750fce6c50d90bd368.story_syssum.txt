Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Fertility issues were at the center of former TV chef Juan-Carlos Cruz's motivation in the alleged murder-for-hire plot to kill his wife, according to sources close to the couple.
The source would not comment on whether she was aware of the alleged planning before his arrest.
The criminal complaint filed Monday accused Cruz of trying to hire David Carrington and David Walters -- homeless men who go by the street names Little Dave and Big Dave -- to murder Campbell.
Assistant Deputy District Attorney Joseph Marcus would not talk about the case, but the homeless men allegedly solicited to carry out the hit spoke with celebrity news and gossip website TMZ on Saturday.
"We're very fortunate that we have a relationship and rapport with some of the homeless and that they were able to give us information," Trisler said.
Cruz, a Los Angeles resident, was an overweight pastry chef at the Hotel Bel Air until he changed his focus to promote low-calorie recipes.
He wrote "The Juan-Carlos Cruz Calorie Countdown Cookbook: A 5-Week Eating Strategy for Sustainable Weight Loss," published in 2007.
