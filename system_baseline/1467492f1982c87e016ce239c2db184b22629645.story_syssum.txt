Choi Dong-jin, a South Korean who operates a jeans factory at Kaesong, expressed his relief as the shutters were finally lifted.
The Kaesong Industrial Complex, which is considered to be an important source of hard currency for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's regime, sits just a few kilometers north of the DMZ, which divides the two Koreas.
Its closure followed a sustained escalation of tensions on the Korean peninsula, set off by North Korea's long-range rocket launch in December and an underground nuclear test in February.
"Yes it is going to re-open, but the question is 'how long will it take to recover our company's credibility from the client?'
North Korean workers there earn an average of $134 per month, 45% of which are taken by North Korean authorities for various taxes.
