Cho, a former executive for South Korea's biggest airline faces charges, after she ordered an international flight back to the gate at New York's JFK airport after becoming dissatisfied that her macadamia nuts were served in a bag instead of on a plate in first class.
Cho was served with an arrest warrant last month in Korea in a case that has outraged the nation over growing resentment of the power held by its large family-owned corporations known as chaebol.
Kim, the flight attendant who initially served the offending nuts, said that Cho wasn't initially angry, but ordered her to bring over a service manual.
Kim also knelt in front of Cho as the executive berated her for having Park bring the tablet.
After the incident, Kim said she was told by a Korean Air manager what to tell South Korean investigators from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport.
