"The airlines have eliminated tens of thousands of seats due to consolidation and just plain old capacity cuts and (they're) using smaller planes," said George Hobica, president of Airfarewatchdog.com.
Those who will be flying over the holiday will pay $376 on average for a domestic ticket, or about 4% more than at the same time last year, according to Travelocity.
"Not only do you have a better chance of getting lower airfare, but also (better) seats.
If you're flying with someone for Thanksgiving, the chances of sitting together on the plane are also higher if you book early, Hobica said.
Travelers who choose to fly out on the Monday before Thanksgiving and fly back on the Sunday after will pay on average $213 more than travelers who fly on Thanksgiving Day and come back the next day, Travelocity calculated.
Lest you think it's impossible to do, Hobica assured that plenty of travelers have successfully gone this route, "especially if they don't like their family or if they're sleeping on the sofa and the sleeping arrangements aren't comfortable," he said with tongue in cheek.
If you miss a connection, Travelocity warns that with planes booked solid, it could be a while before your airline is able to book you on another flight.
Hobica frequently flies JetBlue and he always pays a fee for seats with extra legroom, an option that comes with access to expedited security lanes and early boarding.
"They have free drinks in most of the lounges, snacks and shorter lines if you have to rebook your flight.
