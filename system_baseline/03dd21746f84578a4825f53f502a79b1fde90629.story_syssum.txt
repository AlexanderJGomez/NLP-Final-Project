Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- At least three people were killed and 174 injured during clashes in Egypt on Sunday, officials said, exactly one year after the country's first democratically elected president came to power.
The Tamarod, or "rebel," campaign, a large movement led by opponents of the president, has spent months collecting signatures on a petition calling for Morsy to step down and call new elections.
Some anti-Morsy protesters are loyal to the ousted government of Hosni Mubarak, while others want the army to intervene and lead a transition similar to the revolt that removed Mubarak from power.
Ordinary citizens fed up with fuel shortages, power cuts, a collapsing economy and rising crime have also joined the protests.
Protests also erupted Sunday in Suez, Sharqia, El Monofia and Gharbiya, the state-run Ahram news agency said.
Before the death reported Sunday, clashes had already claimed at least eight lives, including associates of the Muslim Brotherhood whose offices came under attack.
On Sunday, a spokesman for the group said that its headquarters in Cairo fell under attack from between 100 and 150 "thugs."
State media reported that protesters demanding Morsy's ouster ransacked the city's offices of his Freedom and Justice Party, the Muslim Brotherhood's political wing.
His remarks raised the specter of a return to the powerful role the military played in domestic politics under Mubarak.
In the past year, about 80 people have been killed during protests and other political violence largely attributed to Egyptian security forces, Amnesty International said.
