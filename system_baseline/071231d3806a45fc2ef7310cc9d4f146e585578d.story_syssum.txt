Today, as I look up Google's national flu trend map, I see nearly the entire country painted in an alarming red, signifying "intense" flu activity.
Like many other clinics across the country, my office is flooded with patients suffering from coughs, runny noses, fevers and body aches, all potentially caused by the flu.
But others fare less successfully: the young, the elderly, and those with chronic conditions like asthma, diabetes or cancer.
One reason why the flu outbreak is so prevalent this year is that the predominant strain, H3N2, hasn't been this widely circulated since 2002-03 and is associated with a more severe illness.
The reason many cite, "I got the flu from the flu shot!"
But it's still the flu and can be spread to more vulnerable patients, with disastrous consequences for them.
I realize I have to do a better job to dispel these myths in the exam room and convince more of my patients to receive a flu shot.
Then be proactive and get a vaccine earlier in future flu seasons.
