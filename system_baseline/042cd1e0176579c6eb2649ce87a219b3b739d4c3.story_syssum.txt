It is no secret that the Congressional Black Caucus did not initially support Barack Obama's campaign to become president of the United States.
The black caucus and most of black America (with the exception of Tavis Smiley and Cornel West) had remained silent for two years about the devastating economic impact of the recession on black people.
Finally, the White House started a blitz of interviews on black media.
Although the president and his staff steered away from using the word "black," they made clear that they heard the CBC's message and were working diligently to change course.
Some say he was offering a "tough love" rebuke, rallying the troops to get up and act.
Their take is that they are standing up for those who cannot stand up for themselves and that they are pushing a black agenda as others have pushed their own agendas.
Nor would he address our gay brethren in such a manner as they pushed hard for a repeal of "don't ask, don't tell" and now want the Defense of Marriage Act reversed.
So the deeper question is not why President Obama took the tone he did, but why black America tolerates it.
But I think the time has come for the administration to "take its slippers off" and march into America's urban centers and rural centers, and create a sustainable and real-time jobs policy -- going beyond the president's jobs bill -- that will touch everyday black Americans who are out of work and economically disenfranchised.
The cold hard fact is that no group is being as negatively impacted by this recession as blacks, so it is proper and necessary for the CBC and others to continue to press this president to do more.
