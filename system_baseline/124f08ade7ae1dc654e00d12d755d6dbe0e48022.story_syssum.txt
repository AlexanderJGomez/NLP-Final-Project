(CNN) -- Since the Xbox One's release last fall, customers have been waiting (some more patiently than others) for that one great game that would single-handedly justify the purchase of the next-generation video game console.
Some of the creators of "Titanfall" have a pretty good idea what it is like to have that kind of pressure on a game.
Asked if the expectations were too great for "Titanfall," he said with a laugh, "If I say yes, it makes me look like I don't have confidence in the game.
Zampella said "Titanfall" couldn't have existed without the increased gaming power and features of the Xbox One console.
"We've spent a lot of money to back every Xbox One console with hundreds of thousands of servers to have great gameplay."
"It really is about that balance of gameplay where sometimes you are in a titan, sometimes you're not.
"We have had a tradition of a big, multiplayer, epic game that defines each one of our console generations," Mehdi said.
"Whether it was the original Xbox with 'Halo,' there has always been a great game to define the generation.
