The two days of voting felt like a success, particularly because in the days leading up to the vote, Egypt seemed on the verge of implosion.
But elections were held as scheduled, and, surprisingly, there was neither major violence nor reports of systematic fraud or irregularities.
Because Egypt is still operating under a presidential system, with the ruling military council as the executive authority, Parliament will not be able to form a government.
The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party -- which will control a sizable plurality of seats -- supports a pure parliamentary system, with either a ceremonial president or no president at all.
At the same time, with the real risk of a military-approved candidate winning free presidential elections, a mixed system with a powerful president comes with its own pitfalls.
This struggle for power will be just as meaningful -- and likely much more contentious -- than the elections that preceded it.
