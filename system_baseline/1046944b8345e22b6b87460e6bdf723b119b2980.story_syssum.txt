She had pulled off the highway in Oklahoma City, to buy something at a convenience store, when a car pulled up alongside hers.
She said she later learned from police that the children were told they had to kill someone that night or someone in their family would suffer violent consequences.
More than two decades later, Fitzpatrick was living in New Orleans when she once again had a brush with street violence.
I didn't want the children to think that this was normal.
"We offer a space out of the path of the bullet, where a young man can put 6 inches of cinder block between him and violence outside," Fitzpatrick said.
"We're empowering our young men and women to ... find out what they might want to do," Fitzpatrick said.
"Statistics say that overwhelmingly, the young men being murdered on the street, they know their murderer," she said.
"What we do is (ask) ... 'How can we address this differently?
"We give them the space and the opportunity to make that decision.
What I have found is that no one has ever really given them the opportunity to make the choice.
But she said she doesn't force her religion on the children, and evangelizing is not allowed at APEX.
Michael Lewis, a 20-something young man at APEX, said he felt an "instant connection" with Fitzpatrick after hearing her past.
"I've kind of gone through a similar situation," he said.
Today, Santacruze helps others at APEX, where he sees young people facing the same struggles that he once did.
It brings tears to my eyes at the end of the day, and it makes me happy to know that I'm actually influencing their lives.
(It's) when a kid like Kendall can live (here) and make a conscious choice every day to not be involved in the violence, spread the message of nonviolence, and work hard to get other kids to put down the gun.
I can't do anything else but be here."
