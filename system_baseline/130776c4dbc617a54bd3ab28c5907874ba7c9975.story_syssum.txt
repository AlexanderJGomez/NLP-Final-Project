San Diego, California (CNN) -- Sometimes, a film is so powerful that it haunts you long after you've left the theater.
It tells the incredible story of Michael Oher, who went from being a homeless inner-city high school student whose father was dead and whose mother was a crack addict to a star lineman at the University of Mississippi -- eventually being selected by the Baltimore Ravens in the 2009 NFL draft.
The white, wealthy Memphis family not only fed and clothed Michael but also loved him as one of their own along with daughter Collins and son Sean Jr.
There's the message: So much in life you take for granted.
We've stopped being grateful for what we have, because we somehow find it more satisfying to complain about what we don't.
We've strayed so far from the example of our immigrant parents and grandparents that we bear no resemblance to that model.
I heard back from many of their parents who, angrily rising to their children's defense, informed me -- in incompatible narratives -- that either there were no jobs or their kids already had two of them.
In another scene, Michael is so grateful to be at Thanksgiving dinner that he respectfully sits at the dining room table while the rest of the family plops down in front of the television.
In another scene, he requests a driver's license just so he can have something with his name on it.
The scene about the bed made me want to run home and gather up every one of my kids' toys and give them to Goodwill.
