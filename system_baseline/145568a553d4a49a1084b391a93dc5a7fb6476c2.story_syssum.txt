(RollingStone.com)  -- Britney Spears announced today that her new album, due March 15, is titled "Femme Fatale" -- but the superstar singer and her Los Angeles producers are still choosing songs and determining the final direction of the overall sound.
Originally, Dr. Luke and Martin, the Swedish songwriter behind some of Spears' biggest hits, including "...Baby One More Time," planned to give the song to Katy Perry.
"We might have played it for her, but it definitely wasn't a Katy Perry record," Dr. Luke says by phone from Conway Recording Studio in Los Angeles.
"It feels like a really obvious, easy-to-listen-to first single," says John Ivey, program director for KIIS in LA, which played the song once an hour the first day it came out.
"[Circus] ended up doing well, but we were a little cautious about it -- a little tense comeback issues were going to be relevant," says Mark Hudson, music buyer for Trans World Entertainment, who predicts the new album could sell 500,000 copies in its first week.
"She gets it done."
