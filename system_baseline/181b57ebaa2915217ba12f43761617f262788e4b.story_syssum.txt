Even though authorities prosecuted a small group of extremists, whose homemade bomb killed 168 people, Key claimed that there was a government conspiracy to hide the truth.
A retired IRS agent, John Nance, had worked in the Murrah building, knew many of the victims and was outraged over Key's claim that federal agents knew of the bomb plot and did not stop it.
Nance beat Key in the 1998 GOP primary and went on to serve four consecutive terms in the state legislature before stepping down.
"If [the Tea Party movement] does anything, it's an avenue that people need to have so they can express themselves to the government" without violence.
"History tells us that it's government becoming too heavy-handed, going out of its proper role, is what fuels extremism," Key said.
An editorial in The Oklahoman called the bills "a waste of time" and sympathized with residents of House District 90 "if they're having second thoughts" about re-electing Key.
Assuming he is re-elected in 2010, he will become the victim of a populist anti-government movement from the 1990s: term limits.
Even those who rail against the government.
