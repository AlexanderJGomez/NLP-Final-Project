The 54-meter tall renewable structure sits atop a semi-submersible platform known as a WindFloat situated five kilometers from shore.
This means WindFloat structures could theoretically be transported to any ocean location where there is a strong wind resource, says Weinstein.
The fact that turbines and their platforms can be assembled on land (unlike bottom-fixed devices which are assembled at sea on specialized vessels and cost as much as $250,000 a day to charter) means "the cost and risk profile ... is significantly reduced," she says.
The initial structure off the coast of Portugal is merely a pilot installation to prove the device works and is viable, says Weinstein.
