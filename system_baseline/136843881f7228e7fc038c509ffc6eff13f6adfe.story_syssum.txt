"I think you guys vote on bills in the same way the rest of us agree to updated terms and conditions on iTunes," he said.
"Yeah, just agree," wrote one user, macbookairman, on a MacRumors.com forum, echoing the sentiments of many Apple users on the site.
But two digital-media attorneys contacted by CNN say that customers of iTunes, Apple's online marketplace, should still be aware of what they're agreeing to -- and what legal rights they may be giving up.
To them, it is obvious why people are so nonchalant about the terms.
"None of that is true.
CNN asked Handel and Grossman to go through key parts of the iTunes terms and explain exactly what are customers getting themselves into.
Genius: The terms state, "When you use the Genius feature, Apple will use this information and the contents of your iTunes library, as well as other information, to give personalized recommendations to you."
"You should assume that everything you do is tracked or trackable."
Grossman said that there is no leeway on this point, and that anyone who tried to take Apple to court over a lost digital file would lose very quickly.
Licensing: The terms state, "You agree that the Service, including but not limited to Products, graphics, user interface, audio clips, video clips [and] editorial content ... contains proprietary information and material that is owned by Apple and/or its licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not limited to copyright."
By contrast, the terms and conditions for Google's Android Marketplace are about five pages long.
Someone is going to say that it wasn't in the summary and therefore does not count."
Both lawyers agreed Apple should clarify some of the language in the document to make it easier for customers to understand.
An Apple spokesman said the company would not comment for this story.
And companies have to deal with that as well because they depend on users' goodwill.
