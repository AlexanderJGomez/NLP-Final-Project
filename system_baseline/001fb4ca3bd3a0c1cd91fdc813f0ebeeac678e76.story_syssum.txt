He's been waiting 19 years for a visa still stuck in a backlog, but the California Supreme Court ensured this week that his second dream will become a reality.
He was brought to the United States as a minor and has been in line for 19 years for a green card.

Now that he has a law license, however, one thing that Garcia will not specialize in is immigration law.
