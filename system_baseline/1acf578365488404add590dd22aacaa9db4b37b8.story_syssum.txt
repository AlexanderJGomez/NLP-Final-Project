(CNN) -- Retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen, who is overseeing the federal response to the BP oil spill, said Sunday that he is "satisfied" with the amount of dispersants that have been used to clean up the disaster, saying crews have used them only when needed.
"After we discovered how toxic these chemicals really are, they had no business being spread across the Gulf in this manner."
Allen said field commanders on a case-by-case basis have decided to use dispersants when oil has been spotted by surveillance aircraft and no other method of cleaning it up is available in the area.
BP issued a statement Sunday saying it has worked closely with the EPA and the Coast Guard over the use of dispersants "since the very beginning" of the disaster.
"As a result, its use in response to the BP spill was subject to numerous strict conditions once it quickly became apparent that BP wanted to use it in unprecedented quantities and in novel ways."
"While EPA may not have concurred with every individual waiver granted by the federal on-scene coordinator, the agency believes dispersant use has been an essential tool in mitigating this spill's impact, preventing millions of gallons of oil from doing even more damage to sensitive marshes, wetlands and beaches and the economy of the Gulf coast," Gilfillan said.
Meanwhile Sunday, Allen announced that the first of two efforts to seal the ruptured well once and for all could begin as early as Monday night.
That will be followed by a final "bottom kill" after a relief well intercepts the crippled well -- a step that Allen estimated Sunday to begin a minimum of five to seven days after the static kill is complete.
