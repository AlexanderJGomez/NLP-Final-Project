After inpatient rehab, Felicia Anderson sought help from Mothers Making a Change to help beat her addiction.
In that moment, Anderson vowed to stay off drugs, something she'd been unable to do in more than a decade addicted to crack cocaine, even when she was pregnant with her first two children.
In addition to therapy and education, Mothers Making a Change provided transportation and offered free child care while Anderson was there.
"I can say with everything in me, with every bit of my breath, that program helped me turn my life around," said Anderson, who now runs a program to help the developmentally disabled in DeKalb County, Georgia.
She said her drug use began spiraling out of control when her husband, an Army infantryman, committed suicide after returning from Operation Desert Storm.
And she began stealing to keep her children clothed and fed and to support her habit.
"The gifts would be under the tree, and I needed some crack, and I would take whatever present was there," Anderson recalled.
Anderson said she even smoked crack as she went into labor with her second child.
He convinced the judge to let Anderson and her two daughters come to Georgia with him and to let his sister check into rehab instead of going to jail.
That was a turning point for me," Anderson said.
Anderson said that she has been drug-free for 12 years and that she's lucky: Her older two children did not suffer any health consequences from her addiction.
