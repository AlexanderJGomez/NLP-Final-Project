"We're nowhere near (figuring the cost) yet," UCLA Assistant Vice Chancellor Kelly Schmader said near the north side of campus, not far from where workers still were trying to stanch residual leaks in the damaged underground Los Angeles water pipe.
No one was injured, but damage to some campus parking garages and athletic facilities was "substantial," Schmader said.
"I went back to my car to try and leave, and they told me that I couldn't leave the structure because it was flooded," a woman told CNN affiliate KTLA.
Video from KTLA showed workers using machines and squeegees to dry the court and push water out of the arena.
Whether we'll be able to save that court, I don't know," Schmader said.
Morgan Center, which houses the college's athletics hall of fame, also was waterlogged, with workers piling strips of wet carpet outside.
"So we ask everybody to try harder to conserve water."
About 1,000 gallons a minute were still leaking from the pipe Wednesday afternoon, said Jim McDaniel of that agency.
