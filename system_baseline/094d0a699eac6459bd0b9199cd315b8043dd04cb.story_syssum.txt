"The death toll has hit 11 people, including three attackers and five security personnel, while the rest were civilians," said Gen. Mohamed Yusuf Omar Madale, a Somali police spokesman.
Police official Yusuf Ali said Wednesday that the first suicide car bomb exploded outside the main gate of the Jazeera Palace Hotel, and the second blast came as first responders began gathering to evacuate the injured.
Other Somali violence has been traced to Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked organization that the U.S. government calls a terrorist group and that was behind the deadly siege this fall of a Nairobi, Kenya, shopping mall.
According to a presidential media officer and several journalists at the scene, early indications are that the attack was carried out by two suicide bombers who set off explosives at the gates of the hotel, where the president was having high-level meetings.
The Jazeera Palace Hotel is near Mogadishu airport and it is frequented by government officials and diplomats.
