San Diego, California (CNN) -- Another player has entered the immigration battle as the Justice Department sues Arizona over its new immigration law.
But there's hope: A few in the movement have begun to see that getting meaningful action will require small steps and "mini-bargains."
Reformers today still try to link legalization of the vast majority of resident illegals with stronger enforcement mechanisms -- just as they did in 1986.
Illegals, they say, violated the law and American sovereignty, put American security at risk and then took American jobs.
They didn't choose to break any law, but their legal status leaves them with no opportunities.
Supporters of comprehensive reform and legalization worry that the DREAM act will take away the impetus for further reform and benefit only a fraction of the illegal immigrants in the United States.
Although it is true that the DREAM act will initially help only a few hundred-thousand, pro-Latino reformers should not forget the lesson of minority rights since the 1940s: Rights expand over time, covering more groups and more issues.
Legalization forces can get DREAM, but they must also support increased border enforcement.
