Chiranuch Premchaiporn was found guilty for allowing content prohibited under Thailand's controversial "lese-majeste" law to stay on Prachatai, an independent online news site, for 20 days before it was deleted.
Chiranuch had faced 10 charges under the 2007 Computer Crime Act -- which includes lese-majeste offenses -- for statements posted by others on Prachatai between April and November 2008.
Earlier this month, a 61-year-old man serving a 20-year sentence for lese-majeste and computer offenses died in a prison hospital in Bangkok.
According to the Post, hundreds of protesters from the red-shirt movement -- generally loyal to ousted Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra -- placed funeral wreaths, red roses and lilies at the hospital.
