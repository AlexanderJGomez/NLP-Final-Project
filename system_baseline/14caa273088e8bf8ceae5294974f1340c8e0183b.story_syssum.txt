"I proposed appointing a state commissioner to exercise control over the company who should manage the company and its assets until the tasks stemming from the disaster have been fulfilled," he said.
The company should be put under state control and its assets under state closure."
Meanwhile, an eighth victim of the sludge has been found, said Gyorgyi Tottos, an official with Hungary's emergency services department.
Hundreds of soldiers were ready to rescue inhabitants of a nearby village if the wall collapses.
Hungary's state-owned MTI news agency quoted Zoltan Illes, state secretary of environment, as saying the damaged wall could not be saved.
That's the reason why we pulled out ... all human lives from that area, in order not to have more loss in human life."
The pH, or acidity, level of the Danube water was 8.5 Friday -- slightly above normal but not dangerous and able to sustain life, Tottos said.
However, on Sunday she said that while saving lives is the priority, officials remain concerned about the long-term effects of the spill and want to protect Europe's waterways.
It has also established a relief fund for victims of the spill and was attempting to help in finding accommodations for evacuated people.
Orban warned Saturday of the "toughest possible consequences" for those responsible for the spill and said human error was the cause.
Emergency workers have been pouring plaster and fertilizers on the sludge in hopes that it will counter its alkalinity.
