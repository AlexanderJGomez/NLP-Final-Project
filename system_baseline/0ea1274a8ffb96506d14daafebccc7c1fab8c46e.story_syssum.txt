For the first time, Boehner this weekend had offered to accept tax rate increases on household income over $1 million, sources said.
"The president's proposal is the only proposal that we have seen that achieves the balance that is so necessary" between revenue and cost-cutting, said Carney, who refused to discuss specifics.
"Any movement away from the unrealistic offers the president has made previously is a step in the right direction, but a proposal that includes $1.3 trillion in revenue for only $930 billion in spending cuts cannot be considered balanced," Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said.
"We hope to continue discussions with the president so we can reach an agreement that is truly balanced and begins to solve our spending problem."
Boehner has been under pressure from the White House, Democrats, the business community and some fellow Republicans to give up the staunch opposition to any increase in tax rates.
The president's plan also includes one of his key demands on the national debt, a two-year extension of the debt ceiling being subject to periodic congressional votes under the so-called McConnell mechanism.
An aide to Boehner said earlier any such increase would have to be offset by spending cuts and reforms.
