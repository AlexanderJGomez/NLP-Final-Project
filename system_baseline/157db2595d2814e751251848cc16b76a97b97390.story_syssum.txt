(CNN) -- Brian David Mitchell, the homeless street preacher who abducted, raped and kept a 14-year-old Elizabeth Smart captive for nine months, was sentenced to life in prison Wednesday.
Beaming before a group of reporters gathered outside the federal courthouse, Smart, now 23, said she was "thrilled" with the sentence -- the maximum allowable under the law.
"I felt that because of what he had done to me, I was marked," she said during her testimony.
She testified that she awoke to find a man holding a cold steel blade to her neck on June 5, 2002.
Smart said she was raped nearly every day during nine months in captivity and forced to drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes and watch Mitchell have sex with his legal wife, Wanda Barzee.
"I think one of the biggest ways to overcome any trial in life, to heal from any kind of experience, is by helping those around you, because by lifting those around you up, you end up lifting yourself up as well," Smart said.
