He will serve the last two months of his 23-month sentence in home confinement in Virginia, his publicist Judy Smith said.
Meanwhile, Vick's attorneys have said he will work at a Newport News construction firm after his release and he has also agreed to participate in a documentary for $600,000.
Santoro suggested Vick's next plan not call for him to keep two houses and three cars, as did the rejected proposal.
After his release, Vick will work with the Humane Society of the United States on anti-dogfighting campaigns, Humane Society President Wayne Pacelle told CNN Tuesday.
He said he has traveled to Kansas twice to meet with the former quarterback, and during the second visit, the two discussed how Vick could use his sway over youths to discourage them from involvement in dogfighting, as well as help those who were apprehended in connection with it.
The Humane Society, which offers rewards for tips involving dogfighting, has recently paid out $40,000 in five cases, he said.
