The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Philadelphia by Vito LoGrasso, who is best known for wrestling under the moniker Big Vito, and Evan Singleton, who wrestled under the name Adam Mercer.
"WWE has never concealed any medical information related to concussions, or otherwise, from our talent," said Jerry McDevitt from the K&L Gates law firm.
"For most of its history, WWE has engaged in a campaign of misinformation and deception to prevent its wrestlers from understanding the true nature and consequences of the injuries they have sustained," the lawsuit says.
WWE forces wrestlers to do stunts "in a matter that dramatically increases -- often to a near-certainty -- their chances of sustaining brain damage," the suit says.
