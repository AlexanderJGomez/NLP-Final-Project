Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger didn't sign a forward or striker in this year's January transfer window when his team was very much still in the Premier League title race, instead relying on unproven 21-year-old Yaya Sanogo to back up French international Olivier Giroud.
"I'm so happy to be joining Arsenal, a club which has a great manager, a fantastic squad of players, huge support around the world and a great stadium in London," Sanchez told Arsenal's website.
"He has consistently produced top-quality performances at the highest level for a number of seasons now and we are all excited to see him integrate into the Arsenal squad.
"FC Barcelona thanks Alexis Sanchez for his professionalism and dedication for the three seasons that he has been in the first team squad, and wishes him all the best for the future," Barcelona said on its website.
