And that's exactly what viewers will be doing when TV's best midseason offering, "Good Christian Belles," aka "GCB," debuts March 4 on ABC.
ET January 17 for a fourth season, and the 11th season of "American Idol" resumes at 8 p.m.
ET Sunday, NBC): Based on the best-selling novel by John Grisham, this intense and sometimes cluttered courtroom drama, follows attorney Mitchell McDeere (this time played by Josh Lucas of "The Lincoln Lawyer" instead of Tom Cruise) a decade after he brought down a prestigious Memphis law firm.
Every week, Mitch will fight for his clients but with a twist because the mob wants him dead as does a shadowy organization behind one of his controversial cases.
ET January 16, Fox): America's most infamous prison becomes a time-travel portal in this trippy but fun new sci-fi drama from none other than J.J. Abrams ("Lost" and "Fringe").
Hoffman leads a stellar cast that includes Nick Nolte and Dennis Farina in this methodical and fascinating drama about horse racing and the troubled people who inhabit that world.
ET Wednesday, NBC): Based on comedic actress Chelsea Handler's best-selling and mostly autobiographical books, this mildly funny new comedy follows a 20-something (Laura Prepon of "That '70s Show") who parties as hard as she drinks.
What's even less appealing is that Handler stars in the sitcom too but doesn't play herself.
ET February 7, ABC): Bruce Greenwood ("Star Trek" the movie) stars as an explorer and wildlife TV host who goes missing in the Amazon jungle.
ET Thursday, Fox): Geoff Stults ("Happy Town") and Michael Clarke Duncan ("The Green Mile") star in this dull but well-intentioned spinoff of "Bones."
