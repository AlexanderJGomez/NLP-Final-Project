Streets were shut down, buildings lining the route to Cairo University were repainted, and the dome under which Obama was set to give his speech renovated.
But Obama's visit in 2009 is yet another reminder of how drastically different the situation in Egypt has become since the January 25th revolution last year.
It has been more than a year since the uprising started, and while Cairo has cleaned itself up, the city remains mired in turmoil and confusion over the transitional process to its own democracy.
Friends of mine, avid followers of the U.S. political scene who used to be able to name various Congressmen and their policies, just aren't paying as much attention this time around.
All of the superficial reasons why Egyptians admired Obama have melted away, and what is left in some corners is a feeling that he wasn't as quick to embrace our push for freedom as he could have been.
Even though Bush is generally regarded negatively for his "War on Terror," it is interesting to hear some engaged political activists say that they miss the Bush days, preferring his support of freedom of speech in Egypt when compared to the Obama administration.
For the first time in recent history, our own political news is the dominant issue, so local media coverage of the race to the White House so far has been dismal at best.
