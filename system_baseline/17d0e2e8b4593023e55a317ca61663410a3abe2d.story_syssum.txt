That the shipwrecked hero, a young Indian boy named Piscine Molitor Patel -- "Pi" for short -- didn't have another human soul to talk to for 200 days presented another significant challenge.
In this story Pi must remain acutely aware of distance: the distance between him and the big cat, the restricted space of the lifeboat, and the overwhelming open horizons of the ocean all around him.
Some of the loveliest, most magical images plunge beneath the surface to reveal the myriad marine creatures separated from Pi by nothing more than an inch or two of wood.
That's prosaic in comparison, and the first act is not quite as nimble as it might have been (there's a necessary framing device, but also a redundant romantic interlude concocted by screenwriter David Magee for reasons that have more to do with conventional Hollywood wisdom than the demands of this particular tale).
It's at this point that the movie conjures its most surreal and outlandish episode, an alluring strange interlude on a floating island that doesn't quite catch the horror in the novel's description.
