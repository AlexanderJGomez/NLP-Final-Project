Saying the prosecution has provided no evidence regarding the use of a blindfold -- which could be used to make the government's case for premeditation and thus first-degree murder -- Jordan Linn Graham's attorney, Michael Donahoe, asserts that he is unprepared to defend his client if the trial is held in December as planned.
The report, which alleges an FBI interrogator inappropriately touched Graham's knee during the interview, states that almost an hour and a half of Graham's interrogation was not recorded, despite the necessary equipment being on hand.
On July 7, just more than a week after they got married, Graham and her husband were arguing at Montana's Glacier National Park, according to court affidavits.
On July 11, according to an affidavit, Graham led a party to a popular spot in the park called "The Loop," where Johnson's body was located and she called authorities.
Graham then replied, "Dead serious, if u don't hear from me at all again tonight, something happened," according to a court document filed in the case.
