Washington (CNN) -- Latino support for Democratic candidates remains strong, with 65 percent of registered Hispanic voters saying they plan to vote for the Democrat in their congressional district in next month's midterm elections, the Pew Hispanic Center said in a report Tuesday.
"This partisan gap is consistent with survey findings of the full population of registered voters," said the report by Mark Hugo Lopez, associate director of the Pew Hispanic Center.
The study also reveals that the Democratic Party continues to hold a large advantage in party identification among Latino registered voters.
"Nearly half (47 percent) of Latino registered voters say this about the Democratic Party -- down from 55 percent in 2008, but similar to the share on this question expressed by Latinos for much of the past decade," Pew said.
The findings for the report came from a national bilingual telephone survey of 1,375 Latinos ages 18 or older, including 618 registered voters, conducted from August 17 through September 19 by the Pew Hispanic Center.
It is part of the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan institute based in Washington that is funded by The Pew Charitable Trusts, a Philadelphia-based public charity.
