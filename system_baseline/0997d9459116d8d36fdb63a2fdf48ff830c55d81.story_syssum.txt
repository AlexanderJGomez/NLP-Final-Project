(CNN) -- "Down the shore, everything's all right," President Barack Obama declared Tuesday on his return to New Jersey's devastated coast seven months after Superstorm Sandy caused billions of dollars in damage there.
"New Jersey is more important, our citizens' lives are more important than any type of politics at all," said the governor, who is up for re-election this year and is considered a potential GOP presidential contender in 2016.
Christie, a top Romney surrogate who delivered the keynote address at the Republican National Convention, joined Obama for a tour of the storm damage and made a point of praising the president for his "personal concern and compassion" for the state and its people.
The president praised the Federal Emergency Management Agency for its quick response to the Moore tornado, just as he did last fall when Sandy struck the East Coast.
Since coming under heavy criticism for missteps in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, FEMA has been commended by localities for responding quickly to disasters and reducing bureaucratic hurdles.
