More than 30 years later, his son has returned and is watching what could be the longtime leader's collapse.
Over the years, Addahoumi said he has returned to Libya from time to time and that he wishes he could be there now.
Addahoumi's son, Sammi, sent CNN an iReport from Benghazi that showed video of large, boisterous crowds in the city's Freedom Square as developments played on a large screen.
Every summer, he tries to spend at least a month there, he said.
He said Libyans have the resources they need to build the country and that they will do it, piece by piece.
