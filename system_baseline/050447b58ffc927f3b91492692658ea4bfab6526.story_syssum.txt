The partnership includes a promotional cover-wrap that will appear on 1,000 copies declaring Barbie "the doll that started it all," a four-page advertising feature inside the magazine and video outtakes posted online.
A post on "Mommyish" blog, "The Sport's Illustrated Swimsuit Issue Will Feature Barbie, So Your Daughter Can Feel Bad Too," underscored criticism of the partnership for using a children's toy to promote sexualized images intended for adults.
As a brand that is always a part of the cultural conversation, Barbie, for the first time, has an active voice in the debate with her #unapologetic stance.
"When you look at the history of Barbie and how she's 'grown' in career choices I believe she's a positive example ... and quite frankly, a more positive image than the SI models," Utah grandmother Holly Albrecht said on Twitter.
"If the image of what (you're) imagining yourself as is never attainable and is billed as what to strive for, you'll always be disappointed."
Barbie and the Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition have both been accused of promoting idealized beauty in their own ways.
For many, the campaign was problematic because they say the swimsuit edition objectifies women and promotes a homogenous view of beauty.
"Yes, the swimsuit edition is made up entirely of hypersexualized images of women, but this pairing blurs a new line.
It also comes at a time when many are demanding representations of women without airbrushing or Photoshop, she said.
