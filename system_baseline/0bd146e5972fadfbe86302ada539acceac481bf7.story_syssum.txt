Goetz was the subject of national attention when he shot four black teenagers on December 22, 1984, aboard a Manhattan subway car.
Goetz, who is white, was acquitted of murder and assault charges in the shooting but was convicted of illegal possession of a weapon.
Nieves said Goetz went to his apartment to pick up the drug and then sold it to the officer for $30.
