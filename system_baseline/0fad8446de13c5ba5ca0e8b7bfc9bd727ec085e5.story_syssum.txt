The singer didn't plan on releasing her new album "Rebel Heart" anytime soon, but that all changed after unfinished versions of her newest songs found their way on the Internet.
The tracks available immediately for download include "Living for Love," an upbeat anthem, "Devil Pray," a haunting composition, "Ghosttown," an emotional mantra, "Illuminati," an electronic orchestra of melodies, as well as two other songs.
Thank you for waiting and if you have heard please know they are unfinished demos stolen long ago and not ready to be presented to the world," she wrote in her post.
Rolling Stone reported that Madonna had wanted her newest single, "Living for Love," to be released on Valentine's Day, with the rest of the album coming out in spring.
