It's not entirely uncommon for me to have these lively conversations with my food.
Fortunately, though, since the worst of my supernatural household concerns is confined to the lingering spirit of old Velveeta, I do sleep fairly well at night in the 2 square feet of bed space kindly allotted to me by my dog.
Which is far better than what could have been said of two flatmates in London who recently sold an antique mirror on eBay because they were convinced it was haunted and willfully endangering their lives.
The two flatmates also complained of waking up completely drained of energy, screaming in the early morning hours with horrible feelings of impending doom.
Though, to be fair, that kind of sounds like my typical weekday.
You see, in addition to growing increasingly sick and depressed from all the evil hauntings, one of the flatmates even claims to have woken up with deep body scratches, for which he blamed the mirror and kindly provided a link on eBay for photographic proof.
Of course, any potential buyer would need to believe such humorous nonsense as haunting pains and bloody scratches in the night.
Amazingly, thanks to the powers of the interwebs, there was no shortage of interest.
As a result, I plan to list everything I sell in the future as potentially haunted.
In the end, it doesn't really matter whether the mirror was evil or if their stories were even mildly believable.
Which is why, if anyone's interested, I now have some leftover Super Bowl cheese dip for sale.
