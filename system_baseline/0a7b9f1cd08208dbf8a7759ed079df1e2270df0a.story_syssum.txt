The former was the 23-year-old's mission to topple the highest tennis ranking ever held by a Japanese male, Shuzo Matsuoka, who hit world No.
"I try not to think too much because if I start thinking then I feel pressure myself," Nishikori told CNN's Human to Hero series.
Nishikori left Japan for Bollettieri's Florida academy aged just 13 without a grasp of English, but the intensive work on his game bore fruit within five years as he lifted his first ATP Tour title in Delray Beach.
He may have lost to eventual champion Rafael Nadal in the fourth round at this year's French Open, but he was the first Japanese player to get to that stage since 1938.
"Beating Roger this year and beating Djokovic two years ago -- that is why I am playing tennis, to play those top 10 guys and to beat them.
"I am trying to get to be the most successful player in Asia," Nishikori added.
No wonder then that Nishikori joked he'd need a couple of days to celebrate after achieving one of his career goals by beating the Swiss at the Madrid Masters in May.
Nishikori's rise saw a swell of optimism that he could be a pioneer for tennis, hence the 'Project 45' hype as he edged towards usurping Matsuoka's ranking.
It's not going to be easy to get there -- hopefully this year -- but I am getting close."
Much like Andy Murray who has had to carry the hopes of the United Kingdom on his shoulders, Nishikori has the same weight of responsibility, but answers to double the amount of people.
Not many people can feel that way -- I love to stay in Japan, I really enjoy it when I go back."
It is something that can make you mad or crazy sometimes but it is something you love and not many guys can do your job.
