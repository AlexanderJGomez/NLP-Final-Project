Three suspects have been arrested in the murder of Ozgecan Aslan, 20, whose body was found Friday in Mersin's Tarsus district in southern Turkey, according to the country's semiofficial news agency Anadolu.
Her funeral was held Saturday in her hometown, the same day protesters marched in Istanbul and Ankara.
The demonstrators carried banners, and images of the glasses-clad, long-haired Aslan, chanting: "We are here today.
Our actual aim is for those murderers to be punished in an effective way."
