Venezuela said Monday that three U.S. diplomats have 48 hours to leave the South American country, accusing them of conspiring against its government.
"The U.S. government is lying when it denounces the arrest of peaceful anti-government protesters," the ministry said in a statement.
In a YouTube video posted from an undisclosed location over the weekend, Lopez called for new anti-government protests Tuesday and vowed to show his face in front of Venezuela's Justice Ministry and hand over a list of demands from the Venezuelan people to government officials.
Lopez encouraged protesters to be peaceful and to allow him to walk the final stretch to the ministry alone.
"We support human rights and fundamental freedoms -- including freedom of expression and of peaceful assembly -- in Venezuela as we do in countries around the world," she said.
