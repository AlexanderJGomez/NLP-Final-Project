Having been deemed America's Glastonbury by the music industry -- the highest accolade in the festival world -- Bonnaroo will attract more than 80,000 people to Manchester, Tennessee, beginning Thursday.
People are used to listening to an eclectic mix of artists and styles on their portable media players, which is why the musical sampling that Bonnaroo offers is so appreciated.
"Festivals have been one of the few bright spots in the music industry in the past few years," said Doree Shafrir, RollingStone.com's senior editor.
"At a festival, you can interact with other artists, be inspired by them and feed off the crowd."
As a result of a partnership between Ben and Jerry's and the Bonnaroo festival, the ice cream company created Bonnaroo Buzz, a light coffee and malt ice cream, which made its national debut this year.
People are totally immersed in it.
"Music is just the entry point for this platform for all arts -- for people to be creative," he added.
