(CNN) -- Matt Sandusky stood in solidarity with his adoptive father, Jerry Sandusky, while a grand jury investigated multiple allegations of child rape against the former Penn State assistant football coach.
Portions of a 29-minute interview police had with Matt Sandusky during the middle of the trial were broadcast Tuesday on NBC, which obtained the audiotape.
In the police interview, Matt Sandusky said that he was molested between the ages of 8 and 15, that he tried to escape from the Sandusky home and once attempted suicide.
"To put Jerry on the stand and have Matt come in and testify against him it would destroy any chance of an acquittal," co-defense counsel Joe Amendola told reporters Friday night after his client was convicted of 45 of 48 sexual abuse charges against him.
"This tape demonstrates Matt's tremendous courage and strength as he begins to disclose that Jerry Sandusky sexually abused him when he was a child," they said.
The audiotape's leak was the main subject of a meeting hastily called Tuesday by trial Judge John Cleland and attended by prosecutors, defense attorneys and even the judge who has overseen the grand jury that's investigated the Sandusky case, a source with knowledge of the meeting told CNN National Correspondent Susan Candiotti.
Amendola said months ago he was not concerned about what the man said before the grand jury.
Sandusky, who was allowed Monday to call his wife, Dottie, is not allowed visitors until a psychiatric examination is completed that also will determine whether he remains on suicide watch, according to Rominger.
Sandusky is allowed out of the small cell -- which features a toilet, sink and bed -- once a day to take a shower.
