It's "troubling" that 84% of veterans say the public isn't aware of the challenges they face and that 71% of Americans agree, Bush said, citing a survey by the Bush Institute and Syracuse University to be released later this year.
At the end of last year, the unemployment rate for post-9/11 veterans hovered at 10%, compared to just above 7% for non-vets.
"After everything they do for us, we have a duty to make that transition as easy as possible," he said, noting that higher education institutions and employers are among those not doing enough.
The Bush Institute is working with a coalition of government, nonprofit, universities and private companies to de-stigmatize PTSD, help GI Bill recipients stay in school, and encourage employers to give veterans a chance.
"Employers would not hesitate to hire an employee getting treated for a medical condition like diabetes or high blood pressure and they should not hesitate to hire veterans getting treated for post-traumatic stress," he said.
"I honestly think this is a great program," said Verna Jones, director of the veterans affairs and rehabilitation division at the American Legion, who attended the event in Dallas.
The United States has spent around $2 trillion directly on the military operations there.
