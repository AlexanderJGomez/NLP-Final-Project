It's that reality the country's principal opposition group says led it to suspend its participation in next week's meeting in Rome of the Friends of Syria -- an international conference of diplomats from more than 60 nations working to bring about an end to the violence.
In a statement released Friday, the coalition said it also would not accept upcoming invitations to meetings in Washington and Moscow.
The United States, the European Union and the Arab League -- the backbone of the Friends of Syria -- have supplied aid to rebels in the form of communications equipment and humanitarian aid.
The news that the National Coalition was pulling out of the meeting came as a surprise to the United States where at least one senior U.S. official warned the move would be counterproductive.
A head of the interim government will be named within 10 days, according to a statement released Friday by the group at the conclusion of a two-day meeting in Cairo.
The fighting has spilled from the countryside into city centers, with rebels and government forces reportedly clashing in the capital city of Damascus as well the country's largest city of Aleppo.
The deaths in Aleppo, according to the opposition, occurred when Scud missiles were fired Friday by government forces at rebel strongholds in predominantly residential neighborhoods.
