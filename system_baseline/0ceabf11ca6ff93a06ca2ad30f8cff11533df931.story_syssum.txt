(CNN) -- Two University of Florida police officers were placed on leave with pay after using an electronic stun gun to subdue a student who was questioning Sen. John Kerry at a campus forum, the school's president said Tuesday.
"The thing that I regret is that civil dialogue and civil discourse did not happen," Machen said.
"You will take my question because I have been listening to your crap for two hours," Meyer told Kerry, according to the police report of the incident.
Meyer also questioned Kerry about why he did not support impeaching Bush and whether he belonged to the Yale University secret society Skull and Bones, as Bush did.
But as Meyer repeatedly questioned why he was being arrested, officers dragged him to the back of the auditorium and then used a Taser on him when he continued to struggle.
Police noted that his demeanor "completely changed once the cameras were not in sight" and described him as laughing and being lighthearted as he was being driven to the Alachua County Detention Center.
Meyer was charged with resisting arrest with violence -- a felony -- and a misdemeanor count of disturbing the peace.
"For a question to be met with arrest, not to mention physical violence, is completely unacceptable in the United States," Dictor said.
It also includes a "disorganized diatribe" that criticizes the war in Iraq and the media.
"In 37 years of public appearances, through wars, protests and highly emotional events, I have never had a dialogue end this way," he said.
