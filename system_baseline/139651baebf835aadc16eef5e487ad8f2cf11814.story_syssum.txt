The newspaper USA Today reported last week that there has been a sharp increase in the unemployment rate for male veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.
More than 250,000 of the male veterans were said to be unemployed last month, with another 400,000 having left the workforce for various reasons: to raise children, or attend college, or because they have just stopped trying to find work.
After what American soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines are asked to sacrifice, there is something melancholy about the thought of them coming home and having trouble finding a way to support their families.
The certificates were intended to reward the veterans for the time they had spent fighting for their country.
The veterans, many of them hungry and destitute, came to Washington asking Congress to allow them to collect their bonuses early.
Many of the veterans resisted; the police shot and killed two of them.
At the highest level of the Army assigned to the task were men who would later become extraordinarily famous.
We've come a long way since then; no president with an eye toward his legacy would order the Army to do such a thing, and it's hard to believe that military officials would not, behind closed doors, try everything in their power to avoid having to use American troops that way.
There may never again, we should hope, be a Bonus Army camped in the streets of Washington, pleading for help.
The best way to prevent such a sight is to provide the help before the despair of the unemployed veterans reaches that breaking point.
