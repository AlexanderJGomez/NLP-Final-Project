Now Shadley is in Tinseltown for a different kind of industry-related project: designing the Architectural Digest green room -- the backstage area where stars can relax while the show runs -- at the 81st Annual Academy Awards.
"I've sort of been captivated by the movies," Shadley said, warming up after landing in Los Angeles less than an hour before.
The magazine's crew had two days to finish building the entire space from scratch.
An extension of the green room will allow access for presenters not walking down the red carpet.
"I want to try to make people feel rested and comfortable and glamorous because they're going out to do the most glamorous thing on earth -- presenting an Academy Award," Shadley said.
