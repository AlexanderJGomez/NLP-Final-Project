"The iOS app we launched today contained a bug with notifications," Google posted on its Gmail Twitter account.
Everyone who's already installed the app can continue to use it."
The app ... at least the fully working version of it ... will send push notifications and sound cues when new messages are received, search your inbox for an e-mail, autocomplete e-mail addresses and upload photos to messages.
