If Team USA was going to win at the Special Olympics World Winter Games, Nelson thought, they had some conditioning to do.
Nelson decided his son would set an example for the floor hockey team.
Over the next few months, the younger Nelson lost 25 pounds.
They started slow, doing low-impact exercises and lots of stretches to prevent injury.
If one person was caught drinking soda or chowing down on chocolate, the whole team did extra exercises at the next practice.
The team blew by its goal of losing a combined 300 pounds before the Winter Games.
Leonard, one of the team's biggest losers, dropped more than 50 pounds.
"I couldn't move as fast ... because I was always getting tired," she said.
"We have a saying in our team that we're champions, but we're champions in everything we do," Nelson said.
He plans to continue losing weight after the team returns home; he wants to drop from 350 to 280 pounds.
No matter what happens, I'm not going to quit."
