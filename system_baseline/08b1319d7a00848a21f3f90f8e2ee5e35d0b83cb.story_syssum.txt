In an effort to alleviate the flooding, demolition crews blew up an ice jam Wednesday evening south of  Bismarck, according to CNN affiliate KXMB.
The plan is make sure water continues flow through the river channel and not spread out over land.
More than 1,000 people were evacuated from an area near Bismarck on Tuesday night as the Missouri River flooded, Rick Robinson of the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services said Wednesday.
Emergency officials said they were particularly concerned about the Red River, which snakes through eastern portions of North and South Dakota and western Minnesota.
"There have been so many volunteers that we had to turn people away," said Ryan McEwan, a supervisor at one volunteer coordinating center.
Fargo's mayor, Dennis Walaker, said Wednesday that his city was about 95 percent prepared for the flooding, which is expected later in the week.
