A source told CNN that Sharper made arrangements to surrender to Los Angeles police and did so without incident Thursday evening.
Prosecutors in Louisiana said the two alleged rapes occurred on September 23 in a New Orleans apartment.
Prosecutors there said the five-time Pro Bowl player, who became an NFL Network analyst, is also under investigation in Arizona and Nevada.
In addition, a Florida woman last month filed a sexual battery complaint in Miami Beach against Sharper relating to a 2012 incident, a police report said.
The woman, her friends and another person went to Sharper's condo, where the woman claims the battery took place.
