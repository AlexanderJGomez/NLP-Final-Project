Those in the know realize that sometime in the future, the vast majority of light cars and trucks in the US will feature electric final drive systems.
Three of the four electric vehicles Chrysler showed in Detroit, Michigan, were shown at other events and even to Washington bureaucrats.
ENVI is the special group of engineers at Chrysler that develops the company's EVs.
This generator automatically turns on after the vehicle's initial batter charge has been spent (usually within a range of 40 miles), supplying extra voltage that give these three vehicles an estimated range of approximately 400 miles.
This technology is similar in concept to what General Motors has shown in their Chevrolet Volt, a vehicle that should be ready for production in 2010.
Much of the hardware for the all-electric front-wheel-drive propulsion units is built into what Mercedes calls "sandwich-floor" architecture that the company uses on several production cars.
The E-Cell uses a large battery pack that is said to deliver a range of 120 miles.
Adding to its line of popular hybrid vehicles in the U.S., Toyota just confirmed plans to add as many as 10 new gas/electric hybrid vehicles in the next few years.
The good news is that the iQ is a real car, so the FT-EV will not be a glorified golf cart or a neighborhood vehicle with severely limited capabilities.
Perhaps following the performance of the stunt cars used in The Italian Job (2003), BMW decided to investigate a battery-powered MINI.
They introduced the MINI E coupe last November at the Los Angeles Auto Show and the car was on display again in Detroit.
This scenario mimics what General Motors did with their EV1 electric vehicle about a decade ago.
