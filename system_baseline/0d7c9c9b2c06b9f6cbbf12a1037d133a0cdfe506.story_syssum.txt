We hear a lot about Americans being fast food-addicted couch potatoes, and while that does play a role in the nation's expanding waist lines, a new study concludes it's not the driving force behind the obesity epidemic.
That means Americans aren't just eating more high-calorie food, they are eating more of a variety of foods.
"If you look at the data over time, you actually see a slight increase in exercise.
"What this article reinforces is that we need to continue our research to find what combination of strategies will be most effective long term in helping all of us live healthier lives," said Colleen Doyle, director of nutrition and physical activity for the American Cancer Society.
Americans are exercising more: Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show an uptick in the number of people who say they get 30 minutes of moderate exercise five or more days a week, or 20 minutes of vigorous activity on three or more days (about 51% in 2009, compared to 46% in 2001).
"We don't want food to become really expensive again; that is not the answer," said Sturm.
In some 800 supermarkets in the African country, healthy foods were subsidized and available at a 25% discount.
A tax on sugary foods and sodas in Mexico was also introduced last year, but experts are still waiting to see what impact that policy will have on eating habits.
Smoking, for instance, used to be common indoors, but policy and social attitude has made that less socially acceptable.
