Surely, there's a silver lining to these snow clouds though, right?
When the ground is frozen, little of the moisture left by snow sinks into the soil.
"All of the snow that has fallen over the winter by and large remains on top of the landscape," said Minnesota's state climatologist Greg Spoden.
"Even flooding at this point won't alleviate a drought," the agency said.
Oklahoma and Kansas will keep more of the moisture the snow left behind, because the ground there isn't frozen, said meteorologist Joel Widenor.
At the same time, the storms that sweep the United States should grow more intense, said meteorologist Marshall Shepherd from the University of Georgia.
As the current storm reaches the Atlantic coast, dumping snow on the nation's capital, the white precipitation should become slushier and deliver more moisture per foot of snow, according to CNN's Weather Center.
Airlines have canceled flights to and from Washington's Dulles airport ahead of the storm's arrival: United 650, U.S. Airways 350, American 20.
It is already plenty moist, Drought Monitor said.
