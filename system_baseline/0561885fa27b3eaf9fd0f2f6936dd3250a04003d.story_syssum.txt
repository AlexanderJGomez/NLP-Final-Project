Although Clinton has not declared her second run at the presidency, the former secretary of state has admitted she is considering a run and many close aides see a campaign as all-but-certain at this point.
Likewise, in 2008, after finishing a disappointing third in the Iowa caucuses, Hillary Clinton used her New Hampshire primary win to right her campaign.
And in New Hampshire, we have a long history of (frontrunner) train wrecks," Terry Shumaker, a longtime Clinton aide in New Hampshire, said last week during a meeting of pro-Clinton Democrats.
When matched up against Jeb Bush, the former Republican governor, or Rand Paul, the senator from Kentucky, Clinton enjoyed a 8 and 7 point lead, respectively.
Paul's strength in the state comes as no surprise, as its libertarian-leaning population drove his father, former Rep. Ron Paul, to a second-place finish in the 2012 GOP presidential primary there.
The Bloomberg poll suggests, however, Christie remains competitive in his home region, and that the two will have a fierce fight for the all-important early primary state if they both decide to run, as expected.
