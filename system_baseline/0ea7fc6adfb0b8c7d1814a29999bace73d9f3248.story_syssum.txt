Its aim is to do something about the more than 7,000 girls 17 or younger who get pregnant in New York City annually, with 90% of those pregnancies unplanned, according to the city's health department.
The FDA says the pill can be taken after unprotected sex to prevent pregnancy, either by stopping the release of a female's egg, stopping sperm from fertilizing an egg or preventing a fertilized egg from attaching to the womb.
"What you're doing is you're giving a young child, between the age of 14 and 17, a chemical drug and hormonal cocktail without the knowledge of the parent, not knowing the medical history or if that child has any kind of drug allergies," Davids told HLN's "Evening Express," noting teens can't get an aspirin in school "without informed consent" but could get the morning-after pill.
Yet Davids, who has a teenage girl and a young boy, said, "Most parents I've spoken to" in schools involved in the program never got a letter from the city's health or education departments, thus never opted out of the program.
At a time when half of teen mothers never graduate high school and 47% of U.S. high schoolers say they are sexually active, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, they say that the more options teens have, the better.
Another woman, Holly Macke, said the program was "not good, but it's OK" -- especially if the alternative is a teenager having an illegal and possibly dangerous abortion after getting pregnant.
But the mayor said lowering those rates even further is important, given the personal and academic costs of teen pregnancy.
