France, Spain, Portugal and Italy refused to let the president's plane fly through their airspace after rumors surfaced that Snowden might be on board, Bolivian officials said.
The Bolivians squarely put the blame on Washington for Morales' unexpected side trip.
Despite several attempts by CNN to get a response, Obama administration officials declined to comment on Bolivia's allegations that the United States pressured European countries to deny landing rights to the Bolivian president's plane, referring all questions to the European countries in question.
"We demand the governments of France, Portugal, Italy and Spain issue the necessary public apology in relation to this serious incident," the statement said.
The leaders said they supported Morales' complaint to the United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights over the matter, and they called for their countries' foreign ministers to form a committee to investigate what happened.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro blamed the CIA, saying he believes the agency pressured governments to refuse to allow Morales through their airspace.
Snowden has admitted leaking classified documents about U.S. surveillance programs and faces espionage charges in the United States.
Morales, a left-leaning president who has long criticized the United States, had been attending a conference of gas-exporting countries in Russia, where he told the Russia Today news network that he would be willing to consider asylum for Snowden.
The authorization was granted as soon as French authorities were informed the plane was the Bolivian president's aircraft, the ministry said.
"There are no legal reasons to accept this request," Foreign Minister Emma Bonino told the Italian parliament.
Iceland has said it can't consider Snowden's request for asylum there until he's in its territory.
