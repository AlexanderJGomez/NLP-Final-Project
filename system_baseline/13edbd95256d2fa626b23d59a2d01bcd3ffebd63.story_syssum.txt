The 22-year-old Dutch citizen was considered the main suspect in the 2005 disappearance of Alabama teen Natalee Holloway in Aruba, where van der Sloot lived.
Van der Sloot told authorities he attacked Flores on May 30 after she read an e-mail on his computer connected with the Holloway case, Peruvian national police said in a statement Thursday.
Flores and van der Sloot went to a hotel room registered in his name after playing poker at a nearby casino, police say.
Van der Sloot's lawyer, Maximo Alonso Altez Navarro, has said he plans to ask the judge in the case to strike down van der Sloot's confession because he was not properly represented when he was interrogated.
Canlla said investigators were still waiting for judicial permission in order to investigate the contents of van der Sloot's computer.
Police said in a statement Thursday that van der Sloot presumably attacked Flores to rob her of the money she had won gambling at a casino.
Although van der Sloot was never charged in connection with Holloway's disappearance in 2005, U.S. authorities have filed extortion and wire fraud charges against him.
In exchange for the money, the document said, van der Sloot showed the representative a house where Holloway's remains supposedly were buried.
John Kelly, an attorney for Holloway's mother, has said he is the unnamed person mentioned in the FBI affidavit as having taken the money to Aruba and met with van der Sloot.
He was an attorney and judge and had been involved in his son's defense in the Holloway case.
