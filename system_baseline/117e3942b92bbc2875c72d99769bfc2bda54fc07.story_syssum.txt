"Today's resolution will ensure that the elimination of the Syrian chemical weapons program happens as soon as possible and with the utmost transparency and accountability," Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said.
The turnaround came this month, when Russia called for Syria to divest itself of its chemical weapons arsenal after U.S. President Barack Obama accused Syria of crossing a "red line" with the use of nerve gas and threatened a strike.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told the council that his country, long an ally of the Syrian government, "will stand ready to take action" if the resolution needs enforcement.
U.N. weapons inspectors returned to Syria this week to look into at least a half-dozen claims of chemical weapons use -- some allegedly by the government, others allegedly by rebels.
"We now have a legal mandate to start a verification mission in Syria," OPCW spokesman Michael Luhan.
The OPCW plans to send an advance team of inspectors to Damascus, an official with the organization, who declined to be identified while discussing delicate operations, told CNN on Friday.
The official said that in order to meet international deadlines for destruction of Syria's chemical weapons, the group may opt for a "quick and dirty" program that would render the weapons unusable but wouldn't destroy them, the official said.
"This resolution is another triumph of hope over reality," John McCain and Lindsey Graham said in a statement.
The pair said al-Assad's forces will continue to "use every weapon in their arsenal short of chemical weapons" on the Syrian people while receiving outside assistance from Russia, Iran and Hezbollah while doing so.
