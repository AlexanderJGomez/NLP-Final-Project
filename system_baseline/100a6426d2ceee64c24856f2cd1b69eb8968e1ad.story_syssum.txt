Rice, who is believed to be President Barack Obama's choice to replace Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, triggered controversy with her appearance on television talk shows in the days after the Benghazi attack to explain what was known about it.
In a statement released after her Senate meetings on Tuesday, Rice said that she explained to senators that "the talking points provided by the intelligence community -- and the initial assessment upon which they were based -- were incorrect in a key respect: There was no protest or demonstration in Benghazi.
Republicans feel that the administration misled the American people before the presidential election, won by Barack Obama, because an al Qaeda attack countered the narrative that Obama's policies, in Rice's words, had "decimated" al Qaeda.
"Based on her public record and her public service, I would not feel that her appearances and anything she said on those Sunday morning talk shows September 16th would disqualify her for appointment to any other office," Lieberman said.
Republicans believe the president's handling of the aftermath of the Benghazi attack shows a lack of leadership and tried to make that a campaign issue.
Ironically, some are frustrated that Obama's challenger, Mitt Romney, did not take enough advantage of this in the presidential campaign.
A: McCain and several other senators have said that Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, would make an excellent choice.
Some political experts speculate that part of the enthusiasm for Kerry could be that his departure would trigger a special election in Massachusetts, where recently defeated Republican Scott Brown could run again and give the GOP another seat in the Senate.
