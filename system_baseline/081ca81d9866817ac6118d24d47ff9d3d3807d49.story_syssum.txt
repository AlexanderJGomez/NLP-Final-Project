But even as Republicans and Democrats drew closer together, some in the transportation industry decried the nearly $11 billion proposals as short-term fixes that leave the nation's bigger infrastructure issues untouched.
Thursday both the Republican-led House Ways & Means Committee and the Democratic-led Senate Finance Committee passed bills with the same central dollar figure, $10.8 billion.
The bills are much closer on the amount of money they'd raise from an extended increase in customs fees.
But even as they issued warm statements across the north-south axis of the Capitol, lawmakers warned of the remaining differences ahead.
Camp's office would not confirm it, but the Michigan Republican seemed to be objecting to a Senate provision that would increase the amount of time the IRS has to audit taxpayers who incorrectly estimate property values, from three years now to six years.
As lawmakers breathe a cautious sigh of relief and move toward avoiding another crisis, some in the road construction industry see little reason to celebrate.
And Republicans' anti-tax mantra has prevented all but a few from supporting any increase in those fees.
