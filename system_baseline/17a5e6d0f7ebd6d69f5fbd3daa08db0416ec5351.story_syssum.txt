Public health officials expect the 2009 H1N1 virus to linger a while.
However, there are two reasons to think the 2009 H1N1 outbreak will wind down in the coming weeks.
Second, the 2009 H1N1 virus outbreak in Mexico has reached its peak, and numbers there are going down.
He points out that the three outbreaks in the last century that were caused by new viruses -- in 1918, 1957 and 1968 -- started with a mild wave followed by more severe waves months later.
"H1N1 flu could die down soon and return later again this fall when the flu season enters back in full swing," says Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano.
Napolitano adds that public health officials will be keeping a close eye on the Southern Hemisphere, where flu season starts soon.
... Cases of the disease almost completely disappeared over the summer, only to reappear in the autumn of 1918 with the vengeance which we all know," he said.
Secondly, the 2009 H1N1 lacks a gene that is present in highly virulent flu viruses, such as the one in 1918.
Johns Hopkins' Pekosz adds that people remember the horrific 1918 flu season, but often forget that the two other flu outbreaks caused by new viruses, the ones in 1957 and 1968, were far more mild.
Pilot lots of the vaccine would then be tested on people.
Pekosz says there are concerns the seasonal flu shot might not work well if it includes the 2009 H1N1 vaccine, and so the decision might be made to make a separate shot.
"I imagine that the choice of vaccination strategy will be a subject of intense discussion and study over the next several months," says Dr. Ted Cohen, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health.
