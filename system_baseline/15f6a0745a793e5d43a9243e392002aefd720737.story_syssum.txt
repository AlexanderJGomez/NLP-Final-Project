About 1 in 7, or 13.5 percent of adults who encountered intense dust clouds after the collapse of the World Trade Center on September 11 were later found to have asthma, compared with just 8.4 percent who had no dust cloud exposure, researchers in Atlanta and New York City reported on Tuesday.
Among adults with no prior diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 23.8 percent have reported symptoms after September 11, and the prevalence of symptoms has increased over time, researchers reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
People in the vicinity of the collapse had "the potential to inhale huge amounts of particulate matter," observes Joan Reibman, M.D., an associate professor of medicine and environmental medicine at the New York University School of Medicine and the director of the school's Bellevue Asthma Center, who was not involved in the study.
His team's most recent study, accepted for publication in Allergy & Asthma Proceedings, will show that the rate of asthma at the closest elementary school to the World Trade Center (29 percent) is high compared with the rate of asthma in children in the general population.
The CDC's Robert M. Brackbill, Ph.D., M.P.H., led the team of New York City and Columbia University researchers whose study examined the longer-term health impact of exposure to Ground Zero and its varying effect across groups of people.
For each group followed, intense exposure to the dust plume was associated with new asthma diagnoses.
"It shows that people who had heavy dust exposure in the initial period, that this was a risk to developing asthma but not the only risk," says Reibman, who also serves as the director of New York City's World Trade Center Environmental Health Center, one of three centers dedicated to treating September 11-related conditions.
She encourages people to recognize their symptoms and seek a proper diagnosis and treatment.
