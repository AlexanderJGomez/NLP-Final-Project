And as a result, just 10 percent of those surveyed use mobile location services at least once a week, according to the Mobile Marketing Association's latest Mobile Consumer Briefing survey.
Here's a look at why location-based services haven't yet hit critical mass and what those platforms are doing about it.
Concerns about loopholes in Foursquare that give others the ability to announce your check-inshave also been raised.
Users need to know how their location data will be used, and feel comfortable that the companies that have access to it will behave responsibly, according to van Dillen.
For some users, the privacy concerns of sharing their location might be trumped by the potential utility of receiving highly targeted advertising and promotions.
For early adopters, though, the long-term promise of more value through targeted ads, coupons and deals, along with the game mechanics (i.e., badges and "mayor" competitions) instituted by some networks has made location-based services worth the potential privacy headaches.
Facebook, meanwhile, will also reportedly soon enable members to add location details to their status updates and release an API so other apps can offer location ability to Facebook users.
Unfortunately for Twitter, compared to sites like Foursquare and Gowalla which clearly indicate the value -- every check-in is part of a game, you can find your friends, get tacit recommendations for places to go, and maybe score a deal or two -- Twitter is only communicating what feels like a very niche and impractical value proposition.
And Facebook hasn't always had the best track record when it comes to rolling out new features in a way that people trust.
The advantage for both Twitter and Facebook is that their users already have a built-in network of followers and friends, so they don't have to sign up for a new service and start adding people to it.
What remains to be seen is if the users will go for it.
