LONDON, England (CNN) -- London police said Thursday they are planning one of the largest and most complex operations in their history as the city gears up to host the G-20 summit next week.
"This is one of the largest, one of the most challenging, and one of the most complicated operations that we've ever delivered," he told reporters Thursday.
The G-20 summit brings together heads of state and financial leaders from the top 20 industrialized and emerging economies.
The first big protest is expected to take place Saturday in Central London.
April 1, the day before the summit, will see various smaller demonstrations in central London.
Asked about reports that some protesters may be planning violence similar to the recent riots in Greece, O'Brien said simply that police have "well-rehearsed tactics" and an experienced team on hand to deal with it.
The ExCeL venue is in East London, 10 minutes from the financial district of Canary Wharf, and there are concerns that protesters angry about the economy could target workers in the area.
O'Brien called the precautionary measures "common sense" but said police would work to ensure that companies face no disruption next week.
