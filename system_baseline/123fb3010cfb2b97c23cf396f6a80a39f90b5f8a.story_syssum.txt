Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- Authorities in Argentina's Tierra del Fuego province denied entry Monday to two cruise liners that were seeking to dock in the southern port of Ushuaia, in incidents linked to the political dispute over the Falkland Islands.
The ship "was this morning refused permission for its scheduled docking in the Argentinian port of Ushuaia by the local mayor on the grounds that it had visited the Falklands Islands two days before," said CNN contributor Robin Oakley, who was aboard the Adonis as a lecturer.
The law cited was passed last August and refers to ships that carry out "work related to the exploration and exploitation of natural resources, or to military vessels, within the ambit of the basin of the Malvinas Islands on the Argentinean continental platform," Telam reported.
Last month, the Star Princess was denied entry into the Port of Stanley when 74 passengers and crew out of a total of 3,652 had gotten sick after the liner stopped in Ushuaia.
"The policy that the government is carrying out, in reality, is distancing us from the Malvinas instead of getting us nearer," said Jorge Latana, a journalist who has proposed greater cultural integration with the islands' inhabitants.
In Argentina, it is very odd the way one thinks about Malvinas, because the public thinks of it as if no one lived there.
In that sense, the government is speaking out both sides of its mouth.
On one hand it is attacking England through the Malvinas and on the other it is favoring some businesses to exploit minerals.
