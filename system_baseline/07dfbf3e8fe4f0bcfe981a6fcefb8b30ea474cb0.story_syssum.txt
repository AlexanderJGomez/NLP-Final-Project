Smucker Co. wants to assure consumers that its Jif brand of peanut butter is safe to eat.
Smucker Co. have started running ads and offering coupons, trying to lure peanut butter customers as sales have plunged at least 20 percent since the salmonella outbreak.
"We are extremely confident in the safety protocols."
Americans have shied away from peanut butter despite the FDA's assurances that major-label peanut butter in grocery stores is safe.
There's another problem, Powell said: "None of these companies are really coming out and saying this is what we do to ensure safety.
Tainted peanut butter and peanut paste were shipped by Peanut Corporation of America to institutions such as schools, nursing homes and prisons, not to grocery stores.
I think it's prudent to avoid this stuff until we see where this is going," he said.
