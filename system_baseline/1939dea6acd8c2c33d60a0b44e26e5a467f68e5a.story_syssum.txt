The 49-year-old leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party is a former journalist and talk show host, son of a prominent politician, and a one-time amateur boxer with a rep as one of Israel's sexiest men.
Members of Yesh Atid range across the spectrum, Lapid said after the election in Tel Aviv.
Naftali Bennett's far-right Jewish Home pulled in between 11 seats, according to exit polls numbers from the daily newspaper Haaretz.
But in interviews, Lapid has proposed Israel should give up much of the West Bank -- while retaining control of Jersualem.
Yair Lapid is the son of the late politician Tommy Lapid, whose one-time anti-religious party Shinui battled the power and influence of the ultra-Orthodox.
But he used diplomatic language and persuasion in an effort to forge partnerships and policies with religionists.
He represents the ultra-Orthodox, Yesh Atid's website says, Haredim who want to combine Torah study with national/Israel Defense Forces service and participation in the workforce.
In Israel politics, you don't really hear people talking about vision and where we can be and setting our sights high.
Today's Likud appears more hospitable to the far rightist Moshe Feiglin than to centrists like Dan Meridor, denied a safe seat in the Likud primaries," Halevi wrote.
Yet he launched his campaign from the West Bank city of Ariel, sending the message that settlers are part of Israel too.
He is not a hyphenated Israeli, whose loyalty to the state depends on its fulfillment of an ideological agenda.
