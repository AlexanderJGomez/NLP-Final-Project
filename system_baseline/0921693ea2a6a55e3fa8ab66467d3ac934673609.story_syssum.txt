Felipe Massa has been given the all-clear to begin training as he bids to return to the race track.
"After the small surgery, in the next few days I can finally start to go to the gym to get back into shape and drive some tests in karts.
Ferrari said Massa was expected to be at 100 percent fitness in time for the 2010 season, but gave no indication whether he would return to racing this year -- he has, however, indicated that he would like to drive at his home Brazilian Grand Prix on October 18.
Badoer, who stepped into the breach when F1 legend Michael Schumacher was unable to make a shock return to the sport due to a neck problem, was not allowed to test drive the current Ferrari vehicle during the four-week summer break due to this year's regulations.
