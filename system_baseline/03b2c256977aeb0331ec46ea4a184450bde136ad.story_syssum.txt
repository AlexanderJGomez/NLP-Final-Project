The last few years have seen a growing shift in the way men are perceived, under the collective weight of celebrity bad boys, stay-at-home dads, written scholarship on the supposed "end of men," an epidemic of male incarceration, two decade-long wars fought mostly by men and a nascent men's movement that is not about proclaiming male power but male capacity for depth and goodness.
When I interviewed the first victim to come forward in the Catholic sex-abuse scandal in Boston, he legally wasn't talking about rape.
As the victim in Boston told me: "I don't think that people in general realize the long-term effects that it has on people.
Then there is the misperception that men's sex drives are so high that they "must have liked it" when forced to have sex with a woman or even another man.
Without acknowledgement that rape of men exists, there is less help and support for them to overcome the trauma.
It just sheds a stereotype that no longer serves men or women.
For men to be thinking hard about how to be better fathers and husbands can only benefit women, as can the acknowledgment that men are all too often victims of rape.
