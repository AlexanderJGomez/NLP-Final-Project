But nothing, she says, could have prepared her for the excitement she'd feel upon learning her sophomore album, "Epiphany," debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart.
This time around, Michele, whose voice has earned her comparisons to Billie Holiday and Jill Scott, relinquished some songwriting duties to R&B singer Ne-Yo.
The latest epiphany is that I really don't have to be afraid of anybody.
But I found out that there's a lot more lovers out there than I realized, and the world is much smaller than I thought.

Michele: One way is that I didn't write some of the songs.
Ne-Yo is the easiest person to talk to, and he made my experiences come to life with his lyrics.
I went to school, did jazz and there weren't a lot of ladies who sat down and did those jazz things at the keys that she does.
I think that it's a lost art form because kids aren't as exposed to it as maybe they used to be, or should be.
And even in those pranks, the teachers would laugh most of the time.
Michele: What is in my iPod right now on repeat is John Legend's "Evolver."
Those are two that are on my radar.
