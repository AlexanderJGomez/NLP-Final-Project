Chief Petty Officer Terrell Horne was one of two Coast Guard members thrown off their cutter's small boat when the suspect's panga-style vessel "suddenly increased speed and maneuvered directly" at them, then struck the boat, said Capt.
The crew of a Coast Guard patrol aircraft spotted the panga-style boat near Santa Cruz Island, suspecting "it was engaged in illegal activity," said Jenkins, who did not elaborate on the type of activity.
Two people were then detained, the Coast Guard said in a news release, without specifying any charges.
"The Coast Guard, along with its law enforcement partners at the federal, state and local level, are actively working to make sure all of the individuals who are involved with this illegal activity are brought to justice," Jenkins said.
