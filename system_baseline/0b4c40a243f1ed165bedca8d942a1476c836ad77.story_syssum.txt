Despite the close ties -- "she called me mommy and she was my daughter" -- Beauregard was in the dark about Fiore's marriage to Ryan Jenkins.
Interviewed from San Francisco, California, Beauregard told King all she knew about Jenkins was his initial meeting with Fiore.
"She called me the day after and she said: 'Mommy, I met the most perfect guy in the world and -- and his name is Ryan.'
Mike Fleeman, the West Coast editor of People.com, described more details of Fiore's whirlwind courtship with Jenkins to King.

Fleeman told King that Jenkins was arrested and charged with domestic assault against Fiore in Nevada in June and that Jenkins was supposed to go to trial in December.
I knew it was somebody who knew her and [that her killer] wanted to make sure that she was not identified," Brown said.

The brutality of the crime has hit Fiore's circle of friends hard.
"There is no indication that anybody else might be involved," he said.
