The fisherman in Montana became the embodiment of their trip -- Ali and Tariq were embraced nearly everywhere they went, from a Confederate souvenir shop in Georgia to the streets of Las Vegas, Nevada, to the hills of North Dakota where the nation's first mosque was built in 1929.
Like any road trip, there were strange moments along the way: A Mississippi police officer quizzed them about their beliefs on the ground zero mosque and they were asked to leave a mosque in Mobile, Alabama.
He asked if he could hitch a ride to town and the fisherman "happily does it."
He had a similar experience among Bosnian Muslims in Boise, Idaho, where it took 12 years for the community to build a mosque there "with their bare hands."
"It means so much to these people who've been displaced from their own country, and they come here to this place of worship," he said.
He knew little of the town's rich Muslim history, and it was difficult to try to find someone in the town who did.
"I knew our roots went deep in this country, but it was great to truly experience it.
"It was really cool and refreshing to see people who genuinely love the communities they're in and they're there to stay," Ali said.
"And unfortunately in our society, whomever shouts the loudest is going to get the most air time."
