"You have respiratory issues, lung disease, you've got pneumonia, and you've got longer-term issues like cancer and heart disease as well that can result from exposure to indoor air pollution," said Radha Muthiah, executive director of the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves.
TaTedo's stoves are made with clay liners that, along with other simple design features, emit far less smoke and fewer pollutants.
"The charcoal consumption here is less, compared to the traditional one."
While the upfront cost to buy a cookstove is high, the fuel costs are lower because it burns less.
Burning less charcoal or wood means there's less deforestation, something that has caused flooding and other major problems in many countries.
