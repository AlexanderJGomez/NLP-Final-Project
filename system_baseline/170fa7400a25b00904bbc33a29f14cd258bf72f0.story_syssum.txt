According to the account she would later give police, Moore carried her sons to a nearby tree, gripping branches along with her boys as she tried to shelter them from the storm surge.
In desperation, Moore told police she then went to the back of the house, and tried to break in using a flower pot, but was unable to do so.
The man at the door didn't ask to enter the house, he said, but instead asked him to come outside in order to help.
He said he did not know the fate of the children.
Told that their bodies had been found, he said the deaths were a tragedy, but implied that the woman was at fault.
Legal experts consulted by CNN said that no crime would have been committed by a failure to render assistance.
