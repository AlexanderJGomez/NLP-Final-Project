The peloton never threatened to go with the pair and rolled in at their leisure, with Paulinho becoming the first Portuguese stage winner since Acacio Da Silva in 1989.
"It was a close sprint but the most important thing is to win and so this moment, for me and my team, is a good one," Paulinho told the official Tour de France website.
This is the best race in the world and to win one stage in the Tour is the pinnacle of what a cyclist can achieve."
Even if it was quite up and down, there was nothing for me to achieve."
