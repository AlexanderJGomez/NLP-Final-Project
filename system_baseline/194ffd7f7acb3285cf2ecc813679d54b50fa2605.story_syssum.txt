Candidates for the ministries of defense, interior and national security have not been named, though parliamentary speaker Osama al-Nujaifi told his colleagues that al-Maliki promised to submit nominees for those posts in the coming days.
In December, after nearly a year fraught with political infighting, the parliament voted to approve al-Maliki's new government, despite the vacancies.
On Sunday, the parliament failed to hold a vote on three vice presidents under the power-sharing deal after some lawmakers had reservations on a Shiite candidate.
It is too soon to predict whether that will happen or whether the United States and Iraq will negotiate an agreement to keep some U.S. soldiers there after next year.
