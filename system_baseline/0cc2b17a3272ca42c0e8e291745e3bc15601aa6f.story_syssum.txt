The case centers on Perry's June 2013 veto of the $7.5 million budget for the unit run by Lehmberg, after she refused his demand to resign following her drunken driving arrest and conviction.
The second charge alleges that he improperly used the veto threat to get her to resign following her arrest on a drunk driving charge.
Perry defended his actions, pointing to Lehmberg's blood alcohol level at the time of her arrest in April 2013 and then her behavior during her arrest, which was captured on video and made public.
His attorneys could seek to have the charges thrown out, a motion that would delay the case, at the very least.
The governor is scheduled to visit the early primary states of New Hampshire and South Carolina in the coming weeks to meet with Republican activists and legislators.
"Unless he was demonstrably trying to scrap the ethics unit for other than his stated reason, Perry indictment seems pretty sketchy," David Axelrod, President Barack Obama's former top adviser, said in a post on Twitter.
But the Texas Democratic Party called on Perry to resign, saying in a written statement that the governor "brought  dishonor to his office, his family and the state of Texas.
Perry's indictment is the first of a sitting governor in Texas on such charges since 1917 when, according to The Dallas Morning News, James "Pa" Ferguson was indicted for vetoing funding for the University of Texas in an attempt to push out faculty and staff.
