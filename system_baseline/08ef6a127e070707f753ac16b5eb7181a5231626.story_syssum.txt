(CNN) -- With extreme heat and the worst drought in half a century continuing to plague the farm states, there are important lessons to be learned for all of us -- farmers, consumers and the world's poorest populations alike -- about the effect of climate change.
Livestock farmers who use corn to feed their animals could see higher costs, but most have contracts with processors who provide their feed grains.
If you're a shrewd shopper, next year you may notice higher prices for meat, milk, eggs, and cheese and all types of processed foods.
People in rich countries like the U.S. are not going to eat much less or much differently as a result of modestly higher prices.
It is not hard to see that food-related security problems overseas could cost us far more than the extra pennies we'll pay at the grocery store.
The larger and more important issue is whether this year's bad crop yield is an omen of what we should expect going forward.
An atmosphere richer in carbon dioxide concentrations may allow plants to transpire less water during photosynthesis, and thus, improve drought tolerance.
Carbon dioxide concentrations are much higher than they were in 1983 and 1988, when it was nearly as hot as this summer.
For now, we can take a little comfort that ample harvests in the Dakotas, Minnesota and parts of the South could make up for some of the decimated crops in the central Midwest this year.
