As his one-time "Orphans" co-star, Shia LaBeouf, did last winter, Baldwin has given a public statement that he's ready to retire from public life.
There was his conflict with LaBeouf on the set of a Broadway production of "Orphans," the death of his friend James Gandolfini, his angry Twitter exchange with a Daily Mail journalist in which he called the writer a "toxic little queen," and then an altercation with a paparazzo in November that led to a domino effect for more criticism and lost work.
As someone who once relished being out in his home base of New York, where people were generally "very kind" to him, Baldwin says he's now "bitter, defensive, and ... misanthropic" with a distaste for the media that he's never had before.
Presumably to make good use of this "last time," Baldwin goes on to recount in opinionated detail the conflicts he's faced over the past 12 months, lingering on November's altercation in particular.
In the end, that November confrontation appears not only to have cost Baldwin his newly formed talk show at MSNBC but a necessary aspect of his reputation, and particularly in New York.
Then I slid into show business, where you seek only an audience's approval, whether you deserve it or not.
