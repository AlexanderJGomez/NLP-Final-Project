Earlier this week, the city's Department of Public Health announced that 706 infants and 43 health care workers had been exposed to tuberculosis, commonly called TB, at Providence Memorial Hospital.
Parents and other family members of the infants are not being told to get tested because they "are not considered exposed," health officials said in a statement.
"Once in the body, the bacteria usually lay dormant for months or years before they begin to grow and cause a case of active TB," the El Paso Department of Public Health said in a statement.
The bacteria that cause TB spread through the air when an infected patient coughs or sneezes, but it's not a highly contagious disease; close contact over a longer period of time is required before another person becomes infected, according to the Mayo Clinic.
He said CMS is giving the hospital until October 11 to identify policy changes that need to happen to ensure something like this won't happen again.
In October, health officials identified 140 infants who may have been exposed to tuberculosis in a similar incident at a hospital in Nevada.
