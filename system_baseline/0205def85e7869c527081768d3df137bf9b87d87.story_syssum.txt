Chris Christie was joking about donuts and his weight on The Late Show with David Letterman, and the First Lady's weight is once again a subject of discussion in the Washington Post--even though by any objective standard she's in great shape.
Except a study in this week's New England Journal of Medicine shows us that's just not right.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that obesity-related medical costs were almost $150 billion in 2008, and the cost in health related expensed for an average person who was obese was more than $1,400.
But it turns out that making such changes, say by deciding to walk a mile every day for five years, results in far less weight loss than you'd expect.
So imagine my shock to discover that what evidence exists in this new study hints towards ambitious goals being a good thing, and that quicker weight loss isn't less likely to be kept off in the long-term.
But studies show that, on their own, eating more of them without making other behavioral changes doesn't result in any weight loss.
In other words, it's not necessarily bad to snack outside of usual meal times.
But just because so much of what we believe is wrong doesn't mean we still can't do something about the issue.
Now that I look back, if I'm going to be honest about it, I did it in bursts over a few months here and there, each time gaining back less than I had lost.
Each time, I had ambitious goals of 15 pounds or more in two to three months, and each time I really restricted my caloric intake.
I tell you this because more and more, I think that the journey to sustained weight loss is a very personal and individual path.
But one thing I doubt will ever be proved false is that it's much easier not to gain the weight in the first place than to take it off later.
