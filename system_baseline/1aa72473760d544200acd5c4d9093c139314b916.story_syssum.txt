His journey for a new profession led him to Britain, Japan and ultimately back home to Ghana, where he stumbled into his calling after producing a line of herbal cosmetics.
Boateng, who won the Overall Entrepreneur of the Year award bestowed by the Entrepreneurs Foundation of Ghana earlier this year, sat down with CNN to explain how he went from a humble taxi driver to a cosmetics king.
The herbs that we have here have a real potency of curing... and when I started using them too I have realized that I didn't choose the wrong way of curing people.
AB: When I found that my children were growing up, I told [one of my taxi clients] that I had to find something to do so that I would be able to look after my children very well.
I came back with about five buses and started a transport business, but unfortunately for me it was all accidents, one after the other.
AB: I went to the market and bought creams that are manufactured and produced by foreign countries, powders and perfumes, and went around announcing those things for sale and it was really doing very well.
I'm an herbalist, I produce other products but some things, fragrance and petroleum jelly and that sort of stuff.
AB: [As] somebody who started from nowhere,  if I am in this area and being recognized that I am the entrepreneur of the year, obviously, I cherish this the most ... it means they are appreciating what I am doing, so I was very happy.
That is why I'm always passionate even if I did not get the change to educate myself very well.
Whatever dreams that we have, we should think that it's human beings who can do anything in this world.
