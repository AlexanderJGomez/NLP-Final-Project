"As long as it takes," said airline CEO Alan Joyce, when a reporter asked how long the suspension would last.
"I am not sure what actually happened with the debris and why parts of the engine left the aircraft and fell into the ground," Joyce said.
We're going to have to hold for some time whilst we do lighten our load by dumping some fuel and a number of checklist [items] we have to perform.
We're making a left turn now to track back toward Singapore and as we progress with this we'll keep you informed, but at this stage everything is secure, the aircraft is flying safely and we'll get back to you very shortly with further information.
Shortly afterward, debris fell from the plane to the ground, said Trifuadi who, like many Indonesians, goes by one name.
The airline said it will work with the plane's manufacturer as well as Rolls-Royce, the maker of the engine, to determine what went wrong.
Lufthansa, which operates three Airbus A380s, told CNN it is planning to carry out additional precautionary checks on the engines of the planes.
