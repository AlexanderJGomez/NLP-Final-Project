Robin Stearns created a Web site to draw employers' attention to her jobless husband, Michael.
"He's such a great candidate, he would be an asset to any company."
The site features a picture of Robin Stearns holding a sign begging for somebody to employ her husband.
Paul Forster, co-founder and CEO of the job search site Indeed.com, urges candidates to employ measures that separate them from the masses rather than blanketing the job market with resumes.
The site, which has been up for about three days, has brought dozens of e-mails from both employers and other people in a similar situation.
Robin Stearns, who declined to discuss her job because she wants to focus on her husband's job search, says a lot of their friends have been victims of the economy.
