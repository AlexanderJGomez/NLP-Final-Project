Sometimes I wait until dark to go there so no one can see me.
Sandimhia and 1.25 billion other women around the world, find themselves in similar situations every day, where they have no choice but to put themselves at risk of disease, harassment or even violence because they lack access to something as simple as a safe and clean toilet.
In total one and a quarter million men, women and children will die this year from preventable diseases brought about by a lack of access to these basic services.
That is why WaterAid, Unilever and the UN partnership organisation, the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council have produced a new report, We Can't Wait, demonstrating the scale and consequences of this problem.
We have also been banging on the door of governments in both the western and developing world for well over two decades, highlighting the practical steps that could be taken to end this tragedy.
Many governments have made progress towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals that were set in 2000 and are due to achieve many of them by the end of 2015.
Even when this goal is finally reached, one in four people will still not have access to safe sanitation.
World Toilet Day is an opportunity to celebrate the progress that has been made and recognizes how much more needs to be done.
