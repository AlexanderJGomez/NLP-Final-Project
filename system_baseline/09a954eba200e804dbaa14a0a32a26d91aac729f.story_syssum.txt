One day after the Gulf Cooperation Council released a statement urging Yemen President Ali Abdullah Saleh to transfer powers to his vice president, thousands of protestors returned to the streets Monday for marches and opposition leaders are vowing not to back down.
The Embassy of the Republic of Yemen in Washington responded to the GCC initiative on Monday in a statement which  said Saleh has agreed to transfer powers in accordance with the Yemeni Constitution, which means he will not step down from power until his term ends in 2013.
In addition to pushing the transfer of power, the GCC's initiative also called for the formation of a national unity government to be chaired by the opposition.
Yemen's president has promised not to run in the next round of elections.
"We strongly encourage all sides to engage in this urgently needed dialogue to reach a solution supported by the Yemeni people," Mark Toner, spokesman for the U.S. State Department, said Friday.
"We will not be scared to march and make the regime understand that we will not stop until our demands are met," student activist Hareth Abdullah said.
"In the end, I can assure you that we will agree on terms," Osbaa said.
