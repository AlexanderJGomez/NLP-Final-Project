(CNN) -- A pop star wife, an estimated annual salary of $46 million and the most iconic player of this generation -- but to those who know the "real" David Beckham, he is just a "normal guy" and a "devoted dad".
"We used to talk about our kids all the time and he asked me questions and we chatted about schooling and what they were up to.
"It is only for a short time, but it's difficult being away from the children every single day.
Not only has he played in Spain, the United States and Italy, he has also kept up his many business and charity commitments and recently agreed to become a football ambassador for China.
"It was great to have him around and talk, but I've got my family here and that's been so good for me.
But in Beckham, he found somebody to confide in and talk to -- a man completely different to that portrayed in fashion magazines and tabloid newspapers.
It was a bit weird at first, because I'd read so much about him through the press and had my own impression.
Despite his advancing years, Beckham appeared to be in peak condition, showing a level of fitness which would embarrass some of the younger players in the PSG squad.
While Beckham will curtail his time in Paris at the end of the season, Clement hopes to remain to continue his work alongside manager Carlo Ancelotti.
"But it's more important to work with good people."
