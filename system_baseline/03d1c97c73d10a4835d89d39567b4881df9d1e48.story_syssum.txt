Cairo (CNN) -- A documentary filmmaker who followed Osama bin Laden's jihad against the Soviets in the mountains of Afghanistan during the 1980s said he once warned the world's most-wanted terrorist against attacking civilians.
He produced three documentaries and five books about the war in Afghanistan, but his film "Arab Supporters in Afghanistan" remains his favorite piece of work because it featured bin Laden's first appearance on video.
Stores were selling 20 copies at a time and sometimes in the hundreds as I learned when I contacted them anonymously inquiring about the sales.
"I watched him personally monitor bin Laden's consistent low blood pressure and give him the required medicine many times on the battlefield," said Daraz.
"He drove me to the airport, and I sadly returned to Egypt in the winter of 1991 wondering if I would ever see him again," said Daraz.
Bin Laden had claimed responsibility for the attacks in 2004 after years of denial.
The release of the photos would have provoked people who already disagree with the way he was killed and the disposal of the body at sea, even if those people did not support bin Laden's views."
