CNN World Sport looks back at the lessons learned in testing -- and forward to what lies ahead as F1 embraces one of the biggest rule changes in the history of the sport.
The drivers will have to manage their car's fuel consumption, and that's a race craft some may have to learn.
For example, last season many teams, and especially four-time champion Red Bull, eked out extra speed by using the exhaust gases to increase downforce at the rear of the car.
"I'm not calling us favorites -- for that we haven't done enough laps and the speed is not there compared to some other teams."
He also told reporters in Bahrain: "Once they get the engine sorted ... as always, they'll be very hard to beat."
"The goal is to win the championship, and this year I'm more pumped than ever," said Hamilton, who is also rumored to have rekindled his romance with singer Nicole Scherzinger over the winter break.
The team's Finnish driver Valtteri Bottas summed up the team's excitement, saying on Twitter: "Think we are well prepared and made the most out of testing.
"There will be some long days and nights before the first race," warned Lotus head of trackside operations Alan Permane.
He may not be a rookie, but Australian Daniel Ricciardo will come under increased scrutiny in 2014 as he steps up from Toro Rosso to replace Mark Webber as Vettel's teammate at Red Bull.
The seven-time world champion remains in hospital more than two months after he sustained a serious head injury in a skiing accident.
As well as double points, there is double jeopardy for the racers who, just like regular road users, will be slapped with penalty points on their Super License for bad driving -- 12 or more points and they will receive a one-race ban.
After three winter tests, Red Bull is on the back foot; Mercedes and Williams may be favorites, but just who will win in Australia remains, as always, a race into the unknown.
