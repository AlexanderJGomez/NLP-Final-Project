The Queen has managed to "stay above politics" for more than 60 years -- and with Scotland voting on independence Thursday she's not about to upset things now.
This is a rare moment of candor for someone who's well aware that anything she says to a member of the public has the potential to be picked up by reporters, who she also knows have the referendum at the forefront of their minds.
The Queen has come under pressure from some politicians to step into the debate but that idea was given short shrift.
If she involves herself in policy then she risks alienating people and parliamentarians who could ultimately de-throne her and bring in a president.
The frontman of the pro-independence campaign, Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, says he looks forward to the Queen remaining as "Queen of Scots" in an independent Scotland.
Scotland isn't some breakaway outpost of the British Empire; it's home turf which has remained uncontested since the Renaissance.
Perhaps this Jubilee is a time to remind ourselves of the benefits which union has conferred, at home and in our international dealings, on the inhabitants of all parts of the United Kingdom."
It's personal and professional for her.
