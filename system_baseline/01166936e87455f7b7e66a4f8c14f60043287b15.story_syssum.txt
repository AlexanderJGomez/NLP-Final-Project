(CNN) -- Lady Gaga may have to disappoint a lot of her "little monsters" in Indonesia after Jakarta police recommended that her sold-out June 3 show not be issued a permit because of security concerns.
The report said that Indonesian Council of Ulema chairman Cholil Ridwan was urging Muslims not to attend the overtly sexy and controversial singer's upcoming concert in Jakarta.
Yoon Jung-hoon, a reverend who helped organize the "Civilians Network against the Lady Gaga Concert" movement, told the Chicago Tribune that his group collected 5,000 supporters on Facebook.
"Some people can accept this as another culture, but its impact is huge beyond art and debases religions," Yoon said.
