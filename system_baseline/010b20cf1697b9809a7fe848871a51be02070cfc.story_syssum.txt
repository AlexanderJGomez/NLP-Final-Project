Sean Murphy was charged with rape after an incident that happened in front of a large crowd on the lawn of the Xfinity Center, an outdoor amphitheater in Mansfield, Massachusetts, on July 26.
"Mr. Murphy deeply regrets this incident and I am sure the young woman does as well.
"In total, fire and EMS attended to 46 medicals resulting in 22 transports mostly alcohol-related," Mansfield Police Chief Ron Sellon and Fire Chief Neal Boldrighini said in a joint statement.
"Police dealt with a steady stream of intoxicated persons as well, resulting in over 50 people being taken into protective custody and a number of others arrested for alcohol-related issues."
