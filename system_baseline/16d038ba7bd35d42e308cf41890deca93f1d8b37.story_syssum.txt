Dunham, who had a second heart attack in 2002, wore red Friday to spread awareness about heart disease.
The National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, promoted the red clothing day to spread the message that "Heart Disease Doesn't Care What You Wear -- It's the #1 Killer of Women," according to its Web site.
Besides wearing red herself, she goes to heart events and takes pictures of them for a local Web site.
For her sons, 9 and 12, she monitors their diet closely, but fears that she will die while they are young.
"If everyone is wearing red at the same time, somebody is going to notice," she said.
Despite the nationwide movement, Dunham said she hadn't noticed anyone else in her town of Earlimart, California, wearing red on Friday.
