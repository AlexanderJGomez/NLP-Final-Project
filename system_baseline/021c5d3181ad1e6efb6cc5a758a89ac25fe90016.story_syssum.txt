(CNN) -- She's got nerves of steel, golf talent beyond her tender years, and a precocious flair for eye-catching fashion: 11-year-old Lucy Li, the youngest qualifier in U.S. Women's Open history, looked entirely at home as she teed-off at Pinehurst No.
But the California native can also count growing experience in her time at Pinehurst, not least how to deal with the perilous course -- which hosted the men's U.S. Open last week.
Tour pros had raised doubts about whether the child amateur -- still wearing braces and standing on a box to address the media after her opening round -- should be subjected to the pressure and expectation of such a big professional event.
"She is so mature for her age," said 23-year-old Jessica Wallace, who played with Li and Catherine O'Donnell -- the latter also shot 78.
She beats fellow American Lexi Thompson, who qualified for the 2007 Open aged 12, to become the youngest qualifier.
And there wasn't a fairytale end for Li -- she missed the weekend rounds after carding another 78 on Friday, laced with more highs and lows as she tied for 120th in the 154-player field.
The 24-year-old Wie also came to prominence at a young age but is still seeking her first major title.
She birdied the last two holes to move clear of 19-year-old Thompson, who at 16 was the youngest winner of an LPGA event until that record was taken by Lydia Ko in 2012.
