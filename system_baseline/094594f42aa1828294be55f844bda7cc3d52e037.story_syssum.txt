(CNN) -- One phone call brought the 41-year-old memory back to George Hopkins instantly, flooding him with the terror of having a .38-caliber pistol jabbed into his face.
"The guy comes to the cockpit and he's got a knife.
And he sticks a .38 right in my nose, right between my eyes, and I could tell it was loaded because I see the bullets around the cylinder.
With the plane now heading to Cuba, the hijacker lowered his gun.
The hijackers left the plane after it landed, but Cuban authorities held Hopkins and the rest of the crew on board for about six hours before they were allowed to fly back to the United States.
On Sunday, 66-year-old hijacking suspect Pena Soltren surrendered to federal authorities at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport, the same airport from which Hopkins' flight was commandeered.
This is the first time I've even said anything about it for five to 10 years.
Your mind is able to flush things once in awhile, until something happens and then you recall it."
