Phnom Penh, Cambodia (CNN) -- The opposition party in Cambodia has rejected the results of the country's national election, which handed another win to long-serving Prime Minister Hun Sen.
Once the committee issues its findings, political leaders from both sides will find ways to "redress the injustice done to the Cambodian people whose will has been distorted for too long," he said.
The national election committee said it worked hard to ensure the election was far.
"In preparing for the election this year, we started in the middle of 2012," said Tep Nytha, the secretary general of the committee, ahead of the balloting.
