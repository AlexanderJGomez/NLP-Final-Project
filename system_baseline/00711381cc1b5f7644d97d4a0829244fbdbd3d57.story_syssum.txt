A passenger's photo shows oxygen masks hanging from the ceiling on Monday's Continental Flight 128.
But it's also the leading cause of airline passenger injuries that are not associated with a fatal crash, experts say.
In the case of Monday's Continental Flight 128, an unexpected blast of air led to much more than jangled nerves, bumps and bruises.
"Very rarely does it hurt passengers, which is odd because a lot of them don't keep their seat belts on."
At least two of those deaths involved passengers who reportedly were not wearing seat belts while the seat-belt sign was on.
During that same time period, 184 attendants were seriously injured, despite their numbers being far smaller than the number of passengers.
While pilots are always on the lookout for regular turbulence spots -- like mountain ranges and places where weather fronts are converging -- clear-air turbulence can happen anywhere.
The Commercial Aviation Safety Team has focused on seat-belt awareness and pushed for better communication systems for reporting turbulence, Dorr said.
All licensed pilots also receive "upset training," which teaches how to deal with extreme turbulence, he said.
