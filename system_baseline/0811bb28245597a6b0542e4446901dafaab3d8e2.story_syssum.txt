But Iraq's black population hopes that Barack Obama's rise to the White House will mark a turning point for minorities not just in the United States, but also in their country.
"We told our people, Inshalla, God willing, Obama is going to win, and if he wins, it will be a victory for all black people in the world," he recalls.
When news broke that Obama had won the election, it was early in the morning of November 5 in Basra -- but Thijeel excitedly called a fellow member of his political party.
It's impossible to verify Thijeel's estimate, since the government does not keep statistics on race, but there is no denying there are many black Iraqis in the southern city of Basra.
Many white Iraqis claim the word isn't meant to offend, but Thijeel says they have no idea how hurtful it is.
This is key, because power in Iraq is apportioned along ethnic, religious and even tribal lines.
Awad Al-Abdan of the National Dialogue Front says, "There's been social oppression for a long time.
"Obama won, and not that long ago, in his country, black people were marginalized, so this event has shattered all barriers."
