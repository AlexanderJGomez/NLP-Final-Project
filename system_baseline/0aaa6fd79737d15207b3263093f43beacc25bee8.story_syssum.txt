The double-decker freeway had collapsed, pinning motorists in their cars.
I'm alive, just my left foot is stuck under the car.
Each aftershock lowered the upper deck, bringing it closer to crushing Otto and Frediani.
The quake caused $10 billion in damage, ultimately inspiring California and the rest of the region to re-examine their safety measures for earthquakes.
With ultra-accurate GPS, Madin says scientists know that the collision is still going on because they can measure the movement.
Madin was one of the authors of the Oregon Resilience Plan, which is aimed at reducing risk and improving recovery for the next Cascadia earthquake and tsunami.
It is these factors that led the Oregon Resilience Plan to conclude that in a worst-case scenario, 10,000 people could be killed, and large areas of Oregon could be without transportation, electricity, water and sewer for several months to several years.
Based on the study of geologic features that record prehistoric earthquakes, scientists generally agree that there have been 42 megaquakes along the Cascadia fault in the last 10,000 years, with the most recent in January 1700.
Even if there is still plenty of time before the next big quake, much work has to be done to make sure Oregon is ready.
Following on the release of the Oregon Resilience Plan, the Oregon Legislature established a task force to come up with specific recommendations for action for the 2015 legislative session.
