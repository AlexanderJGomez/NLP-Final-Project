In his teen years he was a session pianist on Shadow Morton-produced records (including, allegedly, the Shangri-Las' "Leader of the Pack"), but failed with his groups, including a heavy-metal duo.
Making 1976's "Turnstiles," he fired producer James William Guercio -- a consistent hitmaker with Chicago -- and took the helm himself, with uneven results.
And then there was a series of concerts at New York's Carnegie Hall in early June 1977, featured on the new anniversary edition of "The Stranger" (Columbia/Legacy), out Tuesday.
"The Stranger" established Joel as a best-selling artist -- reportedly, upon release, it was the biggest-selling Columbia album in history -- and propelled him to his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame career.
"I didn't know this at the time, but had it not been a successful album, the label probably would have dropped me.
Ramone, known for his graceful touch in the studio, was coming off Paul Simon's "Still Crazy After All These Years" and the Barbra Streisand "A Star Is Born" soundtrack.
It was an accident that Ramone ended up included in the group portrait on the album's back cover, dressed in New York Yankee regalia -- "I only posed because I thought, 'They'll never use this,' " he says.
The singer had a tendency to hide behind his song's characters; Ramone urged him to put more of himself into the vocals in "The Stranger," and continued the advice for succeeding albums.
Moreover, Ramone's suggestions for the song met with resistance: Drummer Liberty DeVitto rebelled against the Brazilian baion beat, and the band was unhappy when Ramone tapped jazzman Phil Woods to play the alto sax solo.
The song got a big boost when Joel appeared as the musical guest on "Saturday Night Live" in February 1978 and eventually won Grammys for song and record of the year.
Joel, who will play the final two concerts at New York's soon-to-be-closed Shea Stadium July 16 and 18, has long since put the questions of "potential" to rest.
