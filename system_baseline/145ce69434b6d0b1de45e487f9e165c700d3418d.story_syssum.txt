Fourteen people were killed when the plane slammed into a cemetery March 22 in Butte, and investigators immediately began focusing on why the pilot asked to divert the flight from Bozeman, Montana, to Butte, 80 miles to the west.
The report said that at 2:27 p.m., controllers asked the pilot whether he had the airport in sight and "the pilot indicated he had one more cloud to maneuver around."
"Initial reports from ground witnesses indicate that the airplane was flying approximately 300 feet above ground level in a north-northwesterly direction.
Although there is no air traffic control tower at Butte, the local fixed base operator lineman was monitoring the radio as the airplane approached the airport.
The preliminary NTSB report said "visual meteorological conditions prevailed" at both Bozeman and Butte.
