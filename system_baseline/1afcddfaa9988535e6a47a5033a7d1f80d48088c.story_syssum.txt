Nowsch, 19, faces three felony charges: murder, attempted murder and unlawful discharge of a gun from a vehicle.
Robert Meyers said his wife tried to help Nowsch.
Chris Tomaino told reporters that he owned registered firearms but wouldn't say how many guns or what type of weapons they were.
Police have said the shooting followed a road-rage incident that took place last week near a junior high school where Meyers gave her 15-year-old daughter a night-time driving lesson.
Steiber said Meyers then went looking for the road rage suspect, but, according to her husband, she just wanted to keep the situation away from the house.
Tammy Meyers fled home and told her son to take cover as she parked in front of the house.
Meyers' son told police that they were fired upon, and he defended him and his mother.
During a standoff at Nowsch's house earlier Thursday, Robert Meyers chastised reporters, whom he felt were placing blame on his loved ones.
He wouldn't say whether that person was the suspect depicted in a drawing handed out by police.
