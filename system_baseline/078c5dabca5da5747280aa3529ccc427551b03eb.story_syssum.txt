(EW.com) -- Tom Cruise rang in the New Year smiling, as "Mission: Impossible -- Ghost Protocol" led the box office with an estimated $31.3 million over the three-day (Friday to Sunday) weekend.
The sequel has taken in $132.1 million in 17 days.
"Shadows," on the other hand, debuted on the (typically slow) weekend before Christmas, and is just now benefiting from a post-Christmas bump.
In the same time frame, the 2007 original had grossed $141.4 million and its 2009 sequel had amassed $165.4 million.
Finally, in fifth, was David Fincher's "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo," which rose 28 percent for $16.3 million.
The $90 million adaptation of Stieg Larsson's bestselling novel has so far grossed a decent but somewhat disappointing $57.1 million in 12 days.
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows -- $22.1 mil
