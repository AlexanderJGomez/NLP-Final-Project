A nurse who had worn protective gear during her "extensive contact" at a Dallas hospital with an Ebola patient who died tested positive during a preliminary blood test, officials said Sunday.
She was involved in Duncan's care after he was placed in isolation -- his second trip to the hospital after coming to the United States from Liberia --  said Dr. Tom Frieden, the director of the CDC.
The hazardous materials unit of the Dallas Fire Department has cleaned up and decontaminated the public areas of the health worker's apartment complex, Mayor Mike Rawlings said.
Hazardous materials units have also cleaned out the nurse's car and will work on her apartment Sunday.
"We knew a second case could be a reality, and we've been preparing for this possibility,"  Dr. David Lakey, commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services, said in a statement Sunday morning.
"I think we've always expected that there may be another individual who will come down with the Ebola from the transmission of this one particular person, and we always felt that it was going to likely be one of his close contacts or one of the health care workers, because that's the way this virus works," Dr. Frank Esper said.
The World Health Organization estimates more than 8,300 people have contracted Ebola during this year's outbreak.
The World Health Organization estimates at least 416 health care workers have contracted Ebola, and at least 233 have died.
For weeks, health officials have been monitoring those who had contact with Duncan before he was hospitalized and isolated.
Because Ebola's incubation period can last up to 21 days, the health nurse's contacts will have to be monitored for three weeks.
"Keeping track of large numbers of people, taking their temperature twice a day, making sure they don't ... leave town, all of that is a lot of work."
