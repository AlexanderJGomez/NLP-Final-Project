(CNN) -- The BBC is embroiled in a scandal that one of its veteran correspondents has called its worst crisis in nearly 50 years -- over its response to allegations that have turned a beloved on-air personality into one of the most reviled figures in the UK.
He was buried with customary glitz in a gold-colored coffin and with a green beret presented to him by the Royal Marines -- but his life began amid much humbler surroundings.
"If you look at the athletics of it," he told the newspaper, "I've done over 300 professional bike races, 212 marathons and 107 pro fights."
Cycling Weekly reported last year that he also had been a semi-professional cyclist and competed as Oscar 'The Duke' Savile in the 1951 Tour of Britain, and supported cycling charities most of his life.
It also began a 30-year TV career that was a showcase for his extravagant dress, yodels and catchphrases like "Now then, now then, and "How's about that then."
He also promoted the national rail network in a campaign dubbed "This is the age of the train."
In 1988 Savile was appointed to a senior role at Broadmoor Hospital -- a high security psychiatric hospital in England that treats some of the most dangerous men in the country -- a role that is now being investigated by the UK's Department of Health.
Dominic Sandbrook, author of a series of histories of modern Britain, told CNN: "Because he was associated with the BBC, people trusted him and thought of him as a family-friendly face.
In a documentary made in 2000 he interviewed Savile in a flat where his mother had lived but still kept her clothing hanging in the wardrobe 27 years after her death.
In the same program he also revealed that he only took a single pair of underpants with him when he went away and washed them in the sink every night.
