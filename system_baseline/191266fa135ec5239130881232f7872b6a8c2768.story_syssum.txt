(CNN) -- Fernando Alonso insists he is not thinking about the prospect of his Red Bull rivals Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel combining to deprive him of a third Formula One world title this weekend.
Vettel would not be drawn on whether he is planning to support his colleague during Sunday's race, but he did admit he was keen to avoid a repeat of this year's Turkish Grand Prix where he and Webber crashed while battling for position.
"We have had some occasions this year where we got close and it didn't look too good, so I think the main target is not to repeat that, and the rest we will see.
"They have got generally faster cars than me but that doesn't mean that we cannot fight for a win.
