Today, its case is broken, littered with black fingerprint dust.
By reaching into the specially designed display case, more than 6 million people have touched the 74.85-ounce bar, valued at more than $550,000.
"That's why these crimes don't make a whole lot of money for the criminals," said Robert Wittman, a former FBI agent who once headed the FBI's Art Crime Team.
Then, after a security guard left this part of the museum, a man can be seen reaching into the case housing the gold bar and placing the little piece of history into his pocket before exiting the museum.
Fisher and his team had been searching for the Nuestra Senora de Atocha and instead found the sister ship, the Santa Margarita.
The stolen bar is one of dozens of gold and silver bars retrieved from the bottom of the sea.
Wittman, the former FBI agent and author of "Priceless: How I Went Undercover to Rescue the World's Stolen Treasures," said the market is incredibly small for these high-profile objects.
Ten, 15, sometimes 20 years, because the thieves couldn't get rid of them," he said.
"They don't buy stolen property, because ... they can't show it, they can't enjoy it.
Police said they remain hopeful they will solve the crime but just hope they can recover this golden piece of history.
