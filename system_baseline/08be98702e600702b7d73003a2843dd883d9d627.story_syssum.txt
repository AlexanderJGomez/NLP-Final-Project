Windsor, England (CNN) -- The choice of Westminster Abbey as location for the most eagerly awaited royal wedding in 30 years has taken most royal experts by surprise; their consensus of opinion over the past week suggested that St. Paul's would oversee the marriage of Prince William and Catherine Middleton.
Edward was too ill to attend the abbey's opening ceremony and rounded off a particularly miserable Christmas by dying a few days later on January 5 in the fateful year of 1066, the year of the Norman conquest (he is the first monarch to be buried there).
(Even today, some 12 years after the event, the harrowing image of Diana's coffin being carried into the abbey, draped in the royal standard and covered in lilies, reduces many to tears.)
William and Kate are now the golden couple of a very modern monarchy, and it is predominantly because of the influence of his parents (and some help from the queen) that Britain's future king has embraced this position with such maturity.
The monarchy today is a vastly different institution from the one Diana joined all those years ago.
Some may scoff, but it is interesting how fast the front pages of the world's newspapers and the schedules of the news channels were cleared once the official announcement was made last week; proving yet again that the House of Windsor is the longest-running, and best-loved, news story of them all.
