"There are limits to the amount of time and effort that the United States can spend if the parties themselves are unwilling to take constructive steps in order to be able to move forward," Kerry said.
But as time rolled by with little progress, Kerry sought to get Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to agree to a framework, which would form the basis for a comprehensive peace treaty.
With the deadline set to expire on April 29, Kerry and his aides have struggled to get the parties to extend the talks, even putting the potential release of Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard on the table to secure the Palestinian prisoner release.
While Kerry isn't ready to pull the plug entirely, he said the United States would "evaluate what is possible and what is not possible," suggesting Washington may recalibrate its role as broker of the peace process as a result.
