The project, known as Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission (MAVEN), aims to put a spacecraft in orbit around the Red Planet to study how it lost much of its atmosphere and became a desolate world.
Large parts of the U.S. government began shutting down early Tuesday, and there is so far little sign of a solution to the political crisis that caused the stoppages.
When the shutdown started to become a real prospect, MAVEN scientists began talking to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland in the hope that their project would be exempt, Jakosky said.
The next window, if they are forced to launch, would put the spacecraft's arrival at solar minimum."
