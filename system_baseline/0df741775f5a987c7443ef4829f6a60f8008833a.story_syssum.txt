During his afternoon show on WOR NewsTalk Radio 710 in New York, he and Isabel Macdonald, author of The Nation piece, debated what he should have done to ensure the workers were in the United States legally.
Dobbs, who called the article a "hit piece," countered that he had no legal right to do so.
He defended the hiring of those working at the stables.
In the article posted Wednesday on The Nation's website and headlined "Lou Dobbs, American Hypocrite," the leftist political magazine reports that Dobbs hired contractors who used illegal immigrants for landscaping work and caring for horses ridden by his daughter, Hillary Dobbs, a champion show jumper.
Dobbs has a history of making critical comments about the high number of illegal immigrants and the way they are treated.
And we're sitting here talking about more of the same, allowing people to be exploited in this country."
The man held the job for more than two years without legal documentation, the article says, adding that he then obtained a guest-worker visa, designed for seasonal foreign workers.
"You put out an article that is being used by the left-wing press as a hammer on me," Dobbs told Macdonald.
"Even Lou Dobbs, the emblem of this get-tough approach on immigration enforcement, even he has been unable to manage his property [so that] there will be no undocumented workers," Macdonald said.
He also said the article omitted the fact that he is seeking a compromise on immigration issues.
