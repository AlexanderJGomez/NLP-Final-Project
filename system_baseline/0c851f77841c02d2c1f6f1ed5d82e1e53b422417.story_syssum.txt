The justices, however, found problems in how the law threatens to remove Medicaid funding -- the government's health coverage for the poor -- from states that don't participate in an expansion of eligibility.
The law does promise better care and better health for America -- at a cost.
Had the health care law been struck down by the high court, those without insurance would have grown by millions, researchers at the Urban Institute said.
In the best case, the number grows to 53.1 million in 2014 and 57 million in 2019," the researchers wrote.
Both keep down costs by increasing the size of the insured pool and spreading out the risk.
In theory, though, the exchanges will give small firms the ability to buy insurance at rates once belonging to large companies.
Despite his pledge to repeal the law, if elected, Romney has promised to continue some of the law's consumer protections, such as the ban on preventing care based on pre-existing conditions.
He said Thursday that the principle upheld by the high court's ruling is that no American should go bankrupt because of illness.
