Demonstrators demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra began their latest round of rallies -- dubbed the "Bangkok shutdown" -- in the capital Monday.
Outbreaks of violence have flared around the protests this week.
On Tuesday night, authorities reported the nonfatal shooting of two protesters, bus burnings, an assault on police officers and an explosive device being thrown at an opposition leader's house.
The protests this week caused some disruption in central Bangkok, but large areas of the sprawling capital city remain unaffected.
In a bid to resolve the current crisis, Yingluck dissolved the nation's parliament last month and called for new elections to be held on February 2.
The recent protests in Bangkok were prompted by a botched attempt by Yingluck's government to pass an amnesty bill that would have opened the door for her brother's return.
His supporters, known as "red shirts," support the holding of elections on February 2.
