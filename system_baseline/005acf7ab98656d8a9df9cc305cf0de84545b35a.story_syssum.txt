LONDON, England (CNN) -- London commuters crammed onto buses, scrambled for taxis, cycled or simply walked on Wednesday as a strike by Tube workers shut down most of the subway network.
The RMT trade union called the strike after talks with management over pay, job cuts, and disciplinary issues broke down.
While most services on the Tube were shut because of the strike, one line -- the Northern line -- was running normally and five others were running on a reduced schedule, TfL said.
"I think we'd all like to strike for more money, but unfortunately we can't," said one woman at Oxford Circus, where the Tube is closed.
He said he had just walked from Liverpool Street Station, a train station as well as a Tube stop that is more than 2.5 miles away.
