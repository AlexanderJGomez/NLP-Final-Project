Cobb appeared on "The Trisha Show" and discussed his plans to create an all-white town for white supremacists in Leith, North Dakota.
When Cobb received the DNA results, he wrote it off.
That history is what created the "one-drop rule" in America: a legal classification that held that anyone with as little as "one drop" of African or black ancestry was to be categorized as black and treated accordingly.
But this simple social order soon became complicated by miscegenation; and with the rampant increase in racial mixing, the lines between white and black, free and enslaved, became more and more blurred.
The rhetoric of white supremacy not only argued that the races were distinctly different, but also that the black race specifically was inferior, therefore justifying enslavement.
A 2002 study of racial admixture conducted by Penn State University molecular anthropologist Mark Shriver showed that among those who self-identify as white, upward of 30% have at least 2.3% African ancestry -- the equivalent of having had three black ancestors somewhere within the previous five generations of their family.
DNA testing also reveals that somewhere around 60% of black Americans have white ancestry, Shriver's study found.
So, while I was thoroughly amused by the sight of Craig Cobb's face when he learned that he, too, is "of African descent," I am clear that those DNA test results do not magically make him black; no number of drops ever could.
