Maryland thrift store manager Marilyn Seitz says the new rules have the potential to put the store out of business.
After a wave of highly publicized tainted-toy recalls last year, Congress passed the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act.
Now Seitz is going to throw away or give away her entire inventory of children's items, fearing this latest attempt at protecting kids will force the Pennyworth Thrift Store and thousands of others out of business.
"This has gotten so serious, and it is so frightening, because we serve consumers that sometimes have no other way to clothe their children," Meyer said.
"What we've been trying to do is to point out categories that we feel and our scientists feel that are safe, that really are almost practically lead-free," Martyak said.
The CPSC is allowing manufacturers an extra year to comply with the product-testing requirements, but it can't offer a reprieve for selling restricted products under the new rules.
Congress has the sole power to change the implementation timeline set in the law.
