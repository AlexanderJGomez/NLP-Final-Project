The driver and four members of the bachelorette party got out, but the bride -- identified by a relative as 31-year-old Neriza Fojas -- and four others died in the burning limo Saturday night, the California Highway Patrol said.
Guzman said the survivors appeared to be in a state of shock on the shoulder of the roadway, with three of them crying.
The Fresno woman was slated to be married in June, and she and her friends had hired the Lincoln for her bachelorette party, Nicolas said.
"LimoStop Inc. will do everything possible to investigate and assist authorities in determining the cause of this fire in order to help bring forth answers and provide closure to the victims and their families," it said.
Medical examiners may need up to two days to identify the remains, San Mateo County Deputy Coroner Roger Fielding said.
