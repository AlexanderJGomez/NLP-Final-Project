Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected an appeal from a North Carolina county that had regularly opened its public meetings with Christian prayers.
A federal appeals court last year found the prayers to be an unconstitutional violation of the Constitution's Establishment Clause, which forbids any government endorsement of one religion over another.
The high court also turned aside a pair of student speech cases involving off-campus activity in the digital age.
Court records show the posting was widely circulated at the school among students and faculty, and the principal eventually suspended the girl for 10 days.
Free speech advocates and national school coalitions separately urged the high court to intervene and resolve the conflicting rulings, but the justices gave no reason for their decision to stay out, at least in these disputes.
But school administrators do retain the authority to restrict any activity that would cause a "substantial disruption" of the school's educational mission.
