(CNN) -- South Carolina authorities say a convicted sex offender held a woman against her will for three months, repeatedly beating and raping her during the captivity.
The arrest warrant alleges that Rawl, who is also 52, confined his victim to a bedroom that he kept under surveillance and barricaded shut.
Authorities said she was able to escape Tuesday when she persuaded Rawl to take her to a medical exam -- but not before one final act of cruelty.
WIS reports that his next court date is scheduled for December 19.
