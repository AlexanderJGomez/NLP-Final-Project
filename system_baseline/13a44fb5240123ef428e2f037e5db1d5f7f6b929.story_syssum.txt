In the months leading to passage, we heard cries of rationing, death panels and blatant mischaracterization of what is in the bill.
Moreover, a recent Associated Press poll found that a quarter of Americans believe incorrectly that the law designated a panel of government bureaucrats to make decisions about health care for individuals.
The confusion and apathy surrounding the health care reform law leaves ample opportunity for others to mischaracterize and foster doubt, energizing and exciting the repeal platform.
Last week, the Senate voted on two amendments regarding the 1099 provision in the Affordable Care Act introduced by two senators, one by Sen. Mike Johanns, a Republican from Nebraska, and another by Sen. Bill Nelson, a Democrat from Florida.
But more importantly, a repeal of health care reform, followed by a replacement with a more modest set of changes, is tantamount to leaving millions of patients in a state of free fall, with no net to catch them.
Health reform starts at birth -- health plans will no longer be able to refuse to cover children younger than 19 simply because they were born with a medical condition.
Together this all adds up to more patient protections than we have ever had, and this is just the beginning.
The pathway from here to there is long and filled with many speed bumps, but information, transparency and advocacy are our best friends.
As Americans we need to send a strong signal to Republican and Democratic leaders that repeal and replace is not an option.
