Michael Sam, an All-American defensive lineman from the University of Missouri, publicly revealed that he's gay Sunday, creating the possibility he'll be the first openly gay player drafted by the National Football League.
Sam also spoke about his sexual orientation Sunday to The New York Times, saying: "I just want to make sure I could tell my story the way I want to tell it.
With those credentials, he's expected to be picked in the NFL draft in May.
His agent said Monday that he does not think Sam's decision to acknowledge his sexual orientation will hurt his draft prospects.
However, the NFL has made headlines on the issue of sexual orientation in the past.
Sam issued his own Tweet: "I want to thank everybody for their support and encouragement, especially @espn, @nytimes and @nfl.
GLAAD, a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender media advocacy group, said Sam is  "the latest high-profile athlete to come out as LGBT.
Michael is a great example of just how important it is to be respectful of others, he's taught a lot of people here first-hand that it doesn't matter what your background is, or your personal orientation, we're all on the same team and we all support each other."
