Meanwhile, a video obtained by CNN casts doubt on the Border Patrol agent's claim that he was surrounded by rock-throwing suspected illegal immigrants when he fatally shot the boy on the border at Ciudad Juarez.
The video shows part of the buildup before the incident, with several individuals running underneath the Puente Negro, a railroad span that connects the two countries.
Seconds later, two gunshots can be heard on the video.
After the shooting, another suspect is seen running in the upper left side of screen away from the incident.
She had said: "This agent, who had the second subject detained on the ground, gave verbal commands to the remaining subjects to stop and retreat.
"He did not have the physical size to threaten anyone.
His secondary school even sent him on an academic trip because of his good grades," Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz said.
Reports that the Mexican military may have drawn weapons on U.S. Border Patrol agents, which surfaced earlier Wednesday, could not be immediately confirmed.
Peaceful protests against the U.S. Border Patrol were held in Juarez on Wednesday, near the site of the fatal shooting.
The shooting comes less than two weeks after the May 31 death of a Mexican illegal immigrant who had been detained three days earlier by border agents in California.
Earlier, Qualia, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman, said he could not comment because he does not know where the Mexican government obtained its statistics.
