The body of Cher Hughes, a native of suburban St. Louis, Missouri, was found Tuesday on the property of William Adolfo Cortez Reese, who is suspected in her death, said Javier Carrillo, director of the national police investigation unit.
He said Panamanian authorities are attempting to reach police in Holland.
Werle said he was on Cortez's property, a massive piece of farmland on the island of Isla Colon in the western province of Boca del Toro, as police executed a search warrant.
Hughes had lived in St. Petersburg, Florida, where she owned a neon sign business, before moving to Panama, Cooney said.
