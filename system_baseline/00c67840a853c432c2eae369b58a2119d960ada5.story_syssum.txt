Dressage, which involves horse and rider working together to produce a complex "dance" routine marked by judges, is how Kauto Star has been spending retirement since his last National Hunt race in 2012.
"He needed to soften his whole body -- he was just used to going in a straight line.
The hardest thing for him was the canter -- he only really knew about going fast."
Britain has one of the world's leading dressage teams and no matter his racing pedigree, there simply isn't the time to bring him up to the required standard.
Instead, dressage is seen as a way to offer the horse an interesting retirement -- although that wasn't met with universal approval when the decision was made, two years ago.
