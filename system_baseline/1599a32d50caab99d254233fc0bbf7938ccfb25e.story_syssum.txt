The German, who retired from the elite motorsport for the second time in 2012, fell and hit his head on a rock Sunday, said the director of the Meribel resort where Schumacher was skiing.
Schumacher was in a coma when he arrived at the hospital and required immediate brain surgery, officials said.
Rescuers reached him minutes later, and he was airlifted to a nearby hospital, the director said.
Former French Formula 1 driver Olivier Panis visited the hospital in Grenoble on Sunday but was not able to see Schumacher, CNN affiliate BFM TV reported.
In that period of temporary retirement, he was involved in a motorcycle crash in Spain in 2009 that left him with a lingering neck injury, which delayed his racing comeback.
"If you are anything less than a really experienced skier, it's very easy to lose your bearings, because you don't see much in the way of vegetation around you or anything else," said Paul Hochman, a former contributing editor at SKI Magazine.
There is no gene in their body that lets them go slow," Garside said.
That meant he wanted to make sure he understood the slopes, the cambers, even though it was only a fun race."
