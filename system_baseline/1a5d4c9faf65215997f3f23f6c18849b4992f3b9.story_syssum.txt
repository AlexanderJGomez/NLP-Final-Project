And while the criminal case against Hosni Mubarak -- accused of involvement in the deaths of protesters calling for his ouster -- remains alive, news that a court has ordered him released pending retrial naturally has some asking whether Egypt's Arab Spring moment was all for naught.
While she says Mubarak's pending release is a "extraordinary development" and a "potent symbol," its impact could be muted by the long list of worries Egyptians are already dealing with on the ground -- violence, curfews, economic woes.
Egypt's general prosecutor has said he will not appeal to keep Mubarak in custody, state media reported, clearing the way for him to be released.
Mubarak's impending release comes at a time of turmoil in Egypt, where an interim military government has been in charge since Mubarak's successor, Mohamed Morsy of the Muslim Brotherhood, was ousted as president last month.
Eric Trager, with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told CNN that Mubarak's release would likely prompt mixed reactions among Egyptians.
According to Trager, many Egyptians now believe -- thanks to a persistent state media campaign since Morsy was ousted -- that the Muslim Brotherhood was responsible for the deaths of protesters during the 2011 uprising, not the Mubarak regime.
Tamarod, the anti-Morsy protest movement which called for the mass rallies that led to his ouster, said it was not surprised by the ruling on Mubarak's release.
