Suzan Lakhan Baptiste's efforts have turned a beach from a leatherback turtle graveyard to a nesting colony.
Today, she and her group are succeeding: What was once a turtle graveyard is now a maternity ward -- one of the largest leatherback nesting colonies in the world.
For centuries, they've been hunted throughout the Caribbean for their meat and fins, and also for their eggs, which some people prize as aphrodisiacs.
By the 1980s, nearly one in three turtles that nested on Matura Beach were killed.
For years, Baptiste and her group patrolled the beaches every night of turtle nesting season.
She and her group also worked hard to convince the villagers that using the turtles for eco-tourism could create a more sustainable income.
Gradually, her message of conservation turned the tide of public opinion, and after nearly two decades under Baptiste's leadership, Nature Seekers has largely won its battle.
In addition, Baptiste and her colleagues gather data on the enormous creatures, tagging and weighing as many leatherbacks as they can.
Still, turtle slaughter persists throughout the region, and Baptiste is working to help other groups learn from her success, most recently on the island of Dominica.

"When I got started, a lot of people thought I was crazy," Baptiste said, and she admits that she sometimes wondered if they were right.
