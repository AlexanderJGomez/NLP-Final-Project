Police also arrested a third man wanted by authorities for belonging to the same clan, but not directly linked to the killings.
The Casalesi clan and the area where the arrests took place prominently featured in the best seller "Gomorrah," a book written by Roberto Saviano who now lives under constant police protection.
Two weeks ago, the Italian interior minister announced the deployment of 400 additional police officers in the area.
Authorities also arrested dozens of other people, including the wife of Francesco Schiavone, aka "Sandokan," the head of the Casalesi clan who was arrested a decade ago and is serving a life-time prison sentence.
