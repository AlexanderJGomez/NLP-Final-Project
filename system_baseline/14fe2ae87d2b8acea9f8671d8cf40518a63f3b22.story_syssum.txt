He is not gone," Vanessa Fontaine said Friday at a press conference outside of the school in Long Island City where her son ran away October 4.
"I don't know what the commissioner was thinking of last night by saying that, but my son, he is alive, he is out there ...it's just that we are not looking in the right places," Fontaine told reporters.
An hour later, the bloodhounds picked up his scent again, this time at a nearby subway station, the source said.
Fontaine told CNN's "Piers Morgan Live" last week that she believed her son was alive and that someone may have been holding him.
Police said Avonte was last seen wearing a gray striped shirt, black jeans and black sneakers.
