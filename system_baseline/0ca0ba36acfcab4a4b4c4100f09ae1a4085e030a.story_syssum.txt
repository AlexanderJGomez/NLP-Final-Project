That would have sent an unequivocal statement about domestic violence in a league that, according to a Sports Illustrated article last week, includes 14 players who have been arrested for violence against women in the past two years.
Two security camera videos put the Rice case squarely in the public view, with the one most recently made public showing the former Baltimore Ravens' star knocking out his then-fiancee with a punch inside an elevator last February.
A source in the Ravens organization told CNN that team officials never saw the elevator video until TMZ released the recording.
The commissioner also sought to further distance himself from criticism over his handling of the Rice matter, saying the account of the incident the player gave the NFL was different than what was depicted in a video.
"I'm telling you right now it's inconsistent with what he told us," Goodell said, declining to comment further on grounds that Rice's indefinite suspension is under appeal by the players union.
"He's admitting that he made a mistake and he's working to correct it and they're engaging many voices," she said of Goodell and the league.
But NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Fran Tarkenton on CNN Friday said he was doubtful of the league's willingness to deal with domestic violence and other troubles.
Goodell on Friday dismissed questions about whether Mueller's involvement with a law firm that has dealings with the league compromised the former FBI director's investigation.
With Ray Rice suspended indefinitely, the league saw three more of its players come under scrutiny over domestic violence or child abuse allegations.
"While I am disappointed in what Adrian Peterson was involved with, we want to see the facts," Goodell told reporters on Friday.
