The procedure is "not without its risks, but it's treating a disease," medical ethicist Art Caplan told CNN's "New Day" on Wednesday.

It's a way to allow these families to have healthy children," said Solomon, whose organization developed the technique along with Columbia University researchers.
The panel discussed what controls might be used in trials, how a developing embryo might be monitored during those tests and who should oversee the trials, but no decisions were made at the end of the session.
"The big issue over the next 5 to 10 years is going to become how far do we go in pursuit of the perfect baby," said Caplan.
But Solomon said the procedure is closer to an expansion of in vitro fertilization, which has been available for nearly 40 years.
The last thing she would want, she said, "is for the New York Stem Cell Foundation to be involved in anything like designer babies."
