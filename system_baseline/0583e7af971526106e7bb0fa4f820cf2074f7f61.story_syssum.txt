My mother, who was a big fan of the Seven Sisters colleges, had come with me.
I looked at that group and made a silent vow to never allow my mother to be with this group again without a fur coat.
When Mommy died, I shared that story with Doc.
When Doc moved to Winston-Salem, North Carolina, she was not far from me in Virginia, so I got to see a lot of her.
She was a great cook, and I think of myself as a good one.
I called my good friend Joanne Gabbin from Furious Flower Poetry Center to have her come with me to Doc's to cook.
I think she loved me a little bit because she, like my only living aunt, always felt free to make minor corrections.
I know if the lamb was not done properly, she would have eaten it and not said a word.
She would always seek the good in any situation, or she avoided the question.
I will remember her as a courageous woman who always wanted to love, and wish her a rightful place in literature.
