We got our answers Friday at the Stade Pierre Mauroy on a record setting day in Lille -- but for once Federer wasn't the one rewriting the history books.
Federer's performance, coupled with France's apparent advantage in Saturday's doubles, means it's the home team who'll be happier come the end of play.
"Definitely one of the top three matches in my life," said Monfils, who squandered two match points against Federer at the U.S. Open.
In truth at times he was quick to pounce on short Federer balls.
1 Tsonga, displaying some of the artillery that won him the Australian Open in January for a maiden grand slam title.
For large parts of the affair he targeted Tsonga's backhand with his own sublime one-handed backhand, easily getting the better of the 2008 Australian Open finalist.
But Tsonga hung on, altered the momentum and for a brief spell in the third set was in the ascendancy.
Tsonga smelled blood when Wawrinka trailed 0-30 on serve, but the latter rallied to close out the set -- and the match, realistically -- despite double faulting on one of his set points.
With Monfils' victory over Federer, it guaranteed so-called 'live' action Sunday and Clement would surprise a few if he stuck with the out-of-sorts Tsonga to begin the reverse singles.
If I play the doubles and the singles, it needs to be a lot better than today.
Wawrinka and Federer both aren't scheduled to play doubles but they can be called upon Saturday.
