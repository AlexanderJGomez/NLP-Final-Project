(CNN) -- The figure peers down silently from an upper floor of the ruins of a Scottish castle, wearing what looks like an outfit from the Middle Ages.
"Staff have verified that there were no sinister dummies in period costume or historical reenactments going on that day at the castle.
Wiseman said he was looking for "photographic evidence for ghosts" ahead of a session on the subject at the Edinburgh International Science Festival next week.
The photographer insists no one was around when he took the picture; skeptics say the mirror could be reflecting the headrest or be the result of digital manipulation.
For 300 years, the Douglas earls of Angus held sway at the castle as one of the most powerful families in Scotland, according to Historic Scotland, which looks after historic sites for the Scottish government.
It is also possible that a member of the public was standing there when the picture was taken, Wiseman said -- in which case, he hopes they will come forward.
A similar mystery happened five years ago at another medieval site, Hampton Court Palace, built by King Henry VIII west of London.
Palace officials insisted at the time that no one was in the room, and they were at a loss to explain the figure.
