As Weibo, the largest social media platform in China, gets ready for its initial public offering (IPO), a recent university study claims Chinese micro-blogging activity might not be as vibrant as expected.
Dubbed the "Weiboscope," the computer program was originally set up to expose and make publicly available the censored posts from a select group of users with more than 1,000 followers.
To obtain representative data, Fu and his team obtained the timelines of a random sample of micro-bloggers.
In contrast, Weibo claims it has 130 million active users but does not say whether these users post original content.
"I would say that this definition cannot reflect the real activities on Sina Weibo.
"In contrast, my figures are calculated on the basis of the very nature of user-generated-content -- that is those who generate original posts.
He explained that active and original participation on the Internet by ordinary users has always been low because people do not primarily go on to these platforms to create content.
"There is a considerable amount of 'social risk' in creating original content because you can't be sure that what you create will be popular or appreciated by others.
Doug Young, author of "The Party Line," an in-depth look at Chinese media says that even though he is a user of the micro-blogging service, he won't be investing in Weibo because "there is the sense that Weibo has passed its prime.
I don't see how they have done much to innovate beyond knocking off Twitter."
