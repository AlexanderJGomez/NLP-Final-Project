(CNN) -- The tragic death of Moritz Erhardt, a 21-year-old intern at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, has cast a spotlight on the extreme work culture in the financial industry.
The extreme work culture used to be the preserve of a few elite professions, such as banking or law.
There is a significant body of research that shows long working hours have negative physical and psychological effects on people.
People who spend most of their waking hours at work or dealing with work-related activities have little time to build and nurture relationships outside of work.
The result is that their social network withers and, over time, can die.
Harvard professor Robert Putnam has pointed out that the long working hour culture has led to a stunning decline in the numbers of people who are members of clubs and associations.
A recent study by the Swedish sociologist Roland Paulsen has shown that long hours at work also lead to the prevalence of unproductive "empty work" such as checking Facebook, watching YouTube videos or even undertaking personal projects at the office.
These might include having work-life balance programs, or closing the doors to the office at a reasonable hour or banning e-mail traffic after a particular time at night.
