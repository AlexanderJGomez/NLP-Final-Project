His eyes moist and lower lip trembling, Clint Romesha nodded haltingly at family, comrades, military brass and the president standing to applaud him for receiving the nation's highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor.
Explosions from the dawn attack "shook them out of theirs beds and sent them rushing for their weapons, and soon the awful odds became clear," Obama said.
"With gunfire impacting all around him, Clint raced to one of the barracks and grabbed a machine gun," the president said.
The audience on Monday included relatives of the eight soldiers killed in the battle, and Obama paid tribute to the efforts by Romesha and his fellow soldiers to bring them back.
"He was in the Oval Office and he was racing around pretty good and sampled a number of apples before he found the one that was just right."
When it ended, with Romesha and others having held onto the outpost, more than half of their 53-soldier contingent had been killed or wounded.
A few months later, a U.S. military investigation found that measures taken to protect the outpost were lax, and critical intelligence and reconnaissance assistance had been diverted from the base.
