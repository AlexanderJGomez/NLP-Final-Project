She faces a second-degree felony count of unlicensed practice of a health care profession resulting in serious bodily injury and a third-degree felony count of tampering with or fabricating physical evidence, authorities said Tuesday.
Authorities were unable to file more serious charges against Gonzalez because they could not prove the baby's exact cause of death.
Although Renelique was not present when the baby was born, the medical board upheld Department of Health allegations that he falsified medical records, inappropriately delegated tasks to unlicensed personnel and committed malpractice.
The doctor later arrived and gave Williams a shot to put her to sleep, she alleges in her suit.
Gonzalez gave police a statement, meanwhile, and "asserted under oath" that Williams' termination was done by Dr. Renelique while she stood at his side, according to the affidavit.
Another expert certified in neonatal and perinatal medicine told police he estimated Williams' fetus, based on data from her medical records, to have a gestational age of about 21 and a half weeks -- meaning it had not reached viability, the state where it could survive outside the womb.
"This expert ... explained that the standard of care for a premature infant delivered at less than 23 weeks is not to attempt resuscitation," so even if the baby had been born at a hospital, no measures would have been undertaken to save it, according to the affidavit.
