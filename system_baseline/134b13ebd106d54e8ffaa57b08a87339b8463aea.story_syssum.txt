Mollah was sentenced in September after being convicted of crimes against humanity that date back to 1971, during the country's war for independence.
In February, he was convicted of war crimes by an international panel set up by the government in an attempt to bring to justice those accused of atrocities.
"This provision is violated where a court of final instance imposes a harsher sentence that cannot be reviewed," the statement said.
... Only full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital punishment as possibly permitted under international law from a summary execution, which by definition violates human rights standards."
The International Crimes Tribunal, the court set up by the government in 2010, has convicted several other top Jamaat leaders of crimes against humanity.
It has also questioned why the Awami League is only now pressing forward on war crimes trials when it didn't do so while in power during the 1970s and 1990s.
