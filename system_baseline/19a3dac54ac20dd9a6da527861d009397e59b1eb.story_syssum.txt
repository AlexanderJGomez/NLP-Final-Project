The former guards are accused of involvement in a smuggling scheme that undermined the justice system, U.S. Attorney Kenneth Magidson told reporters Wednesday.
Nationwide, the smuggling of contraband cell phones into prisons is a growing problem, the U.S. General Accountability Office said in a 2011 report, noting that the number of smuggled phones seized had quadrupled in a three-year period.
In the McConnell Unit Prison, authorities said Wednesday that rampant corruption had festered since 2005.
In total, authorities have arrested 29 people in connection with the alleged scheme.
