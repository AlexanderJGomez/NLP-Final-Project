Launched earlier this week, the Tony Elumelu Foundation Entrepreneurship Program (TEEP) wants to help find and grow businesses who will contribute $10 billion in revenue across Africa over the next 10 years.
Entries are open to entrepreneurs from all 54 African countries and applications will be accepted in English, French and Portuguese.
As well as these business names, the initiative is also collaborating with big hitters from other sectors, like Vera Songwe,  the World Bank country director for Senegal, Cape Verde, the Gambia, Guinea-Bissau and Mauritania.
"African entrepreneurs have ideas, they have products but they don't have support," says technologist Marieme Jamme, a Davos Young Global leader and CEO of SpotOne Global Solutions.
"Some people are ready to fund amazing and bright ideas, like Tony Elumelu, but let's not get ahead of ourselves here -- we have great challenges on quality control.
