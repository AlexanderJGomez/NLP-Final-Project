Public statements at the time made by the EPA administrator gave the impression that federal officials were trying to cut down overall dispersant use.
"I think the EPA has been struggling to respond to this crisis," said Aaron Viles with the Gulf Restoration Network.
EPA officials say they feared that number would have become the norm and that's why, they say, the directive was issued.
But according to CNN's analysis, BP has gone over that amount 50 percent of the time since the May 26 directive was issued.
"The EPA-Coast Guard directive has been successful in ensuring that BP uses the lowest volume of dispersant necessary," U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Erik Halvorson, a spokesman with the Unified Area Command.
