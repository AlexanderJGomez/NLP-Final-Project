Melissa Huckaby is charged with killing 8-year-old Sandra Cantu, who was a friend of her own daughter.
She was charged with murder, kidnapping, the performance of a lewd and lascivious act on a child under 14 and rape by instrument.
Huckaby did not enter a plea or speak during the court hearing, although she flinched when Sandra Cantu's name was spoken, and she cried at times.
Before her arrest, Huckaby acknowledged to a newspaper reporter that she owned the suitcase that contained Sandra's body.
Willett declined to comment on any of the evidence or allegations in the case, saying evidence would be presented in court.
