Scheduled for completion in 2018, if all goes according to plan, Project Jewel is likely to cement Changi's reputation who is recently named SkyTrax World's Best Airport for the third consecutive year.
More than simply a new terminal, Jewel Changi Airport will be constructed on the site of the old parking lot fronting the existing Changi Airport's Terminal 1, and will be "seamlessly connected" to the existing terminals, according to the airport.
The North Gateway Garden, for instance, will use the trunks of rain trees recycled from the airport's old open-air parking lot.
Travelers will be able to stay at Jewel's own hotel -- approximately 130 rooms operated by international hotel brand YOTEL.
There'll also be new subway links connecting all the airports terminals to the MRT network.
