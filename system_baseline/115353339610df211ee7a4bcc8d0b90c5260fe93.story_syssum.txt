(CNN)In his State of the Union address, President Obama proposed making community college tuition free for two years to boost college graduation rates and lift more people into the middle class.
Even for those who earn a community college degree, it often isn't as useful as other options.
As a result, even if the President's plan passed, it wouldn't help the large number of already-overcrowded community colleges that have waiting lists numbering in the thousands.
What's more, because of the limited productivity gains possible in the community college model, those costs will continue to rise, which means that tuition will, too.
Instead we need to encourage students to seek innovative offerings that are lower cost and improve the quality and accessibility of higher education.
Rather than supporting innovative options like Patten and Southern New Hampshire, the President's plan would nudge students toward a community college sector that is incapable of repositioning its model around student success and fuel rising college costs.
We need a better strategy for skills training overall before we go further down the track of subsidizing students to attend community college only to emerge with little to show for it.
