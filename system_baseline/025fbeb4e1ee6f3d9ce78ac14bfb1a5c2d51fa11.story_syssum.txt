The probe started days after a Human Rights Watch report accused the nation's armed forces of violently taking over the diamond fields in Marange district and killing about 200 people since last year.
Kimberly Process officials urged the government to demilitarize the diamond fields and investigate the accusations against the military.
"The police and army have turned this peaceful area into a nightmare of lawlessness and horrific violence," Gagnon said.
Separately, Human Rights Watch has accused the armed forces of funneling money from the fields into ZANU-PF, President Robert Mugabe's party.
"The money will not be handled by any party but by the Treasury," he said.
