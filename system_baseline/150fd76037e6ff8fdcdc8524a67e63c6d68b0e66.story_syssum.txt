A bomb left 270 people dead when it exploded aboard the Boeing 747 as it flew over Lockerbie, Scotland, less than a week before Christmas day in 1988.
Flynn says he's been in contact with other victims' families, who likely shared a range of emotions upon hearing news of Gadhafi's death.
"We commend and admire the courage of the Libyans, knowing that their freedom has come at a cost," Flynn added.
"Part of me thinks this story had to end this way," Flynn added, referring to the former Libyan leader's being killed rather than captured.
Speaking during a White House press conference, he said the United States is committed to Libya and will support the country's democratic transition.
In 2006, the scope of the archives was expanded to include items pertaining to all 270 victims.
