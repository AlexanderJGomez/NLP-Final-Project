(CNN) -- He is in that landing pattern that middle-aged heartthrobs finally come to: time for home and family and a woman who is worthy of keeping his love.
Those years between 50 and 60 do seem to be a particularly poignant age for men, especially the kind of man who has trouble giving up motorcycles.
If the reports of his engagement are true, this is kind of what Clooney has done, and what a lot of professionally single men ultimately come to do, especially about love.
In this scenario of the chastened older Lothario, the candidate is young enough to lust after and smart enough for impregnation.
I know this isn't very romantic, but the timing is -- whether the 50-something group knows it or not -- guided by the Grim Reaper.
This is the real anchor of middle-aged love: It's time to stop fooling around.
