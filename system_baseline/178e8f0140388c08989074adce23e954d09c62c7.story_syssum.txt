This ultra-illustrative, chronological listing of posts, photos, shared links, check-ins, and more is a radically different arrangement than the Facebook profile you've been used to.
So you may now find that some things included on your Timeline are best kept from curious eyes.
This could be anything from an embarrassing status message you posted in simpler social media times, to a rant your ex left on your wall a few months ago.
If you prefer to keep your profile public, but don't want everyone to see what you posted back in high school, for example, you can also tweak your Timeline settings more generally.
To add a status update, photo, place check-in, or life event to your Timeline, simply hover the mouse over the line in the center of the page until it turns into a plus sign, and reveals the option to add one of those four types of posts.
First, you can add a cover to your Timeline.
Once it loads, you can adjust the positioning of your cover image.
Conversely, you can click the star on a maximized featured post to make it normal again.
You can choose to filter what you see by clicking the "All" dropdown menu at the top.
Click that, and you can choose "View As..." and either enter a friend's name or click the "public" link to see how your profile looks to strangers.
When you add a friend or follow someone's public updates, Facebook automatically sets the level of posts you see to "Most Updates."
And if you haven't done so already, you can organize friends into lists, a la the Google+ Circles feature.
The average Facebook user has 130 friends, but I'd venture to say that most of you reading this have far more than that, so this will help streamline your Facebooking experience.
