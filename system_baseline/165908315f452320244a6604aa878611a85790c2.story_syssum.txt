You've kicked tires, talked to salesmen, taken a few shiny new numbers for a test-drive and you're ready to make the deal.
You still need to decide whether to buy any of those "extras" that your salesperson will always suggest.
"I think that most paint jobs on cars are pretty good these days, so in most cases you probably don't need that anymore," said Bennett, who offered one caveat.
Also, if you get a chip or a ding, get it fixed so the rust doesn't get a chance to set in and spread."
"If you're a smoker, and the plan excludes burn holes from cigarette ashes, and you're not diligent about making sure your ash is always short, that might not be a good purchase because of that exclusion.
If you want to save some cash, one option would be to forego the protectant and just make sure you clean your seats regularly with a good upholstery cleaner or leather cleaner.
It's also a good idea , to use a leather conditioner regularly on leather seats to restore moisture and to maintain its appearance.
"The way most vehicles are constructed today, they are not nearly as prone to underbody rusting as they used to be in the old days -- even in the north, where they get a lot of snow."
Then, when you report that your car has been stolen, the state police crime computer can match code against the state VIN database.
"But even if you live in a safe, low-crime district, your car can still be stolen from a busy downtown street or parking garage," he notes.
"This really does depend on how long you plan to keep the vehicle, because most of these extended warranty plans don't kick in until the manufacturer's warranty expires," advises Bennett.
"So if you plan on selling the car after three or five years, it probably doesn't make sense to buy the extended warranty."
"That's a pretty good warranty, so if you plan on only keeping your vehicle for five years or less, the extended warranty is probably money you don't need to spend."
