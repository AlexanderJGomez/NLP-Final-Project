People around the world are hoping the girls will be set free, but there are skeptics -- and bad signs coming from Boko Haram.
Now, after the government made the announcement of their possible release, the hashtag has reawakened with messages of hope and anticipation.
"It remains to be seen whether this truce will actually materialize, whether it is merely an election ploy for Nigeria's embattled president, Goodluck Jonathan, and most crucially whether it will bring about the release of numerous captives taken by Boko Haram during the past year," he wrote in an analysis for CNN.
Boko Haram has gone after Christians, foreigners and educated people, driving them out of the country's northeast.
"This is a case when we will actually need to see the girls emerging from their six-month confinement before we can truly believe," he wrote after the government's announcement.
On April 14, Boko Haram militants raided the village of Chibok and kidnapped an estimated 276 teenage girls from a boarding school.
Three weeks later, a man claiming to be a Boko Haram leader threatened to sell the girls into slavery.
In spite of many promises to find and free them, the girls have remained in the terrorists' hands.
