Pakzad is one of several Afghan women's rights advocates who are in the U.S. capital this week to address a move the Obama administration is considering: reaching out to Taliban moderates in an effort to bring peace to Afghanistan.
"It is worth engaging and determining whether or not there are those [in the Taliban] who are willing to participate in a secure and stable Afghan state," he said.
The Taliban advocate a strict interpretation of Islamic law, or sharia, that denies women basic rights, including an education.
By one measure, Pakzad and other women's rights groups have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams: The government in Kabul says 2 million girls now attend school in Afghanistan.
Pakzad expresses hope that Clinton and other members of the Obama administration will raise those concerns when moving forward with any policy of negotiating with the Taliban.
"My hope for my daughters, for the next generation ... is that they should enjoy their freedom," she said.
