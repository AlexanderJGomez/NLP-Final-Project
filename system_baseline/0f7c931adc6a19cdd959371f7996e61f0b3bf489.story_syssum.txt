According to masFlight, an enterprise software company that crunches big data for the transport and logistics sectors, January's bizarre weather patterns have already cost passengers flying into and out of the U.S. $2.5 billion, and airlines between $75m and $150m because of canceled and delayed flights.
"On average, a canceled flight takes a passenger an additional 18 hours of travel time to get to their destination," Larsen explains.
According to Larsen, however, the weather in-and-of itself wasn't what grounded millions of flyers, but the airline's capacity to handle them.
Given the likelihood that this year's bizarre weather patterns are possibly a result of climate change, and could become less of an anomaly and more the norm, one wonders how airlines are prepared to adjust in future years.
