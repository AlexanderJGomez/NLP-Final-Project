This week, the tables turned when a surveillance video from a nearby store led to charges of aggravated assault, criminal conspiracy and filing false reports against Philadelphia police officers Sean McKnight and Kevin Robinson in connection with the May 29, 2013, arrest of Najee Rivera.
The grand jury found, however, that Rivera was wailing loudly and showed no aggressive actions as he was lying on the ground and being struck repeatedly by the officers.
Rivera is very satisfied with the charges against the officers, according to his lawyer, Leon Flynn, who spoke to CNN affiliate WPVI.
Robinson's attorney, Fortunato N. Perri Jr., said in a statement that his client "has been a well-respected and dedicated member of the Philadelphia police department for the past seven years.
These guys do not represent the majority of police officers."
