The signs note that the mayor "will not be served in this establishment" and "We believe women should be treated with respect."
"When you see statements like this, it raises the question of is city business being done or not," Councilman Kevin Faulconer said Tuesday.
Regulars at the bar who did not want to speak on-camera told CNN that Filner was often here, usually with a different woman.
Filner issued a required response to the notice of a petition drive Tuesday, arguing that voters should weigh his administration's push for new parks, high-tech jobs, better roads and a 2024 Olympic bid before they decide to whether they want to turn him out of office.
In July, Filner acknowledged that he "failed to fully respect the women who work for me and with me" and that he was "embarrassed" by his actions.
But he also said he will be vindicated by "a full presentation of the facts" and he will not resign.
"I think there was a lot of whispering," former state Assemblywoman Lori Saldana told CNN.
Saldana said she brought complaints about Filner to San Diego County's Democratic Party leader two years ago after hearing accounts of harassing behavior from six women.
But his mayoral campaign featured a television spot in which an Washington airport worker who had a run-in with Filner described his actions as "scary and hostile."
"I deal with frustrated travelers every day, but I never came across anyone like Bob Filner," she said.
