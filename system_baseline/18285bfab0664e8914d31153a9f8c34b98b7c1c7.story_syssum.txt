Rami and Kamal, both gay Iraqis, say they rarely show affection for men in public.
This moment was the worst moment in my life," he said, weeping as he spoke of the 2005 ordeal.
"The other two kidnappers took off my clothes by force, and, at that time, I saw them as three dirty animals trying to tear my body apart."
Only once, he said, was he allowed to talk to his family during captivity.
They spend a lot of time in Internet cafes in Baghdad, surfing gay chat rooms and seeking contacts with other gay men in Iraq and elsewhere.
It's unknown how many homosexuals have been killed by militias in the lawless streets of Iraq's cities, but some Web sites post pictures of Iraqis they say were killed for being gay.
"Gay men and lesbians in Iraq face a lot of risks right now, because homosexuality is sometimes interpreted by people in Iraq as being a Western import," said Scott Portman with the Heartland Alliance, a group that promotes human rights worldwide.
"So they can sometimes be targeted by insurgent groups or militias, in part, because of animosity toward the West and, in part, because homosexuality is not well-accepted in Iraqi society."
"They will force me to give it up, and I cannot do that," he said.
Rami said he once fell in love with a man who was part of the Mehdi Army, a Shiite insurgent group loyal to the radical anti-American cleric Muqtada al-Sadr.
"I told him I would come outside and be killed in the street because I do not want my family to find out I am gay."
Kamal is still tormented by what happened to him nearly three years ago.
"Only my close friend Rami knows about this secret."
