For every Ebola grave, there is roughly one child who lost a parent in the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
The orphans are not sick, and pastor John Ghartey is tired of seeing them not being taken in.
As Ebola killed parents, the fear of contact with orphaned children spread, even after they persistently showed no symptoms.
"Ebola is turning a basic human reaction like comforting a sick child into a potential death sentence," Fontaine said.
A woman in Ghartey's choir died, leaving her eldest daughter to care for four brothers and sisters in addition to her own 1-year-old daughter.
She was lying dead in a room, while the rest of the family lay on the porch.
In the face of the deadly virus, he preaches, with his whole body and full voice, the hope of an immortal soul.
