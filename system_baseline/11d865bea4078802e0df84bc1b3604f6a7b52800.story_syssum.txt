The Taliban forbid girls in the classroom and have threatened to kill anyone who defies them.
Her father's employment fulfills a pledge by Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari, who visited Malala in December and assured her father that the government would meet "all expenses of Malala's treatment and all the needs of the family while in UK," a government statement said Wednesday.
"We do not tolerate people like Malala speaking against us," a Taliban spokesman said after the shooting.
A bullet that hit her left brow didn't penetrate the skull but traveled the side of her head under the skin and into her neck, the hospital said.
The teen had been in critical condition, but doctors removed the bullet and she has no major brain or nerve damage.
Girls were afraid that attending the Malala Yousafzai Post Graduate College for Women in the Taliban-dominated Swat Valley would attract the attention of fighters such as the ones who shot Malala and the two other girls, said Kamran Rehman Khan, a top official in the Swat Valley.
"I was so impressed that despite having threats against her life, she was talking about girls' education in the region and against militants," Khan said.
