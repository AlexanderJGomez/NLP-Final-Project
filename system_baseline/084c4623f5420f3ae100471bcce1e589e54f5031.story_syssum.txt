She also wrote that she was worried about kids being mean to her because of her Muslim faith and asked for the President's help amid the growing crisis of anti-Muslim hate.
As the facts unfold, many indications lead us to believe that this is likely a hate crime.
In the last few months, we have seen public figures engage in rhetoric that has only added fuel to the fire of anti-Muslim hate and bigotry.
Bobby Jindal warned Americans of fabricated "no-go zones" in the United States where non-Muslims are not allowed to go, and insisted that immigration by Muslims should be viewed as an "invasion," clearly not grasping the fact that Muslims have been a part of America since their forced migration on slave ships.
While Obama announced Friday that the FBI has begun an inquiry into Tuesday's horrific killings in North Carolina, now, more than ever, we need the President and Attorney General Holder to speak from the podium and personally address the larger issue of anti-Muslim bigotry.
Furthermore, it is critical for Holder, our nation's chief law enforcement officer, to direct and complete a rigorous federal investigation on the attack and make it clear that violence against anyone based on how they look or how they pray will not be tolerated.
As we carry the torch for Deah, Yusor and Razan and remember the great things they accomplished in their beautiful lives, let us also honor their memory by ensuring that young children such as Sabrina and Saniya are not targets of future hate crimes.
