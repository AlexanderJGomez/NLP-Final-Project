In a battle between Iraqi forces and ISIS over control of Tikrit recently, the tomb of Saddam Hussein was squashed to rubble, though it's not clear which side did it.
And many Iraqis know better than to buy the claims of their deposed despot.
"It belonged to our grandfathers, the Babylonians."
The artifacts, some of the oldest in ancient civilization, are from the "age of ignorance," ISIS says, before the advent of Islam.
History is measured there not in centuries but in millennia, and Iraqi's take such vandalism to heart.
Safa ad-Din Hassan and other parents took Iraqi scouts on a camping trip near Babylon to teach them about their history and make ancient artwork with them.
It's a soul under assault by latter day barbarians, who have destroyed much of it in the North, which has been out of the defensive reach of Iraqi soldiers.
One man fired shots into the rubble toward Hussein's grave site.
