(CNN) -- Manchester City hired Manuel Pellegrini as its new manager Friday and he was given the clear message that one of his tasks will be to develop younger players alongside the expensive stars bankrolled by wealthy owner Sheikh Mansour.
"He shares the club's approach to football and our ambition to achieve onfield success, coordinating with the wider football support teams to ensure natural progression from the Academy to senior level," said Manchester City chief executive Ferran Soriano.
City couldn't escape the Champions League group stage for a second straight term, while Pellegrini's Malaga advanced to the quarterfinals last season for the first time, beaten by eventual finalist Borussia Dortmund.
Mancini was sometimes criticized for his defensive approach but Pellegrini promised to play attacking football at City.
His hiring completes managerial changes at the top three teams in the Premier League, after David Moyes replaced the retiring Alex Ferguson at Manchester United and Mourinho took over from Rafael Benitez at Chelsea.
