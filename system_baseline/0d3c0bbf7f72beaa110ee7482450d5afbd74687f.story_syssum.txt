To be fair, Psaki described the U.S. peace talks with the Taliban -- which Afghan President Hamid Karzai opposes -- as the preliminary step toward long healing process in war-torn Afghanistan and creating "reconciliation" within the country.
What has influenced U.S. leaders is the Taliban's announcement that they oppose "the use of Afghan soil to threaten other countries" such as the United States and they support an Afghan peace process, Psaki said.
The Taliban announcement has angered the Afghan president, who said the country's High Peace Council won't take part in peace talks in Qatar until the process is led by Afghans.
"This shows that the continuation of such policies of the Taliban are for ... foreigners' strategies and goals," Karzai's statement said.
Psaki asserted that the rights of women -- protected under the Afghan constitution -- are not open for negotiation with the Taliban, which has oppressed and mistreated women.
"Our goal in Afghanistan continues to be to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al-Qaeda to ensure that the country can never again be a safe haven for terrorists.
"So it's significant because we are taking a step in the process, but there need to be negotiations, there need to be discussions."
That U.S. withdrawal raises the stakes for Afghanistan to govern itself in peace.
