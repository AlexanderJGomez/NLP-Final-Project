People in Hong Kong's industry point to several causes for the comparatively leaner times: a lack of opportunities for new acting talent, inadequate training and schooling for people who produce movies and changing tastes within the Hong Kong public.
"The Hong Kong film industry came to a rude awakening [in the late 1990s] that the world was changing faster than it was in the age of new delivery systems for home entertainment and the Internet," says Bede Cheng, a local film archivist and curator.
"The result is that the industry has grown more and more accustomed to looking north for both investment and box return -- nothing political, but more of a survival instinct.
"Most films are high-end productions with big stars, or low-end made with a shoestring budget for an easier return.
Some once video distributors like Mei Ah and Universe have gone into production as a way to keep the pipeline flowing."
"For all the risk-taking businessmen out there [in Hong Kong], no one is willing to put their money where their mouth is and throw in some support.
South Korea launched an active campaign on all levels -- corporate, government, education -- to train and cultivate a modern film industry."
In the end, it may be culture that poses one of the greatest challenges for Hong Kong's movie industry.
Chan's own first feature in 2005, "A Side, B Side, Sea Side," includes a scene with a gaggle of girls on Hong Kong's Cheung Chau island who are unable to communicate in Chinese with an Australian man speaking fluent Mandarin.
Hong Kong already has a bad reputation for Putonghua, but I don't feel ashamed.
So we are not good at speaking Putonghua.
After 1997, we lost the confidence to be Hong Kong people."
