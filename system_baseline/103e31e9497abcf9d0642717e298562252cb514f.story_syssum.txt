His death comes at an awkward time for President Raul Castro's government: another prisoner died after going on a hunger strike earlier this month, and Pope Benedict is due to visit Cuba in the coming months.
Villar Mendoza's death was confirmed by the wife of another dissident and by the head of an opposition research organization inside Cuba, who could not be identified for security reasons.
With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking would not be released.
That pardon was prompted by the death of a jailed dissident, Orlando Zapata Tamayo, following an 80-day hunger strike protesting inmate conditions.
