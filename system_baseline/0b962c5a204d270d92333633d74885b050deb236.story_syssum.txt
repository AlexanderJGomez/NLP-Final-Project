The now former host of "Mayhem in the AM" on Atlanta's 790 The Zone offered up plenty of reasons in an interview Tuesday with CNN's Brooke Baldwin.
"You walk a fine line trying to be somewhat on the edge," Shapiro said.
It all started, he explained, as the show's crew batted around ideas during a commercial break.
And it just so happened that Gleason, one of the men most associated with the Louisiana team, had been the guest writer for Peter King's popular "Monday Morning Quarterback" column this week on SI.com.
Gleason also explained his struggles with, and triumphs over, the disease.
At the outset, he realized the bit wasn't funny but wasn't prepared as it quickly got slammed on social media and beyond.
We sincerely apologize to Mr. Gleason, his family and all those touched by ALS," Rick Mack, the station's general manager, said in a statement
Since the story broke, Gleason said, there's been a lot of talk about ALS, an ailment he characterizes as being "not (well) understood ... and largely ignored."
At the same time, he's personally shaken for his part in offending so many -- including Gleason, those fighting ALS and the city of New Orleans.
That's what happened when Gregg Hughes and Anthony Cumia's "Opie and Anthony" show got pulled in 2002 for a stunt in which they broadcast descriptions of people having sex in public places, including New York's St. Patrick Cathedral.
More recently, two popular Australian radio DJs made headlines for a prank call targeting a pregnant Catherine Duchess of Cambridge that was followed by the suicide of a nurse fooled by their call.
He noted that TV shows such as "Family Guy" have repeatedly featured caricatures of Steven Hawking, who also has ALS and uses a synthetic voice, in its shows with no equivalent uproar.
"That was a dumb thing to say, but no one is yelling for them to get fired," Thomas told CNN.
