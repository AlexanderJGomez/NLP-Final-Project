New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- BP has put off crucial "integrity tests" on the new stacking cap on its ruptured Gulf oil well so it can review testing procedures, a review expected to take place through the night and into Wednesday.
But throughout the evening, cameras some 5,000 feet below the surface showed oil gushing from the well's capping stack, indicating that valves had not been closed to begin the pressure tests.
Retired Adm. Thad Allen, who is leading the federal response to the oil disaster, says the well cap placement is part a "very complex, nuanced and broad-based response" to the rupture of the underwater well in April, an accident that killed 11 oil workers and caused worst environmental disaster in U.S. history.
What we can't tell is the current condition of the well bore below the sea floor and the implication of the pressure readings," he said.
If it's determined that the cap can't seal the well completely, and some crude must be sent to the surface, the oil-gathering ship, the Helix Producer, in now in place.
Meanwhile, in another development Tuesday, the Obama administration sent BP and other responsible parties a fourth bill relating to the oil spill.
Allen said authorities are on pace to have around 1,000 skimmers available by the end of the month.
Scientists estimate that 35,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil have spewed daily from BP's breached well and Allen cautions that even if the engineering containment efforts work, there is still a lot to be done in a disaster that has affected the environment and the livelihoods of people from Louisiana to Florida.
