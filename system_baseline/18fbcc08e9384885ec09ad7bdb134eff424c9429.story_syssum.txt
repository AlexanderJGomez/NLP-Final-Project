Cairo (CNN) -- When Azza Hilal Suleiman saw Egyptian military pummel the veiled woman, she stepped in to help and got kicked and clubbed by security forces, a beating that was captured in a video that went viral around the world and also showed live gunfire and the violent removal of a Muslim woman's clothing.
Security forces rushed toward Suleiman and pushed her to the ground as she ran to the veiled woman's side.
A CNN crew also witnessed the security force beatings and shootings and saw other women stripped of some of their clothing.
She had been dressed in a traditional robe and headscarf, but as police clubbed her and dragged her down the street, those articles of clothing were pulled away, exposing her midriff and blue bra.
The video showed one of the police officers aiming a foot at her upper abdomen and stamping squarely on it.
Others came to Suleiman's aid, such as businessman Ehab Hanna, who was also beaten up and shot after he tried to help the woman with the veil.
Hanna said security forces left him alone when they thought he was dead.
He said he and other injured people were on the ground for about 30 minutes because ambulances weren't allowed into the area.
"I started to run, but she froze and fell to the ground when another protester bumped into her," Mahmoud said.
They even continued to beat her after her body was exposed."
Askar questioned why the woman has not come forward to identify herself.
As Wafa Ahmed, Suleiman's sister-in-law, listened to her wailing in pain, she thought of Suleiman's father and other family members, who have served Egypt in the military and government.
