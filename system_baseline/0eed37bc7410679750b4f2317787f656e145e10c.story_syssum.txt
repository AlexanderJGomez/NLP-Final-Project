(CNN) -- "Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine" (Relic Entertainment, THQ) deftly takes the popular tabletop miniatures game and puts it into a video game with gun-blazing, sword-swinging action and a story that flows well.
Players often are accompanied by two other space marines who contribute to the wholesale slaughter of lesser opponents but seem to have little effect on boss battles.
Performing an execution on a stunned enemy also rewards the player with points for good health.
Each character has his own feel and motivations, giving personality to even the lowliest speaking ones.
However, developers were able to knit together a tale that also includes loss and betrayal while giving the player a feeling of omnipotence that makes it unique for shooters.
It's a testament to the writers for crafting an interesting (but short) story as well as the developers for making me feel so invested in my characters.
