(CNN) -- Scientists at the Large Hadron Collider managed to make two proton beams collide at high energy Tuesday, marking a "new territory" in physics, according to CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research.
The as-yet theoretical Higgs boson, also called "the God particle" in popular parlance, could emerge within two or three years, Myers said in November.
It made headlines late last year when a bird apparently dropped a "bit of baguette" into the accelerator, making the machine shut down.
"It's the period in which experiments will really start to collect data in this new energy region, where the potential for discoveries may be made."
"It's a new territory in particle physics, so we're really just standing on the threshold of that, which is exciting for everybody here, of course."
