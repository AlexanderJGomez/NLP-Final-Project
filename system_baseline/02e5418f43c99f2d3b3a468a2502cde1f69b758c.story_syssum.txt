Kaamil, who perceives clear parallels between Lolita's life of captivity-for-profit and the human slave trade, was inspired to record "Let The Girl Go: Free Lolita," a bold music video about Lolita, and a courageous interview on the parallels of captivity between human slaves and performing orcas.
"It's important to understand how horrendous it is to steal a baby orca from her family, force her to perform, and hold her in the equivalent of a bath tank until she dies.
Compared to say, 40 miles, 80 feet is about 1/2600th the size of an orca's normal daily life.
Like a second lump of sugar, a whale named Hugo who had been captured from the same free-living whale community two years earlier, shared Lolita's teacup for 10 years.
Free-living orcas frequently live into their 50s or beyond (they can live up to a century).
Forty-year veteran orca expert Ken Balcomb has told me that tooth marks on a recent healthy newborn suggest that another whale, likely its grandmother, assisted her daughter during a difficult birth by pulling the infant from her body.
But when the whales removed as babies would have been the next maturing generation, rebuilding hit a wall: too few females.
Lolita, who has never given birth, is now menopausal, her gifts to the future forever withheld by her denatured existence.
The proposal is to move her into a vastly larger open-water net-pen in her home waters of Washington State.
Depending on how that goes and whether after all this time there remains recognition, the possibility of full return to her family could be considered.
It is imperative to recognize the inhumanity of forcing any living being into captivity."
