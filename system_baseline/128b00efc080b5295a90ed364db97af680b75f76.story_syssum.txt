(CNN) -- Since the death penalty was reinstated in Colorado more than 35 years ago, the state has executed just one person.
In addition, more and more states are abolishing the death penalty.
The death penalty was reinstated in Colorado in 1976.
And that, said David Beller, a defense attorney not associated with the case, can make the prosecution's decision to seek the death penalty more complicated.
In deciding to seek the death penalty, prosecutors also had to weigh the impact on the families of the victims since the case could go on for a year, with a string of appeals likely.
"Prior to arraignment, Mr. Holmes made an offer to the prosecution to resolve this case by pleading guilty and spending the rest of his life in prison, without any opportunity for parole," the documents filed by the defense team read.
Witnesses who spoke to CNN said the gunman roamed the theater, shooting randomly as people tried to scramble away or cowered between seats.
