Quantico, Virginia (CNN) -- There aren't many people who would voluntarily be pepper-sprayed, but at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia young Marines are doing just that.
CNN got exclusive access inside the Marine Security Guard training program at Quantico, where Marines are training as the service tries to almost double the number of its members posted at embassies and consulates worldwide.
"We also will create a quick-response unit that will be able to augment embassy security in case there are indications ... in a particular country ... and that ambassador wants reinforcement with more Marines," Col. Michael Robinson, commanding officer of the Marine Corps Embassy Security Group, told CNN's Barbara Starr.
"So instead of requesting through the normal military channels...they would come directly to us, and we would be able to provide this security augmentation unit to help reinforce that particular embassy or consulate," he said.
Although most of these enlisted trainees are young -- typically 20 or 21 years old -- security guard is not an entry-level position.
In addition, the Marine must have top secret security clearance and submit to a polygraph.
"No sir, still alive, sir," the young Marine responded.
"It doesn't matter sir, as long as I get to serve."
