You'd never know that Clinton was the candidate who made Bush's father a one-termer, or that Bush ran for office in 2000 promising to restore "honor and dignity to the White House" after Clinton left.
Clinton said he and Bush "talked about everything in the right world.
It is well-documented that Clinton has grown closer with the Bush family since his presidency.
Bush worked together after the Asian tsunami in 2004 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005, while Clinton and George W. Bush worked together after the 2010 Haitian earthquake.
When Bush gave Clinton advice on becoming a grandparent -- "Get ready also to be, like, the lowest person in the pecking order in your family" -- the two laughed and shared a hearty handshake.
Clinton said Bush was decisive and did what he thought was best for the country, even if Clinton sometimes disagreed with him.
Clinton offered wordy, detailed answers, while Bush used more folksy one-liners and quips to engage the crowd.
Clinton said that before the event they "were laughing about having to go to restaurants and having to spend our time taking selfies" with fans.
