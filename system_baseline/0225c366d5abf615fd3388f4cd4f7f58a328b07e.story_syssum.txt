Harry Nicolaides was arrested last August over a 2005 book called "Verisimilitude," which includes a paragraph about the king and crown prince that the authorities deemed a violation of the Lese Majeste law.
The Thai Criminal Court originally sentenced Nicolaides to six years in jail but cut the punishment in half because of the guilty plea.
King Bhumibol Adulydej has pardoned foreigners in other similar cases in the past.
"I think there are individuals who have exploited an obscure law for their own self-interest," he said.
Thailand's new prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, also told CNN he is concerned about the misuse of the Lese Majeste law.
Other cases are pending against both foreigners and Thais.
