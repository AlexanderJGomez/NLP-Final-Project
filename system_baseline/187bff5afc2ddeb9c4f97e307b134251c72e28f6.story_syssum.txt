When it failed to reach any kind of agreement last year, Nepal dissolved its parliament -- paving the way for Tuesday's vote.
Despite fears, officials and reports say that voters turned up in large numbers in the 18,438 polling centers across the country to choose assembly members.
But people largely ignored the call and are voting "enthusiastically," said Election Commission spokesman Bir Bahadur Rai.
One person later died of injuries in hospital, police said.
Two years later, in 2008, Nepal held elections for the first time.
