The day before former New Edition artist Johnny Gill left for a U.S. concert tour in March, Taylor sat in the musician's modest condominium taking measurements for a customized shirt and suit that needed to be completed and shipped in a few days.
Taylor says he wants to change the apparel business model by personalizing a customer's needs, instead of having large inventories and high overhead costs that can quickly put someone out of business in a bad economy.
He borrowed money to pay for a booth, but like many entrepreneurial designers getting started, Taylor said buyers were not interested in clothing without established brand names.
Several months later, Taylor was surprised that some of his personal customers were coming back for more shirts because of his attention to size and detail.
He said television shows and celebrities began to take notice, and soon he found himself in the fitting rooms of major motion picture and recording studios.
The vast majority of men and women who make up Taylor's clientele earn a living on Main Street, like Brian Asciak, the sales manager of a Ford dealership in Long Beach, California, who became Taylor's most recent customer as he sat in his office.
He averages close to $30,000 per month in revenue, and sales are down by only about 15 percent this year, he said.
