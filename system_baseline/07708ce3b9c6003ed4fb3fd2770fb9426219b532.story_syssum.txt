They face a non-jury trial September 17 before U.S. District Judge Casey Rodgers.
Attorneys defending Lay and Freeman call it outrageous that the two are being prosecuted for "a simple prayer."
Lay was a party in the initial lawsuit, and his attorney was among those approving the consent decree, according to the organization.
In a February 4 letter to district Superintendent Tim Wyrosdick in which Lay acknowledged the incident, he said that although past football booster club members "and other adults associated with the school system" were at the luncheon, culinary class students were in charge of food preparation and serving.
"It is a sad day in America when school officials are criminally prosecuted for a prayer over a meal," said Mathew Staver, founder of Liberty Counsel and dean of the law school at Liberty University, founded by the late Rev.
The organization said that neither man "willfully violated any orders of the court."
"We certainly never suggested that anyone go to jail," Katon said.
Neither Lay nor Freeman has been placed on leave, according to the school district.
