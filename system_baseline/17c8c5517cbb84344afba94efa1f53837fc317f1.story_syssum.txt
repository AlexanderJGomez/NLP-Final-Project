Syed Haris Ahmed, charged with providing material support to terrorism in the United States and abroad, used the time to talk about his Muslim faith instead of addressing the evidence against him.
Ahmed, a naturalized United States citizen who was born in Pakistan, waived his right to a jury trial so he could make the statement during closing arguments.
The judge told Ahmed he would act according to the laws of the United States in deciding the case by considering the evidence.
The short, shaky videos were allegedly e-mailed to other co-conspirators and found on the hard drives of at least two men who were arrested on terrorism charges in the United Kingdom.
"The whole point is to get the terrorist before he gets to flight school and figures out how to fly a commercial airliner," McBurney said.
Both testified Ahmed was searching for his Muslim identity.
He did not have a religious mentor and turned to the Internet to find his identity as a Muslim, Martin said.
Sadequee is expected to face the same charges in an August trial.
