My job is to ask tough questions, but when it comes to faith, God, and religion, the more questions I ask in my quest for truth and understanding, the more complex the answers become.
That same rebellious spirit also led to things that definitely were not good for me, like hanging with the wrong crowd and getting into the type of trouble that I would rather not put in print.
I started off at Westmont, a beautiful Christian college nestled in the heart of Santa Barbara, California.
We lifted each other up, had intimate sunrise Bible studies on the beach and spent hours hanging out with friends, talking about how to lead a godly life.
It became the world of church, religion and faith versus the world of ideas, cultures, and philosophies.
I wanted to mesh with a myriad of thinkers, and religious scholars.
When it comes to God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit, those answers rest in faith.
When I started working on a documentary about the growth of atheism, I found myself in a profound place of reflection.
Or just good karma for trying to lead such a generous and selfless life?
My stepfather, who grew up in -- but later left -- the Mormon church has a perspective on religion that I find intriguing.
So, where do I stand now -- 30 years after "finding God," questioning my faith, committing sins, seeking hazardous adventure and trying to love life and people to the best of my ability?
A constant seeker within this world, among people and, of course, for spiritual enlightenment of all kind.
