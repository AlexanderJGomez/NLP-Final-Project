The pledge, designed by the nonprofit group the National College Players Association (NCPA), calls for the NCAA to take more steps to minimize brain trauma, and for money to be designated to increase scholarships and graduation rates, and guarantee medical treatment.
"I think it was a smart decision by the players to design a campaign as visible as the logos that they wear," Huma said.
A team handler who was standing nearby discouraged CNN from asking questions about the pledge, and cut questions short.
The silent protest is just another example of growing dissent for the NCAA.
"If a student feels ... that they are going to lose their athletic scholarship because of a concussion or some injury, something that is not necessarily visible, he'll be less inclined to report that injury out of fear that they're going to lose a scholarship."
Huma said the NCAA doesn't force universities to pay medical bills for injured players, and that if a student doesn't graduate before their eligibility expires, they aren't guaranteed an education.
"We feel like we're on the right side of the argument and we're going to succeed."
