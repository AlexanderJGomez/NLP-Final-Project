But, with mere seconds to go, Team USA's dogged determination was torpedoed by a header from Silvestre Varela.
Now, the U.S. team will have to find steelier resolve for its next contest, against soccer powerhouse Germany on Thursday.
Back at home, bars and streets were packed with people -- an unusual sight in a country that is ordinarily indifferent to soccer.
And when Clint Dempsey put the United States ahead 2-1, cheers erupted even on a flight from Los Angeles to New York.
But Varela's crushing late equalizer -- headed in from a pinpoint cross by Portugal's talisman, Cristiano Ronaldo -- stunned the U.S. supporters.
A tie also gives another point for the U.S., moving it closer to qualifying for the knockout stages.
That confrontation is an intriguing one for U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann, who played for the German team that won the World Cup in 1990.
The good news is that the U.S. players have their fate in their own hands: a win or a tie would be enough to see them through.
In the event of a German win, things get a lot more complicated, but not necessarily catastrophic for the Americans.
Portugal would need a big victory or an especially heavy U.S. defeat to tip the goal difference to their advantage.
So if Ghana wins by more than one goal, and the United States loses by one or more goals, Ghana would snatch second place.
"We have to make it against Germany."
