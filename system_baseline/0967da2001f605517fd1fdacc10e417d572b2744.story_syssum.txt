"Our beloved son, brother and father of three children has gone so unexpectedly, in such a tragic way and much too soon," the statement said.
Family members including Jackson's mother, Katherine, were at the estate Jackson had rented in Holmby Hills.
Meanwhile, the doctor who may have been the last person to see Michael Jackson alive was expected to meet with police Saturday along with his lawyer, an associate of attorney Ed Chernoff said.
"It's a human tragedy, and he's upset obviously over the loss of Mr. Jackson.
The parents need to know what happened in the last hours of Michael Jackson's life, Jesse Jackson said.
He should have met with the family, given them comfort on the last hours of their son."
"I have no information as to what if any treatment, or course of treatment he was doing for Mr. Jackson at all," he said.
A spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner's office told reporters Friday that more tests must be conducted before a cause of death can be determined.
"They need an independent autopsy to get even more answers to questions that are now being driven by the gap between when Michael was last seen alive and was pronounced dead day before yesterday," Jesse Jackson said.
Jackson had been preparing for a comeback tour -- aimed at extending his legendary career and helping him to pay off hundreds of millions of dollars in debt.
