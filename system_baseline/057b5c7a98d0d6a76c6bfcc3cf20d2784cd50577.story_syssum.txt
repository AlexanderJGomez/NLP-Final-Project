But instead of doing all of that for basketball, these same students should say the heck with the games and put their energy, zeal and passion into two fundamental issues posing the most dramatic barriers to their college education: the rising cost of tuition and the lack of financial aid.
Education leaders say it's all about the economy, but when the cost of tuition is jacked up as high as 30 percent in some states, and so many parents are without jobs or are facing wage cutbacks, their children see no hope.
Federal officials say the banks are reaping upwards of $9 billion a year in these subsidies, which include interest collected, and the Obama administration wants to push more of that money to students by increasing Pell grants and Perkins loans.
In some cases, the banking industry has used its financial power to wine and dine college officials, lavishing gifts, golf trips and other perks to keep them in line.
Four students at North Carolina A&T decided they'd had enough of the segregated lunch counters in downtown Greensboro.
Black students in other Southern towns began to do the same, and lunch counter by lunch counter, drugstore by drugstore, department store by department store, Jim Crow was assaulted by the zealous actions of just a handful of students.
If these banks are fighting against your best interests, they don't deserve your account.
Imagine what would happen if thousands of students fanned out across a city and picketed and actually led sit-ins in the banks.
Send throngs of students from each district and make it clear that you will organize young voters and parents in those districts and throw them out of office if they continue to allow the banks to run roughshod.
Students, basketball is wonderful, and seeing your team in the Big Dance is great.
Students, the time for talk is over.
Put those fervent minds to use in battling those who don't have your best interests at heart.
