Jason Rezaian, The Washington Post's Tehran bureau chief, was taken with his wife, Yeganeh, from their apartment on July 22.
In a meeting December 22 with two members of Jason and Yeganeh's interrogation team, I was informed: "The West has an unfair view of us (the Iranian Revolutionary Guard).
And I don't believe I've been granted any of them: the right to meet with my attorney, my trial scheduled in a timely manner, and visitation rights with my wife."
But while I sincerely appreciate Zarif's "humanitarian" efforts, as well as the orchestrating of Jason's one telephone call to me for Thanksgiving Day, the fact is that as a dual citizen and therefore Iranian mother, it is my right to visit my son in prison.
Iran's Constitution spells out that once a prisoner's file is completed, the prisoner is to be moved to a public ward, where he can interact with others and have access to a telephone.
And yet there are rumblings that Jason's case will not be heard until after Nowruz, the Persian New Year, which is on the first day of spring, March 21.
It is traditionally a time when pardons are granted and prisoners are released on bail to visit with their families.
But our patience ran out some time ago, and it is difficult, nearly impossible, to maintain respect for a system under which someone who was born and raised American is being detained "as an Iranian" even as his rights under Iran's own laws are being so flagrantly violated.
Please review the evidence and release my son or ensure that he receives a fair trial immediately.
