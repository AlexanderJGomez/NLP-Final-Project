People from Nepal and India sacrifice animals to the goddess Gadhimai in the Bara district, about 150 kilometers (about one mile) south of Kathmandu, in thanks for wishes granted.
Water buffalo are slaughtered on the first day, and other animals on the second day.
A sustained effort is needed so that, sometime, the practice will end," said Nepali animal rights activist Pramada Shah.
Buffalo is eaten by low castes in Nepal and India, but goat meat is eaten by a wider population.
