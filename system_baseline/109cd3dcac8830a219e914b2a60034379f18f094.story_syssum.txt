Now seven, the girl was found Friday with family in Las Vegas after thousands of tips poured in to police, thanks to an appeal by police to the news media to show the girl's picture.

He said he recognizes his old apartment from scenes in the video.
"She's what you'd expect a little girl in elementary school to be like," he said.
De Meo addressed Stiles directly on Saturday: "Turn yourself in to your local law enforcement agency," he said.
The FBI is also seeking Stiles on state charges of sexual assault and lewdness with a minor under the age of 14 in a separate matter, De Meo said.
