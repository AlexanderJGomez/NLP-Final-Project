(CNN) -- As a young competitive gymnast, Melissa Stockwell's heart would fill with pride as she looked at the American flag and sang the national anthem before every meet.
"Think of the loudest noise you can imagine and our vehicle starts to swerve," she recalls.
While recovering at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, Stockwell says she was inspired by other patients.
"Luckily there are organizations out there that really grab the wounded veterans from their hospital rooms and get them out doing things that they may not have ever done with two legs," she says.
A presentation about the Paralympics inspired her to fight for her country on a new battlefield.
"I dreamed of going to the Olympics when I was younger," she says.
Today the 32-year-old veteran works as a certified prosthetist at Scheck and Siress in Chicago and runs a triathlon club she started with friends Keri Schindler and Dan Tun two years ago.
First place, for the third consecutive year, went to her coach and mentor Melissa Stockwell.
