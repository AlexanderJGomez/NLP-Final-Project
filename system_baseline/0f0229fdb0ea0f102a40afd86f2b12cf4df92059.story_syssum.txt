Over 250,000 participants of all ages entered the competition, whose championship rounds were held in New York on Monday and Tuesday and won by Kate Moore of Des Moines, Iowa.
The fourth-place finisher, 21-year-old Jordan Rowe, saw her dreams of texting glory vanish in the "pressure cooker" round, where actors dressed as emoticons attempted to distract contestants tasked with texting tongue-twisters.
The two went head to head in a best-of-three showdown to see who could most quickly pound out lengthy texts predetermined by the judges -- with no errors.
In the tiebreaker, the two girls furiously raced to thumb the final text: "Zippity Dooo Dahh Zippity Ayy...MY oh MY, what a wonderful day!
Nor does Moore's mother have to foot an appallingly large phone bill each month, because her daughter is on an unlimited texting plan.
Moore's victory was all the more awe-inspiring because she got a phone with text capability less than a year ago.
Moore: It feels the best!
Moore: haah just once or 2ce, teachers hv seen it and taken it away...lol that sux when that happens tho.
Moore: Hahah not at all!
