Moreover, there will be fewer people around to cover Cannes, as news organizations around the world trim costs.
Nevertheless, those who attend may see a bumper crop of good and intriguing films, Variety's Jay Weissberg told Reuters.
Two of the films in competition are American: Quentin Tarantino's World War II movie, "Inglourious Basterds," and Ang Lee's "Taking Woodstock," a tale about the 1969 music festival.
Buzz has been high on "Basterds" since Tarantino announced the project several years ago.
"Taking Woodstock," the new film by "Brokeback Mountain" director Lee, is based on the book by Elliot Tiber, whose hotelier parents owned a musical festival permit in Bethel, New York, where Woodstock was held.
The festival is opening with "Up," the latest animated work from Pixar.
"One thing that always surprises me is that some of the films you have the lowest expectations for turn out to be terrific, and sometimes the bigger films turn out to be disappointments," Rozen said.
