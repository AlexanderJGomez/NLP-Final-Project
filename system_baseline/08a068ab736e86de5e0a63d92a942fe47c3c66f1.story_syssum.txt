The concertgoers, who packed the club, were rocking with wild abandon to the sound of the band on stage.
For survivors of that February night fire in 2003, the Sunday blaze in Santa Maria brought back memories of their own brush with death.
Now, the reality of another such tragedy tears at the heart of Dave Kane, whose 18-year-old son Nicky was the youngest victim of the Station fire.
The Station fire brought changes to Rhode Island law, requiring sprinklers at buildings that can house more than 150 people and limiting pyrotechnics.
Michael and Jeffrey Derderian, the two brothers who owned the club, pleaded no contest to 100 counts each of involuntary manslaughter.
John Barylick, an attorney who represented victims in wrongful death and personal injury cases arising from the fire, knows the pain well, too.
"If only they had learned from our tragedy."
