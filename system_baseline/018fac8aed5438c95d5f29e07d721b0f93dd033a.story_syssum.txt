The U.S. Department of Defense is one of the world's largest institutional energy consumers.
Now, as detailed in a recent report by the Pew Charitable Trusts, its efforts to improve vehicle efficiency and use advanced biofuels could similarly lead the way for countless U.S. businesses seeking a foothold in the burgeoning global clean energy economy.
Building on the work of an expert panel convened by the Defense Science Board, the Pentagon has called for a new technology development strategy aimed at reducing risk to soldiers and enhancing our nation's overall long-term energy security.
The project aims to have select installations each produce as much as they consume in energy, water or waste by 2020.
Combined, these efforts could have a huge impact on U.S. operational security.
According to Pew's report, the military's sizable purchasing power could provide a crucial difference in helping technologies make the transition from the labs to the marketplace.
Throughout these trying times, however, the military also has looked inside its own operations and developed a sound strategy to enhance America's security and lessen our dependence on foreign fuels.
