Panasonic has suspended work at three plants in China until Tuesday, after factories in Qingdao and Suzhou were damaged by protesters, company officials told CNN.
Panasonic also halted operations at a factory in Guangdong province until Tuesday as some local employees staged a strike as protest against Japan's claim to the island chain, called Diaoyu by China and Senkaku by Japan.
"China is a big market for us, it would be very damaging for us to see a decline of the Chinese tourists," said the man, who gave his surname as Watanabe.
Even hawkish publications, such as Global Times -- which ran an editorial "Discard illusion of friendly ties with Japan" last week -- published an editorial Monday headlined "Violence is never appropriate solution."
The battle over ownership of the island chain will "inevitably" have a negative impact on Sino-Japan economic ties, Vice Minister of Commerce Jiang Zengwei said Thursday, state-run Xinhua reported.
Despite booming auto sales in China, sales of Japanese car brands are down 2% in China compared to a year ago, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.
Last week, the Japanese government approved the purchase for 2.05 billion yen ($26.2 million) the group of small islands from the Kurihara family, a private Japanese owner, according to Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura.
The islands were administered by the U.S. occupation force after World War II.
