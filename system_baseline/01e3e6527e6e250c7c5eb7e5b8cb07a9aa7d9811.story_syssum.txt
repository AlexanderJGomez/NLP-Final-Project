But while the Champions League final between eventual winners Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund showcased all that is good about German football, the 36-year-old has told CNN the domestic game may suffer as a result.
"In Germany we have a situation now where Dortmund and Bayern are far, far more away from the other teams, and that's what we don't want to see in the Bundesliga," said Ballack, who has 98 Germany caps to his name.
Shortly before the end of the season it was announced that Mario Gotze -- one of Dortmund's best players -- would be joining Bayern for $49 million, with striker Robert Lewandowski expected to make a similar move in the coming weeks.
Guardiola comes with a reputation as one of the game's leading coaches, but given the standards Bayern set this season, Ballack thinks the Spaniard will struggle to improve the team.
I'm sure he's seen a lot of games, if not all, in the last six months from Bayern Munich, and he knows there's not much to improve.
"But on the other side, like I said, you can't really change a lot because everything works well.
And Ballack, who won one Premier League title and two FA Cups in his four years at Chelsea, and three Bundesliga crowns with Bayern, says his time with Mourinho was a golden spell in his career.
He's a charismatic manager and I really enjoyed working with him for two years and most of the players as well I can say.
And that's what I can say is special, because his attitude, his personality, if he comes in front of the group if he talks to us.
