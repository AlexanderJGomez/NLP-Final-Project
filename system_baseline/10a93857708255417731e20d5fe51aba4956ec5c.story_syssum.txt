Santos said he has been thinking about the possibility of peace ever since the FARC's military commander was killed in 2010.
Then-President Andres Pastrana ceded an area the size of Switzerland to the guerrilla group but ended negotiations after rebels launched a series of attacks across the country in an apparent bid to strengthen their position.
"You can't ask the FARC to simply kneel down, surrender and give us the arms," Santos said.
And that's why there's no cease-fire, no decrease in our military operations, and my government agenda will continue as it was until then."
"President Obama welcomes President Santos' deep commitment to working for peace and recognizes the courage and sacrifice of successive Colombian governments -- and most especially of the Colombian people -- in achieving this milestone," the White House said in September.
