The news of Bergdahl's freedom initially was met with jubilation, but it quickly turned as many called for an investigation into his disappearance and captivity.
When he's not in an office, Bergdahl will live in barracks and share a bathroom with other service members.
At Fort Sam Houston, Bergdahl will have a "sponsor" to help him adjust to Army life again, Manuszewski said, which he called routine for anyone new at the post.
"The stress level is going to increase dramatically," said Rudd, who is now the president of the University of Memphis.
Longtime war correspondent Mike Boettcher, who has worked in Afghanistan, said he believes Bergdahl is going to have a tough time readjusting.
For Bergdahl's family, there will be change, too.
Col. Timothy Marsano, a spokesman for the family, declined to tell CNN if Bergdahl's new job assignment had brought any kind of communication between the soldier and his family.
In mid-June, the FBI said it was investigating threats against Bergdahl's parents.
