Vilseck, Germany (CNN) -- The military released 77,000 of about 87,000 detainees locked up during the Iraq war because there was not enough evidence to hold them, CNN has learned.
A CNN investigation found that frustration over the Army's policy on detainees may have led to the 2007 killings of four Iraqi men by three decorated Army sergeants at a Baghdad canal.
"We're asking them to take basic evidence, which they've been trained to do," said Quantock, who oversees detainee operations in Iraq.
"I think a lot of times we thought the insurgency would dissipate, we were working closely with the government of Iraq, we were trying to improve the Iraqi security forces, but at the end of the day, it didn't work out very well.
The memo spells out that evidence of criminal activity should include photos of "physical evidence," "the detainee at the crime scene or place of capture," as well as photos "of the detainee next to the evidence."
Asked about the killings at the canal, Quantock told CNN: "There's never an excuse to execute anyone.
