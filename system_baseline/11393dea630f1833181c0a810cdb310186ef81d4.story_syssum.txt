Jimenez laced up her sneakers Sunday to pay tribute to her late husband, Army Sgt.
Jimenez, a Huntington Beach, California resident who has run two other marathons, says she runs to keep the memory of her husband alive.
As she prepared for the race, Jimenez wanted people to remember her husband for the man that he was.
Minutes before Jimenez approached the starting line, she shared her angst about the course, which ends with a final hill up to the finish line near the Iwo Jima Memorial.
Security was heightened for Sunday's race due to recent shots fired by an unknown gunman or gunmen at various Marine Corps military sites.
At mile 25, with little strength left, she said she got a rush of energy before making her final quest up the hill.
"Even though that day took away something special, he lives in all these miles," she said afterward.
