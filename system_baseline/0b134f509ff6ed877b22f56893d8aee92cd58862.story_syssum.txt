As "Catching Fire," the second movie in the series, comes to theaters November 22 we've got all the information you need to dazzle friends with your talk of Effie Trinket and Caesar Flickerman in our "HG 101" -- as well as some insider facts about the movie that'll make even the most hardcore fans feel a little more informed before heading into the arena.
With evil monkeys and even more evil victors from previous games to battle, it's a lot for one movie to tackle, but the tributes in "Catching Fire" are more fully-formed characters, and they help set the story apart and keep the conflict interesting.
Yes, the very premise of kids fighting to the death for the public's amusement ensures that there's a dark thread throughout the entire story, but the look and feel of "Fire" is darker as well, with new director Francis Lawrence amping up the action and suspense.
HG 101: So there's this girl Katniss and she's a total badass, and she's basically best buds with the male version of her, Gale (Liam Hemsworth), but she gets sent off to the Hunger Games with Peeta, saves his life a million times and now all the viewers want them to be an item.
The love triangle is what grounds the entire series in reality, and it ain't over until it's over, so don't expect anything to be decided halfway through the series' four-movie run.
While Gale is once again on the sidelines for most of the movie, he does have a particularly haunting scene in "Catching Fire" that stays somewhat true to the book.
While they felt like caricatures in the first movie, "Catching Fire" reveals some chinks in the otherwise bedazzled armor, all thanks to Katniss and her act of rebellion that's now sparked a revolution.
In "The Hunger Games," Effie (Elizabeth Banks) epitomized everything the Capitol stood for: fashion, material things, excess and an obliviousness to the real issues in the districts around them.
With the Panem rebellion in full swing, and Katniss as their poster child, there's more to prove in this 75th Hunger Games than ever before.
