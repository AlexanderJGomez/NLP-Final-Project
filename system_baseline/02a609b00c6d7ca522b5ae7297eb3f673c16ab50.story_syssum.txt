She had migrated from Sri Lanka only weeks earlier to be a domestic worker for a Saudi family.
Her sentence violated international law, which prohibits the death penalty for crimes committed before age 18.
When Rizana traveled to Saudi Arabia, for example, she may not have known that many Saudi employers confiscate domestic workers' passports and confine them inside their home, cutting them off from the outside world and sources of help.
It is unlikely that anyone ever told her about Saudi Arabia's flawed criminal justice system or that while many domestic workers find kind employers who treat them well, others are forced to work for months or even years without pay and subjected to physical or sexual abuse.
Many governments have finally begun to recognize the risks and exploitation domestic workers face.
Perhaps most significantly, eight countries acted in 2012 to ratify -- and therefore be legally bound by -- the Domestic Workers Convention, with more poised to follow suit this year.
The obvious one is for Saudi Arabia to stop its use of the death penalty and end its outlier status as one of only three countries worldwide to execute people for crimes committed while a child.
And they can protect millions of other domestic workers who labor with precariously few guarantees for their safety and rights.
