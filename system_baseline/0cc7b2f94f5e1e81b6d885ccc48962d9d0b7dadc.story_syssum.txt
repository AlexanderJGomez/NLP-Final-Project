Before flying off to the Sundance Film Festival to premiere his latest action-thriller, "Brooklyn's Finest," starring Richard Gere, Ethan Hawke and Don Cheadle, Fuqua, 43, stopped by the CNN newsroom in Hollywood to discuss the making of this film.
Why are you sitting here in our edit bay doing this project?
What else would I be doing except flying to Sundance to promote my movie!
CNN: You were born in the '60s, so you were very young during the civil rights movement.
I don't think you can ever forget Martin Luther King and many other people who sacrificed, whose names we don't even know.
There were a lot of weapons around.
I remember getting on a bus and drivers would treat us disrespectfully, assuming we were going to misbehave.
I don't think they even understood really.
CNN: Did you think there were certain things you couldn't accomplish because you were black?
I remember thinking, "Well, if it's just a matter of money to leave my neighborhood, then I have to make money."
I saw his movies -- "The Seven Samurai" and all that -- and I thought, "Wow, that's even more interesting, because it's a moving picture and you get to tell a story."
CNN: And now you're telling the story of Martin Luther King and Barack Obama.
I thought somewhere down the line it would happen, but not in my time -- because I still deal with racial situations.
So if Hollywood's not ready to embrace more stories about African-Americans -- and that's based on the money that the movies make -- then would the country really be ready to embrace a president?
CNN: As a director, you have this story about an unbelievable presidential election, where a first-term senator wins.
CNN: In the short film you're directing for us, you've drawn the parallel between Obama and Martin Luther King.
Fuqua: It is the passing of the torch between Martin Luther King and Barack Obama.
But more than anything, I would love people to walk away feeling like we've just begun.
