It's a smart backup for when gadgets inevitably need to take naps.
I tested the Powerbag messenger bag for about a month, and I also spent a brief time using the backpack, which is very similar.
When I considered that I keep my phone in my pocket near vital organs, the fear seemed less rational.
On a single charge, it can completely fill about two small gadgets -- a phone and iPod, for example.
I was disappointed to learn that the Powerbag doesn't provide an easy way to charge a laptop, which would have been useful for just a few more minutes of work on Wi-Fi at a coffee shop.
An RFA Brands spokesman said that including a two- or three-prong outlet would require the bag to have a cooling system, which is something the company is not eager to do.
The RFA spokesman said this was only an issue with pre-production models, like the one I tested, and that it's been fixed for the bags sold in stores.
The Powerbag, designed by Ful, is stylish as well as useful, making it a good companion for gadgetheads who don't want to advertise their geekiness.
