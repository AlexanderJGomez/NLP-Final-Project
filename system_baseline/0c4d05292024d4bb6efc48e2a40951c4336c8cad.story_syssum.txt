A seizure disorder caused the death of Jett Travolta, the 16-year-old son of actors John Travolta and Kelly Preston, a source at a Bahamas funeral home told CNN.
As children grow, their bodies and metabolism change, perhaps causing a need to adjust their dosage, said Shinnar, a professor of neurology and pediatrics and director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Management Center at Montefiore.
An autopsy of the actors' son was completed Monday, and the body was cremated that evening, the funeral home source said.
It rules out brain injury, bleeding on brain, skull fractures, rules out heart problems due to Kawasaki disease, which is the disease the Travoltas say their son suffered," he said.
Dr. Cam Patterson, general cardiologist at the University of North Carolina and a genetics expert who follows Kawasaki disease, told CNN, "There is no real good link at all between Kawasaki disease and cleaning products.
"Two, if the artery had enlarged enough, it could be pressing on parts of brain and that could cause seizure.
The next step would have been to conduct more tests, by taking toxicological tests and brain examinations to see what could have caused the seizure.
