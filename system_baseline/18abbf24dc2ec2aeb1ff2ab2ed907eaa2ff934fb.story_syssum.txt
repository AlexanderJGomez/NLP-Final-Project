His Honda bike swerved across the track and he was hit by fellow competitors Colin Edwards and Valentino Rossi.
Lorenzo's misfortune meant Australian Casey Stoner wrapped up the world title with two races still to go, Sunday's race in Malaysia, and the final round in Spain.
Rossi, a seven-time world champion in motorcycling's elite category, left the track devastated by the accident involving his fellow Italian and "good friend" Simoncelli.
The Italian sports community was left stunned by Simoncelli's death and a minute's silence was held at all major events, including Serie A football games.
