That's the question raised by tantalizing evidence published this week by teams trying to find out what happened to famed aviator Amelia Earhart, who vanished along with navigator Fred Noonan during a doomed attempt to fly around the world in 1937.
Louise Foudray, caretaker and historian of the Amelia Earhart Birthplace Museum in Atchison, Kansas, chose her words carefully on Friday afternoon.
One is that Earhart's plane was forced down by the Japanese around the Marshall Islands.
Some think the sonar image could be a man-made object, and others say it could be a geologic feature.
Richard Fredricks, executive director of the American Salvage Association, a trade group, said that "almost anything is possible" these days with advanced technology.
Foudray said she's heard all of the evidence and nothing solid has risen to the surface.
