"In this lawsuit, plaintiffs seek their share of the money collected by defendants as a result of the use of the actors' names and likenesses in connection with merchandising," the document, filed by attorney Jon Pfeiffer in Los Angeles Superior Court, said.
In interviews with CNN earlier this year, the four cast members said they decided to move forward after discovering "Happy Days" slot machines were popping up in casinos around the country in 2008.
The company, which owns the show, said the actors are "attempting to generate a lucrative litigation windfall by riddling their complaint with unsupported and overreaching causes of action" for fraud and breach of good faith.
Instead, it said the actors "were simply ignorant of, or slept upon their own rights.
Since the lawsuit was filed, CBS has sent checks totaling $43,403 in merchandising proceeds to the four actors and Bosley's widow, Patricia.
In addition, from 2008 to January 2011, CBS issued news releases announcing licensing agreements with 14 companies that include gift items, clothing, glassware and bar accessories, the court filing said.
I'm hoping this case gives visibility to not only help us, but to help thousands of other individuals in the entertainment business."
