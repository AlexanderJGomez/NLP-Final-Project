Three years later, he would become one of the most influential U.S. figures working to end a war that had introduced a new euphemism for genocide: ethnic cleansing.
In the ethnically mixed capital, Sarajevo, Holbrooke saw Bosnian Serb forces laying siege to the city to drive out Muslims.
"I thought I'm seeing a color remake of the black and white scenes we'd seen in World War II of Jews signing away their property at the point of a gun and then being shipped off to who knows where," Holbrooke said.
Holbrooke, who had served President Jimmy Carter as an assistant secretary of state, offered his recommendation to Bill Clinton's advisers during the 1992 presidential campaign: Direct use of force against the Bosnian Serbs.
In the back of Holbrooke's mind, there was a lingering question: "Will he do as president what he said he would do as a candidate?"
Instead of getting the Bosnia portfolio, he was named U.S. ambassador to Germany.
Over the course of the next year, Clinton was able to persuade his European allies to at least use limited air strikes against the Bosnia Serbs.
But Holbrooke and others in the administration who advocated force would nonetheless see Bosnia's Muslims endure another 15 months of heartbreak and death -- including the slaughter of 8,000 at Srebrenica.
After eight weeks of NATO bombing, Holbrooke got enough concessions to negotiate an end to 3 Â½ years of war.
"But there are times when you have to use force in order to stop people from being killed in larger numbers, and it seemed to me this was a clear-cut example."
