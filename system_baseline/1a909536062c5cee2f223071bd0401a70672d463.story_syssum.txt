Lille, France (CNN)Former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn conceded Wednesday that his approach to sex is rougher than that of most men, as he took the stand for a second day in his trial in France on aggravated pimping charges.
But the crux of his defense is that he did not know prostitutes were involved.
She later accompanied Strauss-Kahn to his hotel at the request of fellow defendant Fabrice Paszkowski, a businessman friend of the former IMF director, she said.
Strauss-Kahn on Tuesday denied knowing any of the women at the sex parties were prostitutes, saying he was told by Paszkowski that they were "libertines" who liked sex.
Asked about Jade's testimony, Strauss-Kahn maintained that he didn't know she was a prostitute, although she mentioned to him that she was performing dances in a swinger club for money.
She did not sleep with Strauss-Kahn on that trip, she said.
The court also heard excerpts of testimony given previously by two other sex workers, named as Estelle and Marion, who joined a second trip to Washington with Strauss-Kahn.
According to excerpts read out by a magistrate, a witness who was part of that second trip to Washington said he had doubts about the professions of Estelle and Marion after spending time with them.
When asked whether the men of the group knew of their being paid, Helene said, "Even if things weren't told, and considering their status and intelligence, it would have been too good to be true."
That comment came after she wondered aloud about the profession of women at a sex party they'd both attended, Ines said in a statement read in court.
"But I don't consider myself as the organizer of any party whatsoever," he said, adding that he had never asked anyone to organize parties for him.
The trial of Strauss-Kahn, who saw his stellar career plummet to earth after a separate sex scandal that resulted in his arrest in New York in 2011, opened in Lille just over a week ago.
