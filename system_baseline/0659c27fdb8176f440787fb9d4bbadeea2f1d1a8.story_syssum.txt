Thirty-six officers from the Tucson, Arizona, Police Department are in Pittsburgh as part of the G-20 security force.
Officers from departments in several cities, including Cleveland, Ohio; Miami Metro Dade, Florida; Baltimore, Maryland; and Chicago, Illinois, were sworn in as part of the massive security effort, but Tucson wins the prize for the greatest distance traveled.
The downtown Pittsburgh street on a morning with temperatures in the 50s was nothing like a typical day for the officers.
The additional help protecting downtown locations "gives Pittsburgh the flexibility to send its officers where needed," Sayre said.
