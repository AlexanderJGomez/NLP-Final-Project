A spokesman for Brooke Army Medical Center, Dewey Mitchell, said four patients were taken to the hospital's trauma unit.
Although it was not immediately clear whether others were taken elsewhere, Wiley said that University Health System and Brooke Army Medical Center are the two trauma centers in San Antonio and would receive patients in situations such as Tuesday's crash.
Video from the scene showed the bus lying on its side in the highway's grassy median, with clothing and other items scattered on the ground nearby.
Mark Baldon, who came upon the crash shortly after it happened Tuesday morning, said he saw the bus "smoldering," CNN affiliate KSAT reported.
