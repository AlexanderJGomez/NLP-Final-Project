Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Sala saunters in the red soil, her wrinkled skin glistening in the sun as she tries to keep up with the rest of the herd.
The baby elephant was found wandering, alone and confused, after her mother died of starvation, her caretaker said.
The facility has more than 20 elephants in Nairobi and more at another center in Tsavo National Park, where they are also rehabilitated.
"After working with these elephants, it's no longer just a job," said Edwin Lusichi, the chief keeper.
