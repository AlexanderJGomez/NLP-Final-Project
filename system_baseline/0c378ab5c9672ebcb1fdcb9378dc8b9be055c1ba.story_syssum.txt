For fans who have grown to love Posey's trademark dry wit and pitch perfect edginess, Susan lands squarely in the wheelhouse.
During a recent conversation with CNN, Posey discussed her new role, explained her take on the public's misconceptions about working in Hollywood and confessed the whoops moment that just may have cost her Angelina Jolie's Oscar.
But, I do like to show things that maybe most people wouldn't want to show of themselves, where people can judge you and you're not perfect.
So, maybe that's where you're getting that kind of fearlessness.
She has a really strong appetite, even more than these men that are around her and she's hungry for more!
And she doesn't have those things that make a woman powerful like vulnerability and sensitivity and intuition.
Doesn't that seem like a very American thing to do?
Posey: It's a really laid-back thing like cooking or having friends over and just talking.
I can't really watch it, I just get too, there's so much that needs to be done, I get kind of down about politics.
CNN: I wonder what Susan's reaction would be to all the men talking about women's issues.
Posey: What I did pass on that may surprise you is "Girl Interrupted."
CNN: Oh, I could definitely see you in that role.
They probably wanted me to audition and I didn't feel like doing it, or maybe they wanted me to jump through hoops and I didn't feel like doing it.
