(CNN) -- Sergio Garcia leads The Barclays, first leg of the lucrative FedEx Cup playoffs, after Saturday's excellent third round that puts him firmly in contention for the title.
Garcia hit a number of birdies to finish two ahead of the chasing pack, but it was a tremendous shot from the long grass on the tenth that stood out as Garcia chipped on to the fairway after hooking his shot well wide.
However, two bogeys on the back nine, after a fine birdie on the 13th, left the American one stroke over for the day.
The Northern Irishman had disappointed on Friday when he struck five bogeys to undo a promising first round.
