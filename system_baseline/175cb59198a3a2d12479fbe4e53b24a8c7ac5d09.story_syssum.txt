Arielle Spiridigliozzi is one of 350 students who have contracted H1N1 at the University of Kansas.
For more than a day, the girls have been stuck in their suite, on what they call "lockdown."
Spiridigliozzi has abided by the the university's request, worried that she could infect another.
It wasn't like I was licking the handlebars of the bus or anything," she said.
But she only has to look to her roommates for an answer, as illness has rapidly made its way through her suite.
Then a fourth roommate got sick, illustrative of a spreading flu pattern the girls said is obvious from the empty seats in classes.
Spiridigliozzi and Perry will get to wander outdoors again once their fevers have dissipated for at least 24 hours without the aid of fever-reducing medications, they said.
With all this free time, at least the freshmen -- on campus for only two weeks -- aren't falling too far behind in their school work.
"Yeah, I've gotten all my homework done for the next two weeks, probably," added Spiridigliozzi.
