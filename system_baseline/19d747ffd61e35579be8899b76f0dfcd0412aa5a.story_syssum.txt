Access to the Internet and social media websites mean kids can be bullied and tormented around the clock, even in the supposed safety of their own homes.
I first started reporting on the problem of bullying a few years ago when a rash of suicides of children propelled the issue into the national spotlight.
There are not just bullies and victims.
All too often those bystanders fail to intervene, fail to stand up and say "enough is enough."
Increasing empathy and understanding is one of the greatest weapons we have to reduce bullying.
