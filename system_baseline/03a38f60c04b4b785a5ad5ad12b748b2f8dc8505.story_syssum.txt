New York (CNN) -- Police are investigating the slaying of a 32-year-old man in the Greenwich Village neighborhood early Saturday as a hate crime because the gunman made multiple anti-gay comments, they said.
The gunman confronted the two men again, before shooting Carson in the face, police said.
Police said the suspect had forged identification and they used facial recognition technology to determine his true identity.
The identities of the suspect's two companions -- at least one of whom Kelly said left the suspect before the shooting -- are still not known.
On May 10, five men brutally beat two gay men near Madison Square Garden after the couple was denied entry into an after-hours billiards bar, according to Port Authority Police.
Kelly said authorities do not believe the acts are connected, but the investigations are ongoing.
