Washington (CNN) -- John Hinckley Jr.'s relationships with women and his difficulties becoming part of a community away from a government mental hospital were spotlighted Thursday during a hearing to discuss whether the man who tried to kill President Ronald Reagan will eventually be allowed to live as an outpatient.
Hinckley has been spending 10 days a month visiting his mother in Williamsburg, Virginia, where he works part time as a volunteer in the library at Eastern State Hospital, a mental health facility.
Since Hinckley likes music and plays the guitar, one of his doctors suggested he go play for hospice patients.
Jones said Hinckley, when in Williamsburg, had not been interested in going to a gym or participating in certain sports like golf or tennis, either because of arthritis or because he finds the activities unappealing.
But Murphy said Hinckley seems to have coped adequately when rejected in social situations and is "not showing signs of isolation."
Chasson said Secret Service agents will testify they kept an eye on Hinckley in Williamsburg during the short periods of time earlier this year when he was allowed free time on his own.
According to Chasson, the agents will testify about several occasions when Hinckley deviated from agreed-upon plans for how he would spend his time.
The judge may then take some period of time to review the testimony before issuing his ruling on the hospital's plan to gradually allow Hinckley greater freedom.
Brady and his wife became advocates for gun control.
