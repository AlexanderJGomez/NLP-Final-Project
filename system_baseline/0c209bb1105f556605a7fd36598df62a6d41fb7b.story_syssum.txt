But its economy -- which is heavily reliant on commodities, particularly oil and gas, was growing just 1.3% last year compared to 2012, one of the sharpest slowdowns in the emerging markets.
But the eurozone itself has only just emerged from its own crisis, and is wary of cutting ties with such a powerful economic partner.

Export and import bans or restrictions that apply to specific products such as oil or diamonds, flights restrictions or investment freezes have been successful in the past.
