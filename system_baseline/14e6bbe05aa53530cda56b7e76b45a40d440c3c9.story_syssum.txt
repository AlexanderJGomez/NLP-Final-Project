"My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the Americans are not your enemy," Obama said in an interview with Al-Arabiya, the Dubai-based satellite television network.
During his run for the White House, Obama pledged to improve ties with the Muslim world, draw down U.S. troops in Iraq and close the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
The Obama administration also has taken an early interest in the Middle East peace process between the Israelis and the Palestinians, with the president naming former Sen. George Mitchell as his special envoy to the region.
Obama said the United States will start by listening, not dictating, and then a response will be formulated after consultations with all the major parties involved.
Hamid said the real litmus test for the Muslim world is what Obama does with the crisis in Gaza.
