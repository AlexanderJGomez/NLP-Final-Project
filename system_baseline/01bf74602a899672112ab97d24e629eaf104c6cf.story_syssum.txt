The study authors predicted that if similar studies were conducted in other countries, the prevalance estimates would also go up.
In the United States, the most recent estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for autism prevalence are about 1% or 1 in 110 children, based on population studies in a select number of areas around the country.
All 294 children already enrolled in special education or on the disability registry were considered to have tested positive for an autism spectrum disorder.
Kim said she believes if more studies like this are done in other countries, they, too, will find an autism rate of 2-3%, while acknowledging that more research needs to be done to validate the study results.
Grinker said he would compare the situation in South Korea to where the United States was 20 years ago, as far as autism awareness goes.
Vanderbilt University's director of the Treatment and Research Institute for Autism Spectrum Disorders (TRIAD), believes the new data adds to what's already been known about ASD in other parts of the world -- that autism is not rare.
"We have to be careful not to confuse them with other conditions that can also cause problems in these realms like ADHD and social anxiety disorders," he said.
Many of the children who were identified with an autism spectrum disorder through this study were found to have a higher IQ, but had poor socialization skills, one of the hallmarks of autism.
Dawson also believes that the study clearly confirms that autism is a significant global public health concern that transcends cultural, geographic and ethnic boundaries.
