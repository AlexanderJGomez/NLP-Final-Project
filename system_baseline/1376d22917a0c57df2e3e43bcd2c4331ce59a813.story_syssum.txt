The NTSB identified the problem as a cracked fan midshaft on a Dreamliner General Electric GEnx-1B turbofan engine, the group said in a written statement posted on its website Thursday.
In a third related development, a similar General Electric engine on a different kind of aircraft -- a GEnx-2B on a Boeing 747 -- lost power during takeoff last September 11 at Shanghai Pudong International Airport.
United Airlines is scheduled to begin flying the first U.S. domestic routes for the aircraft in November.
Among other touted features, it's the first commercial airliner made mostly of light-weight carbon composites, requiring less fuel than conventional airliners.
