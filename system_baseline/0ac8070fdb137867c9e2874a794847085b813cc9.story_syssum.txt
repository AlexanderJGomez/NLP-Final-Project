On Tuesday, Islamabad decided to reopen the crucial supply routes shut down on November 27, a day after coalition forces mistakenly killed 24 Pakistani troops.
The talks to reopen routes had been stuck on two key issues -- Pakistan's demand to charge more per container shipped across its border, and Pakistan's demand that the United States apologize for the friendly fire incident in November 2011.
Until her apology, the U.S. government had only expressed regret over the incident, but had not issued a direct apology.
The U.S. halted paying the bills from Pakistan as tension rose between the two countries.
Transporters who resume supplies will be "considered a friend of the U.S." and will face the consequences, a spokesman for the militant group said Wednesday.
