(CNN) -- Amanda Wagner and Jessica Tuttle turn 50 this year, but they're not letting age hold them back from their favorite exercise: running.
Conventional wisdom holds that the pounding from years of running leads to excessive wear and tear on the body as we age,  resulting in joint injuries, knee replacements or arthritis.
But a study out of Stanford University that looked at healthy aging runners found that running did not damage joints or leave runners less able to exercise.
That includes not running through pain, and resting if you have an injury, something Tuttle takes seriously.
Beyond the good news about aging joints, the Stanford researchers also discovered some surprising overall health benefits for senior runners when they compared them with non-runners of the same age: Those in the running group were less likely to die from heart trouble, stroke, cancer, neurological diseases or infection.
"Members of the running group, it took them 16 years longer to reach certain levels of disability," says Chakravarty.
"Running is not the only thing that's going to make you live longer and be healthier; it's actually probably engaging in any kind of exercise that people enjoy," notes Chakravarty.
"And I do expect and hope to be running when I'm 60 and when I'm 70 -- I truly do."
