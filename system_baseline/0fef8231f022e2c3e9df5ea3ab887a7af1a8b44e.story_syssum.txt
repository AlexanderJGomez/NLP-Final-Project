A family member found John Chakalos, 87, in his home in Windsor, Connecticut, according a Windsor police department press release.
The Christmas exhibition takes up approximately half of the couple's 86-acre property and includes 6 million lights, said Joy Washburn, the property's caretaker.
For the past five years, the family has invited the public to drive through the estate and requested visitors donate money or nonperishable food for Joan's Food Pantry.
The extravagant display includes a lifesize Victorian-style village, complete with houses, a hotel and a general store; a 22-foot Santa to greet visitors when they enter the property; and a Nativity scene, among numerous other decorations.
