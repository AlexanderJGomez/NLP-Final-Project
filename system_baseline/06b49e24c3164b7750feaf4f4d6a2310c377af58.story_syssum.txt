At a time when his friends are settled down with families, the original surfing pin-up boy is still scoring perfect 10s on the international circuit.
Aged 20 he became the youngest person to win the Surfing World Championship, smashing the record books again when he also became the oldest person to win the title at 39.
Indeed, Slater is one of the few professional surfers to have transcended the niche sports magazines to the society pages, appearing in dozens of films and starring in hit 1990s TV show Baywatch.
Surfing is more than a career for Slater -- it's a spiritual experience, providing solace and filling him with a sense of wonder at nature.
You become hyper aware of a lot of different things -- the way the wave is breaking, timing, putting yourself in the right part of the barrel.
But along with the thrills come huge dangers, with Slater admitting that many of his friends have drowned while surfing.
Life's worth experiences and it's worth the people in your life too," he said.
And you get the feeling his obsession with the water has little to do with the $3.5 million in prize money he's earned.
We travel around the whole world just to do that.
He may have been playing the same ball game over more than four decades, but when it comes to surfing, Slater's love is as deep as the ocean.
