McLaughlin's girlfriend, Allison Dressler, says she found it hard to cook in the beginning of their relationship due to their different diet meal plans.

McLaughlin now goes to work more than two hours earlier than he used to and finishes earlier, which has increased his productivity.
His energy has also increased dramatically; he no longer lies in bed watching The Food Network until the afternoon.
