Dan Glass was at 10 Downing Street to receive a charity's award for his work on transportation issues when he staged the unusual protest.
Glass is affiliated with the group Plane Stupid, which campaigns against airport expansion and climate change.
"I just wanted a few more minutes of his time to get the message across, because he's not listening to communities affected by airport expansion," Glass told CNN on Wednesday.
Glass said he was allowed to remain at the prime minister's residence for about 40 minutes after the event.
Members are encouraged to take direct but non-violent action against the aviation industry, a sector they describe as "one of the root causes of climate change."
