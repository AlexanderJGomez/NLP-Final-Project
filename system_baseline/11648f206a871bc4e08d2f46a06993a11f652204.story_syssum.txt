"The two raids over the weekend show that President Obama remains very comfortable deploying special operations forces in countries the United States is not at war with as a means to combat terrorist groups, just as he is comfortable with the use of CIA drones for the same purpose in countries such as Pakistan and Yemen," says CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen.
And fighting an enemy who has incredible geographic span and seems to pop up everywhere there's a new crisis," says Brannen, now a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
Both Gerges and Brannen believe President Obama was reluctant to take military action against Syria, even though he pushed reluctant lawmakers and the American public to support his call for strikes.
The president was under pressure from some in "the foreign policy establishment" and from certain U.S. allies including Saudi Arabia and Turkey, Gerges argues.
"In the sense that the word has typically been used to describe a president's vision for managing national security challenges around the world, I don't think Obama has a doctrine," says Pletka, who identifies herself as conservative.
"I am always able to predict that he will do less than is necessary while dressing it in the glorying admiration of his own self-perception," she says.
"Every American foreign policy 'doctrine' but one was formulated during the Cold War, for a bipolar world, when American policy toward one country -- the Soviet Union -- dominated all U.S. strategy and was the defining aspect of global affairs.
Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton had a doctrine that helped guide U.S. foreign policy, says Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group.
During a recent speech to the U.N. General Assembly, Obama did not mention East Asia except for a single reference to China in regard to Iran, Bremmer says.
