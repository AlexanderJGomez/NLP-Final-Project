That's how it all started, thus confirming what I've always said: "Kiddie pools are not toys, and should only be used as giant, outdoor toilets."
So, Bonten, now 53, settled in to the fact that he would be losing his right leg -- a harsh reality for an otherwise healthy and active man.
"It's my leg," he told me over the phone.
For safety and sanitation reasons, they're usually required to incinerate them.
Body parts can also be buried during some sort of official funeral (and, perhaps, exhumed) with proper legal oversight.
Still, he wanted his leg, for he had a crazy idea.
Thus, Bonten and the hospital entered a complicated period of legal negotiations, where they finally came to a mutual agreement after a strange set of circumstances.
Thus, the leg was then couriered to van de Goot as specified by the law.
Eventually, as Bonten's story became an even bigger media sensation, a designer named William Schaper Kotter decided to reach out and offer his services to complete the vision.
Surrounding that cylinder are metal bars, symbolizing two years of physical "imprisonment" suffered by Bonten while the leg deteriorated.
And on the top sits a large remote-controlled LED light, flanked by two metal wings, honoring Bonten's upcoming freedom from the help of a new limb.
Because, before all this, he played soccer.
So, he decided to sell his lamp on eBay for â‚¬100,000 -- an endeavor that lasted not even two days before the online bidding site rejected his listing.
So, until somebody comes to him with an offer, Bonten will just keep it at home, where he just returned after a lengthy stint in rehab.
And if he wants to cover the foot with a dirty, used sock ... sadly, I know just the place.
