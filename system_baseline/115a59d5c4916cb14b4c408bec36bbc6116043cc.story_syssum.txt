A mirror that Michael Jackson looked into as he dressed in his final months and onto which he scribbled a message to himself sold for $18,750 at auction in Beverly Hills this weekend.
It was not known which child wrote the chalk note, but Julien's Executive Director Martin Nolan said his research suggested it was from Paris, who was 11 when her father died.
Dr. Murray's defense lawyers argued during the trial that the intense pressure on Jackson to rehearse for the 50 shows put him in a desperate fight for sleep, which led to Murray administering the surgical anesthetic propofol nearly every night in the last two months of his life.
Julien's backed away from selling the bed in which Jackson received the fatal dose of the propofol after a personal request from his mother, Katherine Jackson, Nolan said.
The singer sued the auction company, claiming he did not authorize the sale of items that were removed from Neverland after he sold the ranch.
