(CNN) -- A firefighter shot by a sniper in upstate New York calmly described his wounds as "eventually mortal" unless he got medical help soon, although paramedics were kept away because the shooter could still be near Monday morning.
The shots came across the street from the burning house and car that were set on fire by the shooter, 62-year-old William Spengler, police said.
With the help of two residents of the neighborhood, Hofstetter eventually left the scene in his Chevy Trailblazer, the vehicle he drove there in response to the initial fire call 35 minutes earlier.
Hofstetter and firefighter Theodore Scardino survived their gunshot wounds and were "convalescing and doing as well as I would expect at this stage," a doctor at University of Rochester Hospital said Wednesday.
"Nick was in the dispatch center and heard the entire ordeal play out over the scanners," Sienkiewicz said.
Kaczowka, who was also a 911 dispatcher, had been with the West Webster Fire Department for just more than a year, Sienkiewicz said.
Spengler left a typewritten note behind saying he hoped to burn down his neighborhood and kill as many people as possible, Pickering said.
Spengler was especially attentive to his mother, who passed away in October, a former neighbor, Roger Vercruysse said, visiting her every day in a nursing home until she died.
"The system failed all of us again," she said, adding that her family grieved for the fallen firefighters -- one of whom her two daughters knew from school -- and Cheryl Spengler.
