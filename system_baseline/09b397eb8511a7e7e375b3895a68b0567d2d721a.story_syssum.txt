Paris (CNN) -- New French President Francois Hollande tightened his grip on power Monday as the Interior Ministry confirmed that his Socialist party and its allies won an absolute majority in parliamentary elections Sunday.
Hollande has already introduced some of his programs, which are centered on growth and spending, not austerity, reversing Sarkozy's policies.
Other reforms include raising the minimum wage, a partial return to retirement at the age of 60 and increasing the value-added tax on goods sold in stores.
Hollande became France's first Socialist president since FranÃ§ois Mitterrand left office in 1995 as he swept to election victory over the incumbent Sarkozy, one of the most U.S.-friendly French presidents in decades.
