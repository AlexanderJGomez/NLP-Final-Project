"The upper level outside is really crowded with protesters and for the most part they're kind of quiet and polite," Gannon said from the airport.
The People's Alliance for Democracy , which is leading the protests, said it will not end its occupation of the airports until the prime minister resigns.
Protesters with golf clubs and long wooden sticks clashed with airport taxi drivers, with each side throwing objects at the other.
"When we took the exit there were lots of tourists standing around wondering what they were going to do."
Gannon said she's heard nothing from airport personnel and her quest for answers is hurt even more by the fact that many people in the airport speak no English.
The airlines have also been mum on the situation, Gannon said, making it difficult for them to decide whether to wait it out at the airport or try to find a hotel.
Gannon said she and her new spouse just hope to get home sometime in the near future.
