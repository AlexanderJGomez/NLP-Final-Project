Sarah Palin's supporters call her most visible legacy as mayor of her hometown left the town paying inflated prices for the land and huge legal bills, according to court records.
But the city never obtained clear property to the title until this year, after a lengthy court battle with developer Gary Lundgren, who owned part of the land on which the complex sits.
Diane Woodruff, a City Council member and longtime Palin critic, said that has left Palin's major campaign pitch -- to be a fiscally conservative reformer -- in question.
Lundgren purchased 325 acres from the Nature Conservancy, but the city filed a lawsuit claiming ownership of land it believed it owned.
Lundgren said he offered to give the city a 20-acre parcel to avoid further lawsuits, but city officials turned him down.
Palin's successor as mayor, Diane Keller, said the project has brought in more than $3 million in revenue for local businesses.
It may have been a part of Sarah Palin's dream, but it wasn't only her dream," Keller said.
