His athletic grace has won him fans wherever he has performed, and his dedication to the art continues to bring ballet to new audiences.
From a young age Kumakawa had been keen to see the world and the arrival of foreign guest tutors at his school only reinforced those desires.
In the spring of 1989 he turned professional, becoming the first Asian dancer to join the Royal Ballet Company (RBC) -- his first solo part was the leading mandolin player in "Romeo and Juliet."
He quickly became a Soloist, dancing the Act 1 pas de trois in Tchaikovsky's 'Swan Lake' and completed a memorable performance as the Bronze Idol in La Bayad√®re -- a cameo role that showcased his extraordinary jumping ability.
Not only had he upped sticks in the middle of a season, he also took five of the Royal Ballet's star male performers with him to Japan.
Greeted as a returning hero in his native country, Kumakawa took on the roles of leading dancer, teacher, artistic director and company manager simultaneously.
But he expects to be back on stage next year, delighting audiences with virtuoso performances once again.
