(CNN) -- Hasbro announced plans Monday to unveil a black and silver Easy-Bake Oven after meeting with the New Jersey teen who started a campaign asking the toy maker to offer the product in gender-neutral packaging.
The company did not say whether it would change the packaging to include boys in its marketing.
The new design will be unveiled at the New York Toy Fair in February with the rest of Hasbro's new products for the year, the company said.
Others, including the Toy Industry Association, said toys come in different colors based on feedback from consumers and retailers.
