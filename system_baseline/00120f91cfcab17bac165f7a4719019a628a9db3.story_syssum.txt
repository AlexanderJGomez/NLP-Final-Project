Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Rebels in Tripoli furiously hunting for signs of longtime Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi are exploring a network of tunnels and bunkers built beneath his massive compound.
It also is thought to extend to a neighborhood where Gadhafi forces were lobbing shells recently toward the compound after it was taken over by the rebels.
Another room contained videotapes lined up on a shelf, part of a TV studio where Gadhafi may have recorded messages.
"There is literally a city under here."
