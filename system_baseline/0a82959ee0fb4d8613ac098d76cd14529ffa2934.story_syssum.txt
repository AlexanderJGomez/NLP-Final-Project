"And when these two options failed, we had to open fire selectively into the area, and this actually stopped those Syrians from reaching the Israeli-Syrian fence."
The Syrian state news agency said 23 people were killed and more than 350 wounded in the protests, which continued past nightfall.
As many as 500 people took part in the demonstration, holding mid-day prayers on the Syrian side of the border, then crouching down behind ramparts that Israel constructed in response to similar demonstrations three weeks ago.
Leibovich accused Syria of trying to use the protests to create a diversion "from the bloodshed that is taking place inside Syria," where the United Nations says a crackdown against anti-government protests has left more than 1,000 dead.
Demonstrators arrived in at least eight buses before the protest began, then came down from a hill known locally as "Shouting Hill" -- where people shout to family and friends on the other side of the border -- toward the ramparts Israeli forces constructed last month.
