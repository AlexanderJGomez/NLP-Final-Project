The goal, as the project name spells out in even-Ke$ha-can-understand terms (sorry, Ke$ha, I'm sure you're smart, but that dollar sign ...), was to bump Hawaii off the bottom of that list.
In the end, both Hawaii and West Virginia registered turnout rates of 44.2%*, according to Michael McDonald, an associate professor at George Mason University who runs a site called the United States Election Project.
A polling place volunteer at one elementary school told me he had to start handing out Japanese-language ballots to English speakers just to keep the line moving.
The state should institute same-day voter registration and other reforms that would encourage new voters to go to the polls.
This project received ample coverage in local news, and for that I'm very grateful to websites like Civil Beat and TV stations like KITV for spreading the word about Hawaii's low voter turnout rate.
They're people like Elle Cochran, who never voted until an issue moved her so much that she decided to run for office.
There are people like that in every state, working to make the U.S. government more accountable to all of its people.
*Data nerd note: The voter turnout rates are rounded to one decimal place because of a margin of error associated with voting-eligible population data and with prison population estimates, McDonald said.
