Yet just three months on, the British Head of State's eldest granddaughter would find herself back on that familiar saddle competing once more.
Phillips' performance in France, which among the UK riders was only bettered by world No.
1 William Fox-Pitt, could well be enough to persuade Britain's Olympic selectors that she is worthy of a spot in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.
Yet despite now being a fully-fledged Olympian, the 33-year-old Zara still feels she has some unfinished business to attend to when she, if all goes to plan, touches down in Rio in two years' time.
Come 2016, Mia -- who will be superseded as the youngest member of Britain's royal family when William's wife Catherine gives birth for the second time -- could be watching her mother's bid to win gold, having already spent time on the equestrian circuit.
Having admitted to not feeling maternal before Mia's birth, Phillips has since treasured the experience of becoming a mother for the first time.
Phillips has had plenty of experience developing special bonds down the years, having nurtured a number of relationships with her horses since being introduced to riding as a child by her equine-loving family.
Olympic success came alongside High Kingdom, and he could well be Phillips' partner in Rio, given that she rode the bay gelding in Normandy.
"I think you get to see the signs when things are really good and when things aren't so good," Phillips reflects.
She remains ever-indebted to the role her family have played in helping to lay the foundations for her successful career.
Obviously we're very grateful to our family and hobbies and traditions, and the love and passion they've got for the horses has filtered down through the years."
