(CNN)There seems to be an ever-growing list of people, places and things that will turn you gay.
This level of ignorance is so last century, so near-irrelevant, that I'm hesitant even to respond.
That's OK, as long as you aren't hateful about it, are willing to listen and don't try to restrict the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.
(In fact, he later apologized, regretting his words but saying the science on the issue of sexual orientation isn't clear.)
This apparently still needs to be said: Being gay is not a choice.
I'm not going to roll through all the details, but Mark Joseph Stern from Slate sums it up pretty well: "In study after study, biologists have found that homosexuality, at least in men, is clearly, undoubtedly, inarguably an inborn trait."
It's also an issue that, along with transgender rights and employment discrimination against LGBT people, should be a focal point in the 2016 campaign cycle.
But the point remains that saying so both belittles a serious issue of violence -- that of men raping other men in prison, which has nothing to do with turning anyone gay and everything to do with criminal activity.
And the American people damn sure shouldn't have to listen to it.
