His toddler may be a bit young for cautionary tales, but Avasthi fully understands the risks and rewards of kids and pets sharing a household.
As a doctor who specializes in child and adolescent psychiatry, he has seen kids transform in the presence of pets.
"Kids naturally do things that upset cats and dogs — hugging, staring, petting on the head," says animal behaviorist Kristen Collins of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA.org).
Take measures to help prevent emotional scars after a pet bites or scratches your child.
ASPCA.org provides guidelines, photos and safety tips to help kids and parents recognize signs — such as flattened ears or wrinkled forehead — that indicate distress.
She also recommends that kids and parents practice the proper way to pet a cat or dog using stuffed animals.
During subsequent sessions, kids watch videos of pets and gradually interact with an adult cat or dog.
"Then the child is not afraid and doesn't learn the wrong behaviors," Avasthi says.
Encourage a healthy respect for Mother Nature: "Educate kids that our house pets — even though domesticated and pets — they are animals," Avasthi says.
