Al-Askari said he would push for the Iraqi government to contest the contract renewal.
Al-Askari said there is a general mood of displeasure within the Iraqi government because of the contract renewal.

Starr said new rules and an agreement between the State Department and U.S. military have improved coordination and the supervision of contractors.

"I am up to this point very satisfied with the changes we have seen," Starr said.
Blackwater spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell declined to comment, referring all questions to the State Department.
