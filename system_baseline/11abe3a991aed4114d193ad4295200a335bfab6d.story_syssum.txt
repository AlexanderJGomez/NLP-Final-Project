Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- Three top allies of Ivory Coast's former president, Laurent Gbagbo, have been arrested in less than a week, raising political tension in the West African nation, where the nation's army has been hit by weeks of attacks.
Oureto said the series of arrests against the party's high-ranking officials is intended to "behead the Front Populaire Ivoirien."
Ivory Coast's authorities say Gbagbo's supporters are behind the attacks, intended to destabilize the West African country, which is recovering from a five-month post-election crisis that killed more than 3,000 people last year.
The political standoff was sparked last year when Gbagbo refused to acknowledge his defeat in a November 2010 presidential election and hand over power to Ouattara.
The Front Populaire Ivoirien's headquarters in Abidjan also were attacked on August 18, and the party has accused the government of staging that incident.
Ghana's authorities said Monday they are studying a possible extradition of Katinan.
