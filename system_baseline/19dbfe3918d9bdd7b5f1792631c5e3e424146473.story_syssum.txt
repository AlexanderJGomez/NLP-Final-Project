A grand jury identified Eric Rivera Jr. as the shooter in the death of NFL star Sean Taylor.
Rivera was armed during the alleged burglary, and "during the course of the commission of the offense ... discharged a firearm and as a result of the discharge, death or great bodily harm was inflicted upon Sean Maurice Taylor, a human being," the indictment says.
Taylor, 24, died a day after he was shot during an apparent burglary at his home.
Authorities have said Garcia told police she was hiding under the bedding during the attack, did not see what happened and could not provide a suspect description.
He suffered a sprained right knee in a November 11 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles and had not played since.
He was regarded as one of the hardest-hitting players in the NFL.
