(CNN) -- Clashes broke out Saturday as far-right groups from across Europe gathered in Denmark for a rally they said was meant to make their governments act against the threat of Islamic extremism.
The far-right rally brought together protesters from the Danish Defense League, as well as smaller groups from Scandinavian countries, Germany, Poland, Eastern Europe and the United Kingdom.
We believe in fair criticism of Islam and in the defence of our cultures, our nations, and the rights and freedoms that they have long protected."
Racists and neo-Nazis are not welcome, and those supporting the rally have signed an agreement against extremism, it said.
