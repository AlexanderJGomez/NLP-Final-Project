Mohammed had survived more than a decade on the run, at least one attempt on his life, and a $5 million price on his head for planning the 1998 attacks on the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
Only when they discovered cell phones, a South African passport, a substantial amount of cash and a laptop did they realize this was someone of significance.
Operationally, Mohammed was one of al Qaeda's most effective figures: a bombmaker with aliases, multiple passports and disguises that enabled him to move in and out of Somalia.
Several of the foreign jihadists have come from the United States, with at least two (one from Minneapolis and one from Seattle) carrying out suicide bombings.
"Fazul Mohammed was certainly one of the key members of the al Qaeda old guard," says Candyce Kelshall of the Center for Security and Intelligence Studies at the University of Buckingham in England.
And a recent offensive by Somali troops backed by AMISOM firepower has pushed al-Shabaab out of several districts of the capital -- for now.
The closest the United States came to killing Mohammed appears to have been a strike early in 2007 on a coastal village close to the Kenyan border.
But al-Shabaab is well-entrenched in central and southern Somalia, where a few dollars are enough to recruit young men with no hope of a job.
According to intelligence sources, al-Shabaab's revenues include taxes levied at ports like Kismayu, cash from the Somali diaspora and possibly a levy on pirates' ransoms.
