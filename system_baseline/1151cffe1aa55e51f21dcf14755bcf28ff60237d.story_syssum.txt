The camp was opened less than a month ago to receive Syrians fleeing the violence in their country.
As fighting has escalated around Syria's southern city of Dara'a, where the uprising began almost 18 months ago, the number of refugees here is increasing dramatically.
One 7-year old girl told me she saw her neighbor's throat cut in front of her.
Wasfeyah, a refugee mother of five children, told me that when her family was trying to escape to Jordan, they were shot at and her eldest son, Ali, was hit in the head by a bullet.
Ali survived and they made it across the border, but his little brother often wakes up screaming "there is blood on my shirt."
The quality of the food has been a major complaint from many refugees in the camps.
It is not just a discomfort, but it has become a health issue and camp doctors report that they are seeing many cases of respiratory problems, especially in infants and small children, due to the dust.
The camp has been bringing in tons of gravel that is being spread on the ground to help alleviate the problem.
Water is currently being trucked into the camps from local wells in the community, but Mercy Corps will be drilling a new well and developing a water system with other organizations that will serve the camp, and alleviate the need to take scarce water from the host community.
