(CNN) -- Anna Hazare, the 74-year-old Indian activist set to begin a 15-day hunger strike at a public venue, delivered a message Thursday to the thousands who have taken to the streets in support of his anti-corruption crusade.
Bedi, a former police adviser, wrote in a tweet posting a link to the video, "It was destiny doing this.
Hazare was planning to go on a hunger strike to call for stronger anti-corruption measures when he was detained Tuesday.
Hazare only recently rose to national prominence, as his protest seems to have struck a chord with Indian society across the spectrum because corruption is pervasive at all levels of government, observers say.
Hazare's detention appears to have added to his popularity, because it makes it look like the government is going after the messenger rather than offering solutions.
A magistrate sent Hazare and seven supporters to jail after they failed to post bail, according to Rajan Bhagat, a police spokesman in New Delhi.
The group had refused to leave the prison office until they are allowed to hold their hunger strike without the conditions, the jail spokesman said.
"Our government acknowledges the right of citizens to hold peaceful protests," he said, adding that Hazare and his supporters would have been allowed to hold their protest fast if they had accepted the conditions.
"Any silence will be misinterpreted as the United States looking the other way when it comes to the importance of basic rights like freedom of expression and peaceful assembly in India.
In his video, Hazare warned that more arrests could lie ahead.
"I will not stop, as long as there's breath in my body, until this becomes law," Hazare said.
