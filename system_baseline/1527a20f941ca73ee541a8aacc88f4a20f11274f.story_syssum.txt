(CNN) -- Lexi Thompson struggled to describe her delight after she won the Navistar LPGA Classic on Sunday to become the female golf tour's youngest-ever winner.
Thompson was accompanied on the course by her father and caddy Scott, and the world number 124 said it was an emotional experience to walk up the final fairway with her Dad.
Thompson received a check for $195,000 for her historic win, and the youngster pledged to donate $20,000 to the Wounded Warrior Project -- the tournament's official charity, which helps wounded members of the Armed Forces.
"Well, I think they deserve it," said Thompson.
Angela Stanford finished in third position, one shot back from Joh, with the U.S.'s Brittany Lang and Karen Stupples of England tied for fourth position on 10-under.
