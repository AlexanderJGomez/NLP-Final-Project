The passengers -- who did not know each other before the Monday flight from West Palm Beach, Florida, to White Plains, New York, but were seated in the same section of the plane -- say the incident started during boarding when a male flight attendant began roughly handling bags in the overhead bin.
The passengers said the flight attendant then began to get angry and told them to leave the plane, according to WPTV.
Palm Beach County sheriff's deputies were called to the scene and stood by as the women exited the plane and went to another gate, said Eric Davis, a spokesman for the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office.
As we often do in these situations, we will take this opportunity to review the reports and take away any key learnings that we might uncover."
