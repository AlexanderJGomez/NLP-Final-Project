Earlier in the day Laura Trott added to the gold she won in the women's team pursuit with triumph in the omnium event, but home crowd favorite Victoria Pendleton was beaten to gold by Australian Anna Meares in the individual sprint.
I saw everyone stepping up to the plate and thankfully it worked out for me too.
Hoy took the lead with two laps to go and though Levy briefly overtook him on the back straight, the Scot responded to power ahead and take the line.
Pendleton thought she had won the first leg by 0.001 of a second, only to be disqualified by the judges for straying out of the sprint lane.
In the second sprint Pendleton went off early but ran out of power as Meares surged past her to add another gold to the one she won in Athens.
"I think Anna is the best rider of the field and it is the way it should have been, Anna and myself in the final, she's a fantastic competitor.
She set a new Olympic record in the the 500m time trial event to beat American Sarah Hammer and add to the gold she won in the women's team pursuit.
