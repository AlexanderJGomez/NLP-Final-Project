(CNN) -- A temporary truce Saturday between Israel and Hamas provided a precious few hours for hundreds of people, who had fled the fighting, the opportunity to learn whether they had a home to return to in Gaza.
"It's all gone," he responds.
The two appear small standing amid the massive mounds of debris in Gaza's Beit Hanoun district, where they quietly and calmly converse about the destruction of home after home in their neighborhood.
Around them, others assess the damage -- in whispered conversations.
The people in the neighborhood are calm, almost methodical, in their approach to war and its consequences.
The family is fighting against the cease-fire clock, with only a few hours to gather what belongings they can salvage from the rubble.
Just a few feet away, a massive crater marks the spot where their neighbor's home once stood.
Through the gap, I could pick out Mohammed Al-Zaneen tip-toeing through the debris of his three-story home in Gaza's Beit Hanoun neighborhood.
Peering through my lens, I see the vista of the Gaza neighborhood of Beit Hanoun: the anarchy, the rubbish, the empty shell casings and the lingering smoke.
Through the seemingly never-ending rubble, across the power lines that bisect the road and the stench of rot, this small quiet procession of will marches before me.
He stops for a moment in front of me, stares me straight in the eyes, and -- without uttering a single word -- throws a handful of machine gun ammunition casings at my feet.
