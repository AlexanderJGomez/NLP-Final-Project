Fisher had led by three shots at halfway after a 10-under 61 on Friday, but saw that cut to one stroke by compatriot Chris Wood and Italy's Francesco Molinari after a 71 on Saturday.
That proved enough to deny three-time major champion Harrington his second title in four years at his home event, despite a flawless 64 including an eagle at the par-five 16th.
Wood held on for a tie for third after a closing 68 which featured six birdies and three bogeys, joining Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano on 270 after the Spaniard shot a flawless 67.
Points moved up to second place on 15 under with a superb 61, while U.S. Ryder Cup player J.B. Holmes went one shot better to be in a four-way tie for fourth on 12 under -- one behind Boo Weekley (67).
