Lohan was not at the hearing, but her lawyer entered a no contest plea -- equivalent to a guilty plea -- to the misdemeanor theft charge on her behalf Wednesday morning.
A report prepared by Lohan's probation officer and released Wednesday said, "It would appear that the defendant's criminal conduct is increasing in seriousness and severity," yet it suggested she serve her sentence on probation and not in jail.
Lohan is already two days into completing her 480 hours of community service, including 360 hours at the Los Angeles Downtown Women's Center.
"I have already started my community service at the Downtown Women's Center and thank everyone there for their warm welcome," Lohan said.
