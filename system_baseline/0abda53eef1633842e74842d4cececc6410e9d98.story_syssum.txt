Matthew Hoffman, 30, who lives in the home where Sarah Maynard was found, provided the information that led to the discovery of the three bodies, Barber said.
"I have never experienced anything this big, this serious and this tragic," said Barber, who announced the news at a somber press conference.
Barber said earlier this week that authorities were fortunate to find Sarah, but he said blood evidence found in Herrmann's home coupled with the amount of time the three have been missing had made the situation more serious.
Sarah Maynard was found in an early morning raid involving a SWAT team and was released from the hospital Monday, after being evaluated and treated for injuries that were not thought to be life-threatening, the sheriff said.
But, in the end, the crucial information came down to Hoffman, Barber said.
When asked whether the incident was a home invasion, Barber said it was not, but added that "either they knew Hoffman or Hoffman made himself known to them."
A deputy twice went to her home in Howard, about nine miles east of Mount Vernon, and saw her pickup there.
He just climbed trees and watched us," she said about Hoffman.
