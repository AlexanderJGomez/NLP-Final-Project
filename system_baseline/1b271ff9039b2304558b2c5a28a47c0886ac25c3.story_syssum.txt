The storm-chasing tour guide and car dealership employee in Norman, Oklahoma, is used to tornadoes and wicked weather.
He had stopped by local businesses to collect video of the cricket explosion in western Norman when the bright lights of parking lots were like a beacon in the night for the creatures.
Pictures of Oklahoma's crickets have been all over social media this week, dotting Instagram feeds and hopping around Twitter.
Although the situation is reminiscent of a biblical plague, it's hard to define the so-called invasion of crickets as a plague, per se.
Since they have short lifespans, the crickets tend to rush to reproduce when the conditions are right in the air -- and on the ground.
While the crickets are not considered an agricultural pest, Grantham said they are definitely a problem when they swarm, especially in commercial areas with bright security lights.
The chirping bugs may have appeared a few weeks earlier this year than last, said Brian Jervis, Tulsa County Extension Horticulturalist.
Jervis said he is seeing an increase in calls from people wanting to know what to do about crickets.
Stomping on the bugs may seem like a good idea, but Jervis said that can backfire and cause the population to grow.
Grantham said to give it another week, but some Oklahomans would say the sooner, the better.
