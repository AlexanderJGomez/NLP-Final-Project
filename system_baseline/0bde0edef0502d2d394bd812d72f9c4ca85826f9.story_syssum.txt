(CNN) -- Sudan ordered a number of international aid agencies to leave the country Wednesday after an arrest warrant was issued for the country's president, a United Nations source in the capital city of Khartoum said.
The exact number of groups involved was not given and some groups were not identified, both to protect their people on the ground in Sudan and because they are hoping to reverse the decision.
The Dutch section of Medicins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) said in a statement it was "outraged" by the move, which leaves more than 200,000 of its patients without essential medical care.
"If Oxfam's registration is revoked, it will affect more than 600,000 Sudanese people whom we provide with vital humanitarian and development aid, including clean water and sanitation on a daily basis," Penny Lawrence, Oxfam's International Director, said in a statement.
The International Rescue Committee, which has worked in Sudan for nearly 30 years, said that it had been ordered to close its programs as well.
The ICC order to arrest al-Bashir is the first warrant ever issued for a sitting head of state by the world's only permanent war crimes tribunal, based at The Hague in the Netherlands.
