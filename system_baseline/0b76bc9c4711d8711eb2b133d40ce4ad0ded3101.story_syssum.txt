(CNN) -- Mark Webber claimed his first victory of 2011 as he relegated his Red Bull teammate Sebastian Vettel to second place in the season-ending race in Brazil.
It would have been nice to have a race with Seb all the way through but he had a problem," he told the post-race media conference.
Home hope Felipe Massa claimed fifth place in the second Ferrari with Adrian Sutil an excellent sixth for Force India.
Nico Rosberg of Mercedes finished seventh with rookie Paul Di Resta in eighth in the second Force India car.
