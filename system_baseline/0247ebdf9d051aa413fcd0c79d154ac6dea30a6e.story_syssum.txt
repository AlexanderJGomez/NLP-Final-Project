Youth all around the world have faced unemployment, high tuition fees, and tough economic situations for years.
Jordan's youth are not completely satisfied with the performance of the public sector, nor are they satisfied with their ability to participate in the decision making process.
High unemployment was present in the Middle East, and in almost every country around the world, for many years before the uprising.
Unemployment is a major issue in the Middle East and North Africa region, especially in Jordan.
Jordan's young have some of the region's most sought-after talents, due to their high quality of education and hard-working attitudes.

Such an Arab Spring encourages innovation and creativity; it allows for thoughts and ideas to sprout that were once dormant.
