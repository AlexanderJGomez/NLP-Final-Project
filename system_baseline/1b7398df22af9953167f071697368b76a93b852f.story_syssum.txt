FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt and Paul Rinaldi, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, are expected to hold a series of meetings about safety and professionalism.
"We run the safest system in the world," but these incidents have "cast a cloud."
Federal officials announced a series of new regulations Saturday aimed at preventing air traffic controllers from falling asleep while on duty.
But it's up to the controllers "to take personal responsibility" and get adequate rest during their down time, he said.
The incident was reported to a manager by another controller, the FAA said.
In at least one incident, the FAA has said, the controller deliberately went to sleep, while some of the others appear to have been accidental.
