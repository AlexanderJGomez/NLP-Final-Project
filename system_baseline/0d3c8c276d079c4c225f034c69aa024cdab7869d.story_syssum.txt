The coroner's preliminary assessment is there was no foul play involved in the death of Getty, grandson of oil tycoon J. Paul Getty, said Detective Meghan Aguilar.
KTLA reported that Getty was found on his side near a bathroom in his home.
In his request, Getty said he had been diagnosed with a serious medical condition in 2013.
"A rise in my blood pressure places me in grave risk of substantial and irreparable injury or death," he wrote in the petition.
