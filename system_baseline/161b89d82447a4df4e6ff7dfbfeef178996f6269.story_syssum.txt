With the pressure on after Real's 4-1 win at Almeria, its 20th straight, Barca just could not find the way past the home defense.
Ronaldo had been a largely peripheral figure for 80 minutes until adding two fine late strikes to earlier goals from Isco and Gareth Bale for the European champions.
Garcia Rabasco had given Almeria hope with a thumping strike to level Isco's opener and Real also had Iker Casillas to thank for saving a second half penalty to keep his side in front.
It left Bayern 10 points clear of Wolfsburg, the second-placed side playing Paderborn Sunday in an attempt to close the gap.
Former Dortmund player Julian Schieber scored the only goal of the match against his old club, who slip to 16th with only four wins from 15 Bundesliga games this season.
