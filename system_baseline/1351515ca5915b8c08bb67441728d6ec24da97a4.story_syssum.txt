Atlanta (CNN) -- The barricaded suspect in the slaying of an Athens, Georgia, police officer released four of eight hostages Friday night, said Vernon Keenan, director of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.
Keenan would not say how long the hostages had been held and declined to provide any further details.
The incident began Tuesday afternoon on the east side of the city when a vehicle was carjacked, said Hilda Sorrow, a police spokeswoman.
He has several tattoos, including "Robert/Dad" on his right arm and "Mom/Azale" and a heart on his left arm.
