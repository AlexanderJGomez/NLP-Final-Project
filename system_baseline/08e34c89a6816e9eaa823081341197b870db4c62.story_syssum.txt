Hernandez was certain that deportation proceedings would follow soon, and was mulling over it when a guard brought some news: He was being released.
More likely, Hernandez was one of hundreds of undocumented immigrants released from detention because of looming budget cuts set to take effect Friday absent congressional action.
The move was made because the agency was preparing its year-end budget and had to take budget cuts into consideration, the official said.
Hernandez, the young man who was released in Georgia, can't know for sure that he was released because of budget cuts.
But he does fit the category of minor offenders, and was released at the same time as dozens of other detainees.
"This decision reflects the lack of resource prioritization within the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement and is indicative of the department's weak stance on national security," McCaul said.
Hernandez said he doesn't understand what all the fuss is about.
