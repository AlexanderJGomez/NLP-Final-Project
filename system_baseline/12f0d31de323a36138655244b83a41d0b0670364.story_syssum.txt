Among the show's nominations were picks for best comedy series as well as best actress in a comedy for creator and writer Lena Dunham.
PBS' breakout hit "Downton Abbey," which was nominated in the miniseries category last year, joined the crew for best drama, as did Showtime's "Homeland."
Some have dismissed the show for its narrow take on New York and young women, noting the lack of African-American characters, its general hip and upscale settings, and Dunham's willingness to make her audience squirm as she follows characters into both bedroom and bathroom.
NBC's "Parks and Recreation" missed out on best comedy series as well, though star Amy Poehler got a nomination.
When we wrote the pilot, we never imagined that the Television Academy would include us in the company of such extraordinary nominees," "Homeland's" co-creators Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa said in a statement.
Though "Mad Men" has won it four consecutive years, AMC's "Breaking Bad," featuring Bryan Cranston's best actor-nominated performance as a chemistry teacher turned drug kingpin, is coming off a strong year, and "Downton Abbey" offers a rich and sumptuous take on early 20th-century life.
Kimmel, who stepped in for "Parks and Recreation" actor Nick Offerman at the last minute (Offerman suffered travel delays), showed up in pajamas.
The show will air on ABC from Los Angeles' Nokia Theatre.
