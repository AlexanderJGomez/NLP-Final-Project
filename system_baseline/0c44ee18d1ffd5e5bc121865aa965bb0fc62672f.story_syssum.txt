Polokwane, South Africa (CNN) -- A South African court charged Julius Malema with money laundering Wednesday, and the firebrand politician scoffed at the accusations and riled up his supporters moments after his release on bail.
The court did not provide additional details of the charge against him because it is still finalizing the documents, it said.
After an overnight vigil at a local hall, they waited for him outside the court, peeking behind razor wire amid heavy security that included riot police.
Malema, once a major ally of the president, is now one of his fiercest critics.
His populist rhetoric has made him a controversial figure in the nation and sparked outrage in the ruling party.
In recent years, he has accused his administration of intolerance and failure to improve the lives of the poor.
Malema's controversial road to fame includes his calls to seize white-owned farms in South Africa, especially incendiary in a nation with a history of racial tensions.
