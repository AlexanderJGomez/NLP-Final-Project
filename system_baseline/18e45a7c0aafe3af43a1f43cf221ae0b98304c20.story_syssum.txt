(CNN)Despite clashes that  killed at least 19 fans before kickoff, a soccer match in Egypt continued to the very end, state media reported.
The security forces tried to disperse them, the fans fled to the main road and blocked traffic and stopped the bus carrying the Zamalek soccer team," the ministry said in a statement.
In a social media posting, they said they were tear gassed as they tried to go through a single, small gated entrance that was opened to allow them into the match.
Three years ago, a riot at a match between Al-Masry and Al-Ahly teams left more than 70 people dead in Port Said city.
Authorities later partially lifted the ban by allowing a limited number of fans to attend games, state media reported.
