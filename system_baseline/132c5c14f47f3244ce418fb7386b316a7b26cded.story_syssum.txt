ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Nearly a year after assassins killed Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, her widower won the country's presidential election and hailed his triumph as a victory for democracy.
The election was not by public vote, but rather by lawmakers in the two houses of the National Assembly and in the four provincial assemblies around the country.
"And to those who would say the People's Party or the presidency would be controversial under our guardianship and under our stewardship, I would say, listen to democracy."
"It is the philosophy of ... Benazir Bhutto, in which we believe, which says democracy is the best revenge," Zadari said.
His party had been confident of a win, saying Zardari had the support of three of the four provincial assemblies -- which would be crucial in helping Zardari forge the alliances he needs to tackle the country's main problems.
The party had painted him as a candidate who represented the middle class and has a clean track record -- in contrast to Zardari, who spent 11 and a half years in jail on corruption charges that he refutes.
Saturday's election came one day after Pakistan's Supreme Court reinstated three of its judges who Musharraf ousted in November, following his imposition of emergency rule.
The explosion happened at a checkpoint on the outskirts of Peshawar, about 4 miles (7 kilometers) from the Provincial Assembly in Pakistan, where some of the presidential voting was taking place.
The province is near Pakistan's border with Afghanistan and is rife with Islamic extremists.
