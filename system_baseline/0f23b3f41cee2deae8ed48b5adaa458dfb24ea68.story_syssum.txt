Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Supporters and members of the gay and lesbian community in Kenya blasted the country's prime minister Monday after he said anyone engaging in homosexual activity should be arrested.
In February an armed group raided a government health center that provides HIV/AIDS services to the community.
A spokesperson of the prime minister's office, Dennis Onyango told CNN that the comments made by Odinga were off the cuff and were not a directive to arrest anyone.
