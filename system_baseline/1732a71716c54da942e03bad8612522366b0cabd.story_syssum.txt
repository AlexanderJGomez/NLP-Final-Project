"I cannot see how it could assist any state's cause to allow the world to see a man like Alan dying," Barbara Henning said, according to a message released by the UK Foreign Office.
The Sunni extremist group, which controls large areas of Iraq and Syria, has already beheaded three Western captives in recent weeks -- Haines, and the American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff.
"Alan is a peaceful, selfless man who left his family and his job as a taxi driver in the UK to drive in a convoy all the way to Syria with his Muslim colleagues and friends to help those most in need," she said in the statement.
"I pray that the people holding Alan respond to my messages and contact me before it is too late," she said.
Leading Muslim figures in the United Kingdom have also called for Henning's release in a video posted on YouTube in which they say that killing him isn't permitted by Islamic law.
Dr. Shameela Islam-Zulfiqar, a volunteer doctor who stayed behind the main part of the convoy at the Turkish border, said they got a phone call saying Henning had been taken by masked gunmen.
"As your sister in Islam, I would implore you and beg of you: please spare the life of this innocent man," she said.
But in a marked difference from other groups issuing appeals, CAGE called on the UK government to negotiate with the hostage takers.
None of his workmates at the taxi company nor any of the neighbors on his street were willing to talk to the news media.
