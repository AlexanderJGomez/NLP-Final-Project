(CNN)  -- Fernando Torres' highly-anticipated switch to English champions Chelsea was completed just before Monday transfer window closed in a deal that his former team Liverpool said had broken the British record.
Torres' move followed the news that Liverpool had agreed a club-record fee for Newcastle's England striker Andy Carroll, who handed in a transfer request in the afternoon after the 18-time English champions made an improved bid.
The fee was not disclosed but it reportedly surpassed the previous British record of Â£33 million ($53 million) that Manchester City paid for Brazilian Robinho in 2008.
Another high-profile striker on the move Monday was Tottenham's Robbie Keane, who has agreed a loan switch to London rivals West Ham until the end of this season.
Villa allowed Irish midfielder Stephen Ireland to join Newcastle on loan for the rest of this season, almost six months after he arrived from Manchester City.
Stoke also allowed former Chelsea and Barcelona striker Eidur Gudjohnsen to join English rivals Fulham on loan, with the Iceland international having failed to win a regular place since his pre-season move from Monaco.
German rivals Schalke signed Iran international midfielder Ali Karimi, who worked with coach Felix Magath when they were both at Bayern Munich, plus clubless Greece striker Angelos Charisteas -- who scored the winning goal in the final of Euro 2004.
English club Birmingham City signed Nigeria international Obafemi Martins in a six-month loan deal from Russian side Rubin Kazan, after the former Newcastle striker was granted a work permit.
Dutch club Feyenoord have signed Denmark international striker Soren Larsen from French side Toulouse on loan for the rest of this season, along with Arsenal's new 18-year-old Japanese forward Ryo Miyaichi and Borussia Monchengladbach midfielder Marcel Meeuwis.
