(CNN)Andrew Brannan, 66, who is scheduled to be put to death this week for the murder of a 22-year-old Georgia sheriff's deputy in 1998, is hoping his sentence will be found uniquely unconstitutional.
They are also petitioning the Georgia Parole Board that his sentence be commuted to life in prison.
He then mocks the deputy and at one point seems to dance around yelling "shoot me" at Dinkheller.
But Brannan is able to advance on the deputy, and off camera, you hear the deputy scream before Brannan repeatedly shoots Dinkheller and then flees the scene.
During the trial, Kammer says the defense did present evidence that Brannan suffered from PTSD but claims that crucial testimony from the VA doctor treating him was never heard.
