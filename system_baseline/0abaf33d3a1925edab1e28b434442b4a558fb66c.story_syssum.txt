Only one of the 38 people taken to hospitals was listed in serious condition and none appeared to be burn victims, said Patrick Hynes, chief of the airport division of the Denver Fire Department.
Trejos said when the plane hit the ground, he saw an engine on fire and seats buckling toward each other.
"They described a surreal scene when they pulled up, heavy fire on the right side of the aircraft, all chutes deployed from both sides of the aircraft, people evacuating and walking up the hillside towards them," Hynes said.
Hynes said the entire right side of the jet was on flames and "a heck of a firefight" followed.
Planes resumed takeoffs and landings at the airport after the incident, although Day said a section of the airport will remain closed into Sunday.
A team from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was on its way to the scene to start an investigation.
