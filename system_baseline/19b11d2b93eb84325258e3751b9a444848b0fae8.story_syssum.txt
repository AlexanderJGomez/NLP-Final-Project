Brown, an unarmed black teen, was shot to death by Darren Wilson, a white police officer, on August 9.
If Wilson is charged and then eventually found guilty of first-degree murder, he could face up to life in prison without parole, or death, if the death penalty is sought, according to Joy.
If prosecutors can prove Wilson acted while in a fit of anger or rage when he shot Brown, they might be able to secure a conviction on voluntary manslaughter.
If prosecutors can prove Wilson didn't know what he was doing when he fired in the direction of Brown, they might be able to secure an involuntary manslaughter conviction.
If the grand jury decided against an indictment, Wilson would continue to be a free man, at least so far as the state's criminal charges.
