Negotiators from Colombia's government and largest insurgent group concluded their first round of talks Thursday and voiced cautious optimism that they will eventually forge a peace deal.
Several FARC leaders face lengthy prison sentences in Colombia and the United States, a major backer of Colombia's military and war against the guerrillas.
FARC negotiators named Palmera to their peace talks team and carried a life-sized cut-out of Palmera into a news conference on Thursday.
At least some of animosity between the negotiators had dissipated, said FARC spokeswoman Tanja Nijmeijer, a Dutch guerrilla who joined the FARC after traveling to Colombia to teach English there.
Earlier this month, FARC announced it would temporarily halt its battle against government forces as a goodwill gesture.
