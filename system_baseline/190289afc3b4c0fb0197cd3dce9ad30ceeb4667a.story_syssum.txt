Kellen Winslow recently had a second staph infection and has accused his team of covering it up.
Winslow recently said the Browns treated him like a "piece of meat" when he was hospitalized for the condition, and he claimed they covered up the cause of his illness.
Hospitals have long been known to be hot spots for transmitting staph, but recently cases have cropped up in other community settings.
About 30 percent of people carry staph in their noses without exhibiting symptoms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Dr. James Steinberg, medical director at Emory University's Crawford Long Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, said that environment plays a role in the spread of MRSA but that it's less a factor than coming into contact with a person's skin.
A second infection in the same person could result from re-exposure or from treatment that didn't get rid of the bacteria colonization, he said.
There could be economic and psychosocial repercussions -- for example, another team might not want to play against that one, she said.
On Thursday, the Brown's General Manager Phil Savage said the team did not alert players to Winslow's staph infection partly because of the health privacy laws and partly because the team was in "game mode" when Winslow had a confirmed diagnosis.
Winslow said in a statement released through his publicist, Denise White of EAG Sports Management, that he had been discouraged from making the issue public.
A spokesperson for the Browns did not return a request for comment.
