In the other five-nation pools, England are the top seed in Group G and will have to get past 2008 co-hosts Switzerland, the unpredictable but talented Bulgaria, Wales and Montenegro.
World champions Italy also face a testing time in six-nation Group C after being drawn with Serbia and Slovenia, who have both qualified for this year's World Cup finals and will be seeking to continue that progress.
Bosnia-Herzegovina, beaten by Portugal in the World Cup playoffs last year, were also drawn in Group D.
Group C: Italy, Serbia, Northern Ireland, Slovenia, Estonia, Faroe Islands.
Group H: Portugal, Denmark, Norway, Cyprus, Iceland.
