His 6-year-old daughter, Autumn, crawled on top of the king-sized comforter and stared at him with bright blue eyes.
Her mom had tried to explain why Justin was so sad, but Autumn didn't really understand diabetes or its dangerous implications.
Justin looped his last digit around hers and made the decision to change his life.
He was smart, polite and made her laugh -- three qualities that helped Shanon overlook his size.
He'd eat dinner at work -- frozen burritos, burgers and fries -- then stop off at Taco Bell on the way home for the advertised fourth meal.
Most concerning was his lack of time with Autumn, who got upset when her father wouldn't play outside.
He walks around his neighborhood whenever he can and makes sure to do the little things like taking the stairs and returning his shopping cart.
He only weighs in once a month to avoid becoming obsessed with the numbers on the scale.
The couple raised more than $7,500 for the American Diabetes Association's "Step Out: Walk to Stop Diabetes" in Oklahoma City on September 14.
On his website Justin has included a section where he asks readers to make their own promises -- to themselves or to their family -- to get healthy.
