Monday's resignation came hours after the World Health Organization said the scandal had highlighted flaws in the country's entire food supply chain.
WHO China representative Hans Troedsson said on Monday quality issues could occur anywhere from the farm to the retail outlet.
The country's Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority said tests on "White Rabbit Creamy Candy" showed that it was contaminated with melamine and it ordered stores to remove the product from shelves.

"Xinhua was quick to blame the dairy industry for their skewed rules, but what it didn't say was that the government also played a part in that ugly game," the magazine quoted a blogger, identified as sadmoon109, as saying.
Melamine is the same industrial contaminant from China that poisoned and killed thousands of U.S. dogs and cats last year.
A senior dairy analyst said Chinese farmers were cutting corners to cope with rising costs for feed and labor.
