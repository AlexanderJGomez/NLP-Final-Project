Las Vegas, Nevada (CNN) -- Google doesn't have a booth at the Consumer Electronics Show, but the company's Android software is practically everywhere.
AT&T announced three smartphones on Wednesday, which take advantage of the carriers' latest network protocol.
When questioned on phones, RIM co-CEO Mike Lazaridis reiterated that the company is hard at work on the next iteration of BlackBerry.
For Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer's CES keynote, he focused the Windows Phone 7 presentation on applications -- now totally more than 5,500 -- instead of new hardware.
On display at its booth, Microsoft had many of the nine Windows Phone 7 devices that are already available in stores.
Last year, Google had a table at one of the three main nightly events associated with CES.
Microsoft charges partners to use Windows Phone 7 and places limits on how they can alter the software.
Nor does Nokia, which didn't announce any new products or host a booth, though the company is here in Las Vegas for various small events.
The version of Android made for tablets isn't ready to be demonstrated live, and only two companies say they have products to support it.
Others are showcasing Android tablets, but they are based on older Google software that was made for phones, which obviously have smaller screens.
