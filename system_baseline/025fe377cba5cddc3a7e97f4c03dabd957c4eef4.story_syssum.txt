When Larry, an Army specialist, was deployed to Afghanistan for a year in 2012, Misty decided she wanted to get in shape.
Each time she had tried dieting in the past, she would relapse.
Before she became pregnant with her daughter, Nevaeh, she took diet pills and lost 60 pounds.
She wanted to surprise her husband, and work toward a better life for herself and her family.
She stopped drinking soda, and tried to limit her liquids to water and coffee.
Once she got past that, she started craving more healthy foods and water.
Lunch is a salad or half a sandwich with some kind of vegetable or fruit.
For dinner, she eats a lean meat (like ground turkey or a boneless, skinless chicken breast), a vegetable and a very small portion of starch.
Before, he hadn't been able to lift her off the ground even a little, she said.
The other big part of the surprise: She had bought a new house while he was away.
She said her husband's eating habits haven't changed much; he likes her cooking, but he'll help himself to ice cream or cake afterward.
She's still in disbelief when her husband picks her up.
