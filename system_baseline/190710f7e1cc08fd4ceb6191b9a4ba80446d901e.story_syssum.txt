New York (CNN) -- A heat wave continued to blanket the U.S. Northeast with scorching temperatures on the first day of summer, as residents across the region sought to keep cool amid national heat advisories.
"We actually weren't going to come out, because it was so hot today, but they turned on the sprinklers and we're going to have some fun," first-grade teacher James Bernardini said in Manhattan's Central Park.
The service advises residents to drink plenty of water, to stay out of the sun, to take frequent breaks in shaded or air-conditioned environments and to check on relatives and neighbors during the heat wave.
Residents are advised to call 311 or to go to their city's website online to find cooling centers and to get further information on how to keep cool as the heat continues.
