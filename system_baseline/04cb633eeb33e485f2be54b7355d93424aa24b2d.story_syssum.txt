Marcus Schrenker, 38, of McCordsville, Indiana, pleaded guilty in June to charges of destruction of an aircraft and causing the Coast Guard to respond when no help is needed.
Authorities have said they think he defrauded investors through three companies he owns in a suburb of Indianapolis, Indiana.
While over Alabama, he contacted air traffic controllers, saying that the windshield had imploded and that he was injured and bleeding profusely.
The Coast Guard dispatched rescue helicopters from New Orleans, Louisiana, and Mobile, Alabama, in case the plane crashed on land and sent two cutters in case it crashed into the Gulf of Mexico, prosecutors have said.
Although the plane was severely damaged, investigators found that its windshield and windscreens were not damaged and that there was no blood inside the plane, the documents said.
When found, authorities said at the time, Schrenker was bleeding from cuts on his wrists after an apparent suicide attempt.
Authorities then "presented various pieces of evidence showing his claims to be untrue," and Schrenker admitted that he called in a false distress message and had intended the plane to crash into the Gulf of Mexico, the documents said.
