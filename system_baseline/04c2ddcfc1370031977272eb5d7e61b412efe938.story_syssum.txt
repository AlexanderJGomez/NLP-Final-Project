(CNN) -- When I won the reality show competition "Survivor: Africa" in 2001, I never dreamed that an obscure African flower would provide the drug that later helped me survive cancer.
We drank from the same watering hole as elephants and giraffes, learning the best times to drink and how to stay out of their way.
But as they worked I found some comfort when I learned that one of them was derived from an African flower, the rosy periwinkle.
The drug born of this flower, vincristine, was part of the regimen that saved my life.
Scientists derived a compound for treating severe chronic pain from a cone snail found in Pacific coral reefs, though its habitat is now threatened by destructive fishing practices and marine pollution.
Given the accelerating destruction of rainforests, reefs and other natural habitats around the world, we must take action today -- as there's no telling how many useful undiscovered natural compounds we could lose for tomorrow.
Indeed, scientists warn that two-thirds of the planet's 10 million species could face extinction by the end of the century.
I don't know what I'll need from nature next or where the newest nature-based medicines will come from, but I'm not willing to risk losing any of them.
