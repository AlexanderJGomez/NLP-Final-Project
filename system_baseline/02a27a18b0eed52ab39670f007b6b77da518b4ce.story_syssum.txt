SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN)  -- Imagine collecting thousands of empty plastic bottles, lashing them together to make a boat and sailing the thing from California to Australia, a journey of 11,000 miles (17,700 km) through treacherous seas.
"The idea is to put no kind of pollution back into the atmosphere, or into our oceans for that matter, so everything on the boat will be composted.
The scion of a wealthy British banking family, he is one of only several dozen people to traverse both the Arctic and Antarctic ice caps.
Joining him on the Plastiki will be a permanent crew of three sailors and scientists plus a handful of other crew members who will rotate through the voyage.
"We actually wrap the PET fabric over the PET foam and then basically put it under a vacuum, heat it, press it and create these long PET panels.
Only about 10 percent of the Plastiki will be made from new materials, de Rothschild said.
The ultimate goal of the Plastiki voyage is not just to encourage people to embrace clean, renewable energy but also to see consumer waste as a potential resource.
"Anything that gets in the news and makes people stop and think about plastic can be very helpful," said Betty McLaughlin, executive director of the Container Recycling Institute.
This trip strikes me as kind of dangerous."
