Exiles -- who face never returning to Tibet as long as it is under Chinese rule -- stood on Tibetan soil this week, fulfilling a desire that has burned within since they fled westward across the Himalayas.
He knew it could never be the same as actually returning to Tibet, but perhaps, he thought, it would spark a sliver of that feeling.
A father's unfulfilled wish drove his artist son to create something that would allow the displaced to be able to "return" home again.
"He was saying he had this idea to transport a large amount of soil from Tibet," Dorjee said.
But then Dorjee began visualizing the project and how much of an impact it was sure to have on Tibetan exiles.
Using his index finger, the Dalai Lama, wrote Tibet in the dirt and blessed the soil.
"It was very exciting," said Tenzing Geche, 22, a monk who was a baby when his family left Tibet.
It was completely inspiring at one moment and in another, as she watched elderly Tibetans fall to the ground, sadness overcame her.
But when it closes, Tibetan exiles will be allowed to take some of the dirt with them, a reminder always of the land they long to see.
