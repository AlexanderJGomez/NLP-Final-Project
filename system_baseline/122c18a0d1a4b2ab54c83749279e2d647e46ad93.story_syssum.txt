The violence in Yemen and Libya on Friday stood in sharp contrast to images from Cairo's Tahrir Square, where Egyptians showed up en masse to celebrate the toppling of President Hosni Mubarak a week ago.
Some told Amnesty International that they had been surrounded by security forces, aided by "thugs" who fired shots at them and beat them.
"I'm out here today because we want the president to go and we want to make sure that he and his family don't stay in power," said Khalid Amer, a student.
Opposition lawmaker Ahmed Hashid said police at the scene did not try to intervene.
The state-run Saba news agency said a million demonstrators had marched in Taiz, hoisting Yemeni flags and pictures of Saleh.
Saleh, in power for 32 years, met earlier in the week with his National Defense Council to discuss discontent in his nation.
"He pointed out that there are schemes aimed at plunging the region into chaos and violence targeting the nation's security and the stability of its countries," Saba said.
Yemen's situation is compounded by the fight against al Qaeda, the southern separatist movement in its once-independent south, a Shiite uprising and a looming shortage of water.
