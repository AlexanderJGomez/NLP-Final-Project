(CNN) -- Alex Ferguson is the legendary Manchester United coach who once sent a boot flying into the face of David Beckham, but a British sculptor has revealed a softer side to the formidable Scot.
Over the last quarter of a century, Ferguson has overseen United's ascent to the top of English football.
As a manager Ferguson has a no-nonsense reputation, letting go of top players like Beckham, Roy Keane, Jaap Stam and Ruud van Nistelrooy when he senses they have outlived their usefulness to the United cause.
"I'd already done the Matt Busby sculpture for Manchester United some 12-15 years ago," said Jackson, who in his role as royal sculptor has produced works ranging from the archangel Gabriel and Constantine the Great to the young Mozart.
In order to do justice to a man as respected as Ferguson, Jackson built up an in-depth knowledge of his personality and appearance during several meetings.
"To start of piece of sculpture is almost like researching for a book, you have to get to know the person very well.
Sports stars have long been the subject of works of art, with the athletes of ancient Greece often honored with carvings and statues.
"They have generally come to a job through being young, athletic sportsmen," added Jackson.
Robson, England's coach during the 1990 World Cup, was a native of the north east and occupied the Newcastle hotseat for five years.
