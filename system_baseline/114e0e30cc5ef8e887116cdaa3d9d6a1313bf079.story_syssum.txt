The incident began when some teenagers became angry when they were asked to show identification for a tobacco purchase, said Erdaogan Yavuz, the manager of the OK Gas Station in Wantagh, New York, told CNN.
When Nassau County police arrived on site, the man attacked one of the officers, according to a spokesman for the 8th precinct in Levittown.
All five men were charged with assault but the case will not be prosecuted as a hate crime, said Chris Munzing, the deputy director of communications for Nassau County Police.
A surveillance video from the gas station is in the hands of prosecutors, officials said.
