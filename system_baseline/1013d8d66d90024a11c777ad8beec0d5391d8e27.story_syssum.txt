"Even (his) doctors saw the physical and psychological improvements we were able to make," Norton said.
For the past 25 years, Norton has dedicated himself to providing free and low-cost strength and conditioning training for hundreds of people living with a variety of disabilities.
"I'm building them up, building them stronger, so they can go out and live life like they're supposed to."
Most of the people he trains are in wheelchairs and rely on their upper body strength to get around.
Clement has worked out at Norton's gym several times a week for the past 15 years.
"My activities in the gym have increased my ability to maintain the stamina of everyday work," said Clement, who runs a frame shop and art gallery with his brother.
Norton is the only trainer in the facility, which was donated to him by the city.
Kathleen Lane has been coming to the Warriors on Wheels gym for about 15 years to help with her multiple sclerosis.
Norton says many of the people he has worked with have gone on to drive again, gain employment and pursue their interests without letting their disabilities get in the way.
"But I do know what I'm doing in the gym, because that's what I love doing and that's what I have to offer to people."
