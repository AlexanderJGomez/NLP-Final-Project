An apartment I had yet to find.
My place would be clean, bathed in sunlight, in an elegant prewar building, with a spare room for my college-age daughter.
Now, after selling my suburban Long Island house of 22 years, I set my sights on finding an affordable apartment in Manhattan in a vibrant, safe neighborhood.
According to The New York Times, a go-to place for apartment listings, in October 2009 there were 8,150 apartments listed for sale in Manhattan.
Based on their listings, the average price for an apartment in Manhattan, according to the Times, is $1.1 million.
Trolling the real estate websites, you click on a link and find the apartment of your dreams.
A good man in New York is like prime real estate, snapped up before you can blink.
Only by meeting will you know if this relationship is doomed, because more often than not, you'll be burned by the big reveal.
To help find my apartment "match," I signed with an experienced buyer's broker: Roberta Moser of Halstead Property.
A broker may hand you the sales sheet, which lists the apartment features and price, while declaring: "That's not really the price.
Your bid may be accepted, but until the seller signs the contract, you're in limbo.
For days, the selling broker flirted with me, toyed with me.
How far will New York buyers go to get an apartment they want?
Once, when there were multiple offers, Moser recalled, "a buyer delivered a signed contract with a check for $100,000 over the asking price of the apartment."
But it was a good deal -- and with a little luck, everything fell into place.
Just as in real estate, there's a dearth of inventory.
And all those type-A personalities don't work well for matchmaking.
In Seattle, for example, "there are four single men to every single woman," says Avgitidis.
They all work out, they all dress nice, they all have nice apartments."
