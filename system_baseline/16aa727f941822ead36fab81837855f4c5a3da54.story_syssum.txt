Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, a member of the Russian punk rock collective Pussy Riot, was sent to Mordovia last year for her part in a performance of a "punk prayer" critical of Vladimir Putin -- then the prime minister, now the president -- at a Russian Orthodox cathedral.
In a lengthy letter to the news site Lenta (a translated version was published in London's The Guardian), Tolokonnikova described "slave labor" and unsanitary conditions in which women work through sickness and injury up to 17 hours a day and are beaten -- or worse -- for failing to complete their duties.
She had started developing complications because of the length of the hunger strike, Verzilov said.
Bakhmina said she also went on a hunger strike after authorities said she could no longer phone her children.
Tolokonnikova is waiting to discover if she has done the same.
