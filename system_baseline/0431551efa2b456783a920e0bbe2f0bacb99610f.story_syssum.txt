Some 150 Tibeto-Burman languages are spoken in India alone, but no other language has been identified as closely related, said Harrison, an associate professor of linguistics at Swarthmore College in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania.
Harrison and Anderson, director of the Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages, in Salem, Oregon, focused on Arunachal Pradesh, a remote area of northeast India that is considered the black hole of the linguistic world.
It is a language hotspot where there is room to study rich, diverse languages, many unwritten or documented.
The team set out in 2008 in Arunachal Pradesh to document Aka and Miji, languages spoken in a small district there.
The inventory of sounds and the way these sounds were combined to form words were distinct from other languages spoken in the region.
Anderson and Harrison said Aka is the traditional language of the region's historic slave traders, and they hypothesized that Koro may have sprung from the slaves; though they said more study is needed to determine the origin.
