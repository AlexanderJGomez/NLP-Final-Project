The musical icon stirred a bit of a ruckus on social media Sunday night after he appeared in a Super Bowl commercial for Chrysler while another, for Chobani yogurt, featured his music.
Another tweeted "That Bob Dylan, Chrysler commercial was disappointing and sad on so many levels.
Brian Steinberg of Variety points out that instead of "selling out" Dylan may be merely doing what some of his contemporaries have done in trying to remain relevant in today's music industry.
"For Dylan, an artist whose time in the spotlight was most intense in the 1960s, the feat is more difficult, even if he does continue to release albums that gain plaudits and critical acclaim."
