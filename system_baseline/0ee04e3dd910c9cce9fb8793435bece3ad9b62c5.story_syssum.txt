Scientists at the UK's University of Manchester say they have demonstrated how graphene -- a two-dimensional material made from a single layer of carbon atoms -- could look inside electronic circuits of the future.
"Creating the multilayer structure has allowed us to isolate graphene from negative influence of the environment and control graphene's electronic properties in a way it was impossible before," Leonid Ponomarenko, lead author of the study.
"It could be only a matter of several months before we have encapsulated graphene transistors with characteristics better than previously demonstrated," he added.
The discovery that it is extremely sensitive to single molecules of gas could, according to Geim and Novoselov, lead to the development of new sensors, with possible applications in counter-terrorism.
The U.S.'s Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, have recently discovered that graphene "exhibits a novel reaction to light," which they say could improve night-vision systems and possibly provide a new approach to solar power.
It turned out to be untrue, but bendable phones, computers and televisions may not be far off, says Ferrari.
