Once Moss' last episode airs on Sept. 14, "B&B" has no plans to fill the void, the sudser's head writer told TV Guide.
I don't want to do a presumed death because I don't want the story that follows to be all about Ridge.
But at some point it will be necessary for Ridge to return to the show.
It's been a great run and all good things end eventually.
I want you all to come with me through these new doors of opportunities and experience how cool it's going to be.
The head writer isn't giving up hope that Moss may reprise the role at a later date.
