Moyes, who has been in charge at Goodison Park since 2002, will take charge of the club's final two Premier League games of the season before making the move to Old Trafford.
"Everton's fantastic fans have played a big part in making my years at Goodison so enjoyable and I thank them wholeheartedly for the support they have given me and the players.
Moyes has been publicly endorsed by Ferguson, who says his fellow Scot is the perfect man to take over at the helm.
Moyes has never won a major trophy with Everton after more than a decade in the English top flight, but has consistently produced competitive teams on a tight budget.
The statement added: "The chairman, on behalf of the club, would like to place on record his thanks to David for the massive contribution he has made to Everton since his arrival in March 2002.
Moyes arrives with United having sealed a series of lucrative sponsorship deals aimed at maximizing off-pitch revenue in order to be competitive under European football's financial fair play rules.
Whether Moyes will be given significant funds to strengthen the squad for United's EPL title defense remains to be seen -- Borussia Dortmund's top scorer Robert Lewandowski has long been linked with a move to Old Trafford, but the Poland striker would command a hefty fee and wage packet.
Moyes gave Rooney his debut as a 16-year-old at Everton but they fell out when the England striker left for Old Trafford in 2004.
