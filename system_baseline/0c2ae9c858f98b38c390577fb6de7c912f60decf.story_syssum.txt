Michael McFaul, U.S. ambassador to Russia since January 2012, announced Tuesday he'll leave the post shortly after the Winter Olympics conclude in the southern Russian resort town of Sochi.
But after seven months of separation, I simply need to be with my family again," McFaul wrote.
After advising then-Sen. Barack Obama on Russia during the 2008 presidential campaign, McFaul took a leave from Stanford to become senior director for Russia and Eurasian affairs at the National Security Council.
McFaul's ambassadorship came at a time of strained relations between the two countries, with quarrels over, among other things, Syria's civil war and the arrival in Moscow of admitted National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden.
CNN first learned of McFaul's planned departure on Twitter.
