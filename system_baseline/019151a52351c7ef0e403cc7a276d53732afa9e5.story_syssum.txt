In the final days of winter, when snow coats the surrounding peaks, the caves look all but deserted.
They draw their water from a spring deep within the mountain that is only accessible via a series of tunnels.
"It puts joy in my heart to live here," the priest says, as he looks out of the doorway of his incense-scented cave at the rushing river below, where he sometimes fishes for trout.
In fact, Father Lazar says aside from the monks, the only other people who live in this valley, are the nuns who inhabit a small convent beyond a bend in the river.

"Visitors to Georgia are going to Vardzia and there is no infrastructure there at all," says Tengiz Bendukidze, an executive with Rakeen, an Emirati real estate development company.
Executives at Rakeen say they are still working out the final concept of the new Vardzia hotel project.
The new hotel is expected to be constructed on a hillside directly across the river from the cave complex, on a patch of territory that was occupied by a Soviet-era hotel until it was demolished a few years ago.
"If there's going to be a bar or a night club there, then that's also not good."
