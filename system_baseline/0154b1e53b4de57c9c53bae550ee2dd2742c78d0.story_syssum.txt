The French seemed to have coalesced in reaching back into their history and the Enlightenment: They have started reading Voltaire.
The French publisher Folio says sales of the "Treatise" have increased significantly since the Charlie Hebdo attacks.
When first published, the "Treatise" was a revolutionary creed, and one that landed Voltaire in trouble with the French government and especially powerful religious interests, such as the Jesuits.
"I say that we should regard all men as our brothers," he wrote.
Yes, without doubt; are we not all children of the same father and creatures of the same God?"
Writing in Le Figaro on Tuesday, former Prime Minister Dominique Villepin said that "Faced with the drama that struck it, France has shown great dignity."
Scattered around them, among the many tributes, posters of the writer bordered with the motto: "Je suis Charlie."
In an article in L'Express, the Societe said Voltaire's lifelong struggle was to "crush the infamous" (a saying with which he often ended his letters) and defend the victims of fanaticism.
The phrase was invented by his English biographer many years later.
