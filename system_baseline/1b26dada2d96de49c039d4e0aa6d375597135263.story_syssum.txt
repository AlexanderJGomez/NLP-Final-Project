It looked to be a harsh decision by Irish referee Alain Rolland and tipped the match in France's favor although they had to withstand a late Welsh onslaught to maintain their slender lead.
Wales spent the remainder of the match with the bulk of possession but were unable to work an opening to leave the French to contemplate a final against either hosts New Zealand or Australia who play the second semifinal Sunday on the same ground.
Warburton, who could miss next Friday's third place playoff match, was also amazed to have been sent off.
French coach Marc Lievremont praised the "amazingly brave" Wales, but believed Rolland, the 2007 World Cup final referee, had little choice but to dismiss Warburton.
They trailed away disappointed, but the intensity is set to step up a gear for the clash between Tasman rivals New Zealand and Australia at Eden Park.
