The charges include several counts of aggravated murder with a "mass murder specification," meaning multiple people were killed in a similar fashion, said Bill Mason, the Cuyahoga County prosecutor.
Investigators arrested him in October after authorities serving a search warrant in a rape case discovered the remains of six women in and around his house.
Authorities have said they are looking at the unsolved slayings of three women in East Cleveland to determine if they share any similarities with the remains found at Sowell's house.
On October 20, neighbors reported seeing a naked woman fall from the second floor of his house.
Cuyahoga County Sheriff Bob Reid told reporters this week that Sowell has been a "model prisoner," is kept in an isolated unit and has declined visitation requests.
The skull of one woman was wrapped in a paper bag and stuffed into a bucket in the home's basement.
After the discovery of the 11 women, police in mid-November used thermal imaging in an attempt to see if any additional human remains were on the property and dug certain areas by hand.
