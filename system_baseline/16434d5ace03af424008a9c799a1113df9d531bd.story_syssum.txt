London (CNN) -- Olympics fans will revel in track and field's most anticipated event Sunday, and the men's 100 meters will not lack for drama as Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt attempts to defend his title against his fellow countryman.
Federer, who has 17 grand slam titles under his belt, is hoping to complete a career golden grand slam.
Jessica Ennis earned the heptathlon gold, Greg Rutherford scored a long jump win and Mo Farah's sprint to victory made him the first British runner ever to do so in the 10,000 meter competition.
But history on Saturday also favored the leaders, as the most decorated Olympian of all time tallied another win with his American teammates in the 4 x 100-meter medley relay, handing Michael Phelps his 18th gold medal in the last race of his storied swimming career.
Elsewhere in London, Serena Williams completed a "career Golden Slam" at the 2012 Games, adding for the United States an Olympic women's singles tennis gold medal to her four tennis major titles.
Also on the track, double-amputee sprinter Oscar Pistorius, who runs on special carbon fiber blades and is nicknamed "The Blade Runner," came in an impressive second in his heat of the men's individual 400-meter race, thus qualifying for Sunday's semifinals.
