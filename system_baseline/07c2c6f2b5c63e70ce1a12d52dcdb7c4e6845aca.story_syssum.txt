This was the latest twist in a case that has made international headlines, in part because of the circumstances of the killing but also because van der Sloot was arrested twice, but never charged, in the 2005 disappearance of U.S. teenager Natalee Holloway.
On Wednesday, van der Sloot is expected to finally give his plea in the Lima courtroom.
On Friday, prosecutors went over all the evidence and witnesses they had and gave a summation of the case against van der Sloot.
It has been widely reported that van der Sloot killed the woman after he believed she saw something on the Internet relating to Holloway.
"Movies and books have been made ... At that age, and with other characteristics of his psychological profile, ... in that moment, he felt threatened and reacted in a brutal manner."
He was allegedly given a total of $25,000, and authorities believe he used that money to travel to Peru and participate in a poker tournament, where he met Flores.
