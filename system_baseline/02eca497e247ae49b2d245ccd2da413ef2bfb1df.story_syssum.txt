Kyle's wife, Taya, "could tell something was up" that afternoon when she spoke to her husband.
Yet Routh didn't reveal a clear reason in the fatal shootings.
"It is my opinion that he was suffering from a severe mental disease or defect that caused him not to know his conduct was wrong," Dunn testified.
"I've been so paranoid-schizophrenic all day, I don't know what to even think of the world right now," he told the officer.
"I heard Mr. Routh say, 'I shot them because they wouldn't talk to me.
Routh described being annoyed with Kyle and Littlefield as they made the 90-minute drive from his home to the countryside gun range.
"That's how I felt that day," Routh said on the recording.
It was "strange" because he wasn't hungry, and he felt the two men were trying to "force feed" him, Routh said to Schmidle.
"Not only was he suffering from a severe mental disease or defect, not only did he not know his conduct was wrong, he thought he had to take their lives because he was in danger."
When Schmidle asked what triggered him picking up a firearm and shooting Kyle and Littlefield, Routh replied that he was angry that Littlefield would not participate in the shooting.
And that's what got all, you know, wired up."
After deliberating less than three hours, a Texas jury found Routh guilty of capital murder in the case.
