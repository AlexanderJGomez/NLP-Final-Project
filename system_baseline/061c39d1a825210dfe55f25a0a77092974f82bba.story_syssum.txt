The wounded officer was assisting a state trooper tracking a LoJack device in a suspected stolen motorcycle a few blocks from the Georgia Capitol in downtown Atlanta, Bankhead said.
The police officer suffered a flesh wound in the head and was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital.
Witnesses recalled a wild scene as swarms of officers looked for the two other suspects, who were found in a building by SWAT officers.
One of the suspects has an uspecified outstanding warrant in Fayette County, south of Atlanta, the GBI said.
