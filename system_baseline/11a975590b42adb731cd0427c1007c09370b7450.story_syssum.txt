The service's demise after nearly eight years has come as a shock to many who depend on it to collect news into one place from all the websites they love.
Google Takeout bundles up your feeds, folders, followers and other data into a zip file that you can use later with other services.
Some new tools were rushed on to beat the July 1 demise of Google Reader and are bound to undergo more changes and improvements -- some are still being created such as Betaworks' Digg Reader.
Major news surfaces naturally on the social network; a chorus of links or commentary about important stories will likely make its way into anyone's feed, whether they're following news junkies or just friends.
It is decent for finding recommended links, but the posts and banter are more personal, happy and less about the outside world.
They use your interests and some algorithms to figure out what types of articles and topics you will be most interested in and then serve up content that fits with your patterns.
RSS readers are great because you can scan headlines and the first few sentences of articles and get the gist without having to read them, only going further if it's a topic about which you want to know more.
Save the things you want to dig into later, even offline, with tools such as Instapaper, Pocket or Readability.
The true minimalists can avoid the noise by checking one or two outlets once a day, trusting that the major stories will be featured prominently.
For example, some go directly to their bookmarked must-read sites in the morning, keep up on current news with Twitter during the day and soak in longer articles on commutes with tools such as Instapaper.
Google Reader was a great tool that will be missed, but its death is an opportunity to try new things and play with different apps, sites and tools for reading news online.
