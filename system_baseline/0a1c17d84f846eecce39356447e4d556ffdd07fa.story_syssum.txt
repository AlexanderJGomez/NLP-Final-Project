The suspect remained at large Sunday night, believed to be somewhere in the expansive park, Mount Rainier National Park spokeswoman Lee Taylor said.
The bloodshed began with what the spokesman called "a normal traffic stop" around 10:30 a.m. PT (1:30 p.m.
Taylor said that authorities were able to "evacuate most of the people ... safely," with more than 100 people "holed up in our primary visitor center" with food, water and five law enforcement officers standing guard.
"She was a person with a quick smile, a very gentle person, a very competent ranger," said Taylor.
"This gunman took the life of somebody who had a great deal to live for and was making great contributions to society by being a national park ranger."
