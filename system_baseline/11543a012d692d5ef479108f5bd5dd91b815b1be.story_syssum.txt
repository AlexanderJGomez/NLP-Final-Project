Their goal is to convince voters to reject a law passed earlier this year that could force insurers to pay up to triple damages and lawyer fees if they fail to pay a legitimate claim and then lose in court.
Kirby and his fellow Washington state lawmakers heard so many complaints from policy holders who believed insurers weren't treating them fairly that earlier this year they passed a law called "The Fair Conduct Act."
"The insurance companies stepped in and said, 'Consumers, you get to decide if you want to do this,' '' said Dana Childers, executive director of the Liability Reform Coalition, which is leading the insurance company charge to defeat the new law.
Kreidler said he strongly supports the new law and that if insurance companies act responsibly they have nothing to fear.
There's going to be no treble damages, because if companies deal with their customers in good faith there's no penalty."
The strategy has tied up courts across the country -- over minor claims, judges told CNN -- for months and even years.
"It really came down to basically three elements: a position of delay, a position of denying a claim and ultimately defending that claim that you're denied," said Jim Mathis, a former insurance industry insider.
The first company agreed to pay but her own insurer, Allstate, refused to pay even though she had coverage.
She said Allstate dug into her medical past.
Allstate said it could not comment on individual claims but said cases like Tribble's prove "that the current judicial system is working."
