(CNN) -- The Justice Department charged Toyota with wire fraud on Wednesday as part of a settlement with prosecutors that will require the auto giant to pay $1.2 billion for admittedly misleading consumers and the government over unintended acceleration.
GM engineers apparently knew about it years ago but the Detroit automaker did not move to recall vehicles until last month.
Not only did Toyota fail to recall cars with problem parts, they continued to manufacture new cars with the same parts they knew were deadly," he said.
"In the more than four years since these recalls, we have gone back to basics at Toyota to put our customers first," he said.
The company has settled similar allegations over unintended acceleration in agreements with a group of states, and has also settled with some vehicle owners.
