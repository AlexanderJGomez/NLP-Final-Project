ROOSEVELT, New York (CNN) -- When Lisa Brown moved into her rental house on Long Island last summer with her three daughters, she says, it felt like a new beginning.
Brown and her family are being evicted not because of anything they did, but because her landlord defaulted on the mortgage and the house fell into foreclosure.
Watch Lisa Brown's talk about why she has to move Â»  The broker explained that the landlord no longer owns the property and that the lease was no longer valid.
In most states, when a bank forecloses on a landlord, the tenant has no guarantee of being allowed to stay in the property, and neither the bank nor the landlord has a legal obligation to tell the tenant about the foreclosure.
"In many instances, they're actually paying their rent on time, and the owner of the property who is in foreclosure is pocketing the money," he says.
"What we're facing here", Klein says, "is sort of the new homeless population unless we do something about it."
She had also paid $5,700 for a security deposit and broker fees to secure the house.
CNN tried to reach the owner, who lives upstairs, for comment, but her phone was disconnected, and no one answered the door.
The bank that foreclosed on the house, and now owns it, offered her $1,000 to get out, but she says she's lost close to $6,000 and has nowhere to go.
For now, though, she says she will adjust her dreams and find another place for her family to live.
