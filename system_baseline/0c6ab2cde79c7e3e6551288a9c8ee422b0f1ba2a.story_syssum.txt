Unlike in the United States where the Capitol police is responsible for security at the U.S. Capitol, four different agencies are charged with ensuring the safety of various parts of the parliament building in Canada.
It is there that Michael Zehaf-Bibeau killed Nathan Cirillo, a reservist guarding a tomb for the country's fallen, injured two others and then headed for the parliament.
John Manley, a former deputy prime minister, said it's too early to make conclusions on whether there was a communication breakdown.
"Somebody who decides that they want to rush the building can walk up ... and then rush into the building before anybody can really effectively do anything," lawmaker Marc Garneau told CNN partner network CTV.
"I just think what's really important to remember from this is that Parliament Hill is an incredible public place that's open for people to play football and come and protest and sit and have their lunches, do their yoga," Charlie Angus told CTV.
