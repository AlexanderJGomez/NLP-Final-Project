Semenya gained attention in 2009 before the World Championships in Berlin -- not for her athletic prowess, but because some questioned the then-18-year-old's gender.
While both men and women produce testosterone in their bodies, in men it produces more muscle, adding to athletic prowess.
Semenya had no womb or ovaries, according to the report, and had undescended testes, causing her to have triple the levels of testosterone of other female athletes.
"There's no simple test to determine gender, so what we're left with is an imperfect system," says Dr. Eric Vilain, a UCLA medical geneticist who served as a medical adviser to the IOC on its new policy for testing female athletes for "hyperandrogenism" -- meaning producing too many male hormones.
The IOC then projects this supposed gap onto differences in male and female athletic performance, claiming they 'differ mainly due to the fact that men produce significantly more androgenic hormones than women.'"
Vilain says he believes it would be "extraordinarily difficult" for women to reach the male range threshold for testosterone, which is not spelled out by the IOC because of differing lab testing methods.
He says that for the small number of female athletes who learn they have high levels of testosterone, treating the condition, whether it is caused by a disorder of sex development or an adrenal malfunction, will benefit their health.
