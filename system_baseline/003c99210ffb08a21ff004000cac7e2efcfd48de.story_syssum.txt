"Disabled children -- they're really the forgotten ones in this war," said Blauser, 43.
"They are often not seen in society."
For these children and their families, limited access to health care has taken a toll.
There's not a doctor available for help [and] there's no pediatric wheelchair source in this country," Blauser said.
In 30 days, 31 pediatric and small adult wheelchairs arrived in Mosul for distribution to children in need.
"The experience for me in the first distribution was awesome," said Blauser.
"When I heard the news of the distribution of these advanced wheelchairs, I was very happy deep down," she said.
The boy is among hundreds of disabled Iraqi children to benefit from Blauser's generosity.
The organization provides wheelchairs designed for rough terrains in developing nations, making the devices "perfect for this environment," said Blauser.
"By providing what they need, I'm hoping to start a movement to change the way people think about disabled children," said Blauser.
