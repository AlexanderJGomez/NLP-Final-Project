In the past decade, Griffith -- perhaps best known for her Grammy-winning 1993 album, "Other Voices, Other Rooms" -- had faced a political climate she didn't agree with, as well as recovery from thyroid and breast cancer, which she was diagnosed with in the late '90s.
However, with her latest album, "The Loving Kind" (Rounder), Griffith is as focused and passionate as she has been in years.
Describing herself as someone who was "fed up with negativity," Griffith was equally inspired by her fellow countrymen.
I was hurt by the direction my country was going in.
... Just wondering why I never knew about this and how important that case is currently with equality in marriage.
But I see so much optimism about the direction of the country and [general] openness.
CNN: Now, in addition to "The Loving Kind," there are other songs based on actual events on this record.
I'm a total abolitionist when it comes to the death penalty, but this case really stunned me, because I feel like this country has evolved enough to where we shouldn't have to live with the death penalty.
But it's important to me that my audience hear these stories.
This country is full of them, and especially my home state of Texas.
Griffith: I was always more interested in story songs, things with a point of view ... and things that informed me.
Griffith: Many have asked that, but I was actually inspired to write that by watching an interview with Shania Twain where she said it would not have mattered if she remained a lounge act for her whole career.
