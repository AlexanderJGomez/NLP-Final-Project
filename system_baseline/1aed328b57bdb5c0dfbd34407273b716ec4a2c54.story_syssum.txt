There is about $9.74 million of taxpayer funds available to pay for the transition, but experts say that's not enough.
"I really do hope Obama sticks by his principles and does not accept corporate money, does not accept money from lobbyists, and places a very, very low ceiling on the amount of money he'd accept from individuals to pay for his inauguration," said Craig Holman, a legislative representative for Public Citizen.
President Bush raised a record $42.8 million for his second inauguration, and according to Public Citizen, more than 90 percent of donations to his second inauguration were from executives or corporations.
And I think he's actually got a good resource base of donors that are willing and probably will give money for both the transition effort, but also the inaugural campaign as well," said David Lewis, a professor of political science at Vanderbilt University and author of "The Politics of Presidential Appointments."
Obama could also hold on to the money and use it for a future federal campaign, such as a re-election bid.
