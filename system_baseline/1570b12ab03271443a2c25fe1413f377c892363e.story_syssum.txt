This is a question that a journalist based in Tehran posted on his Facebook account eight days before election day.
Unlike the four previous presidential elections during which the streets were turned into lively and colorful carnivals with the supporters of different candidates engaging in unending debates and fervent speeches, this time it is only the walls of the streets that have been covered with banners and posters.
It is as if this time it is not the public per se but individual observers who are deciding in their heads what to do on election day.
The supporters of the two Reformist candidates tried to persuade those advocating banning the elections while at the same time engaged in passionate polemics over which one of their candidates was better.
The Iranian regime had different political calculations for Rafsanjani's disqualification but definitely one of them was to prevent the polarization of the election and ultimately seeing it turn into a carnival -- like in 2009 -- which was impossible to contain even after the election was over.
Not only did the reformist and "principalist" candidates [who back the Supreme Leader] attack each other but the principalist ones -- who were supposed to be in a coalition -- also went after one another.
But while commenting is allowed, there is a very short trace of vernacular voices under the posts.
But they have one main difference: Principalist online activists monitor and follow their opponents but they are less being seen.
This is why this year it was decided that the spring semester of universities would be finished sooner so that student bodies would not have the chance to have any election activity -- which even drew criticism from the pro-regime student bodies.
Using Slavoj Zizek's analogy, Iran's 2013 presidential election so far resembles drinking decaffeinated coffee, it tastes like coffee but you are not supposed to get a caffeine buzz from it.
