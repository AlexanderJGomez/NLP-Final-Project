She says she was 17-years old at the time of her first encounter with Prince Andrew, which is under the legal age of consent in Florida.
She claims in court papers that Andrew's Scotland Yard protection officers left her alone with him the first time he had sex with her and that she was later involved in an orgy with the Prince and approximately eight other girls.
I have witnessed personally what a good, no-nonsense communicator Andrew is at events he has inspired and hosted.
Two of the important initiatives he has inspired are the Digital Enterprise Awards -- referred to as "iDEA" -- which he is working with the Nominet Trust to deliver.
In 2014 the Duke launched Pitch@Palace, and held two competitive pitch events at St James's Palace, worked with 76 entrepreneurs from across the UK.
His efforts focus on three core areas where he believes he can have the greatest impact: Education and skills, promoting apprenticeships as a desirable path to a career is one of his big issues.
Last month he hosted the Duke of York Award for Technical Education at St James's Palace to celebrate the achievements of students in University Technical Colleges (UTC's) across the United Kingdom.
Because there are still simply too many unanswered questions about his role in the scandal engulfing him; not least what was the nature of his relationship with Epstein, a man convicted of procuring underage woman for prostitution, why did he visit him AFTER he was released from prison and what was the nature of his association with Virginia Roberts (Jane Doe 3) who he was photographed with when she says she was a teenager.
It may be wiser for the media to show a measure of fairness and restraint when reporting allegations that are -- no matter how salacious and good copy -- after all just that, allegations.
The only way, perhaps, Andrew can hope to move on is by giving a detailed rebuttal of all the allegations that have been made against him in a sworn affidavit.
