Icy conditions and strong currents hampered efforts to locate and raise the plane's left engine, which apparently tore from the Airbus A320 when it hit the water in an emergency landing January 15.
After an initial examination at the site, the engine will be shipped with the plane's other engine to the manufacturer, where "the NTSB will supervise and direct a complete tear-down of each engine," NTSB spokesman Peter Knudson said.
Investigators said this week that they found a single feather and evidence of "soft-body impact damage" on the aircraft.
Samples of what appears to be organic material found in the right engine and on the wings and fuselage have been sent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Newly released video captured seconds after the Airbus A320 ditched in the Hudson River showed passengers trying to flee the aircraft almost immediately after it settled in the water and began to float along the river current.
The video, which the Con Edison utility company released Thursday, first shows a long wake behind the plane before zooming in on the aircraft.
Some passengers jump into the water, which was a chilly 41 degrees when the plane splashed down on the afternoon of January 15.
A person manning the camera from inside the plant saw the plane hit the water and redirected the camera, Olert said.
