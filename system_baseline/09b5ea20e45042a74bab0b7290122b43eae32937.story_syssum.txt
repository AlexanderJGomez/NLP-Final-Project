But the idea has prompted worry from some parents and experts about the role and effectiveness of gun safety programs in a classroom setting.
There is no reason for them to be teaching about gun safety when there are children with parents like me," Aimee Patton, a Kansas City blogger and mom to a 6-year-old girl, told CNN in a phone interview.
"The purpose of the program will be to promote safety and protection of children and emphasize how students should respond if they encounter a firearm," says the bill, which was sponsored by state Sen. Dan Brown, a lifetime member of the NRA.
But in testimony before the U.S. Senate earlier this year, NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said the group has a "long and proud history of teaching" safe and responsible gun ownership across the board and to kids, in particular.
"Our 'Eddie Eagle' children's safety program has taught over 25 million young children that if they see a gun, they should do four things: "Stop.
"The purpose of the 'Eddie Eagle' Program isn't to teach whether guns are good or bad, but rather to promote the protection and safety of children," the organization's website says, adding that its purpose is to prevent accidents.
"There are too many kids who grab the guns and kill their cousins.
Another 2004 study of the "Eddie Eagle" program, published by North Dakota State University's Department of Psychology, found that children were able to verbally repeat the program's message, but when they encountered a gun in a role-playing scenario, they were unable to put the skills to use.
He said schools have to play a bigger role in the gun safety discussion but "in concert with the parents."
Brown said first-graders shouldn't be doing experiential learning with guns and felt the "Eddie Eagle" video would be enough.
