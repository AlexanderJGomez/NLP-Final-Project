A Washoe County, Nevada, jury convicted James Michael Biela, 28, of first-degree murder and sexual assault in the death of Brianna Denison.
From the witness stand in Biela's capital murder trial, one of the women recounted how she was attacked on the University of Nevada-Reno campus.
The trial began with emotional testimony from Denison's mother, her boyfriend, and a video showing her with friends at a diner just a few hours before she was abducted.
Her case triggered a flurry of national media coverage and thousands of tips, including the one that led to Biela's arrest.
She told investigators a friend's boyfriend had a truck similar to the description, and that her friend had seen women's panties inside it.
Biela's defense attorneys challenged the DNA testing method, claiming it was not accurate.
