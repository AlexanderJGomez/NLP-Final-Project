New York state regulators this week accused StanChart of breaching sanctions against Iran through illicit transactions -- which the bank denies -- while HSBC took a $700m charge last month to cover US fines over its Mexican division's failure to prevent money laundering.
Shares in StanChart on Monday suffered their heaviest one-day fall in decades after New York state's Department of Financial Services branded it a "rogue institution" and accused it of having breached US sanctions by carrying out $250bn worth of transactions with the Iranian government.
"The Korean financial regulators have always been quite mindful of the US sanctions and the regulations related to Iranian counterparties," he said.
It reached a preliminary agreement in April to sell its Korean retail business to Korea Development Bank, but talks broke down last month.
