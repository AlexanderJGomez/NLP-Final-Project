CNN projects incumbent Sen. Pat Roberts has fended off conservative challenger Milton Wolf in the state's GOP Senate primary.
Wolf's campaign for months tried to portray Roberts as more in tune with Washington than Kansas, pointing to reports from earlier this year that the senator listed his voting address at the home of two longtime political supporters who rent a room to him.
Still, Roberts was seen as the heavy favorite in the nomination battle with a large double-digit lead in the most recent poll.
At the same time, the Roberts' campaign over the past couple of months went up with TV ads reminding voters that Wolf, a radiologist, posted X-ray images of mortal injuries and made light of them and the victims.
He enjoyed the backing and the support of some major national tea party groups, such as the Tea Party Patriots and the Tea Party Express, and some influential anti-establishment organizations, like the Senate Conservatives Fund and the Madison Project.
You tell us that you are tough and you're tested and trusted.
"When would be the time, senator, because I'll go anywhere you'd like.
When you're 20 points down, these are the kind of desperate stunts you pull," spokesman Sean Fitzpatrick said.
Also in Kansas, Rep. Mike Pompeo beat former congressman Todd Tiahrt in the Republican primary for the state's 4th Congressional District, CNN projects.
Challenger Brian Ellis, a businessman who has support from the Chamber of Commerce, tried to unseat two-term Rep. Justin Amash, a libertarian who won his seat in the 2010 tea party wave that landed Republicans in the House majority.
She announced plans earlier this year to run for the seat being vacated by her husband, Rep. John Dingell, the longest serving member of Congress in history.
