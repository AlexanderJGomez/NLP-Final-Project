In a country currently polarized by politics the band are concerned some of the songs featured on "El Sekka Shemal" ("Wrong Turn") could make them targets for the authorities.
In doing so they realize they could face censorship and defamation campaigns, similar to those faced by television satirist Bassem Youssef who had his show cancelled last September after mocking supporters of Egypt's military.
Sitting at the makeshift studio within Eid's family apartment in which the band recorded most of their songs for the past 10 years, they insist they are not political.
After years of little success or recognition they rose to prominence through their participation in "Sout El-Horreya" ("The Sound of Freedom"), a song recorded during the Tahrir Square sit-in in 2011.
For the band the song symbolizes a clash of generations, which they think is the source of most of Egypt's problems: an older generation holding on to an idea of stability and a younger one trying to shape the future it will live in.
(We) work very slowly, but we never go back... Look at the past three years, regimes changed and we continued the revolution," says Eid.
