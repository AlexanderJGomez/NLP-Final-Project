Though, to be fair, he'd been indicating this for the better part of an hour.
And for some reason -- I still have no idea why -- at 10 a.m. on Sunday, lots of people were tweeting about it.
Apparently, things got a little crazy at the bar, there was a shared cab ride and, lo and behold, we now have Ruzzle.
After downloading the app and opening a game account (for which I was denied the user name "RealGilbertGottfried") I soon learned that Ruzzle consists of three two-minute rounds in which you and your opponent each get 16 letters placed in four rows of four that can be linked together to create words by gliding your finger over the screen at any connecting angle.
I won't be in this week.
However, if you're competitive like me, losing is just as bad as a blistering skin rash.
But I'm a glutton for punishment and told her to sign up so she could give me something to write about and, perhaps, humiliate me in the process.
And she's gone on to destroy me three more times.
Since then, I've at least found a way to defeat two random strangers whom I've played against, and this has temporarily restored my limited sense of self-worth.
I'm currently utilizing the English version of the game because, after 34 years, I've somehow managed to grasp it at a solid third-grade level.
So Ruzzle is officially something that matters, and, at press time, it was the No.
I get bored easily, and my interest is already starting to wane.
