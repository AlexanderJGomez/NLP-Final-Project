Two weeks after the unit began actually going out on operations in Iraq, it was ordered to redeploy to Kandahar in Afghanistan.
"The president has asked our military and our country to shift the focus and bolster the effort in Afghanistan, and we are really spearheading some of that effort, so of course there is some excitement here," he said outside a building being cleared out.
That means the soldiers will probably be engaged in longer distance firefights while on their patrols and their training in Baghdad before the deployment mirrored that.
Between 50 and 70 gigantic C-17 cargo planes are necessary to transport dozens of heavy armored mine-resistant vehicles, containers and pallets -- all this as the Air Force's capabilities are strained due to regular combat operations.
Lt. William Hutaff, one of the first soldiers to leave for Afghanistan as part of an advance party, had his flight delayed several times and waited almost two days before he could board one of the cargo planes.
Leaving the aircraft, the soldiers said they were tired and looking to get into their new housing units.
Getting settled in meant sleeping in cots in a tent designed to house more than 100 people, but the base itself proved more developed than many had thought, with a basketball court and even an hockey rink built by the Canadian contingent stationed there.
"There is still a lot of work to be done here," said Fitzgibbon.
