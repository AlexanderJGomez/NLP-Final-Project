The round-ups began May 28, days after the two main political parties said they would not cooperate with the military-backed caretaker government on organizing the elections.
The detentions, it said, are part of a planned sweep to rid the country of criminals.
The crackdown began after the Awami League and the BNP said they would not cooperate with the government to develop a roadmap toward democracy unless it first releases the parties' leaders.
The current political crisis in the Muslim-majority South Asian country of 150 million can be traced, in large part, to the lingering animosity between the two women, political observers say.
After its last stint in power ended in 2006, the BNP handed over rule to a caretaker government to conduct elections, as mandated by the country's constitution.
The rules allowed authorities to arrest people without a warrant as long as there was reasonable suspicion that he or she was connected to a crime, Human Rights Watch said.
The government wants to hold elections in the third week of December, and said the crusade on crime is part of its plan to ensure trouble-free balloting.
They want their leaders set free before they sit down and talk with the government about a roadmap toward a successful election.
Party members say the government's move is a ploy to sideline the pair from the elections by sending them out of the country.
"That actually makes the arrests suspicious in some people's minds," said Sultana Kamal, executive director of the legal aid group, Ain o Salish Kendro (Law and Adjudication Center).
