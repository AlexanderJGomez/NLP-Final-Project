Add to the mix boiling apocalyptic smoke clouds, desperate homeowners caught between fleeing or fighting the fire and sheets of fan-blasted flame that carpet whole stretches of country road, and it is little wonder that residents and firefighters regard bush fires with something approaching awe of the supernatural.
"Quite often what you get reported in the media are firefighters who are extremely stressed trying to put into words things they've witnessed, and interpreted by journalists who are keen to elaborate on the 'magic' of the situation," Sullivan told CNN.
"While seeing one house standing in a row of burnt houses may look surprising, when the fire was actually burning you learn sometime later there was someone there to put the fire out," Sullivan said.
"To all intents and purposes it looks like the fire has gone out but when there's a change of wind direction, there's always residual heat in the char fuel," he said.
He said the burnt fuel can sometimes retain heat for long periods -- even without oxygen -- and has many of the qualities of peat fires, which burn underground for months.
With the pattern of bad fire weather recurring during the fire season, he said new fires are sparked by old fires with depressing regularity.
