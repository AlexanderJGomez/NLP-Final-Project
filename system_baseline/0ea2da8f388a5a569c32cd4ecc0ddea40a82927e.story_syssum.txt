The acting head of the Internal Revenue Service said Thursday that evidence so far shows only conservative groups underwent extra scrutiny cited by an inspector general's disclosure of the agency's targeting of applications for tax exempt status.
"I didn't want to leave the committee with the impression that we're not seeing diversity of political labels across the spectrum," Werfel said of the IRS targeting.
Camp said Werfel's report, filed just over a month after his appointment by President Barack Obama to clean up the mess at the IRS, lacked accountability and reached unsubstantiated conclusions.
Camp also warned Werfel that the targeting scandal and other IRS controversies, such as wasteful spending in past years, would affect his panel's consideration budget request for more money next year.
Republican leaders contend the targeting uncovered by the inspector general's audit indicated political villainy by the Obama administration to try to stifle opponents, such as groups with "tea party" in their names that were flagged for additional IRS scrutiny.
Werfel's report Monday said the five IRS managers replaced included the previous acting commissioner he succeeded, as well as the head of the unit based in Cincinnati that handles tax-exempt applications.
As part of his review, Werfel said 80 groups awaiting IRS action on their applications for tax-exempt status for more than 120 days could self-register with the agency as long as they certified under penalty of perjury that they would comply with applicable laws and regulations.
Werfel said the IRS would continue checking on tax-exempt groups to ensure they were following the law.
