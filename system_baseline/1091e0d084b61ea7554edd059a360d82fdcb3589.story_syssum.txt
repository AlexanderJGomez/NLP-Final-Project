What should not be a surprise to any of us, however, is that Russia continues to spy on the United States.
It is safe to assume that since the end of World War II there has never been a day that the Soviet Union or Russia was not spying on the United States, or vice versa.
After September 11, Russia reluctantly allowed the United States military to operate out of bases in Central Asia, which it views as its own backyard.
Moscow seems to have calculated that with these agents in place, there was little reason to pull them out, even if relations with Washington were on the upswing.
It's not clear what, if anything, these new accused illegals were able to do to steal sensitive information or even help other agents.
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, himself a former KGB officer, has said that he hopes the incident will not damage the improving relations between the two countries.
The United States, of course, cannot be expected to like the fact that Russia spies on us, and is briefly entitled to a modest amount of indignation.
