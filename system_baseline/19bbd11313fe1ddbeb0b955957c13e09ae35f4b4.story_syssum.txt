Chris Christie blasted Democrat Mary Burke on Monday, saying the Wisconsin gubernatorial hopeful can't be trusted after her campaign hired a political consultant who appeared to plagiarize parts of her job plan from other candidates.
"If you can't trust her honesty and her integrity when she tells you that this is her plan, why would you trust her honesty and integrity on anything else she tells you about what she'll do for Wisconsin or about Scott's record?"
And in describing some of these ideas, similar language was used by the consultant that was used in those ideas that he incorporated in other candidates' plans."
Christie's appearance for Walker, a fellow potential contender for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, came the same day as first lady Michelle Obama campaigned for Burke in Milwaukee.
She doesn't care about politics."
