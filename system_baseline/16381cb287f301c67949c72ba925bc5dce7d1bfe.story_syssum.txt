One toe was still fastened onto the right foot of the mummy of the daughter of an Egyptian priest, who may have suffered from diabetes.
For most of history, prosthetic limbs were used primarily to restore function and secondarily to mimic the human form (one of the Egyptian toes even had a false toenail).
In 2007, however, the International Association of Athletics Federations banned Pistorius from competing in able-bodied competitions after tests at the German Sport University showed the Cheetah blades allowed him to expend less energy than able-bodied runners.
Pistorius assembled his own legal and scientific team and successfully appealed to the Court of Arbitration in Sport.
The ruling only applies to Pistorius, and right now there is no general decision nor any guidelines about the future use of what the court called "adaptive sports equipment."
Or an archer whose prosthetic arm does not tremble like an arm of flesh and blood?
In this year's U.S. Olympic trials, Dathan Ritzenhein, the two-time Olympian and 5k American record holder, was eliminated from the marathon team because of leg cramps.
In 1997, Casey Martin, a professional golfer with a circulatory disorder, sued under the American with Disabilities Act to be allowed to use a golf cart to play in the U.S. Open.
"Normal" refers to a range of functioning, and a good case can often be made that those at the lower end of the "normal" range have a disability.
Neither is "right," no matter how passionately some feel about it.
Pistorius' supporters argue instead that fairness in sport means allowing all qualified people to compete, even those born without fibulas.
More and more, our powerful technological achievements will butt heads with our sense of naturalness and fairness.
