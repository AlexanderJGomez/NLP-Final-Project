(EW.com) -- Pick a box-office record and "The Avengers" has probably broken it.
But as we all know, the most important thing about "The Avengers" is undoubtedly its role in the brilliant career of one Samuel Leroy Jackson.
Back in October, the Guinness Book of World Records named Jackson the highest-grossing actor in the history of movies -- the result of Jackson's insane four-films-per-year work ethic, his willingness to take supporting roles in mega-productions, and what we can only assume is a tremendous sense of humor.
If you could wear that eyepatch and Dorothy's ruby slippers and Audrey Hepburn's "Breakfast at Tiffany's" dress while riding Rosebud the Sled and swinging Luke Skywalker's lightsaber... well, you'd be a real weirdo, but at least you'd be wearing a totally sweet eyepatch.
