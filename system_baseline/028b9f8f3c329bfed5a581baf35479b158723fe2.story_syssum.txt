How can Mitt Romney contend with some of the things he said during the primary campaign which will come back to haunt him in the general election?
Romney desperately needs to improve his numbers with Latinos.
Polls show Romney trailing by as much as an unbelievable 50 percentage points behind President Obama with Hispanic voters.
He can't erase the things he's said on immigration.
From now until Election Day, when Romney gets asked an immigration question, he needs to start and finish by reminding Latinos that Obama promised, without caveats, to get immigration reform passed in his first year in office.
Romney has to remain staunchly anti-amnesty and pro-border security but at the same time sound sympathetic and understanding of the desperation of people who often risk their lives crossing a border so they can put food on their family's table.
He needs to talk about the benefits of immigration and how the richness of our diversity has made us a stronger country.
Romney is also going to have to put the time and resources into Hispanic outreach.
Romney needs to do the same, pronto, and he needs to make it count by delivering memorable speeches.
Come Election Day, I don't know whether Romney is going to do better with Hispanics than the polls indicate or if Obama is going to do worse.
