An Ohio sheriff defended the killings of more than four dozen lions, tigers and other wild animals Wednesday after they were turned loose from a farm outside Zanesville by its suicidal owner.
And with night falling Tuesday, he gave the order to kill the escaped animals.
Hanna, the zoo's director emeritus, said he was upset by loss of "precious" animals, but defended the decision to use deadly force.
Schools were closed, and some frightened residents said they were keeping to their homes as sheriff's deputies hunted lions, tigers, leopards and grizzly bears.
I just drove by and it walked out in front of me and was standing there under the street light," one caller to 911 told deputies.
A civil case seeking forfeiture of firearms was pending, according to the U.S. attorney's office in Ohio's Southern District.
"It was like a war zone," Kopchak said when authorities descended on Thompson's property, set off the road named after Kopchak's family.
The community was in a state of "shock and surprise," said Tom Warne, owner of Donald's Donuts and a lifelong resident of Zanesville.
The Humane Society of the United States and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals urged Ohio officials Wednesday to issue an emergency rule to crack down on exotic animal ownership in the wake of the slaughter.

Local governments, she said, ought to train law enforcement officers so they are prepared for bizarre cases such as the one that unfolded in Zanesville.
