Spain international Diego Costa scored the winning goal midway through the second half after a much improved Liverpool took an early lead and can count themselves unlucky after having a goal disallowed and strong claims for a penalty waved way.
So it was with some surprise that only one player drafted in for that game at the Bernabeu kept their place, a move that paid almost immediate dividends.
After a fast paced, high quality opening exchange, German midfielder Emre Can drifted in and fired Liverpool into the lead after his shot took a wicked deflection off Gary Cahill.
Both teams had chances -- Mario Balotelli had the ball in the back of the net but it was ruled offside -- before Chelsea began to take control of the game and Costa fired home after good work by Ceser Azpilicueta on the left.
A typically modest Jose Mourinho, on the other hand, focused on Chelsea's fine performance away from home, claiming that the penalty incident was "too far for me" to see.
The win saw Chelsea extend its lead at the top of the Premier League to seven points, but only briefly.
Elsewhere another Dutchman enjoyed a good day at the office.
From the resulting free kick from the first disallowed goal, City goalkeeper Joe Hart passed the ball straight to Austin who slotted the ball home again.
Premier League top scorer Sergio Aguero leveled the score, despite being both offside and handling the ball in the build up, before a late Martin Demichelis own goal appeared to have handed QPR an unlikely victory.
