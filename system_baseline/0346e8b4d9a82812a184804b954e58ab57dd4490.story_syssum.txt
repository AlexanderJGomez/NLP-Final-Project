For many on the outside, there seemed little amiss in the lives of Ferrante and Klein.
They both had successful careers, including Klein as a top neurologist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.
When paramedics arrived, they found Klein on the floor of the kitchen with a plastic bag containing creatine.
At the time the order was placed, there were no active projects at Ferrante's lab that involved the use of cyanide, according to the complaint.
And when investigators looked at the bottle, they found that over 8 grams of cyanide were missing from it.
"Further, evidence has been uncovered that reflects that the victim intended to have a conversation with Ferrante and Ferrante would 'not like the discussion,'" the complaint adds.
"I thought he was very candid ... and he was telling the truth."
Difenderfer said that it's going to take time to review the "80-plus search warrants, multitudes of evidence (and) terabytes of information" before deciding on the defense team's next steps, including a possible appeal.
