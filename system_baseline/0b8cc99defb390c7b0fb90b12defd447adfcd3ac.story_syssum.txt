Before his tenure with the administration, where he has become a key player on foreign policy issues, Blinken was a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
McCain pointed to statements Blinken made then that "Iraq has never been so prosperous, so powerful, and peaceful as it is today," as reason enough for preventing his nomination.
Menendez said Blinken's statements were part and parcel of those of an official who was duty bound to advocate on behalf of that administration.
Blinken was confirmed Tuesday by a vote of 55 to 38.
