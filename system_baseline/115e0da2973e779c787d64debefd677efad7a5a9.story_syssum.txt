Caluori is charged with making threats against the president and assaulting a federal officer, according to the affidavit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Seattle.
A database check confirmed that Caluori lived at the address in the e-mail," Molnar said in his affidavit, and the username of the e-mail account appeared consistent with his name.
The third time, a man later identified as Caluori opened the door, Molnar said.
"Officer Hensing and I were able to take Caluori to the ground.
Molnar said one of them asked Caluori if there was anything in the apartment that "would hurt" law officers and he replied, "There are things inside that go boom."
The pistol on his ankle was loaded with "five hollow point .38 special caliber rounds," it said, and about 50 12-gauge shotgun rounds were recovered from the shotgun and the bandoleer.
in the affidavit, said Caluori "spends a lot of time on the computer" but she "does not know what he does on it."
"Recent national events are a stark reminder that we must take these threats of death or violence seriously," U. S. Attorney Jenny A. Durkan said in a news release.
"This case had all the troubling ingredients: threats of violence and explosive devices, multiple weapons with hundreds of rounds and even brandishing of a weapon at law enforcement."
A detention hearing has been set for Monday, the U.S. attorney's office said.
