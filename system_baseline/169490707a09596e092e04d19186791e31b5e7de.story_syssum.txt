(CNN) -- Lukas Rosol shocked the sporting world, and perhaps even himself, by defeating two-time champion Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon, but the unknown Czech is not the first to have triumphed against seemingly impossible odds.
"Champions really live in a different place than the rest - they dare to dream," he said.
His only other appearance on the hallowed grass courts ended in a first-round doubles defeat last year.
"You don't make top 100 or even the top 10, let alone win a grand slam, by being aggressive all the time," said McCraw, who has worked extensively with stars such as Maria Sharapova and Jelena Jankovic.
Would be shocked if Rosol can get anywhere near that form again."
"It's got nothing to do with how far he goes after that, only that on this day he lived his dreams, played to or above his potential and the moment rewarded him with a victory.
