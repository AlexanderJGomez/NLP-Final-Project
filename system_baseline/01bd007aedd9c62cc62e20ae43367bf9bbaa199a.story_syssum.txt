New York (CNN) -- A city official married the first couple in New York City to wed under the state's new law allowing same-sex marriage Sunday.
"These are two independent people who are joining together because they can see and they can feel how much better their lives will be," city clerk Michael McSweeney said as he married Siegal and Kopelov.
The office could handle less than a third of those requests -- gay or straight -- on Sunday, according to a press statement the city released earlier in the week.
"Marriage equality is alive and well in every borough of New York City right now," said Christine Quinn, speaker of the New York City Council, who is also gay.
The two tearfully said their vows as friends hovered and snapped pictures.
The two have been wearing rings for five years, and said they don't plan to exchange new ones.
The couple's two adopted sons, ages 25 and 22, attended the ceremony.
New York Rabbi Sharon Kleinbaum of Beit Simchat Torah congregation, who has lobbied for legalizing same-sex marriage, set up a station for couples desiring a religious ceremony after the civil one.
A handful of protesters were outside the city clerk's office in Manhattan Sunday morning.
"All eyes are upon it, and I believe it is going to help propel this movement forward faster than any of the other states have," Quinn said.
