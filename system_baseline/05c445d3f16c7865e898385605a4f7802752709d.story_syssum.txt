(CNN) -- Leaders from Britain and Iran met Wednesday for the first time in 35 years, a potential breakthrough conversation that occurs at a time when Tehran is trying to shed Western-led sanctions over its nuclear program and Western nations are trying to garner international support for their campaign against ISIS.
The two leaders have "severe disagreements," Cameron said, pointing to "Iran's support for terrorist organizations, its nuclear program, its treatment of its people.
In fact, Iranian leaders have voiced support for Iraq's government -- which is also led by Shiites -- in its fight against the Islamic extremist organization.
Iran has been one of the biggest allies of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, the man who U.S. President Barack Obama and other Western leaders have publicly said they want out of power -- even going so far as to support moderate opposition elements fighting to oust him.
Rouhani used rhetorical questions to make his case on Twitter, writing, "Wasn't DAESH (#ISIS) the same group who fought the Syrian gov & the Syrian army?
