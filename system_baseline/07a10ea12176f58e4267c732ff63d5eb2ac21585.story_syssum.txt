Facebook, or "FB" as it's now known to investors, may have made amateur analysts on the Web go wild.
Facebook's was the biggest opening ever for a tech company and the third-largest IPO in U.S. history, behind only Visa and General Motors.
Business Insider posted a poll (obviously not scientific) asking readers where they thought the $38 stock would be by the end of the day Friday.
On rival network Twitter, many observers seemed to be rooting against Facebook and its early investors, finding a measure of glee in the fact that the price didn't skyrocket as some had predicted.
And then there was this sports metaphor, which referenced a certain polarizing NBA star.
"Few hours into trading and Facebook's stocks maintain a $40 value," wrote Giuseppe D'Antonio.
At CNN content partner Mashable, a blog that got its start focusing exclusively on social media and saw its popularity rise as Facebook's did, the staff geared up by creating an IPO-inspired playlist on music site Spotify (which, perhaps not coincidentally, is accessible only through a Facebook account).
