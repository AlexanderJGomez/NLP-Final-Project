Texting a picture of his lifeless mother to his 12-year-old girlfriend.
The family disputed any media characterization that the teen was a loner and said he had many friends and was a wrestler in state tournaments.
What we do agree on is that those who wish to score political points should not use a confused, misguided, 15-year-old boy to make their case," the family statement said.
He is a troubled young man who made a terrible decision that will haunt him and his family forever."
He was arrested Saturday night, after deputies found the bodies of his mother, father, brother and two of his sisters in their home on the outskirts of Albuquerque.
The boy went on to kill his sisters, 5-year-old Jael and 2-year-old Angelina, before his father Greg came home from a volunteer graveyard shift at a homeless shelter.
Authorities believe the father, a former pastor at an Albuquerque church and a chaplain to the city's fire department, was the last to be gunned down in the home.
He even sent his girlfriend a picture of his slain mother, Houston said.
Griego was scheduled to appear in court Tuesday to face two counts of murder and three counts of child abuse resulting in death, but the hearing was waived, CNN affiliate KOAT reported.
"This is beyond any human reasoning or understanding at this time," the sheriff said.
