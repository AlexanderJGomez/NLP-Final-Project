(CNN) -- China has halted imports of some New Zealand milk powders after a company disclosed that three batches of an ingredient used in sports drinks and baby formula tested positive for a strain of bacteria that causes botulism.
"Our technical teams have been working closely this weekend with Coca-Cola, Wahaha and Vitaco and have established that the process used to manufacture their products would kill the bacteria that was in the affected whey protein concentrate," Gary Romano, Fonterra's managing director of NZ Milk Products, said in a company statement.
"And it has also been quite specific about the range of Fonterra products which it has temporarily suspended."
Two years later, a Fonterra-supplied company in China faced scrutiny over claims that their milk powder led to premature sexual development in infant girls.
At the time, Fonterra said it remained "100% confident about the quality of its products."
