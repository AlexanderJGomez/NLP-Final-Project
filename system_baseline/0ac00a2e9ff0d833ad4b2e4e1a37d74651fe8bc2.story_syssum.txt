They brought in extra officers and provided patrols to the families of Lane's victims.
Lane was serving consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole for his attack at Chardon High School on February 27, 2012.
"You never plan on someone escaping and certainly someone of that notoriety, you would think that they would take special precautions to prevent this," Ian Friedman, who represented him at his trial, said late Thursday.
In addition, the number of inmate assaults on staff increased by 60.7% last year, compared with 2012.

"We're upset this happened," said Ron Parmetor, whose nephew Daniel Parmetor, 16,  was one of Lane's victims.
At the sentencing hearing, Lane unbuttoned his blue dress shirt to reveal a white T-shirt on which he had scrawled the word "KILLER" across the front.
"For everyone in that courtroom -- the victims, their families, the prosecutors, defense -- everyone in that courtroom was just absolutely taken aback," said Friedman, who hasn't talked to Lane in about a year.
