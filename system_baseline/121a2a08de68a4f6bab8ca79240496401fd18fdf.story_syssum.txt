Dhoni, who made his debut in 2005, captained India in 60 of his 90 Test matches but decided to quit on Tuesday following the draw with Australia in Melbourne which meant his side conceded the series.
The wicket-keeper batsman missed five one-day games against Sri Lanka in November after suffering a hand injury, the same problem which forced him out of the opening Test against Australia earlier this month.
The draw meant that it was unable to overturn the deficit and slumped to yet another overseas defeat -- a recurring theme during Dhoni's reign.
Dhoni replaced Anil Kumble as captain in 2008 after guiding India to victory in the very first World Twenty20 title the previous year.
This latest defeat by Australia comes on the back of similar results in England, New Zealand and South Africa.
It will also face South Africa, West Indies, Zimbabwe, Ireland and United Arab Emirates in the group stages.
He has scored 8,192 runs at an average of 52.85.
