(CNN) -- Olympic figure skater Nancy Kerrigan Solomon tearfully pleaded Thursday for leniency for her brother, who was sentenced to prison on a lesser charge in his fatal altercation with their father.
The judge sentenced Mark Kerrigan to serve two years in prison, followed by two years of probation, during which he will have to satisfy several conditions, including mental health and alcohol abuse treatment, according to O'Brien.
"My family has never believed at all that my brother had anything to do with my father's death," Nancy Kerrigan said outside the courthouse.
Kerrigan's family has said Daniel Kerrigan had a heart condition.
