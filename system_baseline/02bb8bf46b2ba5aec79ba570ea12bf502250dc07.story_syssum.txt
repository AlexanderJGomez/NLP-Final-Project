Nelson Mandela shouldn't be revered as a civil rights icon, the statements screamed: He should be exposed for what he is: A communist.
Mandela was branded a communist by the white apartheid government, which made it a crime to be one.
South Africa's government came down on the side of the West -- and communist or not, Mandela was squarely on the other side.
Then the government banned the communist party and the African National Congress, which fought for the freedom of black South Africans.
Mandela found the ANC too tame and had begun to push for a violent struggle in the 1940s, when he headed its youth league, the former professor of economics at Stellenbosch University said.
The United States government placed Mandela on a terror watch list, where he stayed until 2008 -- long after his term as President of South Africa, and even longer after his receiving the Nobel Peace Prize.
When Mandela returned home later that year, he was arrested and charged with illegal exit of the country and incitement to strike.
He may not have been directly behind the attacks, said Hermann Giliomee, a historian from South Africa.
Giliomee finds the 1963 plan amateurish, not exactly the design of a master terrorist.
"As I walked out the door toward the gate that would lead to my freedom, I knew if I didn't leave my bitterness and hatred behind, I'd still be in prison," Mandela said after he was freed.
"The day before he was sent to Robben Island, he made a speech in parliament that he was against all forms of racism."
During a world championship match against New Zealand, Mandela walked onto the pitch wearing the jersey of his team's captain.
The crowd began chanting his name.
