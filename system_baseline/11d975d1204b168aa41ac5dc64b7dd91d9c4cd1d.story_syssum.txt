(CNN) -- Veteran golfer Ernie Els took advantage of a remarkable collapse by long-time leader Adam Scott to win the British Open for the second time at Royal Lytham and St. Annes Sunday.
By contrast, Els finished with a birdie on his final hole and had been on the practice putting green preparing for a possible playoff.
A stunned Scott, who had started the day four shots ahead of American Brandt Snedeker and Graeme McDowell of Northern Ireland, admitted he had blown it.
Els is the 16th different winner of a golf major in a row, but it looked an unlikely scenario when he was six behind Scott after dropping two shots to the turn.
He had gone without a win in 36 major starts since his 2002 British Open triumph at Muirfield, but had never lost faith.
