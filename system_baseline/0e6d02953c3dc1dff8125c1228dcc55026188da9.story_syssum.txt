With more than 170,000 refugees on its northern border, and hundreds of thousands of people who have returned since independence, the newborn country is struggling.
At the Yusuf Batil camp in Maban County, where Wek visited last month, 15% of the children are being rushed into acute malnutrition programs.
In Upper Nile, nearly half the refugees are children under 11, and this group is suffering the most.
"This step in the process is exciting because it's the end of a long struggle," said Vincent Cochetel, the U.S. representative for UNHCR.
While talking with a mother who was sharing her joy over finally coming home, Wek also learned that programs to help people restart their lives are at risk of being cut because of competing needs in the country.
A container to transport clean water can literally save a life and just $20 can provide 10 jerrycans for refugees.
Wek plans to work with UNHCR not only on generating awareness for the emergency but also by helping the agency generate funds to support the returnees and their access to education.
The agency is working around the clock to ensure families are safe and receive shelter, water, food and health care.
