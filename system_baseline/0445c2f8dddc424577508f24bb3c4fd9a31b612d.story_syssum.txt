I remember asking someone why an orca -- a highly intelligent animal -- would attack its trainer or essentially "bite the hand that feeds it."
I set out to understand this incident, not as an animal activist -- because I'm not one -- but as a mother who had just taken her kids to SeaWorld, and of course as a documentary filmmaker who unfortunately can't let sleeping dogs lie.
Together we set out to tell this story of an incident at SeaWorld.
I have made television documentaries for 15 years, but "Blackfish" is my second feature documentary and my first one to have found theatrical distribution.
SeaWorld is a $2 billion a year entity, and they'll do anything to protect their greatest asset: Shamu.
At some point you're simply compelled, in spite of yourself, to tell a story that needs to be told no matter how scared you are of an entity that could squash you.
We advocate, instead, for captive killer whales to be retired into sea sanctuaries where they can live out the rest of their lives in a dignified, sustainable manner.
We can't throw them back into the ocean because they don't know how to hunt, their teeth are broken from years of stress and biting on metal gates, and they're hopped up on antibiotics and might die in the open ocean.
I don't know if it will change the way you feel about animals in entertainment parks.
And I trust that once audiences are armed with the truth, they will make the best decisions by themselves and their families.
