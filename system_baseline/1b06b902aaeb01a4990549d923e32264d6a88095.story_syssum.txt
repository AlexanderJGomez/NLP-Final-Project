The Supreme Court on Tuesday will confront its biggest case of the term so far, another high-profile challenge to affirmative action in college admissions.
A federal appeals court last year concluded the affirmative action ban, which Michigan voters passed in a 2006 referendum, violated the U.S. Constitution's equal protection guarantees.
Michigan voters approved the ban after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2003 that while state universities could use race as a factor in choosing which students to admit, they could not make race the determining factor in deciding whether applicants are accepted.
She eventually attended another school, and became the lead plaintiff in a subsequent discrimination lawsuit.
"How the court rules in this case will have national importance, determining whether or not citizens have the right to choose equality over discrimination."
In the 1978 Bakke case, the justices ruled universities have a compelling state interest in promoting diversity, and that allows for the use of affirmative action.
"But the justices can send signals to state legislatures, and to the public more generally, that either affirmation action is something they think should be encouraged, or something for which they're very suspicious."
The debate in recent years is whether and when affirmative action programs -- while constitutionally permissible now -- would eventually have to be phased out as the goal of obtaining diversity is met.
A written ruling could come as late as June.
