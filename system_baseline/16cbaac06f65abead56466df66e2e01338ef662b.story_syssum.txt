And so, legal analysts say, were the methods police used to obtain them.
By the time the boy was finished talking, say police in St. Johns, Arizona, he'd confessed to a premeditated double murder.
A review of the tapes shows that the boy's demeanor was more suitable for a session of show-and-tell than for a soul-baring confession as he describes the carnage he saw inside his home.
"There was blood all over his face, I think, and I think I touched it," he tells the officers.
Later, as the police officers' questions become increasingly pointed, the boy says he shot the men.
That statement came, several analysts agreed, long after the camera should have been shut off and the boy advised of his rights to keep silent or consult a lawyer.
"It's important, of course, to protect society from dangerous people of whatever age, but this case has been handled in such a way that seems to disregard the major challenges of dealing with such a young suspect," Toobin added.
Although authorities once planned to try the boy for murder in an adult court, the case has been referred to juvenile court, where the proceedings are less transparent.
As the questioning begins, the boy is treated more like a witness than a suspect.
"I'm comfortable with the way they approached the beginning of the interview," said CNN law enforcement analyst Mike Brooks, a former homicide detective.
He said the turning point on the tape comes when the officer expresses doubt over the boy's story about not being home at the time of the shootings: "You're sure?"
"Because I heard something that somebody said that somebody was calling your name and you weren't answering."
In this case, the officers made it clear that the boy's initial description of what happened wasn't the answer they were looking for, she added.
Apache County Attorney Christopher Candelaria said the tape was released because it was considered public record.
Juvenile proceedings usually take place behind closed doors.
