Goals from Spanish international midfielder Isco and French striker Karim Benzema either side of half-time were enough to secure the three points, although Depor will feel aggrieved not to have taken anything from the game.
However, the Italian will also be concerned at the often scrappy nature of his side's play and the relatively timid performance of star-man Cristiano Ronaldo who failed to score for his third La Liga game running -- the first time he has done so since 2013.
West Brom comfortably overcame West Ham 4-0, thanks to a brace from the in-form Brown Ideye and further strikes from James Morrison and Saido Berahino, while Liverpool came from behind to defeat Crystal Palace 2-1 at Selhurst Park.
Manager Laurent Blanc had used all three substitutions meaning PSG were forced to play the last 10 minutes with nine men.
Although they held on for the majority of that time the Parisians conceded goals in the 89th and then 92nd minute to Emiliano Sala and Herv√© Bazile respectively to ensure the spoils were shared.
