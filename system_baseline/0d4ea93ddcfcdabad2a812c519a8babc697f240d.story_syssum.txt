It's a bold move considering that more places are starting to limit the access of drones, including the National Park Service, which announced a temporary ban on the use of drones on Friday.
Yet, USF is taking a different approach to drones, making the technology more accessible to its students.
Dean of USF Libraries Bill Garrison says the drones could be a great resource for students working on multimedia projects, and sees the program working in conjunction with other departments at the university.
They'll also be required to provide an explanation on how the drone will be utilized in a school project, and they must be supervised by a faculty member while operating it around the campus.
"One of the things many libraries have struggled with is how do you become a real part of the campus and not be viewed as a book warehouse," he said.
