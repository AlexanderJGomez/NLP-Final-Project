Growing up in Mumbai's largest red-light district, in a makeshift room above a brothel, Katti often found it difficult to study and stay focused on her future.
It was hard to imagine a way out.
It would not have been possible without the help of Kranti, a charity that is empowering girls from Mumbai's red-light districts.
"My mom is my inspiration, and she's the one who encouraged me and who said, 'You're going to do better, you are amazing,' " Katti said.
"From the time my daughter was born, I wanted her to read and write," she said.
Katti said she now wants to study psychology so she can help other women back home.
"This is not like a supernatural thing in me, but I got the opportunity, I got this chance."
