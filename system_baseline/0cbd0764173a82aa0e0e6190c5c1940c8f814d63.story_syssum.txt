In the east German city of Dresden, artist Yadegar Asisi has designed a panoramic scene of epic proportions, breathing life into a long-forgotten view of the Italian capital.
Asisi chose as his subject a historical moment, the influence of which is still felt in Europe and around the world today: The triumphal procession of the Emperor Constantine the Great on October 29, 312.
"But this panoramic scene is not really about showing a cityscape, it is more about the stories hidden within the city," Asisi said.
Asisi has created a second historic panorama showing the ancient Greek city of Pergamon (today located in Turkey), which is currently on show at Scholl's Pergamonmuseum, on the Museum Island in Berlin.
I love to design on the computer as well as painting in the traditional way", Asisi said.
His passion for details has taken him to Rome countless times -- and visitors' reactions suggest all that study has been worth the effort.
"To me it is extremely interesting why so many people in the former GDR did accept to live in such a country," he said.
In 2003, Asisi drew a panorama for Daniel Libeskind which showed the architect's plans for the Ground Zero site in New York.
Yadegar Asisi's Rome 312: Experience the Ancient Metropolis is on display in Dresden until September 2, 2012.
