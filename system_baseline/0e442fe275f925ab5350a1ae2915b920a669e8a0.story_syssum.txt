Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- The Japanese government stepped in Monday to weaken the yen, after it climbed to a post-World War II high against the dollar.
The government is worried that a strengthened yen will impact its economy, which relies heavily on exports.
The stock market, however, lost the upward momentum after an initial 100-point gain as some analysts expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of the intervention.
It all depends how far the government is ready to intervene.
