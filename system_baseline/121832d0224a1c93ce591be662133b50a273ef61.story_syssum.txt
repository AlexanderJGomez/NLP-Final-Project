I could see right away that part of his mission was giving these young men a chance to have some fun.
We looked like a small parade as we rolled into the stadium with five wheelchairs and a large entourage.
These young men's lives had been changed on the gridiron; would they feel strange about going back onto a football field?
When we finished getting our shots, Canales and his group made their way to a front-row handicap-accessible section.
Eddie fell into conversations with coaches and trainers who recognized him and wanted to talk about his work, while Chris and the other Gridiron Heroes watched and analyzed each play.
Though they were now on the sidelines, it was clear that their life-changing injuries hadn't dimmed their love of the game.
The respect that the players and coaches had for Eddie and Chris was clear.
Being at that game that day made me remember why I liked football, although watching it alongside Canales and his Gridiron Heroes was a powerful reminder of the game's risks.
