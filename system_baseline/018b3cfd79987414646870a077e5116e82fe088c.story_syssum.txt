Adonis, born Ali Ahmad Said Esbar, grew up in a poor village near the Syrian city of Latakia and received no formal education until he was granted a scholarship to a French lycee by the then president of Syria at the age of 13.
He spoke to CNN through an interpreter at an exhibition of his collages and a series of literary events called "A Tribute to Adonis" at the Mosaic Rooms in London until March 30.
The Western world should not use this as a pretext to fulfill its own goals in the region.
A: Their main fear is for the violence and for the potential for the situation to develop into civil war.
CNN: You received no formal education until you recited one of your own poems to the then Syrian president in 1943.
A: It was almost 70 years ago after Syria became independent and the president was touring the country.
I can always say that poetry allowed me to be reborn.
Poetry has never had any influence throughout history, however poetry creates a new aesthetic, a new beauty, a new type of relations between things and people, and this is not insignificant.
A: I don't only feel in exile because of these two departures.
A: What's strange is I feel it is I who has changed, not the country.
There's a lot of attention and a lot of sensitive appreciation.
