The Ready for Hillary National Finance Council meeting -- which is being held at the Sheraton Times Square in New York City -- is part rally, part history lesson for the Clinton supporters and will bring together top flight Democratic strategists, longtime Clinton supporters and at least three people rumored to be the former secretary of state's next campaign manager.
The organization has worked somewhat like a ground and grassroots operations for Clinton, dispatching volunteers to different events and sending a campaign bus to drive across the country and rally support.
"That is the point at which we would wind down because we are not going to have a separate and competing field and grass roots infrastructure across the country," said one source with knowledge of Ready for Hillary's plans.
Priorities USA, the super PAC tasked with big money fundraising and ad buying, is in a place to step up the moment that Clinton declares her run.
Correct the Record, a communications and research outfit that has been operating for over a year, is another pro-Clinton super PAC gearing up to run side-by-side with a Clinton campaign.
Brock, according to the source, will tell attendees that he has decided his group will continue through the 2016 election and will use their rapid response and research to push the message of the eventual Clinton campaign.
