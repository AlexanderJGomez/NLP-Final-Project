(CNN) -- Peru's president arrived Tuesday night at a mine in southern Peru, where he was expected to lead an operation to reach nine trapped miners.
Earlier Tuesday, one of the mining engineers in charge of the rescue declined to give a specific time frame for the operation.
We're taking into account all the necessary security measures to avoid risks among the rescuers themselves," said Cesar Chonate, a regional head of Peru's civil defense agency, the state-run Andina news agency reported.
The miners have been getting oxygen, food and water through a tube, which has also allowed them to stay in contact with people above ground, Andina reported.
All those miners were rescued, pulled one by one from hundreds of meters beneath the Earth's surface with a specially designed capsule.
