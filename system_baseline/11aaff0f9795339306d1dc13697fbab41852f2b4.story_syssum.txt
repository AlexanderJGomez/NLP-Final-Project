Constitutionally, women were able to secure the ability to pass their citizenship on to their children by non-Iraqi husbands, making Iraq one of a handful Arab countries with such a provision for their female citizens.
That law, the Family Statutes Law, has been replaced one giving religious and tribal leaders the power to regulate family affairs in the areas they rule in accordance with their interpretation of religious laws.
And while both women and men suffered as a result, the impact on women was greater due to their limited mobility in the face of poor security.
It would be unfair to blame the regression Iraqi women have faced only on the last 10 years, as the previous decade of economic sanctions that preceded it also took its toll on Iraqi society.
Ten years later, Iraqi women find themselves the subjects of a story that does not have a happy ending.
They deserve everyone's support, for the story of women's rights is the story of Iraq's future.
