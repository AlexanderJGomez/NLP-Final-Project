Boasting increasing amounts of disposable income, India's emergent middle class is viewed by the global automobile industry as a prize -- something reflected in the international interest in New Delhi.
As the event opens, some eyes are focused on the sports utility market, with Chevrolet's Adra SUV concept and Volkswagen's Taigun, a mini SUV, rumored to be launched at Auto Expo 2014.
With these new models, Tata, the Mumbai-based manufacturer, has undergone some radical overhauls of its design and technology processes -- including the inclusion of the company's Revotron engine -- in a bid to recapture lost market share.
"Based on market requirement, we will recalibrate our production between domestic and export market," Rakesh Srivastava, Hyundai Motor India's vice-president of marketing and sales, said in an interview with the country's Economic Times.
And while the automobile market might be in danger of stalling, India's sheer numbers mean that there are still thousands of new cars being introduced to India's already-congested roads every day.
The line, which opened at the beginning of February, traverses the western Indian city and will offer respite to some commuters  but much of the remainder of the country's public transportation network is antiquated and overburdened, meaning that cars are increasingly the choice of the growing middle class.
