The son of Jewish immigrants from Hungary, Klein founded his firm Allen Klein & Co. in the late 1950s before the label evolved into ABKCO Music & Records in New York.
He changed the music industry when he represented Sam Cooke in negotiations with RCA, winning the artist control of his own master recordings.
Late in his career, Klein agreed to license a sample of a Rolling Stones song to the British group the Verve for their hit single "Bittersweet Symphony."
Services will be held in New York on Tuesday.
