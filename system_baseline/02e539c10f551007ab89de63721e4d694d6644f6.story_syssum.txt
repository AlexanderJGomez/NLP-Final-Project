We're trying to locate this person," a National Police spokesman in Madrid told CNN on Thursday.
The train was sent to a maintenance yard, following protocol, and a worker who inspected the doors found a brown leather wallet that contained the $2 million check, the California driver's license and some credit cards, a Metro de Madrid spokeswoman said.
Madrid's Metro handles an average of 2 million passengers a day, but this is believed to be the first time that one of them was carrying a $2 million check, the police spokesman said.
Police have contacted the U.S. Embassy in Madrid for help in finding the check's owner, but the embassy had no immediate comment.
