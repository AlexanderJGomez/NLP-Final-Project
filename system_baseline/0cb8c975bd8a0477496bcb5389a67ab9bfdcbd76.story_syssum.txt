It's a scary statement -- one that's received a lot of attention in recent years, although some say the concern is unwarranted.
The move comes two years after an episode of "The Dr. Oz Show" raised public concern about the amount of arsenic in children's apple juice.
"This chemical element is found in the Earth's crust," Michael Taylor, the FDA's deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine, wrote on the government agency's blog.
The analysis showed that 95% of the samples tested were below 10 parts per billion for both organic and inorganic arsenic; 100% of the samples were below 10 parts per billion for inorganic arsenic.
Long-term exposure to arsenic, which is odorless and tasteless, has been linked to cancer of the bladder, skin, kidney, nasal passages, liver and prostate, according to the EPA.
The association also notes in the statement that holding apple juice to the same arsenic guidelines as drinking water isn't appropriate because people consume more water on a regular basis.
The FDA has to accept public comments on their proposal for 60 days before these recommendations can be implemented.
