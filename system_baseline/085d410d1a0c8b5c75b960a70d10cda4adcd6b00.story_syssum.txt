The United States will deploy additional ground-based missile interceptors on the West Coast as part of efforts to enhance the nation's ability to defend itself from attack by North Korea, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced Friday.
"The reason that we are doing what we are doing and the reason we are advancing our program here for homeland security is to not take any chances, is to stay ahead of the threat and to assure any contingency," Hagel said.
North Korea on Saturday responded to the U.S. announcement by criticizing what it described as the Americans' "hostile policy" and saying it won't negotiate with them over its nuclear program.
The United States and other Western nations called the launch a test of ballistic missile technology, and the U.N. Security Council tightened sanctions on the regime in Pyongyang.
