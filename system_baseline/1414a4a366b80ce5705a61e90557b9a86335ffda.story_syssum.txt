It's a place everyone should be concerned about in a time of climate change," says Patrick Bergin, the organization's CEO.
In exchange, the organization not only helps to shape young minds to further the cause, but gets written agreement from the local community to set aside a patch of land for conservation purposes -- a stretch that will be free form hunting, logging and unplanned agriculture.
Bergin notes that when it comes to education in Africa, resources go first to schools in the city, then to those in the surrounding towns.
Construction has already begun on the first school in Ilima, an extremely isolated village in the Democratic Republic of Congo that sits on the corridor between two protected areas.
"If there's a need to repair or maintain the school 45 years down the road, the community has to be able to do it without depending on materials like steel or cement, which would be hard to locate," says Andrew Brose, the project manager.
Brose's team tested different soils and palm oils in the region to find which combination of ingredients would yield the most durable bricks.
Like Bergin, Murphy views the schools project as a means to really impact the continent.
For starters, Mass Design has trained local craftsmen in its techniques as a way of passing on the baton.
