Don't get me wrong: the English, the Scots, the Welsh and the Northern Irish are all very different people.
And while the English are known for introversion and a terror of being noticed, the heat generated by the independence referendum has been a testament to the Scots' uncompromising desire to say what they're really thinking.
For 300 years, we have sustained a political alliance between nations with distinct cultures that has produced one of the world's most successful experiments in getting along against the odds.
And, as such, Scotland's presence in the Union has been sustained hitherto largely by good will.
A turning point was the election of Margaret Thatcher in 1979 -- a right-wing leader who may have helped raise living standards in Scotland but whose faith in free markets became increasingly at odds with the Scottish preference for a well-financed public sector.
Such is the likely size of an independent Scotland's debt, and so uncertain is the future of its currency, that it would almost certainly have to raise taxes through the roof.
Our accomplishments in the fields of constructing a welfare state or investing in high-tech sectors have been made possible by sharing resources and talent.
Soldiers have fought in defense of their constituent countries, but always under the banner of the United Kingdom.
It might seem silly to reduce a decision about the future of a nation to a few lines of a song sung drunkenly and off-key at midnight, but friendship is a precious thing that men will give their lives for.
It's nonsense, of course, but a reminder -- again -- of how much mystery and wonder the Scottish countryside brings to the UK.
If I'm honest, the prospect of a Union dominated too heavily by the English worries me.
We're simply not as loquacious or romantic as our Scottish cousins.
