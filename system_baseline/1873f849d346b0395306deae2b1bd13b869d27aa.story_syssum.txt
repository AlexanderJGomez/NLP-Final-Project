Warner Bros. Pictures announced Saturday at Comic-Con that Superman will pair with his fellow Justice League hero Batman in the upcoming yet-to-be-named film, expected to begin production in 2014.
"It's beyond mythological to have Superman and our new Batman facing off, since they are the greatest superheroes in the world," he said.
CNN partner Entertainment Weekly reported that "Man of Steel" actor Harry Lennix took the stage with Snyder and read a line from Frank Miller's 1986 book, "The Dark Knight Returns," in which Batman wages battle with the man from Krypton.
"Dark Knight" director Christopher Nolan also said he wasn't opting for a fourth movie in the franchise, the magazine said.
Warner Bros. and DC Comics, the publisher of "Superman" titles, are both units of Time Warner, CNN's parent company.
