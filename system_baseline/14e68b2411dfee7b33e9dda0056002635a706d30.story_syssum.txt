The former high school pitcher earned $250,000 as winner of the "MLB 2K13" Perfect Game Challenge, a nationwide contest pitting virtual hurlers against each other in the popular baseball video game.
The four finalists all threw perfect games in "MLB 2K13" during the qualifying month, but Chavarria and the other three were the most perfect.
Chavarria, who was a pitcher in high school and for one year in college, said having a pitcher's mentality helped him devise a game plan against the batters.
"They've got guys who can hit home runs against lefties and righties," he said.
Holland used the Oakland A's in his attempt to win the prize, but Chavarria's Rangers were too much.
Chavarria added another home run later in the game, and his pitching kept Holland's A's off balance as he won 3-1.
I had plenty of times where I thought this was stupid and I ... (was) never going to get it," he said.
