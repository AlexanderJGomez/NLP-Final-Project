The leading candidate, interim President Bronislaw Komorowski, failed to garner more than 50 percent of the vote, which would have clinched victory in the first round of voting to replace President Lech Kaczynski, who was killed in a plane crash in April.
The two were among 10 candidates in the election originally planned for the autumn but brought forward after Kaczynski died.
The tragic death of the president and recent fatal floods in southern Poland -- which left at least 20 people dead and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage -- have meant a tame presidential campaign.
The president, his wife and more than 90 others were killed in western Russia on their way to the 70th anniversary of the Russian massacre of Polish prisoners of war in the village of Katyn.
