Violent crime in the United States fell for the fifth consecutive year in 2011 with murder, rape and robbery all going down, although crime remains a serious problem in many urban areas, the FBI said on Monday.
Despite the positive trend, crime remains a serious problem in many urban pockets riddled with gangs, drugs, and poverty.
James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University, said crime has continued to decline from a peak in the 1990s but now is decreasing at a slower rate.
That report actually showed crime increasing last year, but attributed the change to a jump in simple assaults.
He also noted the increase that the Justice Department reported was from an all-time low in the crime rate the previous year, suggesting crime is entering a low level where police officials hope it will stay for some time.
