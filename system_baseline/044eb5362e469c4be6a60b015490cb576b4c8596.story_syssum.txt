Santiago de Compostela, Spain (CNN) -- The driver of the train that derailed in northwestern Spain was charged Sunday with 79 counts of homicide by professional recklessness and an undetermined number of counts of causing injury by professional recklessness.
Questions have focused on the speed at which the train was traveling as it entered a curve in the track near Santiago de Compostela on Wednesday evening.
Maria Pardo Rios, a spokeswoman for the Galicia regional supreme court, told CNN late Friday that 75 victims had been identified.
Fariza and her husband were on their way to celebrate a Catholic festival.
The death toll rose to at least 79 on Sunday morning when another person died, a representative for the regional health department said.
About 70 people who were injured in the crash remained in the hospital Sunday, about 22 of them listed in serious condition, the official said.
The express passenger service was nearing the end of a six-hour trip from Madrid to the town of Ferrol in northwest Spain when the crash occurred, the state railway said.
She and husband Suso tried to help the injured, taking bed sheets to wrap around the injured and ropes to haul the survivors off the tracks.
He and fellow firefighters smashed windows and kicked in doors to pull out the passengers trapped inside as rail cars went up in flames.
Ward, 18, blacked out when his car slammed on to its side, regaining consciousness only as he was being helped out of the train.
"But we didn't know what was the maximum speed, so I thought it was normal," he said, "And suddenly there was a curve, the suitcases fell, and everything went dark.
Planned festivities in Santiago de Compostela and across Galicia were canceled after the crash.
