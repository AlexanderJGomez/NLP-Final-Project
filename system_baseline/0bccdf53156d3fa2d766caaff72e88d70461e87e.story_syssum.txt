In fact, smartwatches have a long history of failure, especially in recent years as the modern smartphone market began its explosive growth.
Too many companies tried too hard to make the dream of a Dick Tracy-style watch happen before we were ready for it.

In three short years, tablets have started eating into traditional PC sales as people prefer to buy a device that can do most of the things their laptop can at a fraction of the price.
