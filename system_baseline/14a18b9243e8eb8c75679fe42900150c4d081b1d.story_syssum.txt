Washington (CNN)Neera Tanden, one of Hillary Clinton's longtime confidants and former policy adviser, dropped whatever coyness was left regarding the former secretary of state's all-but-certain presidential run at an event on Tuesday night.
Tanden closed the speech with a call to action for the crowd by referencing Clinton's failed 2008 campaign.
When Clinton ran for Senate in 2000, Tanden was her deputy campaign manager and issues director and went on to serve as legislative director in Clinton's Senate office.
In the past two months, the former first lady has hired a number of top staffers and been meeting with advisers to chat out a strategic course for a presidential run.
Politico, on the other hand, reported that Tanden was "likely to play an informal role if she [Clinton] runs."
