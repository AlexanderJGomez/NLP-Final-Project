The threats on David Haines' life are intolerable," the aid group said in a statement.
ISIS, one of the major belligerents in Syria's civil war pitting rebel groups against the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has taken large swaths of northern and eastern Syria and northern and western Iraq for what it says is its new Islamic caliphate.
UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond provided scant details of the rescue attempt or any other plans in the works.
"But I can assure you that we will look at every possible option to protect this person."
