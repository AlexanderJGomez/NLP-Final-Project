Policy-makers in the UK have stepped in to protect bat populations, criminalizing any interference with their roosts, even if no bats are currently present.
"This gives them a basic introduction to their life cycle, when they breed, and their requirements for roosting."
Bats prefer to roost in natural features like trees and caves, but as development has made those environments scarcer, some species have adapted to urban areas.
Some species prefer tight spaces like cavities under roof piles, others need more space, like that found in attics.
"It's very preliminary, but there seems to be evidence that when you put solar panels on your roof, it can increase the internal roof void temperature, which can be disturbing to bats," says Gunnell.
Once the barn was finished, the sleeping bats were put into a soft bag by an ecology consultant, and delivered to awaken in their new home.
Although the Suffolk bats appear to have taken up residence, Gunnell says there's never any guarantee that such solutions will work.
Sometimes you can do everything absolutely right, and it still won't be used."
