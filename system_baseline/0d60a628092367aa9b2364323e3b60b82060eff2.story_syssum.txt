Hope you don't mind if we cruise around in our scientific SUV to grab some historic data and snap some breathtaking images.
It operates by remote control from millions of miles away and has a blazing top speed of 1.5 inches per second.
During its expected lifespan of 23 months, all this cool hardware could help solve big mysteries: Has life ever existed on Mars?
"Back when the Internet was young, it was the largest Internet event in the history of that medium," Curiosity team member James Bell told CNN on Monday.
"Later, in 2004, when the Spirit and Opportunity rovers landed, it became one of the largest worldwide Internet sensations," said Bell, who also worked on that mission.
Nowadays -- at least for some space travel fans -- Martian robots aren't so cool anymore.
After the initial excitement of Monday's landing, even the Curiosity team jokingly acknowledged the first dusty black and white photos from the rover have already lost their luster.
Seriously, no matter how successful unmanned missions might be, robots will never replace the need for human space exploration, says Bell.
Putting a monetary value on space exploration is impossible, experts say, because there are too many unanswered questions, such as whether Mars, the moon or asteroids hold precious minerals, water and cheap energy resources that could be mined and brought back to Earth.
"By going to difficult or dangerous places, we carry the rest of our species along with us.
By the way, Curiosity has fostered jobs, says NASA; more than 7,000 people have worked on the project across 31 states.
But big questions remain: How would NASA pay for development of a landing vehicle?
However, the budget also calls for more money for manned deep space programs, including almost $3 billion for Orion and the Space Launch System.
NASA is studying a proposal -- referred to as Red Dragon -- that would use a SpaceX rocket for less-expensive unmanned missions to Mars.
