What's most depressing is that when she rejoined the public stage, she said she was inspired to speak out by the story of Tyler Clementi, a student who committed suicide after a video of him kissing another boy went up online.
Lewinsky has joined Twitter, which will allow her to make uncensored remarks in the course of the 2016 campaign.
The right won't have to waste its own resources reminding people of the seedier side of the Clinton years -- Lewinsky can do that now.
Does Hillary Clinton not have a right to put this scandal behind her and have a political identity separate from her husband's?
But what she did all those years ago and what she's doing now makes her a perfect candidate for a good, old-fashioned shaming.
