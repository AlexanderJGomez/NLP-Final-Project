TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- When Japanese police arrested three sumo wrestlers and their stable master on Thursday over allegations they beat a 17-year-old wrestler to death, the case sent shockwaves across a country that links its national identity to the sport.
"He said he'd be a good boy, I just need to come get him (from the stable)," his father told reporters last summer, through choked tears.
Police say on June 25, Yamamoto instructed the wrestlers to beat the boy using sticks and a metal bat.
In a separate autopsy, specialists at Nagoya University confirmed earlier this month that shock caused by multiple external injuries contributed to Saito's death.
"There will be some change in the short-term, but in the long-run, nothing will change," says sumo analyst and Japan Times sumo columnist Mark Buckton.
