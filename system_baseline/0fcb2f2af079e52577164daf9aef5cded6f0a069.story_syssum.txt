If Hubble encounters a problem or a glitch, as happens occasionally, science operations will be suspended and the spacecraft will be locked into safe mode until government employees can issue spacecraft commands to restore operations.
The approximate cost of one hour of Hubble observing is somewhere between $8,000 and $25,000, depending on whether one adds the costs of operating and refurbishing the facility to its initial construction costs.
That means each week the government is shut down could cost dozens to hundreds of critical astronomical observations.
This has to be done at extremely cold temperatures, mimicking conditions in space, and the amount of time to cool the system down is one of the drivers of schedule and therefore cost.
To check on the number of satellites that might be affected by the shutdown, this author tried to access a NASA website, only to see the following message: "Due to the lapse in federal government funding, this website is not available.
Their flagship mission, the Mars Science Laboratory and its Curiosity Rover, is apparently still active, operated by team members who work for JPL or Caltech or other participating institutions other than the federal government.
They can't take their laptops home or phone into teleconferences from home, the way I might if a hurricane or snowstorm threatened Yale.
So it means they'll work longer hours to catch up and for most civil servant scientists, there is no such thing as overtime pay.
You are welcome to continue to e-mail me, but I might not be able to respond until the federal government opens for business."
