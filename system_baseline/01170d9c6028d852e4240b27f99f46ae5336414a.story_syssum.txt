Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Perhaps no one better understands what the family of U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords is going through like the widow and children of Punjab Governor Salmaan Taseer.
Taseer had been an outspoken critic of Pakistan's blasphemy laws, which make it a crime to insult Islam or the Prophet Mohammad.
Qadri confessed in court Monday that he killed Taseer because of his support to change the blasphemy laws.
I'm sure in Arizona the general public is not feeling threatened, or not fearing that they can voice their views or openly condemn it.
But in Pakistan, even Taseer's supporters have been mostly silent: perhaps calling his loss a tragedy, but stopping short of criticizing the man who killed him.
"There's also been a warning issued [by clerics] against anyone who has any further vigils, and anyone who takes up the case of the governor and his family, their offices will be burned and their person killed."
He has been cheered, and showered with rose petals on his way into court.
"There were over 200 lawyers who went and put garlands and rose petals around my father's assassin's neck.
Shehrbano has little to no faith that the Anti-Terrorism Court where Mumtaz Qadri is being tried will produce a fair result.
Now his family is looking back at the life of Salmaan Taseer, a businessman and governor of one of the most-populated provinces in the world.
The family says privately, they've received thousands of messages, letters and visits to console them.
His daughter Shehrbano says, "I hope his passing doesn't mean that the room for debate is over.
And daughter Sara says, "He had a liberal and progressive and secular vision.
This country needed people like him.
