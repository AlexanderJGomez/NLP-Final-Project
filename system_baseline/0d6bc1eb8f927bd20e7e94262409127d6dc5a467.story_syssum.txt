She is thinking about the wildfire that reduced her house near Colorado Springs to ashes this week and about the water that Hurricane Katrina pushed into her childhood home eight years ago.
With the flood, her family was able to salvage many items, even if they were waterlogged.
Dawson got to her house in time to see the plumes of smoke and to receive the reverse-911 call to evacuate.
They started grabbing clothes from the closets, not really paying attention to whether the items would actually be helpful.
But, she has heard, the two victims who perished had waited too long to evacuate, possibly trying to save those memorable items.
There were six inches of sludge on the floor, and the family entered with boots and gloves, looking at what survived.
The doll still holds water that seeped in during the time it was submerged.
She will rebuild.
