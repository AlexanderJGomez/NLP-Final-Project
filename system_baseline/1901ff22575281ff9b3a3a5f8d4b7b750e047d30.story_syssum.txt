Unfortunately, the way Duncan framed his comments -- and the backlash they've created -- are just more distractions in what should be a serious conversation about the very real education problems we face, and about the role the Common Core might play in increasing rigor and improving opportunities for American students.
I can't presume to know exactly what Duncan meant, but I suspect he was hinting at the notion that pushback from parents to reform driven by standards and accountability was fairly muted when those policies shined a spotlight on achievement gaps and the relative low achievement of our nation's most disadvantaged students.
Focusing on his gaffe distracts us from the very real and important conversation we should be having about the educational challenges we face in an increasingly competitive world, where school quality matters more than ever.
And even within courses, expectations can and do vary so that some students are being fed a watered-down curriculum while others are being exposed to rigorous content.
Although these challenges are most obvious in schools and districts that serve our nation's most disadvantaged youth, Common Core implementation in at least a few states has shown, perhaps uncomfortably, that may well be reaching beyond our urban centers.
