His speech is interrupted by a boyish young man, a villager, who pulls out his smartphone and plays a YouTube video for all to see: it's the same politician, making the same promises at the last election, years ago.
In most Western countries, people have discovered the Internet and grown with it in stages: from painfully slow dial-up connections, to broadband, to Wi-Fi, to 4G mobile Internet.
The offshoot is the opposite of what happens in the West: Hundreds of millions of Indians have never used a PC—and likely never will—but they can now begin to access the Internet on their phones.
Even with the recent boom, rural subscriptions are still growing at more than twice the rate of urban ones.
There's new rural money, and a yearning to be stakeholders in their futures and to fight for more accountable government.
Growing up in an India of fast growth and development, they have more confidence in their culture, identity and language.
They know about the skeletons in every politician's closet—and that information is power.
Facebook says Narendra Modi, the front-runner to be India's next prime minister, is the second most "liked" politician in the world (13 million likes), after U.S. President Barack Obama (40 million likes).
One reason for this -- apart from limits to Internet access -- could be that Twitter and Facebook remain English language services, relatable to a small subset of Indians.
Despite India's growth and increased connectivity, which suggests a more unified nation, the country may actually be becoming more regional-focused, with more pride in local languages, trends and politicians.
It remains unclear whether Indians will vote for their regional interests, or cast their ballot thinking about a macro national picture.
Calling these elections too early could be embarrassing, too.
