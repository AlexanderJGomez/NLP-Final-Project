His work on the film, about a Wall Street firm facing collapse after an employee (Zachary Quinto) finds out its holdings are going to be worthless, has garnered him an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay.
He spoke to CNN about how the film came together, the challenges of building tension and his promising future.
Chandor: The interesting thing is that Jeremy Irons' character is right, certainly following all norms of common understanding of business ethics.
Hopefully, as the information travels up the chain of command, you see (the characters) in their own way regretting, or glossing over and moving on, or all the different emotions that happen when you see your own role in a tremendously damaging event.
Chandor: I never was a very prominent commercial director, to say the least.
Amazingly, this has been sort of the cherry on the sundae.
The film was very well received for what it was, which has allowed me to direct again, and everybody made their money back, so I've been pretty blessed from that standpoint.
