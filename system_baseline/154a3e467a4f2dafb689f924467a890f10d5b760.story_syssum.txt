Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse also has been charged with conspiracy to seize a ship by force, conspiracy to commit hostage-taking and two firearm charges, according to a criminal complaint released by the U.S. attorney's office in the southern district of New York.
Before Peck closed the courtroom, Muse wiped his hand over his face at one point, and it appeared he was crying.
Peck read the young man his rights and said attorneys had been appointed to represent him because the suspect did not have the resources to hire representation himself.
After a "brief time," the lights disappeared, the complaint said, but about two hours later, the same crew members saw a small boat approaching and later heard "what sounded like" gunshots, the complaint said.
The complaint said Muse, who was carrying a gun, was the first alleged pirate on the ship, and said the attackers used a portable ladder to climb on board.
After several hours, the remaining pirates said they would leave the ship if Muse was returned to them, and if a lifeboat was given to them.
"In those communications, the pirates threatened to kill the captain if they were not provided with safe passage away from the scene," the complaint said.
While Muse was away from the lifeboat, Navy SEALs shot and killed the three remaining pirates.
