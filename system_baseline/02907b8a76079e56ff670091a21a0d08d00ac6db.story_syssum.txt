(CNN) -- After he announced the resignations of four top officials in his administration in 1973, Richard Nixon swore he was done with talking about Watergate, according to the last batch of tapes released by the National Archives.
Nixon would be forced to deal with Watergate over and over again in the next year or so, culminating with his own resignation in August 1974 -- a development forced by the discovery of conversations like those released Wednesday by the National Archives.
"We're still behind you out here, and I wanted you to know that you're in our prayers," said Reagan, then governor of California and a rising conservative star.
The Watergate scandal began to unravel with the June 1972 break-in at the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee.
Other tapes out Wednesday include Nixon discussing China with National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger and meeting with evangelist Billy Graham, the widow of baseball star Roberto Clemente and the Brazilian soccer legend Pele, who spoke of wanting to spread his sport to the United States.
"There are some people who keep throwing in this idea of there being two superpowers in the world who are out to dictate their, as they say, dictate their will, to foist their will upon others, and so forth," Brezhnev said.
And Nixon talks of winding down the war in Vietnam and the return of American prisoners of war, justifying the December 1972 bombing raids on Hanoi that he credited with their release.
One of the major reasons we had to bomb.
