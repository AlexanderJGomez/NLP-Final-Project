(CNN) -- The Food and Drug Administration on Friday promised a safer U.S. food supply when it implements two new rules regulating food imported to the United States.
With 15% of the U.S. food supply coming from overseas, including 20% of fresh vegetables and 50% of fresh fruit, Hamburg said these regulations are long overdue.
"These regulations represent a shift toward prevention and for industry being responsible for documenting what they have done to prevent problems from occurring," said Michael Taylor, the FDA deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine.
"Once finalized, the rules would ensure that foreign foods are held to the same high safety standards as American products," the Pew Research Group wrote in a statement.
Supplier verification means that companies should know who they are buying from -- not just their name and address but their food safety practices."
