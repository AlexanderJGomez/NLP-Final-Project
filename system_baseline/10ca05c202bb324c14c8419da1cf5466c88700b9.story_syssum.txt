Several years later, they turned that idea into a way to help children around the world and founded the nonprofit 100cameras.
Then they set those children free to capture their world and post the photos online.
It's about "addressing poverty from the inside out, instead of the outside in," says Bullock, who is now the company's Public Relations Director.
The photographs were so powerful, they decided to turn their New York apartment into an art gallery, moving furniture into bedrooms, and invited anyone they knew.
What was once a side project for a group of friends now has almost 20 members and recently hired its first full-time employee.
In New York it was educational needs, after-school learning and computers.
Bullock says, "It's really exciting for kids there to see these changes and to feel an ownership in that."
"We want as many kids as possible empowered with the idea and concept that their perspective matters.
