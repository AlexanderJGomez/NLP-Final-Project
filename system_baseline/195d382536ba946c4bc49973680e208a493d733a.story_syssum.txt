But it was a very different story in 1978 when Mazumdar-Shaw started Biocon at the age of 25 with the equivalent of less than $200 in today's money.
"I was a 25-year-old woman with no business experience, I was trying to pioneer a sector called biotechnology which nobody had heard of.
Having built up a leading company from scratch, many would expect Mazumdar-Shaw to have her mind fixed solely on the business.
In 2009, she founded a low-cost cancer hospital with the aim of making usually expensive cancer treatment accessible to more people.
"One of my objectives when I started Biocon was to make sure that I create a company for women scientists to pursue a vocation," said Mazumdar-Shaw.
"I want to be remembered as someone who put India on the scientific map of the world in terms of large innovation.
And I want to be remembered as someone who did make a difference to social economic development in India."
