From the androgynous swagger of David Bowie (his hit "Heroes" introduced Team GB to the stadium), to the drugged-out funk of the Happy Mondays; the rolling grooves of Soul II Soul's "Back to Life" to the punky-punch of The Prodigy's "Firestarter"; the petulance of the Stones' "Satisfaction" to the raw, rebellious sound of the Sex Pistols; and form the staccato rap of Dizzee Rascal (born a stone's-throw from the Olympic Park) to euphoria of Underworld's bespoke-written tracks a montage of era-defining tunes were melded together to provide a snapshot of distinctly British sounds.
Put simply, it rocked: a spell-binding moment that touched the soul in the way the splendor of the Beijing opener failed to with such force.
Jamie Fullerton - features editor for the NME (New Musical Express), Britain's pre-eminent weekly music magazine, told CNN: "What's really interesting is the set included bands like New Order and Happy Mondays, organizers tipping their hat towards the cult element of British rock 'n' roll music, which is very different to what you see at an event like the Superbowl.
"The Olympics is a cultural event and the Games is about hammering home the sense of location as much as anything, it's natural for music to be a big part of that especially because it's so integral to our identity in Britain.
Their template is the one that was followed through the generations, and I think if you ask any visitor to Britain to name a few of the favorite things about this country, I'm sure the Beatles would still be one of them."
Geoff Taylor, the chief executive of BPI -- a body that represents independent and major record labels in the UK -- told CNN in a statement: "I think British people are more obsessed by music than any other people in the world, they buy more CD albums per capita than any other nation, it's fundamental to our life.
Their invasion of the States really raised the profile of the quality that is produced here in the UK.
Ultimately, the success of the opening ceremony to the London 2012 Olympics can probably only be judged properly with the perspective of hindsight and when measured against the others that have gone before it.
Now, back to the "Nanana nahs."
