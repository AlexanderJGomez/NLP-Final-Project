It's a laborious process, but it's necessary to ensure the best questions make the cut for the CNN/YouTube debate between Republican presidential hopefuls in St. Petersburg, Florida, which will take place Wednesday at 8 p.m.
"You watch hundreds of these questions and you really get a sense of what's on people's minds."
That debate christened YouTube as a venue for prodding politicians and a way to get the public involved.
"This debate is to let  Republican voters pick from among their eight candidates," said David Bohrman, Washington bureau chief and senior vice president for CNN.
Each of the eight GOP hopefuls will answer to real people displayed on a 25-foot screen (or their animated creations, as witnessed in the Democratic debate).
Unless someone happened to be in an Iowa farmhouse or a New Hampshire coffee shop, having an impact on the nominating process was "impenetrable" to outsiders Bohrman said, referring to the first two states to hold caucuses or a primary.
CNN's political unit is keeping the questions a secret, but those selecting them say viewers should be prepared for presentations that are funny, questions that are poignant and a format that is unprecedented for the GOP.
"There are plenty of animated figures out there, there are certainly some funny questions, but more importantly, there are hundreds, if not thousands of really, really good, solid questions from real people on real issues."
