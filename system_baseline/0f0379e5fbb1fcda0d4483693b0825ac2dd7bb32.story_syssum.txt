Andres Iniesta made it 2-0 a minute later after woeful defending by Almeria, with his misplaced cross fortuitously rebounding back into his path, then Peru defender Wilmer Acasiete turned Maxwell's low cross into his own net on 27.
The beleaguered Alves could only parry Villa's shot into Messi's pass for the seventh, and Bojan made no mistake when sent free down the middle to seal the biggest win of the Spanish season so far and leave Almeria in the bottom three.
With the Portuguese boss watching from various positions in the stands, Real almost went behind in just the second minute when defender Pepe had to clear off the line from Fernando Llorente.
The Portugal forward then netted his 15th league goal this season -- and 17th overall -- from the penalty spot in time added on after substitute Esteban Granero was brought down, despite having to retake the kick after illegally stopping in his initial run-up.
Valencia lost Lithuania defender Marius Stankevicius to a second yellow card with 10 minutes to go, but held on for the draw ahead of Wednesday's Champions League clash with Turkish side Bursaspor.
