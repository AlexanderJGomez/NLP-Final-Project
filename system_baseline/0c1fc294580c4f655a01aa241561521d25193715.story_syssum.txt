It is expensive, requires the buy-in of multiple entities that serve the community and doesn't always solve the problem.
As of 2012, about 39% of the customers in the United States reported having underground electricity service.
For its part, the regulator cannot directly fix the power lines but still must ensure that any money the utility spends provides value for consumers.
In the wake of a statewide ice storm in December 2002, the North Carolina Utilities Commission and the electric utilities explored the feasibility of burying the state's distribution lines underground and concluded that the project would take 25 years and increase electricity rates by 125%.
Burying the lines raises another potential problem: reduced accessibility of the lines, making it more difficult to repair the system.
It may mitigate damage from wind events such as flying debris, falling trees and collected ice and snow, but so can trimming trees, replacing wood poles with steel, concrete or composite ones, or reinforcing poles with guy wires.
In short, whether a community should go underground with its power lines is a question to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the utility, its regulator and the government.
