The news came only hours after her husband, Pyotr Verzilov, told CNN that his wife had gone back on a hunger strike to protest being returned to Penal Colony No.
Tolokonnikova, 23, was sent to Mordovia last year for her part in a performance of a "punk prayer" critical of Vladimir Putin -- then the Prime Minister, now the President -- at a Russian Orthodox cathedral.
In a lengthy letter last month to the news site Lenta (a translated version was published in London's The Guardian), Tolokonnikova described "slave labor" and unsanitary conditions in which women work through sickness and injury up to 17 hours a day and are beaten -- or worse -- for failing to complete their duties.
Maria Alyokhina, another convicted member of Pussy Riot, went on a hunger strike earlier this year, protesting conditions in a different remote prison camp.
