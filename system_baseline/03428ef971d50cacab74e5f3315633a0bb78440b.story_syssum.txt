Washington (CNN) -- The Secret Service has yanked the security clearances of 11 members accused of bringing prostitutes to a hotel in Colombia ahead of last week's pan-American summit, government officials with knowledge of the investigation said Monday.
Over the weekend, King told CNN that one of the women refused to leave a hotel room Thursday morning.
At least one of the women brought to the hotel talked with police, and complaints were filed with the U.S. Embassy, the sources said.
The Americans don't seem to have broken the law in Colombia, where soliciting prostitutes is legal in some parts of the country, he said.
But the congressman -- a leading Obama administration critic -- said the conduct could have posed a security risk to the president by exposing Secret Service agents to blackmail.
Pentagon spokesman George Little could not say how many more might be involved, but he indicated the personnel might come from more than one branch of the military.
Because presidential security was the overall mission, however, it is not clear whether the Pentagon will ever publicly describe what the military personnel were doing as part of their work in Colombia or what branches of the military they belonged to.
"This incident is not reflective of the behavior of our personnel as they travel every day throughout the country and the world performing their duties in a dedicated, professional manner," Morrissey said Saturday.
