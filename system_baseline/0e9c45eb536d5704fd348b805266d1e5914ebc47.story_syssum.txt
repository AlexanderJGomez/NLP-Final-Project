The puppy Lancy looks and acts just like Lancelot, their first Lab, who died a year ago, say the Ottos.
"We just got him because we wanted to have Lancelot more than just the 11Â½ years," Nina Otto said.
They got the idea five years ago and had a sample of Lancelot's DNA extracted and banked when they heard that cloning was possible.
"I only was hoping to get the essence of Lancelot back," Nina said.
Four customers who also placed winning bids in an auction by BioArts International will have their dogs cloned, and those pets will be delivered in the coming months.
In Lancy's case, his DNA was placed inside an egg from a South Korean dog and implanted in an Irish setter in South Korea.
But, the Ottos say, he's taken a particular fondness to a bush planted at the spot where his original, Lancelot, died last year.
The Ottos can do whatever they want with their money, but "a shelter dog just lost out on a great chance of having a home," said Cherie Wachter of the Humane Society of Broward County, Florida.
"The only reason I don't go to the Humane Society is because I would bring every one of them home," Nina Otto said.
"You could have your favorite dog with you your entire life.
