"We've allowed this policy to become the 800-pound gorilla in the room and a distraction from the atrocities of the regime, the human rights abuses, and the aspirations of the Cuban people," he added.
Democrats have long-hoped to make inroads with Cuban-Americans, the only Latino group that still leans Republican, and have taken notice of the generational shift.
Rick Scott who supports the embargo faces former Republican-now-Democrat Governor Charlie Crist who during a July campaign stop in Miami's Little Havana openly called for an end to the embargo, a move that had been considered political suicide in the state.
At a debate sponsored by CNN in Florida earlier this week, Crist said he wouldn't be willing to go so far as meeting with Raul Castro, but he defended his opposition to the embargo.
Twenty nine-year-old old Chicago-based writer Hector Luis Alamo, who is of Puerto Rican and Honduran descent,  says people in his generation feel that "It's about damn time" for the embargo to end.
"For the first time in more than 50 years, shifting politics in the United States and changing policies in Cuba make it politically feasible to re-establish formal diplomatic relations and dismantle the senseless embargo", wrote the Times' editorial board.
A June poll by Florida International University found that more than half of Cuban-Americans surveyed in Miami support an end to the embargo and a solid majority of them also favor restoring diplomatic relations with Havana.
In 2011, President Barack Obama eased travel restrictions to the island for American citizens and last week, Cuba said it would be willing to cooperate with Washington to help fight the Ebola epidemic in West Africa.
But, only time will tell if a new generation of young, engaged Latino voters can exert enough political heat to completely thaw a relationship frozen during the Cold War.
