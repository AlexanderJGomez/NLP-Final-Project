After months of questions and pressure from whistle-blowers, academic reform groups, the public and members of Congress, the NCAA has decided to reopen its investigation into The University of North Carolina over its so-called paper class scandal.
Even though many athletes were enrolled in those paper classes, the NCAA had previously decided the scandal was not an athletic one, and did not sanction the university.
Now, she said, the NCAA shouldn't focus on punishment: "Instead, they should focus on how to use the UNC example to reform the entire system."
Wainstein has received 1.5 million e-mails and documents, interviewed more than 30 employees, and acquired athlete transcripts going back to the 1980s in his investigation.
UNC said it directed Wainstein to share what he finds with the NCAA, and both UNC and the NCAA said that it was the cooperation from "additional people" that prompted the NCAA investigation to be re-opened.
A spokesman for his office said it is still going through the response.
