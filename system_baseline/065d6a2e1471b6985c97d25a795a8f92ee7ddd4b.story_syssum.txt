(CNN) -- "Slingo," a leader in online games for 17 years, is making its way to Facebook with a redesigned version of the popular bingo/slot-machine game.
Friends can gift others with power-ups or even act as a Joker during gameplay, allowing for a free movement.
" 'Slingo' is one of the earliest and most cherished games of the Internet," said Rich Sawel, product manager for Zynga Slingo.
According to the report, Zynga's net loss of $435 million in the fourth quarter included a $510 million stock-based compensation expense that was previously unrecognized until triggered by an initial public offering in mid-December.
