Sauber pair Sergio Perez and Kamui Kobayashi finished a creditable seventh and eighth respectively, but they were later disqualified by race stewards for technical infringements to do with their rear wings.
The 23-year-old Vettel, who was claiming his 11th victory in just his 63rd grand prix, told the official Formula One website: "I'm very pleased, it was a very good weekend and I had a very nice car to sit in this afternoon.
Meanwhile, a stunned Petrov told the after-race press conference:  "To be honest I can't believe I'm sitting with these guys.
However, it proved a disastrous day for the Mercedes pair of Michael Schumacher and Nico Rosberg, who had both retired by the 22nd lap of the race.
