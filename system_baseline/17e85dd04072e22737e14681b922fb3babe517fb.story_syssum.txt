Police in Dublin, east of Oakland, said Hammer was in a vehicle with expired registration and he was not the registered owner.
"While I was handing him my ID he reached in my car and tried to pull me out the car but forgot he was on a steady donut diet," Hammer continued.
Hammer, who had a hit single in 1990 with "U Can't Touch This," has been enjoying a resurgence in his career and took the stage with "Gangnam Style" Korean performer Psy during the American Music Awards last November.
Hammer performed "Too Legit to Quit," which was released more than 20 years ago.
