(CNN) -- South African police are investigating abuse allegations at the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy, the talk-show host's $40 million school for disadvantaged girls near Johannesburg.
Girls at the school also claimed that the matron swore and screamed at the girls and assaulted them, the newspaper reported Saturday.
In the statement, Samuel said South African child protection services were notified and that the dorm parent was removed from the campus.
The academy opened in January with a student body made up of some of South Africa's poorest children.
