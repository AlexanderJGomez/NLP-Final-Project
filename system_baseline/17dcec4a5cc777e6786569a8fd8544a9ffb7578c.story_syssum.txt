Some Potter fans, under the leadership of Slack, have come together to bring the spirit of "Dumbledore's army" to life.
Slack, a former sketch comedian with an interest in building social movements, came up with the idea in 2005 after reading Potter books to children at a Boys and Girls Club, something he said transformed him.
Slack sees parallels between the magic in the "Potter" books and expanding one's mind to come up with solutions in a creative way.
The alliance also helped hundreds to register to vote last year, according to Slack.
The campaign takes Dumbledore's ethics and beliefs and translates them to the real world.
For the midnight screenings of "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince," members were encouraged to wear buttons mentioning lessons that Dumbledore taught them.
"It's incredible, it's humbling, and it's uplifting to see people going out there and doing that in the name of your character," she told Time magazine in 2007.
This year, 52 such "Can't Stop the Serenity" screenings are taking place around the world for charities such as the human rights organization Equality Now!, in response to a challenge by the film's director Joss Whedon.
In the books, "muggle-borns and other intelligent nonhumans are discriminated against, treated like scum and forbidden from having equal rights," she said, adding that love was the main weapon used against the forces of evil.
Like Slack, Bolton condemns the "Muggle mindset," what members call an ignorance of or refusal to act on the important issues facing the world.
Lang adds that such debates usually don't get too heated, since "we're all Harry Potter fans, we all have that in common."
"It has introduced me to new issues and new ideas."
