This complex story has evolved into a visual psalm of spiritual power that leads us to the truths of democracy that defy, but also reveal, the ultimate power that occasionally breaks into our lives and lifts us to new cultural heights.
The opening scenes of "Selma" shocked me into a spiritual realm with the sudden explosion in the midst of four beautiful, laughing little girls in Sunday school at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama.
That scene put me on an emotional roller coaster ride that reminded me that whatever success I have enjoyed was because of the sacrifice and suffering of others: from Medgar Evers, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, to Jimmie Lee Jackson, James Reeb, and Viola Liuzzo.
And with only our faith in the creator as our source of power.
"Selma" is a cinematic tribute to the democratic vision that we can live together in freedom without violence.
Because of the miracle of Selma in 1965 and today as a film in 2015, we can bear witness and embrace the powerful belief that we shall overcome.
