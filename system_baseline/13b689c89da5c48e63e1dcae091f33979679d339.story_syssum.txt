Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- The third most powerful political figure in the Yemeni government has died from wounds he received in the presidential palace attack in Sanaa last June.
Yemen lost a leader and the government holds the Ahmar family responsible for his death.
Ghani's death came as hundreds of security forces were deployed to the streets of the capital, Sanaa, amid fears that the imminent toppling of the regime in Libya could have an effect on Yemen.
Opposition parties are giving youth extra dose of courage and hope, vowing that they will not give in until Saleh meets the fate of other fallen rulers.
He said that the Yemeni people will have their goals met within days and the revolution will prosper.
