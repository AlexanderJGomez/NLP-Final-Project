The appeal deals with a 1963 book and screenplay on the life of former middleweight boxing champion Jake LaMotta, who wrote it with his childhood friend and business partner, Frank "Peter" Petrella.
That was apparently enough to temper the court's creative streak in Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's majority opinion -- no pop culture references to showbiz or sports; no clever rhetoric about this being a "knockout" legal fight; and no justice who would admit ever seeing the acclaimed film.
She claimed ownership over the original screenplay and the subsequent rights to the story.
Paula Petrella claims she is the sole owner of the book and the original screenplay, and that the subsequent film infringes on those copyrights.
"If the rule were, as MGM urges, 'sue soon, or forever hold your peace,' copyright owners would have to mount a federal case fast to stop seemingly innocuous infringements, lest those infringements eventually grow in magnitude," she said.
She will miss out on damages for periods prior to the three-year look-back, but her right to prospective injunctive relief should, in most cases, remain unaltered."
And if the current owners did not sign over all their copyrights to the industry, you end up with potentially multi-billion dollar clashes of interest."
The case is Petrella v. MGM, Inc. (12-1315).
