Debbie Rowe, Jackson's ex-wife and mother of his two oldest children, has not publicly revealed whether she will challenge Katherine Jackson, his 79-year-old mother, for custody or visitation rights.
Rowe's lawyer said this week that she was not asking the Jackson family for more money in exchange for dropping a possible custody challenge.
People, you know, don't give her credit that she was a friend of Michael's for over 30 years."
That is when I looked at him and said.
A daughter, Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson, was born the next year.
Rowe gave up parental rights to Jackson in 2001, but she changed her mind more than two years later and sought temporary custody of the children.
Rowe claimed in the 2003 interview that she still had "some influence" over how Jackson raised the children, citing his practice of covering their faces in public as her idea.
"If one of her horses is sick, Debbie will stay up all night long caring for them.
"Debbie doesn't run out to all of the social events," he said.
When Hollywood's paparazzi surrounded her outside a restaurant near her ranch earlier this month, she showed flashes of anger and frustration.
One letter sent Tuesday demanded the New York Post retract its report that Rowe had agreed to drop her custody claims for $4 million.
Rowe also filed a lawsuit this week against a woman who claimed in a TV interview to have e-mails from Rowe saying she didn't really want to raise the children.
