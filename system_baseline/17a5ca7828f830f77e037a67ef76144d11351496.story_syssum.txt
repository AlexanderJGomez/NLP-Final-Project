Former Southampton defender Claus Lundekvam told a Norwegian television channel he and other players in the English top flight had made money out of betting on minor events in a game such as the first throw-in.

The Premier League insisted the case was a matter for the English Football Association.
Spot-fixing shook the world of cricket last year when three Pakistan internationals were jailed for conspiracy to corrupt during a Test match against England in 2010.
