The board this week released a sometimes scathing report that paints a vivid picture of the chaos that descended on an east Oakland street on March 21 after a convicted felon opened fire on officers during a traffic stop.
The panel, made up of law enforcement experts, said the two officers made a mistake in the traffic stop when both approached the car on the driver's side.
â€¢ Police leadership violated policy by assembling a SWAT team from officers on scene instead of waiting for the official special weapons and tactics team to arrive.
As other officers entered the dimly lit front room filled with children's toys, the officers were startled to see a woman running at them, screaming.
The report praised the officers' restraint in not shooting the woman who was in the apartment.
