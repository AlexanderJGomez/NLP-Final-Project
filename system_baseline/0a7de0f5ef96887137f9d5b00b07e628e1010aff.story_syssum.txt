Twitter was ablaze Sunday evening with running commentary about every conceivable aspect of Super Bowl XLVI, from Patriots' tight end Rob Gronkowski's balky ankle to Madonna's acrobatic halftime show to all those commercials.
If the coin toss is heads, they will give free pizzas to America.
Patton Oswalt -- Just heard Madonna will do a parody version of @alyankovic's "Like a Surgeon" during halftime show.
Paul Sanders -- Just glad to see that someone is finally willing to take a stand in favor of world peace.
The Sklar Brothers -- How can you not take Danica Patrick seriously as a race car driver at this point.
TheFakeESPN -- Giants receivers are on the sideline reapplying Tyree stickum to the top of their helmets.
Rainn Wilson -- All those Patriots Superbowl XLVI CHAMPIONS hats & shirts are already on their way to the Congo.
