A child of divorced parents who always fought about money-related issues, and with my grandmother's words etched in my mind, I told myself at a young age that I would never rely on a man or anyone to take care of me.
I became so defiant about being able to do things on my own that I would rarely even let people buy me meals.
A lot of my friends, however, were beginning to settle down and I started to feel like something was wrong with me for not being able to even fathom doing the same.
One week we'd be cruising the Mediterranean in a massive full-service yacht, the next we'd be on a shopping excursion in Rome.
We all know what sugar daddies are: Wealthy older men have throughout history sought out much younger women -- "sugar babies" -- to date, even marry and take care of.
I just knew that I was in mine for the wrong reasons and that I had compromised the woman I had worked so hard to become.
But, it serves as a constant reminder of a time when I didn't recognize myself, and that didn't feel very good.
