"There is a potential for 9/11 memorabilia loss due to a fire," according to a statement from the National Park Service, but the extent of the damage is not known yet.
Seven fire companies responded to the blaze, which started about 3 p.m., said Geraldine Budzina, a Somerset County dispatcher.
Ken Nacke, whose brother Louis was on Flight 93, said many 9/11 artifacts -- including notes and other mementos left at a temporary memorial at the crash site -- were being stored in the area where the fire burned.
"At the temporary memorial, people would leave cards, T-shirts and handmade stuff that was very comforting to us," he said.
"We are deeply saddened to learn that a fire occurred at the Flight 93 National Memorial headquarters," Gordon Felt, president of Families of Flight 93 said in a statement.
The memorial park is dedicated to the 40 passengers and crew who died when Flight 93 crashed outside the town in southwestern Pennsylvania.
The memorial, still incomplete, includes a visitor center with traditional and interactive exhibits, public programs and information about the history of Flight 93.
Since 2001, more than 1 million people from around the world have visited the crash site.
