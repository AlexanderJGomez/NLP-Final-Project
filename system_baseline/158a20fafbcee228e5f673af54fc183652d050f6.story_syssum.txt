"Despite Renzi's best efforts to convince us otherwise, we agree with the district court that the alleged choices and actions for which he is being prosecuted lie beyond those limits" of protected activity, the court said in a unanimous 45-page ruling.
Republican Renzi, 53, faces federal corruption charges related to an alleged illegal land-swap deal, allegedly designed to help a business associate pay back $700,000 owed the lawmaker.
Previous lawmakers have sought to shield themselves from prosecution using the "speech and debate" protection, including former Rep. William Jefferson, D-Louisiana.
Renzi represented the large 1st District in his state, centered in Flagstaff.
