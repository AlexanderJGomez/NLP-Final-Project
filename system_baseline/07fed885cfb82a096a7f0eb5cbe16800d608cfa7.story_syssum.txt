HP tried to bring itself around by replacing its CEO last year.
Yet HP hasn't stayed ahead of the innovation curve, failing for instance to adapt well to the tablet craze.
The tech job market is excellent for younger workers, but many of those who are laid off and over 35 will find the market less welcoming.
The difficulties of older techies have been investigated statistically in studies at American University and the National Research Council, but a very public human face was placed on this recently in an online town hall meeting with President Obama.
Granted, family issues restricted him to the Dallas area, but if the hype regarding a seller's market for engineers were true, Wedel should have been able to find something in that region, which sadly has not been the case.
A few years ago, HP executive Ann Livermore made it plain: "A basic business tenet is that things go to the areas where there is the best cost of production."
Unlike Livermore's explicit position on cheap labor, former HP CEO Carly Fiorina said that HP offshores work because the American educational system doesn't develop good math skills in its students.
Probably so, but the message here is that engineers, like many others, will have to get used to a life of layoffs in a globalized economy.
