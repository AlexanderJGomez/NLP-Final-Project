About 40 million Americans have chronic sleep disorders that prevent them from getting good rest.
Insomnia drugs help the patient sleep, but they do not treat the underlying cause, which could be a result of another illness, life changes or shifting work schedules.
Doctors may be factoring in cost considerations and their own familiarity with prescribing antidepressants relative to newer sleep medications, experts said.
"There's inadequate body of information to support use of the unapproved treatment," said Dr. Vaughn McCall, medical director of the Sleep Center at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.
Insomnia drugs can produce deeper sleep levels for a longer period of time -- about eight to 12 hours, he said.
Side effects for antidepressants can include headache, night sweats, nausea, agitation, sexual problems and dry mouth.
The entire sequence normally takes about an hour, and the fourth stage is considered the deepest.
Doctors might hesitate to prescribe some types of sleeping drugs because they belong to the same class of drugs, called benzodiazepines, as Xanax and Valium.
"A lot of it is a holdover from the days where the perception was that sleeping pills would cause dependence and there would be abuse liability," said author James Walsh, executive director and senior scientist at the Sleep Medicine and Research Center at St. Luke's Hospital in Chesterfield, Missouri.
"There are still a lot of doctors prescribing antidepressants and other sedating medicine for insomnia even though those medicines haven't been studied very well for treatment of insomnia and have some different types of risks," Walsh said.
Using anesthetics to get relief from sleep disorders is highly unusual and inappropriate, several doctors have told CNN.
"Propofol induces coma, it does not induce sleep," said Dr. Hector Vila, chairman of the Ambulatory Surgery Committee for the American Society of Anesthesiologists.
