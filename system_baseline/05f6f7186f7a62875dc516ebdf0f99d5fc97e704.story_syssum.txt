Manchester, New Hampshire (CNN)  -- On Sept. 12, 2009, frustrated tea party citizens from across the country marched upon the Capitol in Washington, energized by a shared sense of disenfranchisement in the political system and anger at a federal government they believed was taxing too much and racking up a dangerous amount of debt.
"We're not a protest movement anymore; we've morphed into something else," said Matt Kibbe, president of FreedomWorks, which has helped support tea party groups around the country.
Candidates Michele Bachmann and Ron Paul have enjoyed strong early support from tea party groups and are working to leverage that momentum into victories in states such as South Carolina.
"We're not going to sit back and just let the Republican party hand us the nominee," she said.
The hard-line, no-compromise stance tea party freshmen took on deeper spending cuts in Washington this year in the debt ceiling deal may have hurt the group's standing among Americans.
"When it comes down to the question of voting for President Obama or voting for the Republican nominee, I think Tea Partiers have a challenge, and that's why we've weighed in on this conversation early so we have a better choice."
"But with each passing day as the president's numbers appear to get worse, Republicans are looking at each other and saying, hmm, we really have a chance to win this thing."
"The tea party is an organic movement that was largely created by people who were frustrated by Washington," he said.
You cannot crush that out given the noise coming out of Washington these days."
