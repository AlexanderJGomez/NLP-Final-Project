Washington (CNN) -- Former presidential assailant John Hinckley Jr. should not be allowed to spend any unsupervised time during visits to his mother's home in Virginia, according to a psychiatrist who first met Hinckley in the 1980s and interviewed him several times in recent months.
Patterson said he had asked Hinckley about Secret Service reports Hinckley had gone into book stores and looked at shelves of history books which included volumes about presidential assassination.
Dr. Patterson, the former director of forensic psychiatry at St. Elizabeths, told the court he opposes allowing any expansion of Hinckley's trip beyond 17 days and said the unaccompanied time should end.
He said those are risk factors in analyzing whether he could become a danger to himself or others.
Barry Levine, a lawyer for Hinckley, has said the main issue is whether Hinckley is dangerous and that no evidence has been presented to show that he is.
