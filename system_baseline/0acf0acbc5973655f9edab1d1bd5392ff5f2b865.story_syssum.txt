A common benchmark in the United States for determining when a driver is legally drunk is not doing enough to prevent alcohol-related crashes that kill about 10,000 people each year and should be made more restrictive, transportation safety investigators say.
The board acknowledged that there was "no silver bullet," but that more action is needed at the federal and state levels.
That same person could reach the 0.05 threshold after two to three drinks over the same period, according to the calculator.
Many factors besides gender and weight influence a person's blood alcohol content, and many states outlaw lower levels of inebriation when behind the wheel.
And it is pushing for laws requiring all first-time offenders to have ignition locking devices that prevent cars from starting until breath samples are analyzed.
In recent years, about 31 percent of all fatal highway accidents were attributed to alcohol impairment, the NTSB said.
Currently, more than 100 countries on six continents have BAC limits set at 0.05 or lower, the safety board said.
A new NHTSA chart shows a person with a 0.05 BAC level experiences "reduced coordination, reduced ability to track moving objects, difficulty steering, (and) reduced response to emergency driving situations."
The safety board also recommend that NHTSA provide financial incentives to states to carry out the changes.
The NTSB recommended last December that states require ignition interlocks for all DUI offenders and said states should improve interlock compliance.
