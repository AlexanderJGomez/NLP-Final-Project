Washington (CNN) -- Recent remarks from a Supreme Court justice have alarmed those still pushing for an Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, three decades after an earlier attempt failed.
He said the justices "would elevate a corporate entity to have the rights of an individual, and yet say that women do not have rights as an individual under the Constitution.
Maloney said many women's groups have acted as if prevailing law and practices are enough to assume women have equal rights, but she noted that several prominent groups now have fresh concern.
Supporters believe the 35 ratifications could be kept alive by Congress if and when another three states endorse that 1972 proposal.
"The three-state strategy was developed following ratification of the Constitution's 27th Amendment in 1992, more than 203 years after its passage by Congress in 1789," notes the website www.equalrightsamendment.org.
