Two car bombs exploded in the oil-rich and ethnically mixed city of Kirkuk, about 240 kilometers (149 miles) north of Baghdad.
A clash between security forces and gunmen last month killed at least 50 people and wounded more than 85 others.
More people died violently in Iraq in April than in any other month since June 2008, the United Nations said.
