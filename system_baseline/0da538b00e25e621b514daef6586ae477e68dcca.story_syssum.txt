I checked in with women around the country, most of whom I interviewed last week about Abedin's decision to stick with her husband, to take their pulse.
"When relationships hit the rocks, doesn't everyone have those 'What did I do to deserve this?'
"When a woman's self-esteem is already low, and she is already so insecure, it is easy for a man like this to bend her thinking in a way that makes her feel as if she is the one who failed somehow," the divorced mom of a teenager said.
"If I acknowledge I am powerless to stop his behavior, that is very disheartening," she said.
Meg Watt, a married mom of two, says she knows plenty of people who have blamed themselves for their significant other's choices, and that she was also guilty of it in a past relationship.
"But the important thing is to realize that the only person who can 'fix' infidelity is the one who chose to commit it."
