Patrick's disappearance is a mystery to police, who've scoured the area to no avail, and to relatives.
"(Missing work) is out of character where she is concerned," her father, Matthias Patrick, told HLN's Nancy Grace on Wednesday.
She was supposed to be at work at 7 a.m. the next day, but she was reported missing after she didn't arrive, her family said.
"(The dogs) indicated that whoever was in that vehicle ... tracked back to that roadway" roughly 30 feet from the car, Strong said.
Patrick's parents told WXMI that she had just bought a plane ticket so that she could visit them in Florida at the end of the month.
Patrick was working at Kalamazoo's two teaching hospitals, the Western University Michigan School of Medicine said.
