The film was the first box office hit directed by a Latino filmmaker and starring mostly Latino actors, said Chon Noriega, a professor of cinema and media studies at the University of California, Los Angeles.
The event features 40 films that show how Latinos have been depicted on the big screen and is part of the network's "Race and Hollywood" series.
Chon Noriega: I decided I was going to focus specifically on Hollywood films that look substantively at either Latino characters or the Latino community.
There really haven't been, as far as I can tell, many Hollywood films that go beyond those three major groups.
Noriega: If I'm watching a science-fiction film and there happens to be a Latino character, I know that that character is going to be the first one to die.
To my mind, it's valuable just to go back and just see that these are the films that at different points represent how not just Hollywood but our society was trying to figure out where Latinos fit within the national culture.
Noriega: Actually, [co-host] Robert Osborne and I kind of went back and forth on that throughout the series because I think there are two views.
In the history of Hollywood, we're maybe able to identify 70 films that really focus on Latino characters, family or community, and a third of those have white actors playing the Latinos.
In the makeup room, they started putting brownface on her, [because] she wasn't dark enough to meet the expectations of what a Latina character would look like on stage.
When you look at the statistics in terms of the overall presence of Latinos in film and television, the numbers really haven't changed that much.
