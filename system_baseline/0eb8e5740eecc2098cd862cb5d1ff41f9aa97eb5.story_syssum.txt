And while the actor is set to play Wu-Tang Clan member Ol' Dirty Bastard in a forthcoming film about the rapper, Williams is most excited about his new role as an executive producer.
In what Williams calls " 'The Blair Witch Project' meets the hood," "Snow on tha Bluff" documents real-life stick-up boy Curtis Snow.
While Snow was quick to get caught up in the hype of Williams' characters, the latter made clear it's not his fictional accounts that deserve credit; it's the real-life people who inspire them.
Among fans (counted among that group is President Barack Obama), Omar Little has been dubbed the best character on "The Wire" and is the role Williams is probably best known for.
Williams said he also dealt with his own "racism" with "The Wire," especially when the first season with a predominantly black cast was followed with a second season with more white characters.
"I got real bitter and angry," he said of his initial response.
"I don't think Hollywood was ready to have that many young black actors running around with statues in the town," he said, noting that the lack of a statue can't come close to the career opportunities he's been provided, thanks to the show's success.
In his first leading role in a major film, Williams is set to play the iconic artist in the last two years of his life, as seen through the eyes of his manager, Jarred Weisfeld, a former VH1 intern.
It was just a very unfortunate accident how he lost his life," said Williams, who did most of his research for the role by spending time with the late rapper's mother.
"I feel like I've been given an opportunity to paint people that society would deem as 'the gangster,' 'the thug,' as a human being with raw emotions," he said.
