Meteorologists in the city, which is famous for its annual ice festival, issued a red alert for fog at 5 a.m. Tuesday, with visibility in some central areas of the city down to less than 20 meters (65 feet), the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.
Government officials blamed the smog on a lack of wind and farmers burning crop stalk after their autumn harvest, though the city's coal-burning heating system, which was recently started, is also a likely factor.
Residents of this city of 10 million people were also surprised by the thick smog.
People are very angry about this and there is a lot of discussion over the Internet.
An explosion in the number of cars on the roads, as well as industrial pollution are seen as the main contributors.
