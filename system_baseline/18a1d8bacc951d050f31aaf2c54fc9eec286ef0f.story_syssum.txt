"The truth is that Maradona has always been very nice to me, even before he was our coach and I took my first steps as a professional," Messi said.
"But afterwards, we started getting used to him and he's been our coach for a while, so now it's normal.
"It's very special for me to wear the shirt of the national team.
Maradona has had well-documented troubles with drugs and his party lifestyle, even being kicked out of the 1994 World Cup, but Messi maintains a much lower profile off the pitch.
The Rosario-born forward said that he is hoping to make the World Cup "mine" despite the weight of expectations on his shoulders.
At Barcelona, Guardiola decided to use me more in midfield and that's when I had more touches on the ball and played more around the front of the area.
Messi insists he feels no extra pressure going into the World Cup, with Argentina's first Group B match against Nigeria on June 12, as the intense media cauldron in Spain has prepared him well.
Argentina are not among the favorites after struggling to impress under Maradona, and Messi admits that European champions Spain, five-time World Cup winners Brazil and 1966 titleholders England are the teams to beat.
