Shaheen woke Elle up and gave her orange juice to keep her from slipping into unconsciousness.
During the three-day study, Elle didn't have to poke her finger every few hours to find out her blood sugar level because the "bionic" pancreas recorded it automatically and adjusted her insulin accordingly.
Shaheen didn't have to set her alarm to wake up every three hours at night because the device was designed to catch a dangerously high or low blood sugar and treat it.
"I hope very much we'll have a system on the market within four years, and I'll be very disappointed if we don't."
The Shaheens first heard about the artificial pancreas shortly after Elle was diagnosed with diabetes at age 8, but she had to be 12 years old to enroll.
She was in the school office and her voice was trembling, and she said 'Mom, I need you to come quick.
For three days, the device did the work Elle's pancreas can no longer do.
For that one weekend, Elle didn't have to draw blood, and she could eat foods she hadn't eaten in large quantities for four years.
Then, after the experiment, Elle had to leave the artificial pancreas behind, and it was back to counting carbs and poking herself every couple of hours.
Last week, Russell and Damiano visited the Food and Drug Administration offices in Silver Spring, Maryland, to show regulators a prototype for the artificial pancreas.
Russell said he hopes that by the fall, the FDA will give him permission to allow adult diabetic patients to leave the building and walk the grounds of the Massachusetts General Hospital campus accompanied by a nurse, eating as they like and using the hospital's gym.
Then by the summer of 2013, he hopes to give the artificial pancreas to children attending a summer camp.
