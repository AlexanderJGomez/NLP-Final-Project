(AOL Autos)  -- Recently, Consumer Reports magazine issued its list of best and worst used cars, and divvied them up by price range.
It also came in three flavors: Base, Technology and Sport Packages, and all three were powered by a 3.7-liter 300-hp V6.
The '07 328i was propelled by a 3.0-liter 230-hp inline six-cylinder engine, which you can find mated to either a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic transmission.
Here is yet another one that appeals to luxury buyers with its balance of SUV-type spaciousness, pampering amenities, deft handling and burly engine muscle.
Luxury features included standard leather seats with heating and ventilation, and optional 10-way power adjustments for the driver's seat.
Lexus has placed No 1 in the JD Power Dependability Survey every year for the last 12 years - until '07, when another carmaker, Buick, finally tied them for first.
And by the latest recommended used-model year, the '07, you could choose among various styles and engine sizes, including the Carrera, with its 3.6-L 325-hp flat-six plant; the Carrera S and S Cabriolet, with the 3.8-L 355 hp V6; the 911 Turbo, with twin-turbocharged 480 hp six-cylinder engine; and the GT3 track model, powered by a high-revving 415-hp six-cylinder engine.
