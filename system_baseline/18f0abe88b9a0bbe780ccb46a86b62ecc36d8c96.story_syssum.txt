"Our hearts, thoughts and prayers go out to the families and friends of our fallen angels," said Lt. Col. Andrew J. McNulty, commanding officer of the 1st Battalion, 9th Marine Regiment.
David P. Fenn II: The Polk City, Florida, resident joined the Marines in June 2010 and was promoted nine months later.
Like his fallen colleagues, he amassed a host of honors in his military career, such as the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal and Sea Service Deployment Ribbon.
Aaron J. Ripperda: At 26, Ripperda was the most senior of those killed Tuesday, both in his age and rank.
He, too, served in Afghanistan and accumulated a number of medals along the way.
By December 2011, the mortarman had earned his new rank -- and he also earned a number of recognitions, such as the Combat Action Ribbon and Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal.
The night after the incident, the Marines issued a statement saying that 60 mm mortar rounds and tubes used to fire them are being pulled pending the investigation.
The Wednesday night update from the Marines indicates that a Navy Corpsman remains "very seriously injured," while five others are "seriously injured" and two Marines have been treated for minor injuries and released.
