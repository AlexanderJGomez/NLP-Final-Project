New York (CNN) -- Two Mexican brothers have been extradited to the United States to join a third brother to face sex trafficking charges in New York as part of a complex collaborative effort to combat human trafficking, federal officials said Monday.
All the extraditions resulted from the comprehensive anti-trafficking program, which has so far resulted in the indictment of 52 defendants on sex trafficking charges and has "rescued over 100 victims, including 17 minors," the release said.
Under the initiative, "the United States and Mexico have collaborated to bring high-impact prosecutions under both U.S. and Mexican law to more effectively dismantle human trafficking networks operating across the U.S.-Mexico border," Monday's news release said.
"The extraditions over the weekend followed by the arraignments today are a testament to our resolve to bring justice to those charged with forcing young women into prostitution," James T. Hayes Jr. is the special agent-in-charge of Homeland Security Investigations in New York.
