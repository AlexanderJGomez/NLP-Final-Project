The online witness said he saw Liu and the unknown man struggle for a time before the attacker turned off her laptop, the news release said.
Ten hours later, police arrived at the basement apartment to find Liu's body, naked from the waist down.
The attacker was described as white, age 20 to 30, 6 feet tall, weighing 175 to 200 pounds, with a muscular build and medium-length brown hair, and wearing a blue crew-neck T-shirt.
The friend was looking away when he heard a shot and a scream, police said.
Upon looking back at the screen, the friend saw Hain's husband firing a handgun at where his wife had been, they said.
