The state's Department of Correction said Michelle Kosilek, previously known as Robert, who is serving a life sentence without parole for murdering his wife in 1990, has a gender identity disorder.
According to Francis Cohen, the lead counsel of Kosilek's initial lawsuit, Kosilek did not receive any treatment for her disorder from 1992 to 2002, even though she had repeatedly asked the prison for help.
A 2009 University of California, Irvine study of prison inmates in California found that a transgender inmate is 13 times more likely to be sexually assaulted than the average inmate, adding on to security concerns above medical ones.
U.S. Sen. Scott Brown, R-Massachusetts, said in a statement Tuesday that the court's decision is "an outrageous abuse of taxpayer dollars.
The court ruling left it up to the Department of Correction to decide where Kosilek will be incarcerated after the surgery.
