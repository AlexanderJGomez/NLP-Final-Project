Department of Agriculture will provide scientific knowledge to help farmers, ranchers and landowners battle risks associated with climate change, including drought, floods, pests and fires.
"USDA's climate hubs are part of our broad commitment to developing the next generation of climate solutions so that our agricultural leaders have the modern technologies and tools they need to adapt and succeed in the face of a changing climate," Vilsack said.
In addition to affecting food supply and rural economies, climate change comes with a hefty price tag.
Vilsack will introduce the hubs at the White House on Wednesday.
