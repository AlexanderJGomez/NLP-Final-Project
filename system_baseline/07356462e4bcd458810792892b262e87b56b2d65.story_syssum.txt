Recently, a Long Island school district drew criticism following a performance that removed the holier lyrics from the traditional Christmas song "Silent Night."
To filter religion out of history leaves something that cannot, in good faith, still be called history.
Religion has always been a part of our civilization; the Constitution and our courts recognize this.
In 1971 the United States Supreme Court decided Lemon v. Kurtzman and formulated the "Lemon Test," which is a three-pronged evaluation of the constitutionality of legislation concerning religion.
It would be impossible to develop a public school curriculum that did not in some way affect the religious or nonreligious sensibilities of some of the students or their parents.
Fortunately, the courts have squarely dealt with that issue, in the context of ... you guessed it ... "Silent Night."
After Florey, it appears that the Establishment Clause does not prevent the singing of Christmas carols with religious origins by public school choirs, though the line seems very thin.
In Stratechuk v. Board of Educ., South Orange-Maplewood School Dist., the Third Circuit Court of Appeals held that a school district's policy to bar performance of religious holiday music at seasonal shows, while allowing it to be taught in class, had a legitimate secular purpose of avoiding potential Establishment Clause problems, and was not "hostile" to religion.
At least there are some less contentious holiday traditions that we can always count on: egg nog, gift returns, and bad decisions at office parties.
