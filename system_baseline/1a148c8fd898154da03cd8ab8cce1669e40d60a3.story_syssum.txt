Last year I was able to travel back to East Africa to find my parents, reconnect with others who survived the war and place my vote in the referendum that would eventually lead to the division of Sudan into two independent states.
Through two civil wars that lasted a total of 39 years, this is what we had hoped, prayed and fought for; it was hard to believe it was happening in my lifetime.
It was never easy, but I always tried my best and kept complaints out of my heart by holding tightly onto the hope that one day, I would read and write.
My main concern for the newest nation in the world is not tribalism or corruption -- though they both exist, it's the fact that we are still at war with the National Congress (NCP) of Sudan, the governing official party of Sudan, and this needs to be permanently addressed before moving onto smaller issues.
As I write this article there are still many innocent people suffering and dying all across the country.
With my fellow brothers I walked to Ethiopia barefoot without adequate food or water in the rain and burning sun, eating unripe mangoes and dodging the corpses of those who perished along the way.
All around the world there is corruption, tribalism and division, as many find it easier to pick on those that are different, which is why we need to hold tightly to the good in this world.
