Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- Some of the families camped outside the San Jose mine, waiting for rescuers to reach 33 workers trapped underground, fear Chilean President Sebastian Pinera may be playing politics with the rescue operation in an effort to boost his popularity.
The mine rescue appears to have boosted Pinera's popularity at a time when he was under fire in other parts of the country.
Outside the mine Sunday, some family members said they were angry that the rescue effort was being turned into a political spectacle.
She also claimed rescuers discovered the miners were alive in an underground shelter in the early hours of August 22, but waited until midday to officially announce the news, after Pinera arrived at the mine.
The woman, who asked not to be named for fear of unspecified reprisals, said she did not bother to wait in the hot sun to meet the president Sunday.
God works on his own schedule and we have to wait patiently," said Eli Steger, daughter of trapped miner Jose Ojeda.
"Hopefully this spirit of unity, faith, confidence and pride to be Chilean that is in the air at the San Jose mine and in every corner of Chile is a spirit that will illuminate this third century of independence," Pinera said, referring to Chile's recent bicentennial celebration.
Two other drills, a Schramm T-130 (Plan B) normally used for boring water holes and a Raise Borer Strata 950 (Plan A) normally used for drilling ventilation chimneys in mines, have been operating for about three weeks.
