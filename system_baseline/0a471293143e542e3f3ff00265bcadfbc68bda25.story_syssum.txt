President Barack Obama says he has "high confidence" that the regime is to blame -- the strongest position short of confirmation.
That's how then-CIA Director George Tenet described what turned out to be flawed intelligence that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction in the run-up to the war 10 years ago.
And that is why our intelligence community has scrubbed and re-scrubbed the evidence," Kerry told Congress.
And intelligence does not work that way," he told CNN's State of the Union.
That information boils down to summaries of what the evidence is.
"In the three days prior to the attack, we collected streams of human, signals and geospatial intelligence that reveal regime activities that we assess were associated with preparations for a chemical weapons attack," the U.S. report says.
"... We intercepted communications involving a senior official intimately familiar with the offensive who confirmed that chemical weapons were used by the regime on August 21 and was concerned with the U.N. inspectors obtaining evidence."
In May, a U.N. official said there were strong suspicions that Syrian rebel forces had used sarin gas.
Russia, a Syrian ally, says its investigation of a March attack in Aleppo, which apparently involved chemical weaopns, found that the charge used was homemade and similar to projectiles produced by the group Bashaar al-Nasr, part of the opposition Syrian Islamic Liberation Front.
Some experts on the region question why al-Assad would have ordered the attack.
A preliminary assessment "determined that 1,429 people were killed in the chemical weapons attack, including at least 426 children," the U.S. report says.
The United Nations is calling on world leaders not to take action until the results of the U.N. probe are in.
So, short of a shocking finding that chemical weapons were not used, it's unclear how much of an effect the U.N. results will ultimately have.
"The evidence speaks for itself," he said.
