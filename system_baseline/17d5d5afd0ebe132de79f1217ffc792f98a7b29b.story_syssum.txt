(CNN) -- A nurse accused of killing a Texas mother in a parking lot and stealing her 3-day-old son had suffered a miscarriage and believed she needed to show her fiance that she had a child, authorities said Wednesday.
Witnesses said Kala Golden, 28, who was shot outside a Houston-area pediatrician's office Tuesday, screamed and attempted to chase after the car with her son inside, CNN affiliate KTRK reported.
Police believe the kidnapping was the motive for the shooting, the report said.
Golden's husband, Keith Schuchardt, told KHOU he had not yet signed Keegan's birth certificate, which complicated the process of getting his son back.
The baby was returned to him Wednesday after the paperwork was resolved, according to Warren Diepraam, Montgomery County district attorney trial division chief.
"The defendant confronted Mrs. Golden and shot her multiple times in the parking lot," then took the baby and left, the report said.
The Montgomery County Sheriff's Office said detectives began a "systematic canvas and search" of areas near the shooting scene and spied the car at the apartment complex.
During an interview with authorities, McClain provided information that only someone at the scene would know, the report said.
Authorities said Tuesday that Golden and the woman parked next to her at the doctor's office apparently spoke to one another or argued before the shooting.
She's just a mom doing her best to take care of her kids, and I miss her," Hartis told CNN affiliate KPRC.
I mean, you hear about a lot of shootings and other types of crimes, but somebody kidnaps a baby, 3 days old, and the mother to be shot?
