The reason we started this business is we looked at our community and we wanted to do work that matters," explains Kgatlhanye.
"One of the first obstacles these kids face is not being able to finish their homework," says Kgatlhanye, the first runner-up at the 2014 Anzhisha Prize, a pan-African award celebrating entrepreneurs aged 15-22 who've come up with innovative ways to solve problems in their communities.
The company has also teamed up with local individuals and corporates who are willing to cover the cost of the bags on behalf of the students.
"The plastic comes to our workshop where we process them into a textile, sew it up with industrial sewing machines and then we distribute," she continues.
Kgatlhanye says they are already hard at work as they prepare to take on an additional 12 employees to meet the growing demand for their bags, as well as introduce new products.
We've also started with product development -- having other things for sale like conscience bags made out of the same material that corporates can then buy for their conferences and summits.
