The court -- not the department or the state Board of Parole Hearings -- has the final say on whether Atkins should be released, Thornton said.
Her request is now before the Board of Parole Hearings, which is conducting an independent investigation and will hear the case during its monthly public meeting, Thornton said.
The Board of Parole Hearings will receive public comment, discuss the request in closed session and then announce its recommendation.
Her husband and attorney, James Whitehouse, has been quoted as saying she has terminal brain cancer, according to a blog called Manson Family Today.
Tate and three houseguests were slain in August 1969 by killers who burst into her Benedict Canyon home.
Her punishment was changed to life in prison when the California Supreme Court ruled the state's death penalty unconstitutional in 1972.
Last month, authorities dug for buried bodies at the Inyo County, California, ranch where Manson and his followers once lived, after police became aware that testing had indicated humans might be buried there.
