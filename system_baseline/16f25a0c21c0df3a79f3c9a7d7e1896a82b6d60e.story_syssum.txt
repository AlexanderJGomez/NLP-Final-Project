By the time the spree was over, authorities said, the suspects killed two sheriff's deputies in two counties, wounded a third deputy, attempted three car carjackings and shot one of those drivers in the head -- all during a span of six hours Friday, prompting school lockdowns and a massive manhunt.
The wounded deputy, Jeff Davis of Placer County, was shot in the arm and later treated and released, and the driver, Anthony Holmes, 38, was in serious condition in a hospital, according to authorities and CNN affiliates.
He has no idea of the damage he did," Placer County Sheriff's Office spokesman Dena Erwin told reporters after Marquez's arrest.
Events began shortly before 10:30 a.m. when Oliver and his partner found themselves being fired upon by at least one of the suspects in a vehicle in the parking lot of Motel 6, authorities said.
The first was Holmes' vehicle, but he fought the carjacking attempt, police said.
Authorities arrested Monroy in or near the hijacked truck, and Marquez allegedly ran from the scene, said Erwin.
A SWAT team, police armored vehicles and gun-drawing officers formed a perimeter around the neighborhood and set up checkpoints to inspect the car trunks of passing motorists, the Sacramento Bee reported.
His ID was found on the dashboard of one of the vehicles he allegedly carjacked, KCRA reported.
