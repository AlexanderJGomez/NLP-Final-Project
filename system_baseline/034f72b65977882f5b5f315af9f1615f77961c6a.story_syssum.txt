Officials in Washington said Monday they would grant consular access to the U.S.-held suspect in an alleged Iranian plot to assassinate the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States.
U.S. officials arrested Arbabsia last week on suspicion that he conspired with an Iran-based member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to hire hit men from a Mexican drug cartel to set off a bomb next year at a restaurant to be visited by Adel Al-Jubeir, the Saudi ambassador.
We have asked the Unites States to provide us with the relevant information regarding this scenario," he told the Islamic Republic News Agency.
Salehi's apparent willingness to look at evidence of the plot comes in stark contrast to the response of the country's supreme leader.
Authorities developed the case against the suspects with the help of an undercover informant posing as an associate of a Mexican drug cartel, according to officials and an FBI agent's affidavit.
Reza Aslan, a religious scholar and author, told CNN on Saturday that the described plot doesn't fit the Quds Force's modus operandi.
Iran could more easily target Saudi diplomats in the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere, Aslan said.
