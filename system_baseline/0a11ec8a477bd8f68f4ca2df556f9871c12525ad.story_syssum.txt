Many observers believe Saverin, who, according to the Facebook origin story was slighted by Zuckerberg as the site grew, was a primary source for the book "The Accidental Billionaires," on which "Social Network" is based.
Saverin filed a lawsuit against Facebook over his reduced stake in the company, and the legal dispute was settled out of court.
He was a visionary and always knew Facebook would only grow if it remained true to its central idea of people presenting themselves truthfully and without pseudonyms.
"The decision was strictly based on my interest of living and working in Singapore," he said.
"But he did this not because he wanted to, but because he had no other choice as a foreigner living in Singapore, where financial transactions are more restricted and bureaucratic for those who hold a U.S. passport.
Saverin still has his own profile, with more than 1 million people subscribed to it.
