His story made national headlines after a witness claimed Couch was a victim of "affluenza" -- the product of wealthy, privileged parents who never set limits for the boy.
The judge ordered that Couch's parents pay for the treatment facility, which was not identified.
If Couch violates the terms of his probation, he could face up to 10 years behind bars.
He told reporters he has no doubt that money played a role in the case.
All four were killed when the teen's pickup plowed into the pedestrians on a road in Burleson, south of Fort Worth.
"There has been nothing from Ethan from these proceedings with regards to remorse on his part at all -- that I do think would have helped.
The way the system down here is currently handled, the way the law is, almost all the focus is on the offender."
