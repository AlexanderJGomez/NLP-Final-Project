(CNN) -- Protesters took to St. Louis streets for a second night Thursday after an off-duty officer killed a teen who fired at him three times, authorities said.
"I think the officers showed a tremendous amount of restraint," St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson told CNN affiliate KMOV.
Twitter user PontifexMonty said "people really getting mad that they're burning the flag in St. Louis.
Police said the teen fired a pistol three times at an off-duty St. Louis officer who was wearing his uniform while moonlighting for a security company.
Without video of the incident or unbiased witnesses, the police and the public must rely on physical evidence, he said.
The officer, a six-year veteran who has not been named, was placed on administrative leave.
The officer tussled with one teen, who ran off, then turned around and fired at least three shots toward him, Dotson said.
Additional marches are planned over the weekend around the St. Louis region, organizers said.
