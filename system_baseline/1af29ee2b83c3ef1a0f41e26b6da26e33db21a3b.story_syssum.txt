At an enthusiastic gathering at Hollywood's El Capitan Theatre, Marvel chief Kevin Feige reeled off announcements for a new Captain America film, a "Guardians of the Galaxy" sequel and the two-part Avengers adventure.
The character was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko and made his first appearance in Strange Tales No.
"Strange" wasn't the only film to get a spot on the Marvel calendar.
Feige said Marvel's plans -- and the opportunity to make a big announcement -- have been the works for a while.
"I'm blessed to be a part of this Marvel universe, and I'm looking forward to making magic happen," Boseman said.
In addition to his well-received "Sherlock" series, for which he won an Emmy this year, he's earned a great deal of Oscar buzz for his performance as cyberpioneer Alan Turing in "The Imitation Game," a drama about World War II codebreakers.
