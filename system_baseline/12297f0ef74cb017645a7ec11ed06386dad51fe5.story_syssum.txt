(CNN) -- Hotels love to push the aura of movie-star glamor as part of their mystique, listing on their websites Hollywood royalty that have stayed in -- and sometimes trashed -- their rooms.
Over its long history, the Victorian hotel, noted for its wraparound porches (highlighted in the film where rows of men wait to watch for Monroe's character, Sugar, to return to the hotel), has been the site of many films, including 1915's "Pearl of the Pacific" and 1924's "My Husband's Wives."
The plot centers on a couple and their son, the hotel's winter caretakers.
The hotel, just outside Rocky Mountain National Park in Estes Park, is considered haunted and is routinely surveyed for paranormal activity.
The Aqua Star Pool, the largest heated pool in Beverly Hills, is surrounded by cabana guest rooms for easy access to the Southern California sunshine.
Ben Affleck's character, Tony Mendez (based on a real CIA operative), heads to the hotel to mingle with Hollywood's elite as part of a farfetched rescue scheme for American hostages.
"Lost in Translation," a 2003 movie starring Bill Murray as a fading actor and Scarlett Johansson as a lonely young American newlywed whose husband is busy working, uses the Park Hyatt Tokyo to tremendous effect.
The hotel was the setting for 1998's "How Stella Got Her Groove Back," starring Angela Bassett as workaholic divorcee Stella Payne, Taye Diggs as much-younger love interest Winston Shakespeare and Whoopi Goldberg as sidekick Delilah Abraham.
Other highlights are an open-air dining terrace, a double infinity pool, five all-weather tennis courts and a spa housed in a restored 18th century plantation house.
While many remember dramatic Swiss Alps ski scenes with machine guns setting off avalanches, "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" opens on the beaches of Portugal, with James Bond staying at the Hotel Palacio overlooking the Bay of Cascais.
