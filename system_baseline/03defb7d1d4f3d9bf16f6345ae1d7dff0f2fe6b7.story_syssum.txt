Every life on this good earth is precious, and all four Americans who lost their lives at the U.S. Consulate were in Benghazi to help the Libyan efforts.
Because I knew and worked with Chris, I understand firsthand that the world has lost a true hero, and we seem to have precious few of those.
I was there as the new director of the fledgling American School of Tripoli and Chris had just been appointed U.S. Deputy Chief of Mission.
He loved the school and in an e-mail earlier this year shared how much he was looking forward to witness its eventual reopening.
What really made Chris exceptional to me, however, was his ability to distance himself.
It is extremely rare to find someone who can do that, consistently rising above the fray, and that's what makes his death so especially painful.
As I continue to watch the Libyans, who have only known oppression, try to dig out of the void left behind in the wake of Moammar Gadhafi's fall, I will always remember Chris and the legacy he has left them.
