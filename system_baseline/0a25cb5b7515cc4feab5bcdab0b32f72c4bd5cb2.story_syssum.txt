(CNN) -- At least eight people are dead after a bizarre mix of weather across the country spawned tornadoes, ice storms and record-setting warmth this weekend.
The Kentucky Emergency Management reported a fifth death because of flood waters, in Ballard County, but did not provide specifics.
The eighth fatality came from a traffic accident near Kansas City, said Chris Redline of the Missouri Department of Transportation.
Flooding, extreme cold and unseasonable warmth covered other parts of the country.
On Saturday night, the National Weather Service said a tornado was likely to blame for damage in central Mississippi, including four semi-trucks overturned and five houses heavily damaged.
Moderate to heavy lake-enhanced snow was expected for far western and north central upper Michigan into Monday night.
"We are allowing customers to rebook their trip with no penalty through (Sunday)," she said.
And we are currently sitting at 70 degrees, which we've been at for the past couple of hours," she said.
Toronto Mayor Rob Ford described the winter weather Sunday as one of the worst storms in the city's history.
"It truly is a catastrophic ice storm that we've had here, probably one of the worst we've ever had," Toronto Hydro CEO Anthony Haines told CTV Network.
