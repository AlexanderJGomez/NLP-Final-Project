In my view, reform is not enough: The real challenge is to transform education from a 19th century industrial model into a 21st century process based on different principles.
What and how young people are taught has to engage their energies, imaginations and their different ways of learning.
In the catering business, there are two main methods of quality assurance.
The other method of quality assurance are the star ratings guides, like Michelin.
In general they are much better than fast food and offer a higher standard of service.
What's needed is a much higher standard of provision based on the principles of personalized learning for every child and of schools customizing their cultures to meet local circumstances.
Understanding those conditions is the real key to transforming education for all our children.
