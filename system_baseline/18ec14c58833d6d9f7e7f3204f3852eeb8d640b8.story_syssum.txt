Europe vs. the United States, whether in the Solheim Cup or its male equivalent the Ryder Cup, is a grudge match as intense as any on the planet.
Hedwall dazzled as Europe crushed the U.S. in August's Solheim Cup, winning the trophy on American soil for the first time with an emphatic 18-10 victory.
23 made history by becoming the first woman to taste victory in all five of her matches, rounding off a victorious weekend with a singles win over former teen sensation Michelle Wie.
"I was the first to tee off and I had a good long drive in the middle of the fairway," recalls Hedwall.
"I remember walking to school and saying, 'Who wants to be a lawyer or a doctor when you can be a professional athlete?
When I got picked for the national team I was 14.
"I'd heard that a lot of the older players on the Swedish golf team went over there and liked it.
"I wanted to go to college and it turned out to be a good decision," said Hedwall, whose twin sister Jacqueline -- her caddy at the 2011 Solheim -- also played university golf in the U.S. and is now a fledgling pro on the Ladies European Tour.
But, just like the girl who achieved her childhood dream of playing professional golf, Hedwall is confident of capturing that elusive first victory.
