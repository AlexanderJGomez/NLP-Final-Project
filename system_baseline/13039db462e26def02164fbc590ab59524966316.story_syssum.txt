For someone who has spent the best part of three decades broadcasting in some shape or form, you might have thought this would be something of a handicap.
If you don't like what I am saying, well, I am sorry but at least I don't have to witness the grimace, the yawn or the shake of the head before you switch off.
What I was not prepared for was the wholesale rethinking of how I go about my breathing, thinking, and ultimately delivery.
In the world of seemingly unlimited broadcasting it puts our throats under terrible strain because we don't do it properly.
Apparently it's all designed to open up the throat and allow the sound to flow from the vocal chords.
I have been told I sound like gargling with broken glass, although I can't hear that.
I needed to be more aware in my style, less thrusting into the audience's face.
I had tried it out a few times while presenting Quest Means Business and the results were uncomfortably bad.
I will never really like standing in front of a large audience, hoping they will like me (a therapist would have a field day with that comment) but at least I am no longer nervous to the point of going to the bathroom multiple times just to get away.
