A Ugandan lawmaker first introduced the bill in 2009 with a death penalty clause for some homosexual acts.
"There was no quorum which (was) mandated for bill passage.
The President also believes that the issue is not a priority for his country.
According to Amnesty International, the bill's definition of "aggravated homosexuality" includes acts in which a person is infected with HIV, "serial offenders" and sex with minors.
Rights groups and the international community had urged Museveni to veto the bill.
The bill can become law without the President's signature if Museveni returns it to parliament twice and it garners the support of two-thirds of lawmakers, he said.
