(CNN) -- Since March 11, the six reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant have been in various states of disrepair after being battered by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
1 unit's reactor core has been damaged, but its containment vessel was not.
While electricity issues remain, lighting has been restored for this and the No.
1, there has been evidence of high radiation levels in spots in and around the No.
The water is being pumped in to help cool down nuclear fuel rods and prevent the further emission of radioactive material.
3 unit's turbine building had 10,000 times the amount of radiation typical for that locale, Nishiyama said.
The workers -- each of whom tested 170 or more millisieverts of radiation, including two with direct exposure on the skin -- were admitted Friday for four days of observation at Japan's National Institute for Radiological Sciences, a research hospital in Chiba.
3 reactor and its spent nuclear fuel pool.
3 reactor was "severely damaged" after an explosion caused by the buildup of hydrogen gas, reports the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum.
5 and 6 units, the No.
Its capability to cool the fuel rods in the spent fuel pool is working again, according to the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum.
4 and 6, this reactor was off on a scheduled outage when the quake hit and there are no major issues with the reactor and core itself.
Its capability to cool the fuel rods in the spent fuel pool is working again, according to the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum.
6 reactor was offline when the tsunami struck, and there are no major concerns about the structure or safety of its core or containment vessel.
