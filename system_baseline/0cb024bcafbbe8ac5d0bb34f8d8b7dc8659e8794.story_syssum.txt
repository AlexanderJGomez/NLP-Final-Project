The funeral came two days after a Westminster Cathedral memorial service for Saldanha, who in early December took what turned out to be a prank call from two Australian radio show hosts pretending to be Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles.
The hosts were able to get some information about Catherine's condition before the nurse who took the call grew suspicious and ended the call.
"Without your beautiful smile and sparkling personality, the house is an empty place to live."
The hospital, which has said Saldanha was not subject to any disciplinary actions because of the prank, set up a memorial fund to benefit her family.
