"There was a rumor that there were archives in the Condé Nast offices in New York that nobody had known about," says Todd Brandow, a photography curator.
Among the prints were photographic portraits of Winston Churchill, Katharine Hepburn, HG Wells, George Gershwin, Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo, WB Yeats, Fred Astaire, and countless other luminaries of the 1920s and 1930s.
During his lifetime, Steichen was recognized as the most important photographer of his age.
Even today, says Natalie Herschdorfer, an art historian who co-curated the exhibition with Brandow, he is "one of the top five photographers of all time".
But after his death he fell from prominence because his widow, Joanna, was extremely protective of the rights to his work, making exhibitions very difficult.
He looked first and foremost at a woman wearing a dress, not the dress for its own sake.
In a letter to his sister, he wrote that the outlook was bleak and that he was considering abandoning photography for film, which he thought may have a more secure future.
After he arrived, he stumbled upon an article in Vanity Fair in which, to his surprise, he was named as "America's greatest portrait photographer".
It was Condé Montrose Nast himself who had the vision to attract Steichen's talents to his magazines.
It was this unique approach towards fashion photography, which was firmly rooted in the tradition of portraiture, that was one of the keys to Steichen's success.
But in 1935 he burned out, and resigned to spend his time on horticultural photography, which was his great passion.
