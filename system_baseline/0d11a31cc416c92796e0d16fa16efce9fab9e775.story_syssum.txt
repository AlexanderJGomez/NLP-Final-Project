Kanye West and Kim Kardashian are accusing a YouTube co-founder of illegally publishing video of their engagement party to boost his new "foundering" website.
"Immediately after giving his word to honor the condition required for his attendance at the event," Hurley posted the shaky video on MixBit, a video sharing website owned by his San Mateo, California, company, it said.
"An opportunity to do so appeared to Hurley when he learned of the October 21, 2013, event featuring West and Kardashian," it said.
"Undeterred by the contractual restrictions to which he had just agreed, Hurley opted to exploit and capitalize upon the extreme public interest he knew would attach to the event, in order to boost the fortunes or his underperforming business venture," the suit said.
