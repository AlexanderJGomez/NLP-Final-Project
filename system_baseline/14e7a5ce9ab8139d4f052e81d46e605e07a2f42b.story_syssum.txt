Coots was a third-generation "serpent handler" and aspired to one day pass the practice and his church, Full Gospel Tabernacle in Jesus Name, on to his adult son, Little Cody.
"Even after losing half of his finger to a snake bite and seeing others die from bites during services," Coots "still believes he must take up serpents and follow the Holiness faith," the website says.
We were honored to be allowed such unique access to Pastor Jamie and his congregation during the course of our show, and give context to his method of worship.
On one episode, Coots, who collected snakes, is shown trying to wrest a Western diamondback out of its nook under a rock deep in East Texas.
"Catching two snakes the first day, 'course we'd hoped for more," Coots says in the video.
