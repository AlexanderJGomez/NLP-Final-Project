Partners in Google's mobile-phone venture were understandably skeptical when the Android maker said this summer that it planned to acquire one of their rivals, creating a potential reason to roll out improvements to its popular smartphone operating system on Motorola phones before offering them to others.
Then, when the company's intentions to buy Motorola surfaced, Google execs said they were mainly doing so in order to protect themselves and their partners against patent litigation.
Google led the market in the most recent quarter, thanks in part to wide adoption by many companies, with 43% of smartphone owners using Android phones, according to research firm Nielsen.
In the nearly three months since announcing a bid for Motorola, the strategy to remain a neutral player "has been clearly communicated to us by Google, and it makes sense," Uddenfeldt said in an interview.
Google has suggested that it plans to leverage Motorola's hardware expertise in order to understand how to integrate software more closely with hardware, Kevin Packingham, the senior vice president for Samsung Electronics products, said in an interview.
In the meantime, Motorola is laying off 800 of its 19,000 workers, and the company is preparing to launch the Droid Razr, the spiritual successor to one of the most popular phones of the last decade.
Samsung expects to continue to work with Google on some lead devices in the future, he said.
According to Packingham, Samsung was chosen for two of the three Nexus phones because of its hardware expertise and access to components, and there is no bidding involved in the lead-device program.
