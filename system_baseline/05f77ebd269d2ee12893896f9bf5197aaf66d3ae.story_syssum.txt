"Finally," Schigt remembers about his sojourn, which he spent surfing on the country's sunny Pacific coast, "I felt excited to get out of bed in the morning.
Within a month he'd quit his job, bought a slice of secluded beachfront property on Costa Rica's southern coast and opened the new business there that he still runs today: Kalon Surf School, which offers retreats for (among others) plenty of stressed-out business executives.
Get-fit getaway packages, which let us spend a few days rebooting and relearning healthy habits to incorporate into our busy lives.
But all approach the "reboot" experience differently, whether by leading participants through downward dogs on Mexico's Riviera Maya, biking (and tasting) through California wine country, or taking group swims in the warm, clear waters of the British Virgin Islands.
Take part in the Discover Miraval package here (for as many days/nights as you choose) and you'll see why: the healthful pursuits here range from daily yoga and meditation classes to private nutritional consultations to rock climbing up the granite crags of 7,000-foot Mount Lemmon, the highest point in the Santa Catalina Mountains.
You'll want to pack light when heading to Kalon's laid-back beachfront property, nestled between the bathtub-warm waters of the Pacific and the lush green Cordillera mountains—everything, even sunscreen, is provided for you here.
If crystal-blue oceans, emerald-green forests and sugary beaches sound more inspiring than a sweaty yoga studio, head south to Mexico's Riviera Maya for the Mind Body Adventure Week at Maya Tulum.
Après workout, you'll want to make time to visit the onsite spa, where desert botanicals and Utah honey are employed to ease your tired muscles.
From $1,120 for four days/three nights.
