In the early underwater scenes, when a robot-cam pokes around the wreck of the "Titanic," with Bill Paxton and his team of hipster techies hovering in anticipation, the ocean debris flies right out at the audience.
For the rest of Titanic 3D, he employs the technology in a ''subtle'' way: to heighten the images and lend them a bold sculptural clarity.
I recommend it, rather, for the opportunity to see, once again on the big screen, the only disaster film in history that can truly be called a work of art.
There are two ways that it now looks different -- and, if anything, they're both examples of how a movie can age almost karmically well.
It now speaks to a sense of entitlement that's on the rise in our world.
I mean that it's more potently clear than ever that the levels of dread and tragedy he packed into this movie cannot be consigned to some iconic historical event from 1912.
His Jack, who has nothing and therefore nothing to lose, lives every moment in a state of cat-eyed discovery.
The Titanic, that splendid vessel, is like the 20th century itself, launching forth in all its looming luxe and promise, with Jack as the symbolic new man on the rise -- the aristocrat of the spirit who uses his charm and talent to enter realms from which he would previously have been barred.
To watch "Titanic" again is to do nothing less than enter a movie and come out the other side, with one's spirit feeling just a little bit larger.
