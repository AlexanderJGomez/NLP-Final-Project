When New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg appeared at a news conference Wednesday without Lydia Callis at his side, fans of the sign-language interpreter immediately expressed their disappointment via Twitter.
Callis, 30, became an Internet sensation just three days earlier because of the dramatic facial expressions and body language she used to translate Bloomberg's dire warnings about the dangers coming with Superstorm Sandy.
When the mayor talked about falling trees, high winds, heavy rain and rising waters, Callis made sure her face, hands and body conveyed the urgency to those who could not hear.
As the mayor scolded two New Yorkers who had been arrested trying to surf the rolling waves of New York Harbor, calling it "just an outrage," the outrage was clear in her expression.
But Callis herself was staying out of the spotlight, apparently giving just one interview to DNAinfo.com reporter Jill Colvin, who tracked her down at the New York emergency management headquarters in Brooklyn on Wednesday.
The body language replaces the intonation others hear in a voice, she said.
She told Colvin that she began signing as a child for her deaf mother and three siblings.
But Wednesday afternoon, Callis was gone, replaced by another woman whom Bloomberg introduced at his news conference as Pat Mitchell.
"Bloomberg's new signer does her job fine, but she doesn't have panache of Lydia Callis, who signed with a New York accent.
The mayor's office, obviously with bigger matters to address, did not respond to CNN calls or e-mails about Callis and her replacement.
Callis earned a degree in American Sign Language from that school, which is part of the Rochester Institute of Technology, before moving to New York City last year, a school spokesman said.
