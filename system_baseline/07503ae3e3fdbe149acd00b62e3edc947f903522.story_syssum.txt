One day after Ai Weiwei was released on bail, the dissident artist remained at home, unable to speak with anyone about why he was detained or what awaits him now.
A group of journalists and supporters gathered at his home and studio, hoping to be able to speak to him.
It was not a customary answer from the provocative conceptual artist, renowned as a harsh, uncompromising critic of Chinese government policies.
But later Ai called for a boycott of the games because he said China was using them as propaganda.
Beijing police accused him of evading a "huge amount" of taxes, Xinhua reported in May, more than a month after he was detained.
Observers in Beijing said it may not be coincidental that Ai's release on Wednesday took place on the eve of Premier Wen Jiabao's upcoming visit to Hungary, Britain and Germany, where Ai enjoys wide support among artists and politicians.
Some Chinese netizens tried to camouflage their postings.
Under bail conditions, he has lost his freedom of speech, said Jerome Cohen, adjunct senior fellow for Asia studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Beijing police told state media that Ai had been released on bail because of his good attitude in confessing his alleged crimes and also said he was suffering from a chronic disease.
"A lot of the censorship that happens in China is self-censorship, and I think the fact that Weiwei doesn't engage in self-censorship is a big reason why people gravitate to him," said Klayman, whose feature film "Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry" is set to be released this fall.
