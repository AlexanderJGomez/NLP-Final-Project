The House of Lords, Britain's highest court, ruled in her favor on Thursday, ordering the country's director of public prosecutions to spell out the criteria under which it will seek to prosecute someone who helps another person commit suicide.
Purdy had been suing to force the British authorities to specify exactly when someone would be prosecuted for helping another person commit suicide.
The law doesn't make clear at what point a person has broken it -- whether it is illegal to sit with a person on the plane to the clinic, open the door of the car to the airport, or even help them arrange the trip.
"It is no part of our function to change the law in order to decriminalize assisted suicide," he wrote.
Before the ruling in her favor, she had said she would travel abroad on her own to die if she lost the case, so her husband would be sure not to face prosecution.
British and European courts refused to guarantee that the husband of Diane Pretty would not be prosecuted for helping her to travel abroad to end her life.
