The Band Perry joins a long list that includes the Jackson 5, the Bee Gees, the Pointer Sisters, even the Von Trapp Family Singers.
The band is a democracy, they said, but their mom holds two votes and plays referee.
1 on the country charts, headed over to the pop charts and went quadruple platinum after selling more than 4 million copies.
