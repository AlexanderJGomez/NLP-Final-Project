One particularly good new search result that Microsoft demoed, but which is not yet live, is for movies that are no longer playing in theaters.
Certainly, its rival Google has taken notice of Bing's visual splashiness -- and even disastrously tried to imitate the background images on its famously sparse search home page, only to cut short the trial within hours.
For instance, if you search for "how to quiet a baby" and one of your friends on Facebook has liked one of the articles that shows up in the search results, you will see their picture next to that result.
"Even if only a small percentage of queries have moments where the social graph informs and improves search results, it's a huge difference," Nadella said, adding that it is only the beginning of using social sites like Facebook to improve search.
Being in second place also lets Microsoft play with new visual approaches to search faster than Google can, as there are fewer users who will get upset when the location of a link moves.
But Microsoft showed today they are still in the lucrative search game, even if they aren't making money at it yet, and if you haven't used Bing in recent months, it's definitely worth giving it another test spin.
