It has provided an ideal case study for disaster relief, and an Oxfam report, published today, examines the lessons that have been learned, as well as areas that the humanitarian relief sector still needs to improve upon.
Oxfam says the response to the humanitarian catastrophe was the "largest-ever privately funded response," with private donations making up 40% of all money raised -- an impressive $5.4 billion, which came close to matching government donations of $6.4 billion.
"All the things that come together to ensure that people do connect were all there -- it was a natural disaster (as opposed to a man-made humanitarian crisis), it was enormous, completely unexpected," she said.
But the speed and level of funding for the disaster was unprecedented, and in itself almost overwhelming; like other nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), Oxfam soon halted fundraising for the disaster, urging the public to donate to other, less-well publicized emergencies by mid-January 2005.
The tsunami was one of the first disasters to be extensively captured on camera, and the extent of media coverage makes a sizable difference to the public -- and governments -- opening their wallets, Oxfam says.
Oxfam's report also highlights the importance of coordination; in 2004, the lack of a unified plan meant that efforts were scattergun, and often involved NGO workers operating outside of their main areas of expertise.
While the idea of a repeat of a natural disaster of this magnitude is unsettling, it is heartening to know that the lessons of 2004 have been digested and those aid-givers better equipped as a result.
