(CNN) -- As water levels already at or above flood stage continue rising in rivers in southwestern Louisiana, the weather forecast says more rain is on the way.
Many rivers in the southwest, closer to Texas, where flooding has been prominent, are still rising and expected to crest over the weekend.
The National Weather Service said at least two EF-1 tornadoes struck Thursday, one of which damaged 50 homes in St. Martin Parish.
The heavy rainfall accompanies a broad warming trend covering the southeastern United States and reaching into the Midwest, according to the weather service.
2012 was the warmest year on record for the contiguous 48 states of the United States, according to the National Weather Service.
Cold weather should return soon, giving the country a normal start into 2013, he said.
