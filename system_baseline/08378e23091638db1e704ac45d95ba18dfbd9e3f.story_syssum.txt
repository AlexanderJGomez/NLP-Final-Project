Facebook and Google have added new translation tools, but they take different approaches.
Facebook Inc. and Google Inc. are two Web companies trying particularly hard to make this happen, and they've released a number of updates to their translation services in recent weeks.
But for now, here's a look at the latest language features from both companies, and some background on how their translation services work.

At least another 30 languages are in the works, meaning Facebook needs help working out the kinks on those languages before they're put to use.
Pros and cons: People are good at knowing idioms and slang, so Facebook tends to get these right, but there are limited numbers of multi-lingual volunteers who want to spend time helping Facebook translate things.
How it works: Google's computers learn how to be translators by examining text that's already on the Web, and from professional Web translations posted online, said Franz Och, a principal scientist at Google.
The site's interface has been translated, with the help of Google users, into 130 languages.
Google also recently unveiled a translation service for Google Docs, which lets anyone upload a document to the Web and have it translated into a number of languages for free.
Och said real-time translation of Internet chats is on the horizon, as are more languages and increased quality as Google's computers get smarter.
Also, Google lets people spot translation errors, suggest new wordings and translate its interface into languages Google's computers don't speak just yet.
