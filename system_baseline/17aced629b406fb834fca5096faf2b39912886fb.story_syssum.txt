Central Falls, Rhode Island (CNN) -- Graduates of the nation's most vilified high school descended upon campus Tuesday evening to support the school's fired teachers.
A firestorm has erupted in this Democratic stronghold in recent weeks after 93 teachers, support staff and administrators at Central Falls High School were fired for the low performance of the school, which graduated just 48 percent of its seniors last year.
Obama weighed in last week, endorsing the actions of the local board.
They expressed outrage and disbelief that the school they attended has become a national pariah.
The defenders of the school say improvements have been made, but the stats are skewed against them because the school's population is so transient.
However, the meeting was abruptly called off, because the Governor's Commission on Disabilities said the school's auditorium was unfit for people with disabilities.
The president "hasn't heard our side of the story," said McLaughlin, a member of the teachers' union.
She called for an independent mediator to intervene at Central Falls because tensions have gotten so high between the union and the school administrators who carried out the firings.
She noted the school didn't graduate half its seniors last year.
As darkness fell at the school, the graduates who had come back said the problems at the school have been oversimplified and that the rest of the nation can't understand the importance of the teachers in the tough environment they live.
Now, many here wonder what the legacy of the school will be next.
