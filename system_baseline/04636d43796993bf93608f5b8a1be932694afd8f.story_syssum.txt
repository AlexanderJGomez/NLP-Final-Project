Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thailand's prime minister huddled with the chiefs of the country's armed forces early Friday after a string of grenade attacks killed at least one person and wounded dozens of others in the already-tense capital.
Across the barricades, the Red Shirts were playing music and trying to encourage a festive atmosphere.
Thursday's explosions took place near an elevated train station where the Red Shirts are gathered, said Col. Sansern Kaewkumnerd, spokesman for the Center for Resolutions under Emergency Situation.
Abhisit declared a state of emergency April 7, hours after anti-government demonstrators stormed the country's parliament.
The ruling still must be reviewed by the country's attorney general's office and its Constitution Court, but if it stands, the 64-year-old party will be broken up, and Abhisit and its other senior leaders will be banned from politics for five years.
