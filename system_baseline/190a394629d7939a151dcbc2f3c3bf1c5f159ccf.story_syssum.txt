The Los Angeles coroner's office said Monday that it would abide by a request from the police department to keep Jackson's cause and manner of death confidential.
On Monday, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff delayed for a week his decision on whether to approve several contracts for the Jackson's estate to give the children's new lawyer -- whom he will appoint -- time to weigh in on the deals.
The judge has already approved a contract to allow Columbia Pictures to use video that AEG Live shot of Jackson's last rehearsals for a documentary due out this fall.
Katherine Jackson's lawyers, while endorsing the movie deal, have objected to terms given to AEG, saying it is too generous to the company.
Jermaine Jackson, Michael Jackson's older brother, told CNN's Larry King last week that he likes the deals, which he said could bring in nearly $100 million into the estate.
Katherine Jackson was appointed last week as the guardian for the children, but she was not made the guardian for their interest in her son's estate.
