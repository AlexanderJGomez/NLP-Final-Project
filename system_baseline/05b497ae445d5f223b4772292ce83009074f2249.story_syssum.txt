Guido Bertolaso, the head of the Italian Civil Protection Department said that there is a 20 to 30 percent chance the river could break its banks and cause disruption in some neighborhoods in northern Rome, but not in the historic city center.
"I just recommend people to stay at home and not to rush to the river banks to watch the river swelling," Alemanno said.
Because of the intense rain, the streets of some northern Rome neighborhoods were already flooded by water and covered in thick brown mud.
The body of a second victim was found in the southern region of Calabria after a bridge collapsed.
