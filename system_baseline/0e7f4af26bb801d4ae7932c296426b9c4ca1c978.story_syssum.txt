In an interview that aired Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press," Obama said he "should have anticipated the optics" because "part of the job is the theater of it," conceding "it's not something that comes naturally" to him.
"After having talked to the families, where it was hard for me to hold back tears listening to the pain that they were going through," he said, "I think everybody who knows me -- including, I suspect, the press -- understands that ... you take this stuff in.
And the part of what I'd love is the vacation from the press."
"There are days where I'm not getting enough sleep, because we've got a lot on our plate," he said.
