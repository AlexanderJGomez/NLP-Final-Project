As a nation grieves over the three people killed in the bombings, the scores injured and a police officer who lost his life during the search for suspects, members of the Tsarnaev family have gone on record to express their feelings about the possible guilt or innocence of the pair.
"You tell me, my son never would keep it in secret," she said.
"Someone framed them," Anzor Tsarnaev said while the manhunt was being conducted.
After being told by ABC News on Friday that his youngest son had been captured alive, the elder Tsarnaev reportedly began to weep and had this message for his child: "Tell police everything.
Alina Tsarnaeva told The (Newark, New Jersey) Star-Ledger that she had not seen her brothers "in a long time" but spoke lovingly of Tamerlan.
After the death of Tamerlan and as authorities continued to hunt his younger brother, their uncle Ruslan Tsarni spoke passionately at a news conference Friday outside his Montgomery County, Maryland, home.
He said he was still in a "state of shock" but expressed happiness that his younger nephew had been captured alive and said his elder nephew had fallen prey to outside influences, according to a family acquaintance.
"If somebody wants to convince me, show me evidence," she said, telling reporters Friday she is studying to become a lawyer.
At times seeming almost combative during a press conference, she said it would take much more than photos to convince her that her nephews had committed such a crime.
Our hearts are sickened by the knowledge of the horror he has inflicted.
