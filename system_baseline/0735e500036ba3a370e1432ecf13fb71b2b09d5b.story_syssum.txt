This contrast is fittingly emblematic of two great visionaries of computer science, Marvin Minsky and J.C.R.
In Licklider's view, human intelligence should be complemented by machines, not replaced: "Men will set the goals, formulate the hypotheses, determine the criteria and perform the evaluations.
Computing machines will do the routinizable work that must be done to prepare the way for insights and decisions.
It's easy to argue that life and death decisions should never be left to machines, but Licklider's vision was much broader, recognizing technology as an enabler for many human capacities.
The tension between the Minsky and Licklider visions has certainly been amplified in the age of so-called big data.
The high-value targets in big data are invariably human: highly adaptive adversaries such as terrorists and cybercriminals whose ingenuity frustrates even the most advanced algorithms.
When U.S. intelligence tracked down Osama bin Laden, it was a function of brilliant, resourceful people asking questions and testing hypotheses using a variety of technologies.
Cyber security might always be an uphill, defensive struggle as techniques and technologies raise the stakes on both sides.
Aspiring good guys must be absolutely relentless in refining the intersection of brainpower and computing power, each of which is vulnerable in isolation.
Through rapid iteration, a group of determined people using low-friction technology had created a vast, self-regulating system.
