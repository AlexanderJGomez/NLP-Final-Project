If it is al-Baghdadi, it would be one of the first known appearances of the militant leader to be captured on video.
In the video, the man purported to be al-Baghdadi urges people to follow his call to create a "caliphate," an Islamic state, in Iraq and Syria, and wage "jihad" during Ramadan -- the holy month of fasting for Muslims that began last week.
Al-Baghdadi's appearance comes days after ISIS declared him as the leader of its new "caliphate," or Islamic state, extending from Aleppo in northeastern Syria to the Diyala province in Iraq.
Al-Baghdadi was never identified by name, only as "the emir of the believers," according to a woman who was at the mosque when he arrived.
The men who got out of the vehicles were chanting "Allahu Akbar" (God is great) as they walked in.
Bara'a was sitting on the second floor of the mosque, an area designated for women to gather during the sermon.
Very little is known about al-Baghdadi, but a biography posted on jihadist websites last year said he earned a doctorate in Islamic studies from a university in Baghdad.
