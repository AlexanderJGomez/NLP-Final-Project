On Saturday, it was City who found themselves two goals down after West Ham's French midfielder Morgan Amalfitano opened the scoring in the 21st minute before Diafra Sakho netted again with 15 minutes remaining.
Jose Mourniho's side will extend their advantage to eight points over City if they beat Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday.

Bremen are without a win this season and are currently anchored to the foot of the table with four points from nine matches.
At the business end, Hoffenheim move up to second after a 1-0 win over Paderborn while Leverkusen's 1-0 victory over Schalke lifts Roger Schmidt's side to fourth.
Bayern Munich will go six points clear at the top of the table if they beat Borussia Monchengladbach on Sunday.
