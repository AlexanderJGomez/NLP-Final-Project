Bones were unearthed during a seven-month search at an ex-detention post in La Plata, Argentina, officials said.
A team of six professional anthropologists and support crew said it believed the remains were human, but it was unable to determine how many bodies the fragments represented.
The bone fragments in Argentina were unearthed during a seven-month search at the former detention post in the city of La Plata, near Buenos Aires.
In 25 years of searching, this was the first time that human remains were found at a former detention center, said Luis Fondebrider, president of the EAAF.
"The possibilities of identifying some of these remains is low because of the state they are in," Fondebrider said.
