Chris Cornell's new solo album, "Scream," was produced by Timbaland.
"It's actually created an environment where I can answer simple questions that someone's probably had forever," said Cornell.
His new solo album, "Scream," has him meshing his rock vibe with dance-floor beats by the much sought-after producer Timbaland.
Nine Inch Nails lead singer Trent Reznor took a swipe by twittering: "You know that feeling you get when somebody embarrasses themselves so badly YOU feel uncomfortable?
"You could kind of see it coming," he said.
For Cornell, working with Timbaland required him to "rinse away everything that I knew about songwriting and recording."
"I think this is as good as any album I've ever made, and I listen to it probably more than any other record I've ever made."
If I had a musical identity that was definable then it would be time to get into painting or something else.
Cornell: He didn't really have a particular direction in mind in terms of what he wanted me to do.
It defies genre, and yet it's very much a song-oriented album as well as an album-oriented album.
When I'm out on the road, depending on the day, a couple times a day I'll spend a half-hour or an hour or so.
CNN: I read a couple of your tweets, and you said that you were having trouble sleeping.
I think everybody has a hard time when you play ... [a] show and then you're finished at 1:30 in the morning.
There's some aspect to timing and luck, there's talent obviously as well.
So we sort of did it as kind of a ritualistic, "OK, let's participate in the real thing."
