A day after becoming the first player since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win the first three majors of the season, Park is not concerned by the presence of five women's majors this year.
"I felt the pressure because I was going for three in a row and everything that was going on was very crazy -- but once I got on the course, I was very calm," she said.
Winning a fifth major in the season, with the Evian Championship taking place in September, would represent a milestone in the history of golf.
The Seoul-born golfer won her first major in 2008 at the U.S. Women's Open but had to wait until earlier this year to add that success.
