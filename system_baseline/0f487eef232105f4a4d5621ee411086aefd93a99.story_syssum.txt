If snowboarders were the Olympics' introduction to a younger, hipper, "slacker" generation of competitors, the next wave of adrenaline junkies has taken it back to the new old school.

With Gus Kenworthy and Nick Goepper winning silver and bronze, it was a historic moment -- the U.S. had previously achieved such a clean sweep of medals on just two occasions: the 2002 men's halfpipe snowboard competition, and the 1956 men's individual figure skating singles.
All the competitors look relaxed as if they were hanging out with their friends on the slopes of their backyard ski resort -- which is not so far-fetched, given they train together and meet at events several times a month.
Their main event, the X Games, is all about showing off new tricks in fairly relaxed, showbiz atmosphere.
The 22-year-old Swede might not have made it up on the podium, but he definitely garnered plenty of attention with his very, very low-cut pants -- which, by the end of his run, revealed much of his colorful underwear.
"I think the president of the IOC should be Johnny Knoxville, because basically, this stuff is just 'Jackass' stuff that they invented and called Olympic sports," commentator Bob Costas said on NBC said before the Games began, referring to the comedic daredevil who was known for crashing into things.
"We've been able to really customize and drill down where we can have the greatest impact," Alan Ashley, the USOC's chief of sport performance, told the Washington Post.
