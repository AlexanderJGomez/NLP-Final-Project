The goal instigated a frenzied period of Italian pressure which eventually told when referee Carlos Batres awarded a penalty after defender Tommy Smith tugged at Daniele De Rossi's shirt in the Kiwi's penalty area.
The stalemate continued, but New Zealand's Chris Wood could have won it for the All Whites in the 83rd minute when he shot narrowly wide of Federico Marchetti's left post.
A win against Slovakia would ensure qualification, but they must rely on New Zealand getting a result against Paraguay to have any chance of topping their group.
"It's an incredible result and it's way above anything we have achieved before against the stature of our competitors," New Zealand's coach Ricki Herbert said, AFP reported.
The result leaves Slovakia needing to beat Italy in their final group match this Thursday to have any chance of progressing to the next round.
Santa Cruz turned provider in the second half, breaking down the left past Slovakia's Vladimir Weiss in the 72nd minute.
Weiss went close for Slovakia in injury time, but he and his team toiled fruitlessly in search of a goal for most of the game while Paraguay, who with Santa Cruz, Nelson Haedo Valdez and Barrios had class to spare in midfield.
