By contrast, in most people's eyes, those who are normal only need to work hard and they will have at least a good career.
Without passion, no one can fully express their talent or define who they are.
Often others seem to just trip over their passion as they move into adulthood.
But notice that some who pursue a childhood or family "interest" do so only as a convenient default choice.
Some will simply not commit the time and energy to a search that can often be frustrating.
Those who search and find their passion place themselves in intensely stimulating environments, and stay there until the job is done.
But you cannot just read, talk or experience.
You must be constantly saying to yourself about whatever book, fact, argument, person or experience is at hand: Why?
Recognize the superficiality implied by those words and by our impatient, thoughtless world.
Or you find yourself in a regular conversation, and you start talking with excitement about an idea.
Even with a passion identified, there is a common pitfall.
Never take conventional wisdom as anything other than folklore, to be tested against your logic and experiences.
