But the Washington Post got out ahead of him, obtaining the emails through a public records request and publishing them late Tuesday.
On one of his top issues, for example, Bush received a "daily immigration update."
As staffers exchanged emails about vacation time, Bush suggested that "you guys h that you guys have a verbal conversation about it rather than create a public document.
Have a nice day," Bush said, throwing in a smiley face.
In the email, Hoffman encourages Bush to support a campaign finance reform law working its way through the Florida legislature, but the governor balks, explaining that he's only in favor of "campaign finance reform that doesn't put us at a disadvantage."
And the bill in question, "would do just that," Bush wrote.
He received one email branding him as "NO CONSERVATIVE" and regularly took flak from activists who wanted more right-leaning policies out of the governor's mansion, according to the Post.
