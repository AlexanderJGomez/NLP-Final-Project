Most of America first saw his face and learned his name Thursday, when Las Vegas police announced the 19-year-old's arrest in connection to what they called a road rage incident February 12 that ended with a mother of four mortally wounded by a gunshot.
It has a clear theme, though, with the majority of pictures showing marijuana in its various forms and some of the teenager seemingly smoking it.
It's not clear how any of his past led to Nowsch's arrest Thursday, one week after his neighbor Tammy Meyers was shot.
Erich Nowsch spent Friday in the Clark County Detention Center on charges of murder, attempted murder and discharging a gun from a vehicle in a prohibited area.
But they believe it was Nowsch who shot Tammy Meyers soon after she'd gotten out of her car outside her Las Vegas home, about a block from his own home.
The mother and son then drove away and tracked down a man thought to be Nowsch, only to lose sight of him.
The son told police that he and his mother were fired upon, and he shot back.
That was the extent of what authorities knew about the back-and-forth between Nowsch and Tammy Meyers until Thursday, according to Las Vegas police Capt.
"She told him to pull his pants up and to be a man," Robert Meyers added.
