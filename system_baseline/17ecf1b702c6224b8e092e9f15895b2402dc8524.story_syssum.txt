(Travel + Leisure) -- Eight centuries ago, Marco Polo anointed Hangzhou "the most splendid city in the world."
All 72 spacious suites and villas are decorated with Chinese antiques (porcelain snuff bottles; calligraphy brushes) and are scattered across the grounds like a traditional village, complete with arched bridges and a lagoon.
Also facing the lake, the Hyatt Regency's atmospheric, antiques-filled 28 Hubin Road (dinner for two $66) serves classic Hangzhou fare, such as beggar's chicken and Dongpo rou -- a fork-tender pork dish named after the city's 11th-century poet Su Dongpo.
Tea fanatics might head to Old Dragon Well Imperial Tea Garden to pay homage to the 18 bushes set aside for the Ch'ing dynasty emperor Qianlong.
A short stroll from the train station, pedestrianized Hefang Road is a collection of Ch'ing dynasty houses (and replicas nearby).
Getting There: Hangzhou is a 100-minute train ride from Shanghai; express trains launching next month will take 38 minutes.
