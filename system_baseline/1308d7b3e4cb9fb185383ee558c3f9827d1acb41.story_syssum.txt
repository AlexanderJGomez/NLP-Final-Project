The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently released data showing just how common and costly STIs are in the United States, especially for America's youth.
While the vast majority of HPV infections will not cause serious harm, some infections will persist and can lead to cervical cancer.
Young women are biologically more susceptible to STIs, and many young people may be reluctant to disclose their risk behavior to a doctor, because of embarrassment, stigma or concerns about confidentiality.
Annual gonorrhea screening is also recommended for sexually active women with new or multiple sex partners and women who live in communities with a high burden of the disease.
To increase the early diagnosis and treatment of STIs, CDC is reaching out to health care providers and young people at risk throughout the nation with messages about the importance of screening.
Parents and caregivers need to open the door for frank, honest discussions with their children about STIs and behaviors that can place them at risk.
With increased awareness, prevention, testing and treatment we can bring this hidden epidemic into the spotlight and safeguard the health of young people while saving the nation billions of dollars in the process.
