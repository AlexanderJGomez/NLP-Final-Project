It's Huawei.
At company headquarters in Shenzhen in southern China, I talked to Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei's Consumer Business Group.
The market priority for Huawei's Consumer Business Group is China, followed by Europe and Japan.
Despite the trust issues and the fact that many Americans can't even pronounce the name of the company, Huawei has sold and will continue to sell its phones in America under the Huawei brand.
My colleague Dayu Zhang in Beijing offered this on-the-ground Chinese consumer perspective: "To me and my friends, Huawei is more like a brand of low-end, cheap smartphones.
Huawei has a reputation for making smartphones that are just good enough.
"We have the ambition to be the best -- to have the best products and be the best solution provider."
And that's the question Huawei has its designs on.
