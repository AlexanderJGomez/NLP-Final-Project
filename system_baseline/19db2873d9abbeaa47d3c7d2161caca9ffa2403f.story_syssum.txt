On a freezing cold Sunday in the north of England, around 14 kilometers from Manchester, Oldham produced one of the greatest results in its recent history to defeat the seven time FA Cup winners.
First, Smith took advantage of some awful goalkeeping by Brad Jones to fire home his second with Reece Wabara heading Oldham into a 3-1 lead just minutes after the interval.
It was that year which also saw Oldham relegated from the Premier League -- a division which the club has not been able to return to since.
Brentford, which is less than 10 kilometers from its illustrious west London rival, had taken the lead twice, only for Chelsea to snatch an 83rd minute equalizer through $80 million striker Fernando Torres.
Leeds, which was relegated from the top-flight in 2004, now faces an away game at Premier League champion Manchester City.
Meanwhile, Luton Town, which became the first non-league side to ever beat a Premier League team following the 1-0 win at Norwich on Saturday, will play first-tier Millwall in the next round.
