But she never gave up, and she continuously reminded herself to keep going.
One of the reasons Dumig decided to photograph Sahra is because growing up in Germany made Dumig realize that she lived a fortunate lifestyle.
"Apart Together" serves not only as a documentation of Sahra, but as a far-reaching story about people from all backgrounds.
The underlying themes of "Apart Together" include the feelings of isolation and "otherness" and the search for a valuable human dignity.
"But they are a person, they are people with emotions and lives."
The photos are powerful because of this symbolic nature, as there are infinite interpretations attached to each one.
"Apart Together" allowed Dumig to share various special moments with Sahra, and they were both able to learn from each other.
Ines Dumig is a photographer based in Germany.
