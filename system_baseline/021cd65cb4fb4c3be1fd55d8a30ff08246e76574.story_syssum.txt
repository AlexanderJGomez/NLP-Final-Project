Police believe six to eight people were involved in the homicides, which occurred in the couple's home in Beulah, west of Pensacola, near the Alabama state line.
Coldiron and the younger Gonzalez face charges of murder, robbery and residential home invasion; the elder Gonzalez faces charges of evidence tampering for allegedly trying to disguise a vehicle spotted at the home.
Authorities released two surveillance tapes taken from the front and rear of the Billingses' home.
Investigators believe one motive in the deaths was robbery, but "we believe there are other motives," Morgan said.
Nine of the couple's children were home at the time of the incident, Morgan said, and police believe three of them saw the intruders.
One of the first three arrested is believed to be the mastermind behind the crime, Morgan said, but would not say which one.
"It leads me to believe that this was a very well-planned and methodical operation," Morgan said.
Asked whether the suspects entered the home planning to kill the couple, Morgan said authorities do not know.
Markham said earlier the family does not know any of the three suspects.
