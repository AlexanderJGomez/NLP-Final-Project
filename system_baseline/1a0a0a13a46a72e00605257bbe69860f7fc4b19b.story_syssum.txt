A statement from the Saudi Ministry of Health said one of three new cases was a 21-year-old man who died after being admitted into intensive care this week.
The other two cases, according to the health ministry, were in Saudi Arabia's eastern governorate of Al-Ahsa, where most cases of the disease have appeared.
This is considered "a positive step to follow-up the development and mutation of the virus over the time, meanwhile, helping in the diagnostic steps, and to find out a quick mechanism of diagnoses," the ministry said.
Releasing the genetic sequences from four more patients and making them publicly available is essential for allowing researchers around the world to study this emerging disease.
While the overall number of cases is limited, MERS has been fatal in more than half of patients, according to the WHO.
But the international organization called for caution, saying it is possible for the virus to move around the world.
