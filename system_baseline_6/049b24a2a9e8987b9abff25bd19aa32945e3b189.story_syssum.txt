Washington (CNN) -- A week after the Supreme Court ruled in favor of an Ohio law that restricts early voting, Attorney General Eric Holder argued the decision will disproportionately affect African-Americans, many of whom "heavily" use early voting.
A federal judge had previously said the law was unconstitutional and placed a hold on it so it couldn't go into effect.
In his video message, Holder said early voting is "heavily used" by African-Americans because the practice is popular among people who have a hard time getting to the polls due to childcare responsibilities, hourly salaries, and reduced access to transportation.
