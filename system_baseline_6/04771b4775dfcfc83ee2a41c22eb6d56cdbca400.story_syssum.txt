The Rio state government requested the army occupation after a series of attacks against police posts.
The troops will remain until at least July 31, after the World Cup ends, Escoto said.
Unlike many of the favelas that cling to the hills near Rio's picturesque beaches, the Complexo da Mare is a sprawling, mostly flat shantytown that combines 15 different neighborhoods in the city's smoggy north zone.
The resurgence in violence in some of the favelas already pacified has raised alarms in a city that will host many of the 600,000 international fans attending the World Cup.
In the Complexo da Mare, Escoto said the military will have everything under control.
"Rio de Janeiro will be prepared for the World Cup," he added, before his aides whisked him off, part of their policy never to let their top commander stay in one place for long in hostile territory.
