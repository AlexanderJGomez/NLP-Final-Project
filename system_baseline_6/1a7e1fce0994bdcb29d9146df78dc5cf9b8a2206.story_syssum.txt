"In hindsight, many of the expenses that were incurred at the 2010 conference should be been more closely scrutinized or not incurred at all," said Fink, a 32-year IRS veteran.
The panel's ranking Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, berated Fink for wasting the money of people who earn less in a year than the cost of the "Star Trek" parody video.
Despite the public displays of outrage by legislators, Issa and Cummings conceded that such wasteful IRS spending on conferences and travel no longer occurred due to government reforms.
In his report on the conference spending made public on Tuesday, Treasury Inspector General J. Russell George said the IRS spent taxpayer dollars on everything from event planners' commissions to speakers' fees to guest prizes to parody videos.
He wondered out loud how many IRS workers involved in the improper targeting could have benefited from better training and more staff paid for by the money spent instead on the Anaheim conference.
In the inspector general report last month, an IRS unit that handles applications for tax-exempt status was found to be using criteria that included conservative labels such as "tea party" to target groups for extra questioning.
