Jamie Hein has asked the commission to reverse its initial ruling that found she violated the Ohio Civil Rights Act by putting up a sign that read "Public Swimming Pool, White Only" at her Cincinnati duplex.
Hein said she received the sign from a friend and posted it in early May, the summary says.
He said he never confronted Hein about the matter, but has no doubt that the sign was intended for his daughter.
