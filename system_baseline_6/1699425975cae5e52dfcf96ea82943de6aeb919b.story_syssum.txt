LONDON, England (CNN) -- An American professor doing research in London stumbled across a series of previously unknown letters written by, to, and about Benjamin Franklin, a stunning find that sheds new light on early U.S. history.
"The first item was a letter from Benjamin Franklin to the secretary of the governor of Maryland, and I looked at it and I started to read, and I thought, 'This doesn't look familiar,'" Houston told CNN.
Houston had been working at the time on a book on Franklin, "Benjamin Franklin and the Politics of Improvement," published last year.
Franklin went all over Pennsylvania trying to persuade farmers to lend their horses and wagons to Braddock and his men.
Houston said he believes the documents he read at the British Library are copies of that collection.
Birch and Franklin were friends in London, both members of the Royal Society, and Houston said he believes the copies were made sometime between 1757 and 1758.
"We're very pleased."
