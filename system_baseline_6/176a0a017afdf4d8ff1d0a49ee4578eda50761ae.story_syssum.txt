An iPhone app called BeautyMeter was pulled from the app store after a nude photo surfaced.
"Apple will not distribute applications that contain inappropriate content, such as pornography," an Apple company spokesman said at the time.
It would be impossible for Apple or developers to keep all potentially objectionable material out of the app store, since much of the content is submitted by users, he said.
Joshua Topolsky, editor in chief of Engadget, a technology blog, said the impossibility of policing all app store content should free Apple from some blame.
The mysterious approval process frustrates app developers and could lead some to turn away from Apple and move on to other phones, said Jared Brown, an app developer.
Apple has said it approves 96 percent of submitted iPhone apps.
"I think they've really cultivated that."
