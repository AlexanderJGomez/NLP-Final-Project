(CNN) -- When I think of Gloria Steinem approaching 80, I think about the women of my generation, growing up at the end of the Baby Boom.
And when I looked at the larger world, I found that men were the leaders of countries, companies, churches, schools -- although the teachers were mostly women.
Letty Cottin Pogrebin wrote about the insidious ways that women compete with other women.
Gloria's words rang in my head when I challenged the status quo for girls in high school.
"Gender roles are policed," Gloria taught us.
Other times it is subtle, but it can be just as effective.
When we have children, people double down on the pressure for women to conform.
Women pressure other women about work and family, a phenomenon that has continued well past the "mommy wars" of the 1980s.
If Gloria had been her editor, we might have seen a different headline: "Why Parents Still Can't Have It All ... and How to Raise Everyone's Consciousness About It."
"A feminist is anyone who recognizes the equality and full humanity of women and men," Gloria taught us.
