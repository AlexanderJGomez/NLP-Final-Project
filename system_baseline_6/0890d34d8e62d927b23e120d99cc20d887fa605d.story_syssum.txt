Her new job will be another first in Napolitano's career: She was the first woman valedictorian at the University of Santa Clara; the first woman to be elected governor of Arizona by popular vote; first woman to head the mammoth, sprawling and unwieldy Department of Homeland Security.
Napolitano knows how to herd cats.
Napolitano is not a limelight-seeker.
It was to focus on getting rid of criminals and threats to national security, while understanding that immigrants -- like her own Italian family -- have contributed much to this nation's prosperity and security.
Janet Napolitano is also one of the warmest and most caring individuals I know.
Napolitano has done exemplary work at the Department of Homeland Security, most of it away from the spotlight.
I suspect that as the administration looks to replace her, it will begin to grasp how much it will miss her.
