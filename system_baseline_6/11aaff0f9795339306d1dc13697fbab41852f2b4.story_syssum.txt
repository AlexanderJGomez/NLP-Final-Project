It is 10 years after the invasion of Iraq, and images of Iraqi women from various political parties are filling the streets of Baghdad ahead of April's local elections -- a sign to casual observers that women's equality is on track in this war-ravaged country.
And while both women and men suffered as a result, the impact on women was greater due to their limited mobility in the face of poor security.
Violence against women -- and the lack of legal protection for women -- is also on the rise.
Ten years later, Iraqi women find themselves the subjects of a story that does not have a happy ending.
But despite the challenges that face them, some Iraqi women continue to stand up for women's rights.
