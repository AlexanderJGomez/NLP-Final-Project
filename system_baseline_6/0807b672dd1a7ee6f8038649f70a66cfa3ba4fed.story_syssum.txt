(CNN) -- Liangqiao, a small collection of huts and farms in southern China, is known as a cancer village.
Jingjing Zhang, an environmental lawyer who is working the villagers who want to sue the government, said the Dabaoshan mine has been polluting the Hengshui River for decades.
Pollution is a serious problem throughout China.
CNN talked to the mine's director who acknowledged environmental issues with the mine, but said it wasn't a problem that could be solved overnight.
Water tests from Huanan Agricultural University have concluded the Hengshui is indeed too toxic for any human use, in stark contrast to what Jingjing said the government told the villagers.
China is trying to address its pollution problem.
She said that after he got cancer he was unable to work and he reluctantly went for medical treatment.
