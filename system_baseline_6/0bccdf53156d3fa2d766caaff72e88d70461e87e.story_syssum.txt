But these wrist gadgets are nothing new.
LG and Samsung gave that category a whirl late last decade, but the devices were way too expensive and not nearly as functional as a traditional smartphone.
Tablets were nothing new when Apple introduced the iPad in 2010.
It seems like the public is finally ready to accept smartwatches the way they accepted Apple's iPad.
We weren't ready for smartwatches before, but now that smartphones are so ingrained in our lives, Apple and others appear smart to give wearable tech another chance.
