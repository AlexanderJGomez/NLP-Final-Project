Washington (CNN) -- Ten years after the September 11th attacks, the nation still isn't fully prepared to handle another huge disaster, Lee Hamilton, one of the co-chairmen of the 9/11 Commission, said Thursday.
Tom Ridge, the first secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said competing measures to deal with the problem are being considered by the House and Senate, while police and fire departments are waiting for some kind of action.
"We're sending mixed signals as far as what Congress wants in the area of homeland security, and this fragmentation, to me, is inviting, if not disaster, certainly it's preventing law enforcement and the intelligence agencies from doing the job to the maximum," King said.
"Luck is not a strategy," he said, warning that the United States must adapt to detect the evolving tactics of terrorists.
