Earlier Thursday, Kellogg Co. said it will not renew Phelps' advertising contract.
Norwitz said Kellogg's relationship with Phelps began with the company's support of the U.S. Olympic team.
On Thursday, before the decisions by USA Swimming and Kellogg were announced, Phelps told CNN affiliate WBAL that the incident was a result of "bad judgment."
The U.S. Olympic Committee also issued a statement that said in part: "Michael has acknowledged that he made a mistake and apologized for his actions.
He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 18 months probation.
