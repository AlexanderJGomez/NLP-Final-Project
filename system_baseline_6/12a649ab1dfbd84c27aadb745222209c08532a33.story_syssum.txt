(CNN) -- The arrest of drug kingpin Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman is a monumental moment in the world's war on drugs.
Guzman, 56, is the drug kingpin extraordinaire.
Guzman had been caught once before by Mexican authorities, in 2001, but he escaped from a high-security Mexican prison.
Guzman's drug operation is believed to have penetrated not just all of the Americas, but Europe, Australia and west Africa as well, according to the West Point report.
That helped Mexican authorities and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents hunting Guzman gain confidence in recent weeks that they could arrest him.
"This would be a significant blow to the overall operations not only in the Americas, but Chapo Guzman had expanded to Europe.
The United States doesn't want to see Guzman escape again.
That official was referring to Guzman's extradition to the United States.
