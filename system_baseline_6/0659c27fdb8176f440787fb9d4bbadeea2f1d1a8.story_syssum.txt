Thirty-six officers from the Tucson, Arizona, Police Department are in Pittsburgh as part of the G-20 security force.
"There's a standardization in training," Tucson Lt. Paul Sayre said.
The additional help protecting downtown locations "gives Pittsburgh the flexibility to send its officers where needed," Sayre said.
