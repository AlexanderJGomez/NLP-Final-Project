President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi's resignation Thursday came after Houthi rebels kidnapped his chief of staff, seized control of key government buildings in the capital, Sanaa, and failed to abide by provisions of a tentative peace deal hammered out Wednesday.
"This really creates a situation where even if the Houthis keep control over Sanaa, they have little chance of taking control of the whole country," said Al Rowas.
But that seems unlikely at present.
Despite their takeover of Sanaa, it's unclear whether the Houthis really want to take charge of the country.
They've been at war with the central government for the best part of a decade and are also fighting the Sunni AQAP.
The Houthis have more recently forged an alliance with supporters of former President Saleh, said Al Rowas.
While in power, Hadi and the government of Prime Minister Khaled Bahah have been trying to fight AQAP on the ground and also have authorized U.S. drone strikes in the country against terror targets.
The Houthis have publicly said they oppose U.S. drone strikes and U.S. involvement in Yemen.
Al-Hamdani, the Yemen analyst, said she didn't see an immediate need to pull U.S. personnel out of Yemen.
Since Hadi's resignation, there has been a lot of anger against the Houthis in parts of the country, said Al Rowas, the IHS Country Risk analyst.
