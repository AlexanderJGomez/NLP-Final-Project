Sri Lankan army chief Sarath Fonseka says a key Tamil town has been taken in a national TV broadcast Sunday.
The rebels gained control over Mullaittivu in 1996 and established a military garrison there, according to the government.
The re-capture enabled the government to use a highway linking the mainland to the peninsula to move troops and supplies.
"They (Sri Lankan authorities) are also directly responsible for subjecting journalists to harassment and interrogation," she said.
Others have been driven from the country by death threats, or in fear of detention and torture by government authorities, it said.
