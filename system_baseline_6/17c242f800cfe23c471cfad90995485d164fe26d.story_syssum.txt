From bragging "mommyjackers" and smug "sanctimommies" to pictures of poop-smeared kids and placenta art, blogger Blair Koenig has seen it all.
But a couple of years ago, I started getting a lot of submissions from parents, many of whom have parent friends that they find annoying.
Koenig: The aforementioned poop pictures are probably the most common type of submission I receive.
Koenig: I get e-mails from parents who say they're "reformed" and submit old examples of their oversharing ways.
Koenig: If there's a backlash, it's not really from parents.
Koenig: Social media is the gateway drug to oversharing.
Koenig: That answer depends on the person, because some people don't find poop disgusting but are completely repulsed by vomit or long strands of green snot.
It's like a funny field guide to parent overshare, and I think it'll be an essential baby shower gift.
Koenig: There are two kinds of people on social media: those who post too much information and those who don't.
Some people even take pictures of their pet's poop.
