The man who dazzled the world of golf by accumulating 14 majors by the age of 32 has now gone five seasons without a single one.
Woods won five PGA Tour titles in 2013 -- the tenth time in his illustrious career that he's done so.
And while his game is still in good enough shape to be way out in front at the top of the world rankings, Woods says it is, inevitably, less powerful than it used to be.
If Woods needed a reminder of where his game used to be in the majors, he will get it this season.
You evolve as you age and I think I've done that so far."
