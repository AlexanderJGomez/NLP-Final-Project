(CNN) -- Chicago police continued to search Friday for a suspect in the brutal rape of 15-year-old girl who was walking to school near one of the city's Safe Passage routes for children.
The 15-year-old girl was walking to her high school in predawn darkness when an assailant hit her on the head, dragged her between two houses to a yard and raped her, police said, with the assault taking place just a half-block away from one of the city's "Safe Passage" school routes especially for students.
A resident found the girl half-naked and bleeding from the head on a snowy walkway at the side of his home.
