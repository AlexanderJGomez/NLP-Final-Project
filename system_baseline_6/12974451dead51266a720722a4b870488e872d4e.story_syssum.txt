"It was agony," said Escobar.
In the last 10 years, her Juan Felipe Gomez Escobar Foundation -- named for her late son -- has brought health care to tens of thousands of children in Cartagena and provided more than 2,000 teenage mothers with counseling, education and job training.
... Next year, she's going to be pregnant again," Escobar said.
Escobar is hoping to change that through her teen mothers program, which aims to teach young women how to support themselves and their children.
