Schultz attended the first of CNN's Boardroom Masterclasses and spoke to Andrew Stevens about his business strategies.
Starbucks is not an advertiser, people think we are a great marketing company but in fact we spend very little money on marketing and more money on training our people than advertising.
I think a great leader, at times, has to demonstrate a level of vulnerability and share with people how you really feel.
Schultz: But I would say something like this, that the success of the company is linked to the fact that the company really did try to have a conscience and a soul in everything it did and the success of the company was shared with its people, that would be enough for me.
