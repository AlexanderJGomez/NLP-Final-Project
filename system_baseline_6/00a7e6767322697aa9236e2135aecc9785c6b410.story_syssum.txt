(CNN) -- When Lukas Hartmann, 29, signed up for 23andMe's at-home genetic testing service, there were no surprises in his results.
Genetic testing can be a powerful tool.
"So GMOs, aspartame, artificial flavors & colors, pink slime ... no problem!"
Scientists have identified more than 2,000 single gene disorders, says Rebecca Nagy, president of the National Society of Genetic Counselors.
The upside of these at-home genetic testing kits -- and 23andMe isn't the only company that sells them -- is that they've generated a lot of buzz about genetics, Nagy says.
She says she believes most early adopters of the tests are information-savvy and understand the results aren't set in stone.
Nagy recommends anyone who wants to do genetic testing first talk to a genetic counselor.
"Know what you're doing so that when you get the results back you can really use them to your best benefit."
Hartmann says he now believes he will not get limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, although he says there is a risk he could pass the genetic mutations onto his kids.
