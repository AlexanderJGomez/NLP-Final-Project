(CNN) -- It takes a special person to join Mensa.
But a new partnership between American Mensa and online dating giant Match.com offers a new, enticing reason to join the society of geniuses: true love.
Sereg found she does not connect with people who are athletes or sports nuts, for example.
A Harvard graduate, Binazir said highly intellectual people can frequently feel "entitled" to love.
The new Mensa partnership will give Match.com users a new way to find common ground, said Helen Fisher, a professor at the University of Indiana and Match.com's chief scientific adviser.
"If you're proud of being in Mensa, if someone (else) is also proud of being in Mensa, then you're already in the same clan," she said.
But the partnership with Match.com provides another way for people to find common interests, which is always positive, he said.
"One of the most recent marriages in our Mensa group came through finding each other on Match.com, and that was before the partnership," she said.
