(CNN) -- Nine civilians died in an attack on a luxury hotel in the Afghan capital, a government official said Friday.
In January, a bomb and gun attack by the Taliban on a restaurant in Kabul killed 21 people, most of them foreigners.
He said fighters will "continue to attack the pro-U.S. Afghan establishment."
