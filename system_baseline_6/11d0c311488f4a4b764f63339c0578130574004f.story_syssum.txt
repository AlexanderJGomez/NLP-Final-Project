(CNN)A runway at New York's LaGuardia Airport reopened Friday morning, a day after a Delta Air Lines plane skidded off it before halting near the icy waters of Flushing Bay.
"You didn't feel the wheels take," Faellaci said.
Faellaci said he was thankful for the plane's crew, first responders and God that it wasn't much worse.
Faellaci said he was reminded of the U.S. Airways plane that landed in the Hudson River in 2009.
"There were people that were calm, there were people that were praying, there were people that obviously were frantic, there were people that were crying," Faellaci said.
The Port Authority chief said plows had cleared the runway minutes before Flight 1086 touched down and that two other landing pilots had reported "good braking" action on Runway 13.
Four minutes after the plane landed, all of LaGuardia Airport shut down to air traffic.
