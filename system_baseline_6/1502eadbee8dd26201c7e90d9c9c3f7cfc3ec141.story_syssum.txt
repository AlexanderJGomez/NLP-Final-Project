"We need to be targeting the top ISIS military and strategic leadership," said Danielle Pletka at the American Enterprise Institute.
Analysts said the first challenge would be to locate elusive ISIS leaders like Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
But a U.S. intelligence official pointed out that over time, the United States has killed top extremist leaders, from Osama bin Laden in Pakistan to Anwar al Awlaki in Yemen to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in Iraq.
"The intelligence community has a proven track record finding, fixing and finishing elusive leaders of terrorist groups," the official said.
