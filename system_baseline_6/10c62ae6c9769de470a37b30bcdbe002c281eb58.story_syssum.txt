The package originated from Yemen -- the source of last week's thwarted bomb plot -- said New York Police Department Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne.
FBI agents, Port Authority police and U.S. Customs and Border Protection had inspected the package "out of an abundance of caution," New York FBI spokesman Rich Kolko said.
Senior law enforcement officials said the package was one of the more than a dozen packages from Yemen that investigators had been looking for since Friday.
Yemen said Monday that it is tightening security at all of its airports.
After last week's incident, the TSA and U.S. Customs and Border Protection took immediate steps to enhance measures for screening inbound cargo, including grounding packages originating from Yemen destined for the U.S., the TSA said.
The day before visiting Yemen, Pistole spoke to the International Air Transport Association conference in Frankfurt, Germany, met with international aviation security officials and signed an international security agreement with Germany, the TSA said.
