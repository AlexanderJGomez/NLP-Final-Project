Receivers dotted around five major cities, including Mexico City and Acapulco, will sound the alarm if they detect an earthquake.
With roughly 21 million people living both formally and informally in and around Mexico City alone, that means many will not be aware the alarm is sounding until the ground begins shaking.
It's called the Grillo (the Spanish word for cricket) early warning system.
Meira also hopes versions of the Grillo system could be introduced elsewhere in the world where earthquakes are a real risk -- like in Nepal, India, the West Coast of the U.S. and along much of the Pacific Coast of South America.
Then there is the fact that only a handful of early warning systems like SASMEX exist anywhere in the world.
"The real test of a good infrastructure is the density of sensors," Meira said.
Given that the devices can be produced cheaply and located anywhere with an internet connection, the potential for Grillo to be used in a variety of vulnerable areas around the world is very real.
"The science is all there," he said.
