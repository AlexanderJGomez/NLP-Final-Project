(CNN) -- As a child, I thought growing up in a slum near a dumpsite in the Philippines was as normal a life as an ordinary kid can have -- until I mingled with people from different social classes.
I got so lost that I couldn't even find my way back to peace and happiness until God answered the desire of my heart.
That mentor guided me and helped me change my perspective about a lot of things.
Our main purpose is the exact opposite of that of the bullies and gang groups -- to care, show love and acceptance by making a small yet significant difference in school, in our family, toward our friends and the people around us, and to use our time, skills, talents, strength and energy in more productive activities.
And, even though we may feel helpless sometimes, there are a lot of things we and others can do to help stop bullying and gang violence.
Education and learning is not the sole responsibility of the school, but a concern of the family and society as well.
