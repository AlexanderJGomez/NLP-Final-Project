"Secretary Clinton really values Senator Warren and has reached out several times over the past six months," the source added.
Since the 2014 midterms, Clinton has prepared for 2016 by meeting and talking with top Democrats about the strategy, tactics and policy that would make a possible Clinton run in 2016 campaign successful.
Erica Sagrans, the Ready for Warren campaign manager, said Tuesday that the meeting is another sign Clinton "is among a growing number of Democratic leaders who admire" Warren's liberal positions.
