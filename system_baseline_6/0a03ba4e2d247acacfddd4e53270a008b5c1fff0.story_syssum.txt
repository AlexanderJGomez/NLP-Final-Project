Though she was one of the most seriously hurt that day, Wright is now aiming for a spot on the British Paralympic volleyball team in 2012.
The bombings happened the day after the International Olympic Committee announced London would be hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2012.
The British Volleyball Federation announced her place on the team last month, and this week the team is competing at the 2010 Sitting Volleyball World Championships in the U.S. state of Oklahoma.
She was the last person pulled from the station that day, and Wright said she feels she's one of the lucky ones.
"There were 52 people that day who were definitely worse than me, 'cause I'm still here."
