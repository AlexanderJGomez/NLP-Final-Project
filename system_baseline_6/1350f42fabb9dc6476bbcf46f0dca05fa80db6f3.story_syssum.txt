Copenhagen (CNN)Denmark was on edge Tuesday, as it emerged that the suspected gunman in the weekend terror attacks in Copenhagen apparently swore allegiance to ISIS' leader, and armed police responded to a bomb scare at the scene of one of the shootings.
While police haven't formally released the name of the gunman, they said he was a 22-year-old man born in Denmark.
Police also said he was "known in connection to gangs."
"An attack on Denmark's Jews is an attack on everyone," she said.
We will stand together and continue the everyday life we know.
The Danish Film Institute said he was director Finn Noergaard.
CNN's Karl Penhaul and Dominique Van Heerden in Copenhagen contributed to this report, as did CNN's Ralph Ellis, Holly Yan and Hamdi Alkhshali.
