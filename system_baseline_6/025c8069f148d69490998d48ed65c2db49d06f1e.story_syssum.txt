(CNN) -- Explorer Dennis Schmitt found an island nearly two years ago near Greenland.
He calls his discovery Warming Island.
Many climatologists and scientists say arctic ice melt and other changes in the Earth's climate are the result of an increase in the world's temperature, a trend widely called global warming.
There are several possible reasons for the warming, scientists say.
"For the last 30 years, there's no way there's anything natural that can explain it," Stephen Schneider, a professor of environmental studies at Stanford University in California, said.
Since then, there's been a few tenths of global warming, so we're proclaiming global warming."
Asked about glacial melt, which many observers point to as evidence of global warming, Lindzen said the way glaciers change and move are phenomena largely unexplained.
The models don't predict it," he said.
The lower end of the range could cause more intense hurricanes, droughts, wildfires and flooding, Schneider said.
"Exactly how much it's going to warm up, we don't know," Schneider said.
