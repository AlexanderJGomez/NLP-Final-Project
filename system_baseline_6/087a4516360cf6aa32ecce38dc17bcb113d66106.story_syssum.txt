(CNN) -- The growth of e-commerce in China has outpaced that of western countries during the past five years.
China, in its current state, lends itself perfectly to e-commerce.
Characteristics of Chinese e-commerce
Many large e-commerce companies have chosen to build their own last mile delivery capabilities to ensure a better customer experience and to facilitate faster growth.
In 2012, we launched the Service by Yihaodian (SBY) model to provide our merchants with logistics, marketing, platform, and data services.
For example, online shoppers in the U.S. are used to opening one window at a time and flipping back and forth via navigation buttons, but Chinese online shoppers prefer that each click opens a new window allowing them to navigate a site by jumping between several windows.
Not many successes for multi-national Internet companies (not only e-commerce companies) can be found in China.
It is more beneficial for multi-national companies and brands to conduct e-commerce in China through strategic partnerships or through an e-commerce solution provider to ensure a higher success rate.
Trends in e-commerce in China
E-commerce in China is also rapidly penetrating third and fourth tier cities, predominantly due to growing Internet penetration, a local shortage of shopping malls and supermarkets, and an overall lack of available products.
Yihaodian started social commerce five years ago by embedding our website into a well-know social networking site Tianya.
We are fortunate to witness this change and proud to be a part of making this happen.
