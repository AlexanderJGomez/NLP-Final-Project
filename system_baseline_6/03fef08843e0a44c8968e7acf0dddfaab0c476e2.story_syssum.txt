Amidst the roars, step forward Marcel Hirscher, the 23-year-old with the weight of all Austria on his shoulders.
"It was very difficult," Hirscher told reporters.
Around four million people were watching on television in Austria and 40,000 are here live in the stadium.
"I really tried not to make the same mistakes I've done in the past in big events," he told reporters.
Marcel did it really great again today."
