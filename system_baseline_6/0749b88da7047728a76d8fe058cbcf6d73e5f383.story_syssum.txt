Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (CNN) -- An estimated 3 billion people -- nearly half the world's population -- still use an open fire as their primary source of energy for cooking and heating.
TaTedo's stoves are made with clay liners that, along with other simple design features, emit far less smoke and fewer pollutants.
Cookstove prices start at about $6 (U.S.), a lot of money for many families in developing countries.
While the upfront cost to buy a cookstove is high, the fuel costs are lower because it burns less.
