It may now be Albania's liveliest neighborhood, but a little over two decades ago it wasn't even on the map.
"If you could compare it, Albania was like North Korea is today," says Enno Bozdo, Tirana's deputy mayor.
The Block was a silent stronghold of Albania's elite.
The Block was his perfect opportunity.
Almost all of The Block's venue's names are in English, a detail that irks some locals.
"English is a way to look trendy," says Rudina Hoxha, a journalist.
In the Block it's twice that.
In 2007 a shade more than a million people visited the country.
"We wanted to see Albania because not many people back home know anything," says Alexei, a French backpacker cycling to Istanbul through the Balkans.
For coffee: Radio Cafe Tirana.
Yes, its theme might be cheesier than cheddar sandwich, but Duff is packed most nights and it's a great spot for people-watching in the heart of The Block.
Good for a romantic meal beside the madness.
