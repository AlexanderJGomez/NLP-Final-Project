Health care teams are now giving anti-rabies shots to three other patients who received organs from the same donor as the patient, the CDC said.
The CDC then examined autopsy tissue from the donor and determined he had died of the same type of rabies, which is spread by raccoons, according to the CDC.
The three other recipients are being tested for rabies, and health authorities are looking for family members or health care workers who might have had close contact with the donor or the recipient who died to see if they might also have the disease, said CDC spokeswoman Melissa Dankel.
Kuehnert said perhaps new rules need to be put in place to help doctors decide what to do with organs when the donor has died of encephalitis and no one knows why.
At least one transplant surgeon won't take organs when the donor has died of encephalitis of unknown origin.
