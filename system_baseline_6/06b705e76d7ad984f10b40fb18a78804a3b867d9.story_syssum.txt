By early Saturday, police were nowhere to be seen in the capital of Cairo, with military forces deployed on streets all around the nation for the first time in more than three decades.
"We haven't seen this many people on the streets at the same time."
Mohammed Mansour, a resident of the Shubra neighborhood of Cairo, said that he and fellow demonstrators had been "beaten and assaulted by police" since Monday, when the popular unrest began.
Continuing to fight Friday, he said that his group had beaten back police, who retreated.
The Muslim Brotherhood sent its followers onto the streets after Friday prayers, the first time Egypt's large and venerable -- but illegal -- Islamic opposition called for protest during this round of demonstrations.
"Let a new government form, but if we don't get what we ask for, we will go back to the streets again and again."
"They kept protesting until he fled the country," Yousef said of Tunisia.
