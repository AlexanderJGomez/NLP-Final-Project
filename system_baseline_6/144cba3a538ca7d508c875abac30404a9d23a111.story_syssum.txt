(CNN) -- An uproar over treatment delays at the Department of Veterans Affairs is triggering a heated debate over whether it is too difficult to fire federal workers, with the House approving legislation on Wednesday that would make it easier to remove senior executives at the agency.
How many has the VA fired?
But, the trend over the past five years shows a substantial difference at the VA. From 2008-2013, the VA fired executives at a rate one-fourth the firing rate for government overall, according to the OPM data.
And even last year, when the VA was in line with the rest of the federal government on firing, critics still see that as a significant problem because the rates of termination in the federal government are substantially lower than in the private sector.
She did, and was not fired.
We don't want a government that is staffed according to political persuasion," he said.
Stier believes the system needs to change, that there may be too much red tape.
But for now, Shinseki has no plans to fire himself, saying he isn't resigning.
Nor has he said if he is in the process of firing any VA employees as a result of the scandal.
"I will do everything I can," Shinseki demurred.
