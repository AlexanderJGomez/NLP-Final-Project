A portrait of Eluana Englaro taken in July 2008 in Italy.
But although Englaro had cleared the last legal hurdle, the court's decision sparked a new fight to find a hospital or clinic that would take out Eluana's feeding tube.
Finally, a private clinic in the northeastern Italian city of Udine agreed to assist in Eluana's case.
The outline adheres to the Cassation Court's ruling, which required certain steps and conditions once Eluana's feeding tube is removed.
