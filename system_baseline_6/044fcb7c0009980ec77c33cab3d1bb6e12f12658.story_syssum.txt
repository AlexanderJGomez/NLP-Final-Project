How could I write something useful for women in China?
Many Chinese women now are well-educated -- in fact, Businessweek reported that U.S. business school enrollment is driven by women from China.
In short, Chinese women today want what all women want -- great careers, true love, and maybe, a child who's happy and successful (most Chinese women are still restricted to having one child under government policy).
Now, there is an epic clash unfolding in Chinese society between women's newfound dreams and traditional notions of a woman's role.
But in a culture where women always have been second-class, laws will change only when enough women recognize their own selves and say "I'm not gonna take it anymore!"
That's why many writers and editors who care about women's culture are fighting to redefine beauty in China, show that strong is beautiful, and profile women who've ignored the rules, defined their own lives, and who as a result are lovely and amazing at every age.
