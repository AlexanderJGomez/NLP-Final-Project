It was at Nuerburgring that his father Manfred Winkelhock raced his last Formula 1 grand prix.
Manfred's brothers Joachim and Thomas Winkelhock were also racing drivers; Joachim entered seven grands prix in the 1989 season but did not pre-qualify, so didn't race.
Hill too was the son of a racing legend.
Graham Hill died in 1975, when Damon was 15.
Another F1 champion to sire a racing son was American Mario Andretti.
And Williams driver Nico Rosberg is the son of Keke Rosberg, the Finnish driver who won the world championship for Williams in 1982.
1992 world champion Nigel Mansell has supported the racing careers of sons Leo and Greg, who have both raced in single-seat racing formulae but, again, without looking obvious F1 contenders (though Greg is only 19).
