Lille, France (CNN) -- Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka each faced questions heading into Switzerland's Davis Cup final in France.
Also encouraging for Federer and the Swiss, Wawrinka thumped a listless Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-1 3-6 6-3 6-2 to begin the day.
"Definitely one of the top three matches in my life," said Monfils, who squandered two match points against Federer at the U.S. Open.
"I know how to play those matches," Wawrinka said.
Wawrinka stormed to the first set and when he held a break point to begin the second, it appeared as if the Swiss No.
Tsonga smelled blood when Wawrinka trailed 0-30 on serve, but the latter rallied to close out the set -- and the match, realistically -- despite double faulting on one of his set points.
"I just went to check the mark, and I was booed in my own country -- maybe not by the French spectators but by the Swiss spectators.
"Now I'm coming out of the match without any pain, which is good, too," said Federer.
Wawrinka and Federer both aren't scheduled to play doubles but they can be called upon Saturday.
