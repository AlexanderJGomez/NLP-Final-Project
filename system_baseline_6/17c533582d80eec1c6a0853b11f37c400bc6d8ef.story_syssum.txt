Four -- Colorado, Illinois, Missouri and Iowa -- have confirmed cases of Enterovirus D68, also known as EV-D68.
Dr. Christine Nyquist, medical director of infection control at Children's Hospital Colorado, said the hospital sent around 25 samples to the CDC from patients with respiratory illness.
The season often hits its peak in September.
"It's one that we don't know as much about as we would like," Schuchat said.
The virus has sent more than 30 children a day to a Kansas City, Missouri, hospital, where about 15% of the youngsters were placed in intensive care, officials said.
It's big," she said.
Vaccines for EV-D68 aren't currently available, and there is no specific treatment for infections, the Missouri agency said.
Sometimes they can be accompanied by fever or wheezing.
Jackson said physicians in other Midwest states reported cases with similar symptoms.
More than 900 children have gone to Children's Hospital Colorado emergency and urgent care locations since August 18 for treatment of severe respiratory illnesses, including enterovirus and viral infections, hospital spokeswoman Melissa Vizcarra said.
His mother, Jennifer, called 911 when her son's breathing became shallow, and her son was airlifted to the Denver hospital, she told KUSA.
The hospital's Dr. Robert Merrick believes that the same virus that hit Kansas City is causing the rash of illnesses seen at the Quincy and Hannibal hospitals, which both imposed restrictions this week on children visiting patients, the affiliate said.
Like other enteroviruses, EV-D68 appears to spread through close contact with infected people, the agency said.
