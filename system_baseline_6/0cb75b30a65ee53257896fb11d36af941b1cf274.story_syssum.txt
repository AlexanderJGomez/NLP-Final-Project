"And I think that understanding the history of the Confederacy and understanding the history of the Civil War is something that every American and every young American should be part of."
During the 1960s, we Americans looked at the war as it occurred on the battlefields, because the conduct and course of the war dominated every single moment of every day.
Today, the study of Confederate history is much more "inclusive" -- to use the word of choice for many state's 150th anniversary commissions -- as we look more deeply into the past.
What about slavery?
Why did many take advantage of the first opportunity to escape to freedom while others remained "loyal" to the South?
We Americans -- from native Americans to those who have ancestors who wore the blue or gray to those who are descended from slaves to those who have recently come to our shores -- want to know ourselves.
This is why millions of Americans read so many books about the Civil War or visit the battlefields or come to museums like The Museum of the Confederacy so that they can see first hand the ingredients that formed us.
