Morris was last seen by a friend, who walked her to a parking garage at the Shops at Legacy mall just before 4 a.m., but he did not walk her all the way to her car, police said.
She appears on surveillance video walking into the parking garage with the friend, police said.
Family and friends on Friday night also retraced Morris' steps, hoping to find answers to her whereabouts, the station said.
"Police are involved and we are going to find her and whoever has taken her or whoever she is with."
