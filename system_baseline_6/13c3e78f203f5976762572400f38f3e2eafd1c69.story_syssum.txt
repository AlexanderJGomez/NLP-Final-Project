Once at the White House, her personal maid put the suit in a bag so Mrs. Kennedy wouldn't have to look at it.
I am getting somewhat that same sensation as I travel around Texas.
Hours later, Kennedy continued to wear the suit during the emergency swearing in of Johnson as President.
The public hasn't seen the suit since the assassination and won't for another 90 years.
Also hidden from view in the new archives building in Maryland: the blue blouse Jackie Kennedy wore beneath the pink suit, her stockings, blue shoes and blue purse.
It is kept at a temperature of 65 to 68 degrees, which is best for the fabric.
