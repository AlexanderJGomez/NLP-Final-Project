(CNN) -- Shailene Woodley isn't just the lead actress in "The Fault In Our Stars."
If the movie version of "The Fault In Our Stars" is anything like the book, Woodley will soon be proven right.
"In 'Fault,' I am trying to rewrite what a female lead can look like," Woodley said.
Thank you so much!
In the process, she gained something as well: "a deeper sense of gratitude" for life.
