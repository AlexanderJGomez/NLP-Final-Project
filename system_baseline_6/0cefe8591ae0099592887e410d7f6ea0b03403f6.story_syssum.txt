Officials in the United Arab Emirates have said -- and a U.S. official confirmed -- that the plane's cockpit voice recorder has been examined and nothing on it indicates an explosion.
The latest threat was revealed October 29 when authorities in the United Arab Emirates and Britain found two explosives-laden packages sent from Yemen that were addressed to synagogues in Chicago, Illinois.
A U.S. official said that the devices found in the packages last week were very sophisticated and could have exploded in flight, but it wasn't clear whether that was the intent.
After last week's incidents, U.S. government authorities grounded packages originating from Yemen destined for the United States.
