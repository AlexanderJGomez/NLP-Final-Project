Lawyers for McDonnell and his wife met with prosecutors in the city of Alexandria on Monday as the Justice Department sought clarity over previously undisclosed gifts given to the governor and his family by the chief executive of a troubled dietary supplement company.
It has been a stunning turn of events for McDonnell, a well mannered former star in Republican politics who rose from state legislator to Virginia attorney general to governor.
Maureen McDonnell also bought stock in the company and promoted its products at a luncheon at the governor's mansion in Richmond.
McDonnell maintains he didn't know about the gifts or the stock and has denied wrongdoing.
Williams has also given generously to McDonnell's political organization.
An ethics investigation of Cuccinelli's relationship with Williams cleared the attorney general of any wrongdoing but revealed that Cuccinelli put the executive in touch with an attorney who could help him win grants from a state agency.
