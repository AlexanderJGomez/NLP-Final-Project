"I am not happy about house arrest," Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Saunter said during a hearing last week.
Judge Saunter gave Lohan a year to complete the community service.
Lohan entered drug rehab last year to avoid a jail sentence imposed by another judge.
"It would appear that the defendant's criminal conduct is increasing in seriousness and severity," the probation report said, yet it suggested she serve her sentence on probation and not in jail.
It also revealed that the drug test failure last August, which resulted in a jail sentence and court-ordered rehab, involved cocaine and amphetamines.
