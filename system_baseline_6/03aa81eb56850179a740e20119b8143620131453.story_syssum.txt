(CNN) -- Newly-crowned Dunhill Links champion Martin Kaymer could prevent Lee Westwood from replacing Tiger Woods as the world's number one golfer.
He played so solidly," Kaymer said.
The only way Woods can retain his five-year long stint as world number one is to play another tournament in October, but he is not due to return to action until the HSBC Champions event in China on November 4 -- where Westwood was also scheduled to appear.
