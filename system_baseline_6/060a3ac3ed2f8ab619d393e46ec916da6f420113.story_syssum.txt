Debbie Rowe said she married Michael Jackson to avoid the taboo of having childrien out of wedlock.
A close friend of Rowe said she has been grieving Jackson's death -- grief made more painful by paparazzi hounding her and media reports vilifying Rowe by depicting her as a heartless woman who would trade her kids for cash.
That is when I looked at him and said.
You have been so good to me.
Rowe gave up parental rights to Jackson in 2001, but she changed her mind more than two years later and sought temporary custody of the children.
She said the children don't call her "mom" because she did not want them to.
"Debbie doesn't run out to all of the social events," he said.
Debbie is just as happy at home in her very modest, humble, horse ranch."
"Ms. Rowe has not accepted -- and will not accept -- any additional financial consideration beyond the spousal support she and Michael Jackson personally agreed to several years ago," Eric George said in the letter.
Rowe also filed a lawsuit this week against a woman who claimed in a TV interview to have e-mails from Rowe saying she didn't really want to raise the children.
