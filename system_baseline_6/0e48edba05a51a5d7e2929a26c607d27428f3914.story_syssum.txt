Only about 6% of Latino voters agree that the GOP is the party most concerned for their interests.
But Republicans make a big mistake if they imagine that the Rubio choice will gain them many Latino votes.
Of Latinos who are legal residents of the United States, 28% lack health insurance.
Under these circumstances, Republicans should be cautious about assuming that they can sway Latino votes with the symbolic politics of a Rubio nomination.
Republicans tend to assume that immigration is the issue that most moves Latino voters.
And to the extent that symbolic politics can sway votes, Republicans should be looking to groups more receptive to the core Republican message than Mexican-Americans are likely to be.
Symbols of inclusion can work.
