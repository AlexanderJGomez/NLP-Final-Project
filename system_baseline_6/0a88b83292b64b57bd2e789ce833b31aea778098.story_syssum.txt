New York (CNN) -- New York City's Board of Health voted Thursday to ban the sale of sugary drinks in containers larger than 16 ounces in restaurants and other venues, in a move meant to combat obesity and encourage residents to live healthier lifestyles.
New York City spends an estimated $4 billion each year on medical care for overweight people, the mayor said in an earlier statement.
Thursday's decision is expected to take effect in six months and be enforced by the city's regular restaurant inspection team, allowing restaurant owners nine months to adapt to the changes before facing fines.
