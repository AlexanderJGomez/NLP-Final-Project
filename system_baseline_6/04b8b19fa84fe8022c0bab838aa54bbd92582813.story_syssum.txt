Rawalpindi, Pakistan (CNN) -- A suicide bomber killed at least 35 people Monday by detonating explosives outside a bank where people had lined up to pick up their monthly checks, police said.
At least three people sustained serious injuries, Rethore said.
Iqbal Nisouwana, a driver, who rushed to the scene to help tend to the wounded said he saw five men in uniform among the wounded.
On October 10, militants held dozens of hostages for some 22 hours inside the army headquarters in Rawalpindi.
Eleven military personnel, three civilians, and nine militants were killed in the siege.
This year, the United Nations has lost several staffers to terror attacks, including five who were killed in a suicide bombing at the World Food Programme offices in Islamabad last month.
Two more U.N. workers died when attackers shot their way onto the grounds of the Pearl-Continental Hotel in Peshawar in June and set off a car bomb.
