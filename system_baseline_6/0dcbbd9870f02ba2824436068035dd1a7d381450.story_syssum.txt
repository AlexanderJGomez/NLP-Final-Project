(CNN) -- Even if you know nothing about IndyCar Racing or NASCAR, the odds are you know the name Danica Patrick.
Patrick, who was recently named Nationwide's most popular driver by NASCAR fans, took some time to play the new Sega game and talk about her own gaming background in this exclusive interview for CNN.
I played "Super Mario Bros." I played any kind of racing game that existed, I played "Track and Field."
So to be in something like a Sega game is to me more cool because it's something that's not common, and it's not given that I would be in those games.
I think given the fact that we're in a racing environment, racing games tend to be something that's obviously really common, so growing up I've played them and some people continue to play them and I think it's a good fit.
Playing games and being an adult race car driver, I think it's more of a mental thing.
But if it's in your head that it's going to help you to play a simulator or play a racing game, then it will help.
How have you seen video games evolve to become more than something just guys play?
I think it also is about being able to have fun, and the games just get better and better over time.
There are more easy ways for people to be able to play the games that they want to play, when they want to play them.
I'd like to think so.
There are lots of different cars having to do with racing.
If you're listening on the radio to the race, you're going to hear a lot of spot reaction about where cars are and things like that.
It's just that you actually get to do it and it doesn't cost any money to crash the car.
