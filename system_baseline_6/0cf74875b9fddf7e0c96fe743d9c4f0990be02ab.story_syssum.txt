ROME, Italy (CNN) -- Police Wednesday arrested the suspected head of an Italian mafia murder squad following a two-day manhunt after he eluded police by crawling through sewer pipes, according to Italian media reports.
Setola is believed to have slipped into a tunnel built under his hideout near Naples on Monday, as police closed in on him, according to the reports.
He got out of jail last spring after a doctor ruled that he was legally blind.
In November, police arrested an Italian police officer suspected of informing Setola about police operations.
