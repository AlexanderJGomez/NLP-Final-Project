(CNN)  -- World number three Roger Federer exited the Monte Carlo Masters at the quarterfinals stage to Austrian Jurgen Melzer Friday.
The second followed a similar pattern, with Federer unable to capitalize on his seven break points in the match as the seventh seed went through.
Melzer will now play world number six David Ferrer after the Spaniard saw off 11th Viktor Troicki of Serbia 6-3 6-3 in an earlier match Friday.
