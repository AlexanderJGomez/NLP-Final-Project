(CNN) -- Negotiators for Iran and six world powers completed the first day of discussions on Iran's nuclear program Monday in Moscow.
Israel, which is believed to have its own nuclear arsenal and is alarmed over Tehran's hostility toward the Jewish state, has said it may attack Iran to try to stop Tehran from developing nuclear weapons.
Iran's top negotiator, Saeed Jalili, struck a nuanced position after the Baghdad talks, asserting Iran's right to pursue peaceful nuclear energy but also saying that progress had been made during the meeting.
"Iran now has the choice to make," she said.
Adding to the complexity of the situation, a U.N. report released just after the Baghdad talks said that inspectors had found a high level of enriched uranium in Iran.
