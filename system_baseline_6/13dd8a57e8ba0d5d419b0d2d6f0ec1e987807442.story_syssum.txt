Jackson Irungu is quitting Kenya after being targeted for being gay.
"They have a weapon to which they defend themselves," says Pauline Kimani, a leader of an umbrella organization for gays in Kenya.
A few people defend gay rights on the streets of Nairobi.
Kenya is a country of faithful people and religion plays a defining role in homophobia in Kenya.
As a result, most homosexuals in the country have to hide their sexual preference for fear of social stigma, say gay activists in Kenya.
But for an openly gay man Kenyan like Irungu, progress is too slow in Kenya.
