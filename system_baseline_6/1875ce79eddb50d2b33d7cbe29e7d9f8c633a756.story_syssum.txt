(CNN) -- British TV host Piers Morgan said taking over for retiring Larry King is like replacing Frank Sinatra's Las Vegas show.
Morgan will be based in New York, but also will work from Los Angeles and London, CNN said.
"Larry King would be it," Morgan said.
Morgan, 45, began his journalism career as a newspaper reporter in the United Kingdom for The Wimbledon News.
Morgan also writes two regular columns for the Mail on Sunday newspaper, which he will continue.
