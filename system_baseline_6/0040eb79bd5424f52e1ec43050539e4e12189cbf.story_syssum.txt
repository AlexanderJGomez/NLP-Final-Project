He described Mao as "classic Warhol subject matter."
Artistic inspiration aside, China also provided Warhol with a respite from the pressures of fame.
Many Chinese are familiar with certain Warhol works, such as the Marilyn Monroe or the Chairman Mao portraits, reproductions of which dot cafes and tourist markets across Beijing.
"If you don't know who Andy Warhol is, I won't blame you.
"For the first time, I learned the charm of pop art," Weibo user @Yanmingdu wrote about the exhibition, while user @GracieMankedun posted, "Just saw Andy Warhol's exhibition and I got a little confused.

While Shiner acknowledged the Mao portraits "could be read as a sarcastic or ironic portrayal", he said Warhol "definitely wasn't being critical.
