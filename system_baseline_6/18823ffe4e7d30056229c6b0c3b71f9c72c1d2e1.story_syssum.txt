Bauer was the stronger of the duo and made his run for the finish to be denied by Katusha fast man Kristoff, who was claiming his second stage win of the 2014 Tour.
It left the way clear for the sprinters but Bauer looked set to spoil their day with his gallant but in the end fruitless effort.
I left it until 400.
