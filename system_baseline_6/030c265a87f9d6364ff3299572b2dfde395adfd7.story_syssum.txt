Displayed are 112,225 gifts for Kim Il Sung, his son Kim Jong Il and current leader Kim Jong Un from 184 different countries.
Former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright gave Kim Jong Il a silver dish when she visited in October 2000.
I then noticed the car Stalin gave to Kim Il Sung during the Korean War in the early 1950s.
Not to be outdone, in 1953, Chairman Mao Zedong of China also gave the North Korean leader a train.
