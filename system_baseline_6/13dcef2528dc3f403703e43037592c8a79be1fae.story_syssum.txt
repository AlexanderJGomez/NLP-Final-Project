Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Bangkok turned into a war zone Wednesday as Thai military forces cracked down on anti-government protesters, ending a tense standoff that has troubled the capital for weeks.
"I would like to give moral support to officers who are doing their duties now and would like to reassure you," Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva told citizens.
He said the government had regained full control and Red Shirt leaders had fled or were taken into police custody.
Hours after the large military operation got under way, soldiers took control of the park area.
At least five people, including an Italian journalist, were listed as killed by the Police Hospital in Bangkok.
"Negotiations failed because core [opposition] leaders are not to be able to make decisions by themselves," the statement said, alluding to an outside force influencing the protesters.
The Red Shirt opposition members support former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a bloodless 2006 military coup.
"I never approve nor agree to any use of violence," he said.
