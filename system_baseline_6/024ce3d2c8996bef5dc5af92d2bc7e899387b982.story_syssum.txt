New Delhi (CNN) -- Here's the best way to understand the new India in 30 seconds.
The story struck me because it weaves together some important trends and forces in India as the nation undertakes the biggest elections in world history.
The second trend is the rise of rural India.
More than 100 million voters in India's elections are first-timers who turned 18 in the last five years.
Half of all Indians are under age 30; the average age in India is 28.
Some suggest that these trends mean India's elections will be fought and decided on social media.
India's Internet and Mobile Association says a strong social media campaign could swing up to 4% of votes.
Why?
Watch India's elections very closely.
They're immensely consequentialâ€”for India, and the world.
