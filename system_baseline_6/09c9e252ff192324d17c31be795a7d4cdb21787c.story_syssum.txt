As the bus took on more passengers along its route, an ultra-orthodox man demanded she should sit in the back of the bus as is the custom on that route.
An argument ensued and ultimately the bus driver called the police to intervene, but not before a crowd of black-clad ultra-orthodox men had gathered outside the bus.
Rosenblit said he asked if she was willing to show respect for the objectors and move to the back of the bus.
I oppose this unequivocally.
Rosenblit describes herself as secular and said she did not ride the bus looking for a confrontation.
