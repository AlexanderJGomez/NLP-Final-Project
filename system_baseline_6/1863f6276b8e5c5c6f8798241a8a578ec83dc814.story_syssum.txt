(CNN) -- Former U.S. Marine Dan Hottle knew he had found his dream job at Yellowstone National Park.
Hottle is one of many military veterans who have worked for the National Park Service and at Yellowstone, the nation's first national park, established in 1872.
"It's pretty rural and only packed with visitors in the summer," he said.
"I saw an injured bison on the road, and I know it's going to be food for a grizzly bear later this afternoon.
Park stats: Yellowstone National Park was the fourth-most-visited national park (PDF) in 2012, with 3.4 million visitors last year.
While Old Faithful Geyser is the big draw for first-time visitors to Yellowstone, it can take the whole day to enjoy and get around the geyser basin where it's located.
"I think it's the prettiest part of the park," Hottle said.
"The vibrancy of the colors around the spring are created by natural bacteria," Hottle said.
Early in the morning or later in the evening, when he's driving the only car on the road, Hottle likes to stop at a pullout about halfway to Lamar Valley, where he can sometimes hear wolves howling.
He doesn't have to hike more than one or two miles for a good chance to see a wolf pack or any of other animals that live in the park.
Funniest moment at the park: Moments after he spotted that bull elk, a tourist asked him, "Where's the wildlife?"
"You can drive around for two weeks and not see a bear, and then three show up in my front yard," he said.
"Female elk with calves can take people out," Hottle said.
Another park he likes to visit: Glacier National Park.
