Just 24 hours after resigning from his highly-successful eight-year stint at Italy's AC Milan, he has been announced as the new manager of English Premier League club Chelsea -- replacing temporary manager Guus Hiddink.
Ancelotti, who turns 50 next week, has been in management since 1995, when he took charge of Italian Serie B club Reggiana.
Before entering management, Ancelotti had a significant playing career as a midfielder with AS Roma and AC Milan.
Despite his management success at AC Milan, it has been widely reported that his relationship with the club's owner, Silvio Berlusconi, has not been strong in 2009.
