By 2008, when recession caused many small businesses to close shop, the Scotts left their day jobs to grow the business, Barn Light Electric Company.
Last year, Scott reported, the company pulled in $10 million in revenue.
They've been married for 29 years, Scott said, and building Barn Light made them stronger.
He is the "gas," and Donna is the "bricks," he said of their collaborative management of the company; he runs the manufacturing while she heads the administration, sales and marketing.
The company bought the patents of old lighting businesses, including Benjamin Electric Manufacturing Company, and allows employees and customers to suggest ideas for new styles.
Bragg thinks of his fellow employees as close friends, he said.
The company pays well, employees said, and has a sense of humor, too.
Locals may see a new building and go "Oh, its Barn Light, they're getting bigger again," Barn Light's communications coordinator Betty Lynne said.
