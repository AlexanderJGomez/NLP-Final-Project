(CNN) -- Gun control supporting candidates facing tight races for governor in Connecticut and Maryland are the beneficiaries of a last-minute ad buy from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
"The NRA praises Tom Foley, calling him pro-gun," a voice in a new Connecticut ad says.
The group has plans to spend $1.7 million in the state in its support for Malloy, who signed a gun control law in 2013 which expanded background checks and banned sales of some weapons like the AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, which was used in the Sandy Hook massacre.
He has also said he would repeal Malloy's gun control legislation.
With polling places officially open in Connecticut and Maryland in just a week, Bloomberg's group is focused on Election Day.
