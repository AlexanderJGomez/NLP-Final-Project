(CNN) -- Lake Urmia in Iran used to be a site to reckon with.
"If the lake dries up, this kind of threat will not be comparable to any other threat," he said in a public statement in January.
"In the year 1956, the per capita water available in Iran was 7,000 cubic meters.
Shortages are cited throughout the country, not just at Lake Urmia, but in the Hamoun Wetlands in the east of the country -- a one-time oasis surrounded by fishing villages that has since dried up.
"When Rouhani took power, in the first government meeting, he ordered the formation of a special group to save Urmia and the other dying wetlands," recalls Naser Agh, a professor at the Artemia and Aquatic Animals Research Institute at Urmia University, and a member of the steering committee of the Lake Urmia restoration program.
They also approved a large amount of money, so it can really help save the lake."
