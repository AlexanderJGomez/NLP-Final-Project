Delayed for months by chaos and conflict, the recovery of wreckage from downed Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 has finally begun in war-torn eastern Ukraine, Dutch officials said Sunday.
The wreckage will be transported to the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv before being sent to the Netherlands.
It noted at the time that Dutch investigators still hadn't been able to visit the site amid the unstable situation in eastern Ukraine.
