Hoping to tap into the events market, Reykjavik has set to work building its conference infrastructure.
"We may be a small country, but we've got big ideas," says Karitas Kjartansdottir, Harpa's conference director.
Meet in Reykjavik has adopted the slogan "meet in the middle," a reference to both the country's handy midway coordinates, and to the historic Reykjavik Summit, where former U.S. President Ronald Reagan met with General Secretary of the Soviet Union's Communist Party Mikhail Gorbachev in 1986, to negotiate arms control.
"It will be a long time before we get another meeting as prominent as the Reykjavik Summit," says Gudmundsson.
"The Blue Lagoon brings more energy to business groups, and makes corporate events more fun and productive," notes Magnea Guomundsdottir, the director of public relations for Blue Lagoon Iceland.
As if the setting wasn't unique enough, Blue Lagoon has also arranged DJs, circuses and modern dance performers for corporate events.
