Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has denied allegations that she failed to heed warnings of possible corruption in a rice subsidy program whose recent problems have stoked anger among farmers in the country's rural heartland.
Yingluck insists that the rice subsidy program, introduced in 2011, has been successful and benefited farmers.
The farmers said their planned protest wasn't political -- unlike the anti-government demonstrators in central Bangkok, they say they don't want to see the ouster of Yingluck.
The tensions over the rice program come against the backdrop of the protests by groups affiliated with Yingluck's political opponents.
The protesters say they want Yingluck's government replaced by an unelected "people's council," which would oversee electoral and political changes.
