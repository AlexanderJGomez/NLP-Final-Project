(CNN) -- In Texas, 33-year-old Marlise Munoz's body is being maintained with technology after being reportedly declared dead based on neurologic criteria, meaning her brain can no longer keep her body alive and functioning.
For the medical community and families affected in these cases, thorny ethical issues remain unanswered.
For others, the mother and fetus are viewed as separate beings with independent interests.
Does the fetus become a ward of the state and the woman's body merely a biologic incubator for the fetus?
Clearly, the first priority of doctors, nurses and other clinicians is the well-being of their patients.
When doctors and nurses begin to view their actions as causing physical, emotional or spiritual harms to their patients, it causes them moral distress.
Using technology is always a double-edged sword; the very technology that creates hope can also create suffering.
If there is uncertainty about the degree of brain damage a person has suffered, then it is ethical to use medical technology to keep him or her alive until a better determination can been made.
