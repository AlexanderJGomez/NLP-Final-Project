But with U.S. and Europe shrinking from the fight, this rag-tag band of civilian volunteers know they could be the first, last and only line of defense if Moscow rolls into this corner of northeast Ukraine.
Now, with Russia estimated to be massing up to 88,000 troops just across the border from Ukraine's eastern frontier, he finds himself marshaling a newly formed self-defense committee.
Fedorok said they've also been getting refresher courses from friendly Ukrainian army officers in recent days.
"As much as anything else, we're put here making a political point.
We know this outpost is only an effort to slow down the Russians," Fedorok said matter-of-factly.
The major, who declined to give his name, said the order was to defend the bridge or blow it up if the Russians advanced across the border.
"I prefer to say that we are not pointing our tanks at the Russians but merely looking toward our brothers in case they advance in friendship," he said.
The Pentagon's latest figures put the number of Russian troops massing just over the border at about 40,000.
He suggested Ukrainian ultra-nationalists had been threatening ethnic Russians and driving them out of their homes and businesses -- the same accusations that Moscow used as a pretext to intervene in Crimea.
