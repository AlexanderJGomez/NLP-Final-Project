(CNN) -- Civilians are in hiding in the Yemeni capital as protesters and government forces struggle for control on the streets of Sanaa.
Protesters have used Change Square for a seven-month sit-in demanding the resignation of President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
Dozens were killed and more than 700 were wounded -- many of them by gunshots -- over the last three days in clashes with the military, according to medical staff in Change Square.
Yemeni officials have said forces cracked down on those committing acts of violence during protests.
