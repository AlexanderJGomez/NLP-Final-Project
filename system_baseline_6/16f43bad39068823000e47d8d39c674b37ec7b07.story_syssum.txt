The PKK accuses Turkey of oppressing Kurdish culture and suppressing Kurdish nationhood.
By then the group's founder, Abdullah Ocalan, was living in exile in Syria where he organized PKK training camps.
In 1998, under intensive Turkish pressure, Syria expelled Ocalan and shut down the PKK camps he had established there.
It accuses the PKK of launching attacks on Turkish targets from secret bases in the mountainous and semi-autonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq.
