Nelson Mandela shouldn't be revered as a civil rights icon, the statements screamed: He should be exposed for what he is: A communist.
Mandela was branded a communist by the white apartheid government, which made it a crime to be one.
South Africa's government came down on the side of the West -- and communist or not, Mandela was squarely on the other side.
Not really, believes South African historian Sampie Terreblanche.
After his release from prison, Mandela made some high-profile appearances with communist leaders.
At the time that Umkhonto we Sizwe carried out its first attacks, Mandela was at its helm.
Mandela received a sentence of life in prison.
Umkhonto we Sizwe beat the war drum against the "white supremacy" and "the white state."
"Umkhonto we Sizwe is a new, independent body, formed by Africans, It includes in its ranks South Africans of all races," the group said in its manifesto.
At a sports match in 1995, as President, Mandela made a gesture of support to white South Africans that drew gasps.
The crowd began chanting his name.
