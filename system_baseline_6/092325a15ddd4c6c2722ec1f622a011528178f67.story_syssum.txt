But Butler's daughter is one of thousands on waiting lists for the 49,000 Head Start classrooms around the country - a list that might get shorter after an investigation into allegations of fraud by some applicants and Head Start workers.
Head Start is open to foster and homeless children, kids with some disabilities, families eligible for government assistance and families with incomes below the federal poverty guideline, about $22,000 for a family of four.
Parenting skills improved, too, among those whose kids were in Head Start, according to the HHS study.
The investigators' documents showed they made too much money to enroll, but at eight of the 15 Head Start centers they approached, staff members pretended they hadn't seen the income levels, or they urged parents to lie.
The problem, Kutz said, is that Head Start workers only have to sign a statement that they've seen proof of parents' incomes.
Not all Head Start programs have been letting the income rules slide.
"We know the majority of Head Start programs across the country are doing the right thing."
Demand for Head Start remains strong, even in programs where there's no suspicion of fraud.
"I know they could do a much better job."
