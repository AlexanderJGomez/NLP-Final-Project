(CNN) -- When I moved back home, I knew what I was in for.
Sixty-three percent of 18- to 34-year-olds know someone who has moved back home.
Moving back home has not been easy to swallow.
With extra time on my hands, I also began to intern at R&B Records, a nearby music store.
Most of my friends are pursuing internships or graduate study.
And still, we wonder: Will this be enough?
While my friends and I have enjoyed our experiences, the current job market has brought a feeling of uncertainty, which has been unsettling.
I would say that my friends are all more enriched individuals.
I'm thrilled that soon I'll get to make a room of my own.
