Aides to Perry, who allowed Willingham's execution to go forward, started off with general questions about how things were going at the commission, a relatively new agency, Bassett said.
"As soon as we started discussing the Willingham investigation, the meeting got more confrontational and more difficult," Bassett said.
"The case has been scrutinized and reviewed by a jury, state and federal courts, the news media, anti-death penalty activists and the Forensic Science Commission," Perry spokesman Mark Miner told CNN in an e-mail.
He said Perry's office called him just days before the commission was slated to hear from the expert it hired to review the evidence in the Willingham case.
Representatives of the attorney general's office raised no concerns about the Forensic Science Commission's jurisdiction when the panel voted unanimously to take on the Willingham investigation, he said.
The state fire marshal's office has told the Forensic Science Commission it stands by the findings in his case.
Nashed told CNN that Hurst's review of investigators' findings in the Willingham fire was also reviewed by appeals courts and the state Board of Pardons and Paroles, which rebuffed a plea for clemency.
The most recent review was conducted by Maryland arson expert Craig Beyler at the request of the Forensic Science Commission.
"The Willingham case really demonstrates how severe the consequences can be when you use bad forensic evidence," Saloom said.
