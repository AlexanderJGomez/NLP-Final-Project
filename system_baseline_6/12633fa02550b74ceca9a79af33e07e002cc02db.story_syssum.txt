Lynch and Frost will write and produce each one and Lynch will direct all nine.
Lynch (then best known as the director of "Eraserhead" and "Blue Velvet") and Frost -- who had written for "Hill Street Blues" -- created an eerie story starring Kyle MacLachlan as FBI agent Dale Cooper, who had come to the Pacific Northwest town of Twin Peaks to investigate the murder of a high school girl named Laura Palmer.
Showtime plans to show the entire run of the TV series before the premiere of the new "Twin Peaks" episodes.
