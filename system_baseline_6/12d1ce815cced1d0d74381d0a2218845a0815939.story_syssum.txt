"Some evidence that we have collected at a couple of the scenes and some other information we have leads us to believe that this particular matter was ISIS-inspired," said Neil Gaughan, acting deputy commissioner of the Australian Federal Police.
"The act that we believe was in preparation involved attacks against police officers," he said.
"I think the entire Australian community should be concerned about the young age of those particular men," Gaughan said.
The suspects were associates of 18-year-old Nadun Haider, who was killed while stabbing officers at a police station in September, police said.
Australians should be stoic about the threat of terrorism, Abbott said Saturday.
Police said this particular threat had been fully contained.
