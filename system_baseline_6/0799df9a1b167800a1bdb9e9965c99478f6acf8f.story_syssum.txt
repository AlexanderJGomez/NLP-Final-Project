Conservative outlets that back McDaniel have been all over the fact Cochran rents a basement apartment in Webber's D.C. home, and that Webber has traveled extensively with Cochran on the taxpayer's dime.
Now McDaniel is fending off questions about whether his campaign was involved in trying to photograph Cochran's sick wife.
"He and I are very different with our ideology.
I am not that guy," McDaniel said.
But like other Republican incumbents this year, Cochran and his allies are fighting back hard.
He said Cochran fights hard for Mississippi's needs and calls his seniority -- ranking Republican on the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, a big plus for the state.
People can lose touch and get lazy and all those things but I don't think that's the case with Senator Cochran.
And they can't name one," McDaniel told CNN.
We wanted to ask Cochran himself why he thinks he should get another six years, after serving 36 in the U.S. Senate and six before that in the House.
