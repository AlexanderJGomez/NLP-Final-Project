The mood at the show was somber, said Bob Templeton of Crossroads of the West Gun Shows.
"It's going to be a long dialogue on gun control and gun rights, and it will be hard to strike a balance between those two positions," he said.
Bill Schaeffler of Tucson, among those at the show Saturday, said he knows gun control and high-capacity ammunition magazines will be hot topics.
Federal law enforcement officials were on site to monitor buyers and sales activity, Templeton said.
