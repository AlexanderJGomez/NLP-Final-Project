The Alawites, he said, understand there are very few alternatives other than staying in Syria now, but if rebels take the airport, they would likely feel trapped.
The airline cited a "deteriorating situation" around the Damascus airport, a Cairo airport official said, according to Egyptian semi-official news agency Al-Ahram.
Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford said that in response to government Internet-related actions, the United States has given "a thousand pieces of non-lethal equipment -- largely communications gear" to help opposition activists get around the cyber roadblocks.
"That is the reason why our non-lethal assistance to the Syrian opposition, we put a special emphasis on communications equipment precisely to help the Syrian people tell the world what is going on inside Syria," he said.
Most of the wounded were children, they said.
On Wednesday, villagers in northern Syria picked pieces of a downed fighter jet from an olive grove after rebel fighters claimed to have shot down three government aircraft in 24 hours.
Al-Assad's government has relied increasingly on air power to battle the 21-month-old revolt against it, and witnesses said a cheer went up when the jet went down near Aleppo.
Witnesses said two fliers ejected from the plane before the crash.
"The heroes of Darret Ezza shot down his plane!"
