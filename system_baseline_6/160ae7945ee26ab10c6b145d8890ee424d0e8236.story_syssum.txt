Cymothoa exigua: Biting your tongue, so you don't have to
As a youngster, this nasty little parasitic crustacean begins a life of terror by fighting its way through the gills of its fish host of choice, the snapper.
The fish is actually able to use the parasite just like a normal tongue, only it has to share all the food with its new friend.
A female sacculina begins life as a tiny free-floating slug in the sea, drifting around until she encounters a crab.
Rather than waste the nutrients on itself, a host crab will hobble along and continue to look for food with which to feed its parasite master.
Filarial Worms: Proof you need thicker skin
In an interesting (if scary) example of parasite ingenuity, filarial worm embryos living underneath the skin can sense the onset of night, which is their cue to head upward to the skin's surface in order to increase their chances of being picked up by a passing 'skeeter.
Where there are guinea worms, there is Guinea Worm Disease -- and that's usually in Africa.
(Of course, in areas where an entire village shares a single water source, this helps spread the infection.)
This cure for a guinea worm infection has been around so long, some believe it's where we get the snakes-around-a-staff symbol for medicine.
First, they hang out in the droppings until a snail happens along and eats the bird dung.
So the bird devours the stalk and ends up with a bellyful of Leucochloridium paradoxum that will, of course, lay eggs and begin the cycle again.
