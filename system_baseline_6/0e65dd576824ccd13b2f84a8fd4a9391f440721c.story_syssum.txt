The All Blacks and their fans are clear on one thing, says Dan Carter: the goal is to make history and become the first rugby nation to win back-to-back World Cups.
Heading abroad to another World Cup where the All Black are certain favorites -- following their steamrollering 14-game perfect year in 2013 -- Carter has every reason to be optimistic.
"I've been part of the squad that's won the World Cup before so, you know, that's a huge achievement," Carter says, diplomatically.
"It's a real rugby environment, rugby culture is everything to do with Twickenham.
Lost one game there a couple of years ago but apart from that I've had a lot of success at Twickenham."
"The pinnacle of any rugby player is to reach those heights but to do it away from home, two tournaments in a row would be something pretty special," Carter said.
