From making his professional debut at just 13 to running top-class defenders ragged, this is one Tiger who hasn't changed his stripes since bursting onto the scene in Europe with Porto and Atletico Madrid.
"I have three years left on my contract with the club and my reality is that this contract ties me down for a few more seasons," Falcao said.
Falcao has emerged as one of the world's top goalscorers since making the move to Porto from Argentina's River Plate in July 2009.
His father played club football in Colombia, and there was never a doubt in Falcao's mind what he wanted to achieve in life.
It was the realization of a dream for a player which had begun life with one simple dream -- to become one of the best striker's on the planet.
Falcao who has scored five goals in six qualifying games, wants the latest generation of Colombian talent to write their own records and emerge from the shadow of former great players such as Carlos Valderrama and Faustino Asprilla.
