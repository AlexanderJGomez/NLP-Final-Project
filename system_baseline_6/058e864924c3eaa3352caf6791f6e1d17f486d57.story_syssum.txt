Stern made his prime time debut this year as a judge on "America's Got Talent;" Harvey hosts "Family Feud" and his daytime talk show, "The Steve Harvey Show," is set to premiere on September 4.
"I think the uniqueness of (my show) is the male perspective, which is missing from daytime television," he said.
That personality goes a long way, said Premiere Networks President Julie Talbott whose company syndicates "The Steve Harvey Show" on radio across the country to 7 million listeners.
There are not the venues available for these young acts to hone their skills and talents, which is really a shame.
I don't want to be one of the ones where people say 'Man, whatever happened to so and so?'
I don't know how it's going to go, but I also know that God didn't bring me this far to leave me, so He causes things to happen."
