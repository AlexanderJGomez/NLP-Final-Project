Allegations against the Japanese camera and medical equipment maker came to light after the October dismissal of former President Michael Woodford -- a rare foreign chief executive in corporate Japan -- after he questioned ex-board members about dubious transactions at the center of the case.
The new management includes Yasuyuki Kimoto, a former director of Sumitomo Mitsui Bank, who becomes chairman, while Hiroyuki Sasa, an Olympus executive officer, is promoted to president.
Woodford also questioned Sasa's experience to lead Olympus out from under the shadow of the scandal.
Woodford is is suing Olympus for wrongful termination.
Olympus shares lost nearly 80% of its market value in the weeks after Woodford went public with his allegations.
