If anyone embodies golf's fixation with going further, faster it is Miller.
The 29-year-old is homing in on his main target for 2014, the long driving world championship in Las Vegas, a title he won back in 2010.
This is the World Championships -- the big one.
The speed at which Miller swings the club regularly clocks in at 155 miles per hour and the ball consistently flies off the face at a freakish 225mph.
When Miller launches into his first drive on the range after a brief warm up, it is impossible to see the ball against the backdrop of a grey autumn sky.
That is going to give us the right launch conditions.
Miller's obsession with distance is one reflected at all levels of golf, he says.
"Technology as it has progressed -- with shafts and the heads -- it plays a huge part," Miller explains.
it is always going to grow, just like the game.
Cox says there are up to 50 points of Miller's swing that have been tweaked from a regular tour pro's to maximize the length he hits the ball.
Miller's jet-propelled swing is backed up by numbers.
It all boils down to this; Miller needs to execute the perfect technical swing, and connect with the ball, not only right in the middle of the club, but also at the right angle, for it to fly.
Unsurprisingly, Miller makes my effort look feeble -- his ball flies off the face at 208mph, hit by a club that was wielded towards impact at 144mph.
I play golf with some people who would struggle to hit it 397 yards in two shots.
