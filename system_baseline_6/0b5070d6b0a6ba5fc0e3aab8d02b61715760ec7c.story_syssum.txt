Hong Kong (CNN) -- Officials wielding infrared thermometers are becoming more difficult to avoid at entry points from mainland China as Hong Kong strengthens its defenses against the H7N9 strain of bird flu.
Health authorities are still investigating the possible sources of infection and how the virus is spread.
That's only the second highest number of provincial cases behind Zhejiang, which has reported 46 cases of infection and six deaths.
Hong Kong has said it is prepared to halt the import of live poultry, meat and eggs if the H7N9 virus is found at a mainland poultry farm with export ties to Hong Kong, or if that farm is within 13 kilometers of another that supplies the city.
