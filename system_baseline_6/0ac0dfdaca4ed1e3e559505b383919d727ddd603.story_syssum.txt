Los Angeles (CNN) -- Paul Walker's brothers are helping "fill in small gaps" in "Fast & Furious 7" action sequences not finished before the actor's death, producers said Tuesday.
"This film is the most important we've ever done together," the post said.
The high-performance 2005 Porsche Carrera GT was going "between 80 and 93 mph at the time the car impacted a power pole and several trees," the final report said.
Investigators found "no pre-existing conditions that would have caused this collision," the report said.
The crash happened a few hundred yards away on a wide street.
