But many were disappointed by the countless features the smart watch did not include.
"I'm waiting for a smart watch that does something extra than just bring my phone to my wrist," says design engineer Esben Oxholm, who mocked up his own smart watch concept in February.
I just know that I'm not paying 300 to 400 bucks for a wrist attaching remote control that needs to be recharged every day."
Others say that the smart watch proper still hasn't been invented.
Through all the fevered commentary, technological enthusiasts continue to draw up their own visions of what a smart watch should be.
