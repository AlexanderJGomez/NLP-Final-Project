Stuck in a foot of snow on a road somewhere outside Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, the couple from Wisconsin pulled all the clothes out of their suitcases and wore them, trying to keep warm in their car with temperatures dipping below zero.
Their route took them on Beartooth Highway, but they said they didn't see any signs warning that the road was closed.
"There are only two roads in this area, so I kinda knew what road they needed to be on," he said.
Then he got on the snowmobile and minutes later, found the couple just about where he thought they'd be.
"They were really grateful and there were some tears," he said.
Barnett loaded Mark and Kristine on his snowmobile and drove back to his truck.
"It's really rural up here, we're just up in the mountains."
