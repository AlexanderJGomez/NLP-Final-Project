Caluori's right hand was placed out-of-view behind his back," the affidavit said.
Caluori continued to struggle and would not comply with our commands," Molnar said in the affidavit.
The safety was not engaged," the affidavit said.
in the affidavit, said Caluori "spends a lot of time on the computer" but she "does not know what he does on it."
Call the CIA or run it up the chain of command," Molnar said.
