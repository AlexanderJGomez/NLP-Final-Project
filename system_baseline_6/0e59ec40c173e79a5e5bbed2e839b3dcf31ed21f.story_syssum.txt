The busiest shopping day of the year also saw a major boom for gun sales, with the federal background check system setting a record of more than 175,000 background checks Friday, according to the FBI.
Employees of the background check agency, who work every day but Christmas, worked through the weekend to vet Friday's purchases.
Last year, the agency completed 21 million background checks, and about 1.1% of those purchases were denied, the agency said.
The gun shop can read the information to the background check agency  over the phone or run the information through a secure Internet connection.
