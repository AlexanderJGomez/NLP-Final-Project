(CNN) -- The media circus that is Jodi Arias' murder trial is in its final stretch, as the jury began deliberations Friday following closing arguments.
His grandmother introduced him to Mormonism as a child.
That November, he baptized Arias into the Mormon faith, a ceremony Arias said was followed by anal sex.
His throat was slit from ear to ear.
Prior to Alexander's killing, Martinez said, Arias stole her grandparents' .25-caliber pistol, rented a car in Redding, California, turned off her cell phone and brought along cans of gas so there would be no record that she was in Arizona.
After she dropped Alexander's new camera, he became violent, the defense said, and had Arias not defended herself, investigators would've found Arias, not Alexander, dead in the bathroom.
Did Arias change her story?
"If Jodi Arias were accused of the crime of lying, I could not stand before you and say she's not guilty of that crime, but nowhere in your jury instructions are you asked to convict Jodi Arias of lying," Nurmi said.
HLN has enjoyed a ratings boost since the trial began, and people drive hours to see the trial for themselves.

If convicted on this charge, Arias will face a mini-trial of sorts to determine if she killed Alexander cruelly and knew he would suffer.
The jury can also decide that Arias killed Alexander recklessly or that he attacked her.
