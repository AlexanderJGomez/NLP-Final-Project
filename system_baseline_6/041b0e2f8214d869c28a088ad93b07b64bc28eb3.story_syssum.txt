(CNN) -- No one will know until June how the Supreme Court will rule on President Obama's Affordable Care Act.
The president may say he is confident the court will uphold the law, but it seems he's not entirely optimistic.
That leaves the Supreme Court.
Voters will want to hear something from Republicans that indicates they know, care and want to deal with this problem.
If ObamaCare is rejected by the court, it would present a huge opportunity for Republicans.
