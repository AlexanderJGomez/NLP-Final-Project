In February, a Florida man fell into a sinkhole that opened suddenly beneath the bedroom of his suburban Tampa home.
Sinkholes are particularly common in Florida, which rests on a nearly unbroken bed of limestone, according to the Florida Sinkhole Research Institute.
Insurance claims submitted in Florida alone between 2006 and 2010 totaled $1.4 billion, according the Florida Senate report.
