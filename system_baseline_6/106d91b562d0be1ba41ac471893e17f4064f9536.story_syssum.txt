It's the first time that potential human organ trafficking, a worrisome international crime, has been detected in Spain, authorities said.
"It's the first case that we have detected in Spain, of some people who come from foreign countries and who try to get some poor people, some immigrants," to sell a piece of their liver for a transplant, Matesanz said.
But medical workers there, following strict protocols against human organ trafficking, prevented it.
Further investigation into the people who were recruiting and paying for those tests led police to the Lebanese mayor, and to the Lebanese suspects and the Palestinian, who live in Spain, authorities said.
It's exploitation of human beings."
