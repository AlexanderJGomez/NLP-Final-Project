T.J. Lane, a remorseless killer who escaped from an Ohio prison where he was serving three life sentences for a school shooting, has been captured.
The 19-year-old scaled a fence at the Allen Oakwood Correctional Institution in Lima, about 90 miles northwest of Columbus, Warden Kevin Jones said.
A Correctional Institution Inspection Committee report in April said the facility was over capacity by 217 inmates.
Lane escaped with Clifford E. Opperud, 45, who was serving time for aggravated robbery, and another man.
Chardon schools will be closed Friday, but counselors and other support services will be provided, the school district superintendent said.
Lane pleaded guilty last year to three counts of aggravated murder, two counts of attempted aggravated murder and weapons-related charges.
"For everyone in that courtroom -- the victims, their families, the prosecutors, defense -- everyone in that courtroom was just absolutely taken aback," said Friedman, who hasn't talked to Lane in about a year.
