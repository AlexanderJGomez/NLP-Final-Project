(CNN) -- The Gettysburg Address was a quick-hitting speech that was built to last.
It has been 150 years since President Abraham Lincoln got up in front of thousands of people in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to dedicate the Soldiers' National Cemetery at a turning point in the Civil War.
Lincoln was able to get straight to the point and deliver a punchy speech in part because he came after Edward Everett's marathon presentation about the war, explains James Cornelius, curator of the Lincoln Collection in the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum.
In some cities, people could buy commemorative event pamphlets that contained the speech, and key phrases were incorporated into Lincoln's 1864 election posters and memorials after his death.
We found that people in some states, like Delaware, were particularly fond of quoting the address and that different parts of the speech were more popular in some states than others.
Pretty much everyone knows this part of the Gettysburg Address, even if they think a score is just something from sports.
That, and people tend to remember the beginnings of speeches, Cornelius said.
Little doubt exists that Lincoln opposed slavery, and in fact loathed it, Cornelius said.
But Lincoln can't take full credit for this phrase, Cornelius said, because it was a fairly common expression used in the parlance of war.
You should continue on and further this effort."
There are five versions of the speech, and one of them omits those two words.
Even Lincoln himself is said to have used a version of the phrase in a letter 20 years before the address, Cornelius said.
Maybe that's why people can't help but post the speech on social media, 150 years after the fact.
Why do you think the Gettysburg Address endures today, and why do some lines seem to resonate more with different places and groups in the United States?
