The mother of four, a 32-year-old woman named Rinchen, set herself alight Sunday in front of Kirti Monastery in the county of Aba, which Tibetans call Ngaba, in Sichuan Province, the Tibetan advocacy group Free Tibet said in a statement.
The other reported self-immolation was carried out Saturday by Tsering Kyi, a female middle school student aged 18 or 19, at a vegetable market in the county of Maqu, or Machu in Tibetan, in Gansu Province, according to Brigden of Free Tibet.
Radio Free Asia also reported the death of a female middle school student in Maqu on Saturday, citing an "exile source" with local contacts.
