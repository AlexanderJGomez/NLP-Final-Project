I just feel the NCAA is pimping off the Penn State situation," said my friend on the phone, a former football player and current college administrator.
I think the NCAA sanctions are not only fair but also could have been harsher.
But to hear the indignant reaction of those in the Penn State family and in the media, you would think that the NCAA was shutting down the entire university.
I'm willing to believe the board of trustees also realizes we got off easy, considering how quickly it agreed not to appeal any of the NCAA sanctions.
Any board member who sat back, asked no questions or failed to demand on the record that university President Graham Spanier be more accountable to his bosses â€” that would be the board itself -- needs to step down.
Board members are entrusted with the care of the university.
The trustee website also states that the board: "...has a continuing obligation to require information or answers on any university matter with which it is concerned."
Even after the board was updated about the Sandusky investigation in May 2011, several trustees recalled in the Freeh Report, no one asked tough questions.
We are ... Penn State.
