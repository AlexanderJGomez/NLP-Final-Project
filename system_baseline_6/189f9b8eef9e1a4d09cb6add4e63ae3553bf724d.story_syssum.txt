(CNN) -- In the cold, predawn hours of February 20, 2007, shortly after 4 a.m., armed men stormed into the home I owned with my family and burst into my bedroom, shouting at me to show my hands.
That's when I realized the men were U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.
The ICE agents had no judicial warrants; instead, they claimed that the rudely awakened men, women and sometimes children in the homes had provided consent.
ICE claimed it was looking for people not suspected of a crime, but merely those in violation of civil immigration laws.
In the home of three of the other people in our case, ICE knew it had already deported the person it were seeking.
I knew that the government is not supposed to enter your home without a warrant or handcuff you only because you are Latino.
