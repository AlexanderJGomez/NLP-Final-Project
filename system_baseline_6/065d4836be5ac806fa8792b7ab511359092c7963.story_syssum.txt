And that, Silverstein recalled, is when this very normal day was shattered.
As the group walked to the concert hall, several orchestra members openly wept, but Silverstein says they still managed to take their seats.
The orchestra's music director, Erich Leinsdorf, was going to have to break the news to the audience.
Seated at the end of a row, closest to the audience, Silverstein watched the stunned people react to the news.
Cabot, who regularly attended the Friday afternoon concerts, told the audience a story about the death of his father, according to Silverstein saying that he had "needed to hear music to help through the tragedy" because of the "solace" music provides.
The shooting of the president was the "first time anyone of us had been confronted with the situation," he said.
