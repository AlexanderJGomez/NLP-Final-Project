Did you benefit from a crime?
Moreover, it is Muslims themselves who stand to lose the most when crimes are committed by these vigilantes.
If the goal of our detractors were really to get Muslims to do more "speaking out," then what Muslims have already done would have been enough years ago.
The critics who want Muslims to "speak out" only grow more demanding when Muslims actually do speak out, because by doing so Muslims have publicly affirmed the right of others to blame them collectively, regardless of whether they are accountable or not.
It is worth remembering that the perpetrators of crimes such as the Charlie Hebdo massacre are always screaming "Revenge!"
Perhaps it is more comfortable to keep the conversation focused on Muslims and their religion than it is to investigate whether one's own country or one's own group has anything it might have to "condemn."
