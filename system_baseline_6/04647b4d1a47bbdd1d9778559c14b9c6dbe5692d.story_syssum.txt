Zinedine Zidane: Midfield supremo Zidane features at the very top of our football heroes of the decade but he also heads the list of villains for his infamous headbutt on Italy's Marco Materazzi in extra time of the 2006 World Cup final.
Thierry Henry:  Henry went into France's World Cup qualifying playoff against Ireland as one of the most respected footballers on the planet but by the end of the tie his reputation was in tatters.
In a derby match two years later the severed head of a pig was even thrown onto the pitch in his direction.
The outspoken Irishman, who even walked out on his country's 2002 World Cup bid, later admitted he had deliberately "hurt" Haaland in revenge for an earlier incident.
Not so.
Hoyzer was jailed for over two years and his revelations left a stain on Bundesliga football.
He received a six-month ban from the AFC Champions League for spitting at a match official and during the 2006 World Cup his tackle left France's Djibril Cisse with a broken leg.
Now the Argentina national coach, he took them to the World Cup finals with a last-gasp qualification and then promptly spoilt it all by earning a temporary worldwide ban from FIFA for abusing reporters after the crucial game.
