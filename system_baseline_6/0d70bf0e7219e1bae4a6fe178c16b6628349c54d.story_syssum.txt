Low-wage workers have been the hardest hit since the onset of the financial crisis, and low-wage jobs remain a fixture of the new economy.
Congress should help low-wage workers gain access to predictable work schedules.
A University of Chicago study found that 41% of early career hourly workers and 47% who work part-time received a week or less of notice of their work schedules.
Women comprise over two-thirds of the nearly 20 million workers in low-wage jobs like home health care, fast food work, and cash services.
Traditional economic safeguards have offered little help to these workers.
Real solutions exist.
According to the National Women's Law Center, the bill would provide workers the right to request and receive predictable work schedules, receive compensation for sudden scheduling changes, and not fear retaliation if they request scheduling accommodations from their boss.
The bill protects families and allows them to attend to their many obligations, not just work.
Conversely, just-in-time scheduling increases worker turnover and hurts worker satisfaction.
They can start by passing legislation that better protects shift workers from arbitrary and unpredictable scheduling practices.
