(CNN) -- Portugal's Sergio Paulinho won stage 10 to hand Lance Armstrong's RadioShack team their first victory in the Tour de France.
"It was a close sprint but the most important thing is to win and so this moment, for me and my team, is a good one," Paulinho told the official Tour de France website.
Overall leader Schleck was pleased with a comfortable day in the saddle: "It was quite an easy day even if it was fast at the beginning.
Even if it was quite up and down, there was nothing for me to achieve."
