Kang, who was vice principal at Ansan's Danwon High School, was rescued from the sinking Sewol ferry.
His family members -- one son, two daughters and his wife dressed in all-black traditional Korean wear followed the hearse.
"As the one in charge of the safety of the students, he was suffering from guilty feelings," another teacher had told Korean media.
Police have confirmed the contents of a note, which Kang left behind.
During this period, several students from the high school came to the funeral home to pay their respects to Kang's family.
"The vice principal really liked students," she said.
"Teacher Kang Min Kyu, please rest in peace.
"We are so sorry..." tweeted Kim Min Hyuk, a senior at the high school, who tweeted the name of the vice principal along with the names of other dead teachers from the ferry tragedy.
