"Tom is a caring father who dearly loves Suri," Cruise lawyer Bert Fields said.
The July 30 Life & Style cover read "SURI IN TEARS, ABANDONED BY HER DAD," under a photograph of Suri appearing to have tears in her eyes while in her mother's arms, the suit said.
"Tom doesn't go around suing people," Fields said.
Cruise will "undoubtedly" donate any judgment proceeds to charity, Fields said.
