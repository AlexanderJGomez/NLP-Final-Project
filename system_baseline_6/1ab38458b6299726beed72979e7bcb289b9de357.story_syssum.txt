(Financial Times) -- Walmart is taking a 51% stake in Yihaodian, a leading Chinese e-commerce website, in a significant move by the U.S. retailer to boost its online presence in China.
Walmart has more than 350 stores in China, where it has been making steady progress.
Mr Ashe said that, in addition to helping Walmart's e-commerce goals in China, the increased investment in Yihaodian would "further contribute to China's domestic consumption, help stabilize prices, and advance expansion in the middle and western regions" of China -- a nod to Beijing's oft-repeated desire to make progress on these goals in the current Five Year plan.
