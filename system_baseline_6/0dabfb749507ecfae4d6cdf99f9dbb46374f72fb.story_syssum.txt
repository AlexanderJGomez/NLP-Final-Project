(CNN) -- DNA has linked the slayings of three women, Philadelphia police said Tuesday night in announcing they are looking for a serial killer.
Analysis showed the three were killed by the same assailant, Clark said.
The victims all were choked, police said.
Police said a third assault victim was pulled into an alley earlier this month.
All victims were white females involved in prostitution and narcotics, police said.
