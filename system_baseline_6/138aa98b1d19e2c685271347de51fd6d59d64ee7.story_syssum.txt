The first African-American president is confronting the delicate issues of justice and discrimination after renewed violence this week in Ferguson, Missouri, sparked by a grand jury's decision not to indict a white police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown, a black youth, this summer.
Instead, Obama pledged to lead a national conversation on race and address the deep rooted belief in many communities of color "that our laws are not always being enforced uniformly."
"He doesn't want to be the black president.
"When Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son," Obama said.
He responded with a speech in Philadelphia in which Obama said Wright's views denigrated the "greatness and goodness of our nation" and rightly offended "white and black alike."
For five years after Obama's seminal speech on race in Philadelphia, he tried to avoid racial issues but stumbled over the controversial case of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. who was arrested in his own home in 2009.
But Obama has studiously avoided the debate over whether race is a factor in his sinking approval ratings.
Rogers Smith, co-author of  "Still a House Divided," a study of racial politics in the Obama era, said the president understood the symbolism.
