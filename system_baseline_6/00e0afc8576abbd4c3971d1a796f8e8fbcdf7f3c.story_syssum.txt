One-time basketball bad boy Ron Artest, who changed his name to Metta World Peace and said it was meaningful and inspirational, was ejected Sunday from the Los Angeles Lakers-Oklahoma City Thunder game for hitting James Harden in the head with his elbow.
The Thunder, they're playing for a championship this year, so I hope that he's OK and I apologize to the Thunder and to James Harden," he said.
World Peace's act was called "disgraceful" by game commentators, and sports analysts said the behavior was reminiscent of the ball player they once knew as Ron Artest.
Sports fans were baffled, some even amused, when World Peace announced last year that he planned to legally change his name from Ron Artest.
But in the world, peace sometimes comes with a price: The NBA is now reviewing World Peace's less than peaceable actions.
