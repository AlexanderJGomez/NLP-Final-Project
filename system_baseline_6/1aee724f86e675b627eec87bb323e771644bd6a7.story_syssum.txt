One proposed solution that didn't go anywhere was the DREAM Act, a bill that politicians passed around like a hot potato for more than a decade.
The Cuban-American GOP rock star and potential GOP vice presidential nominee is floating the idea of a modified DREAM Act that would keep undocumented immigrant students from being deported by giving them legal status in the form of a student visa followed by a work visa.
The idea was originally shared with me about five months ago by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who, along with her colleague, Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, was eager to find a way to break the stalemate over the DREAM Act and help get these young people out of legal limbo and on with their lives.
Democrats may think these kids are adorable, but they don't want to adopt them and become known as the "illegal immigrant party."
So what?
There are no good guys and bad guys, just both parties pushing their own interests without caring about what happens to a bunch of undocumented students.
What Rubio has in mind might not be perfect, but it's the only entree on the menu.
A Republican like Rubio has a cultural connection to Democrats like Gutierrez, Menendez and Gonzales.
