(CNN) -- The Seattle artist Moxie makes sculptures out of felted wool that are, like her, desperately playful and mad.
Even before her creative career took off, Moxie simplified her life and identity by changing her name to her nickname.
"Each poke, you are deciding what the piece will be and mean," she said.
I did an embroidery piece from the perspective of being behind a crowded street with a lot of people.
You never stop missing your parents.
What was that about?
...
Moxie: Wool, like every animal hair, has scales up and down each fiber.
Moxie: I believe in the high five.
Everyone has a context, a history that no one can know like you know your own.
Moxie: I can't watch films that are important to me, like any cinematography.
A relatively new one, "Back to Work," is about productivity and creative process.
Moxie published an instructional book, "I Felt Awesome" (North Light Books) in 2010.
