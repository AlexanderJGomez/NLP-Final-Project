(CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of marriage equality this week.
In 2013, the vast majority of Americans have moved beyond prejudice toward gays and lesbians.
The problem is that even while public opinion has reached an all-time high on marriage equality, old laws discriminating against gay and lesbian Americans have stayed on the books, hurting gay couples and their families.
Importantly, the court also strengthened the foundation upon which advocates and officials will one day achieve marriage equality nationwide.
