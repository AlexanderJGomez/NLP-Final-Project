Kennedy Space Center, Florida (CNN) -- NASA launched its Ares I-X rocket Wednesday, after multiple delays over two days because of bad weather.
As the clock ticked toward noon, NASA officials nervously awaited all-clears for technical items and a weather clearance from weather officer Kathy Winters who, time and again, said conditions were "red," meaning a no-go.
Before the launch, the space agency had begun negotiating with the Air Force to see if a Thursday launch attempt was possible.
If static surrounds the rocket, it can interfere with radio signals sent by or to the rocket.
The top of the rocket, known as the upper stage, includes a mock Orion crew capsule and a launch abort system.
