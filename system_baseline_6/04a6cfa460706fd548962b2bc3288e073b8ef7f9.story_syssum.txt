Swierczynski: "Fun & Games" is about an alcoholic house sitter who, one sunny California morning, finds himself squared off against the most lethal killers in the world.
(Or am I?
Swierczynski: I love books and movies about hit men.
Swierczynski: My love of noir and pulp grew right out of my teenage love of horror fiction (which I still love).
Swierczynski: Absolutely.
Swierczynski: Such a great question, because I leave for a cross-country book tour/road trip in a few weeks, and I've been obsessing about which books to pack.
Swierczynski: My first issue of "Birds of Prey," for DC Comics, will appear this September -- which is part of the companywide relaunch of every single title (all with new No.1 issues).
October brings "Hell & Gone," the sequel to "Fun & Games."
