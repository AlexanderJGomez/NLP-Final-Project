"I've been playing with a bad neck for a while," Woods told gathered reporters.
Woods revealed he had been troubled by the pain before last month's Masters, where he finished tied for fourth.
"I'm having a hard time with the pain," Woods said.
Mickelson could have leapfrogged Woods if he had won the Players, but he shot a closing 74 to tie for 17th.
