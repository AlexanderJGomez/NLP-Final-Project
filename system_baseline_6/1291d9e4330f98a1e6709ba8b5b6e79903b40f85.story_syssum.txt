"We just thought it was fitting," State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said.
Frein, 31, is charged with first-degree murder and other charges in a September 12 ambush outside the state police barracks in Blooming Grove.
The squad of 13 U.S. marshals -- armed like a military special operations squad -- found Frein at an abandoned airport near Tannersville, authorities said.
"He's been stashing food, he's been staying out in the woods," Noonan said.
"He had a lot of locations he knew how to hide in.
Tom Corbett said he expects authorities to make sure Frein stays safe.
Authorities have not discussed a motive but have said Frein has talked and written about hating law enforcement.
"Eric Frein had a mission that was to attack law enforcement," Noonan said.
There was no indication that anyone was helping Frein, who was "quite well-prepared," Noonan said.
But with Frein in custody, the trick-or-treating will go on as normal, said Barrett Township Board Chairman Ralph Megliola.
We are so proud of our Pennsylvania State Police, their hard work," another said.
