--Anders Breivik was " a little bit surprised" that his attacks succeeded, his lawyer Geir Lippestad says Tuesday, adding that Breivik had not expected to get to Utoya Island.
Breivik says the deaths are the price the Labour Party had to pay for its "treason," the judge says.
--Police announce Monday that the number of confirmed dead in the bombing is eight, an increase of one from previous reports.
--Police say they are investigating Breivik claims that two other terror cells assisted him in the attack.
Ringerike hospital chief surgeon Colin Poole says he has never seen gunshot wounds like those of the victims from the island, and speculates the injuries were caused by expanding or "dum-dum" bullets, a hospital spokesman says.
