President Barack Obama has signed a covert directive authorizing U.S. support for Syrian rebels battling President Bashar al-Assad's forces, U.S. officials told CNN on Wednesday.
Diplomatic sources have also said the United States is providing intelligence on Syrian troop movements, which is then passed to rebel groups.
Foreign policy experts on Wednesday urged the Obama administration to increase its support of the armed opposition.
The State Department said Wednesday the United States has set aside $25 million for "nonlethal" assistance to the Syrian opposition, with another $64 million in humanitarian assistance for the Syrian people.
