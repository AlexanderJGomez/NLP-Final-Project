With one vote on Friday, the Republican-led House launched the latest spending battle in Congress -- one that could bring a government shutdown in less than two weeks.
"It's up to Senate Democrats to follow House Republicans and show some responsibility," Cantor said.
Government shutdown: Again?
Cantor said Friday the House would consider a one-year debt ceiling measure next week that contains other conservative-backed proposals, expected to include postponing implementation of Obamacare for a year and approving the Keystone oil pipeline from Canada.
In addition, the White House said Thursday that Obama would veto the House spending resolution defunding Obamacare if it reaches his desk.
On the House floor on Friday, legislators warned of the serious consequences of a government shutdown.
Instead, the Senate is expected to strip the measure of all provisions defunding Obamacare and send it back to the House.
"Will he act as the captain of the entire House of Representatives or remain a captive of his right wing Republican mates?"
Meanwhile, Democratic resolve is bolstered by surveys showing most people oppose a government shutdown and more would blame Republicans if it happens.
