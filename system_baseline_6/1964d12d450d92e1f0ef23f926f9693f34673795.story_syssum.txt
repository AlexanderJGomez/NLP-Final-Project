Aberdeen, Maryland (CNN) -- The man who abducted the mother of Baltimore Orioles legend Cal Ripken Jr. from her Maryland home restrained her and appeared to have used her credit cards, a law enforcement official said Wednesday.
He also said police don't know of any relationship between the suspect and the Ripken family.
Rich Wolf, a spokesman for the FBI in Baltimore, said the FBI is helping local police investigate the case.
He died in 1999.
