Speaking to reporters ahead of this week's summit of the Group of Eight industrialized nations in Japan, Bush said he did not need to skip the ceremony to show his position on religious freedom and human rights in China.
Bush assured Japan that the issue of North Korea's past kidnappings of Japanese citizens will not be ignored by the United States.
Bush said the United States and Japan leads the world in research on clean technologies.
As world leaders began arriving for the summit, more than 1,000 people protested in northern Japan against the event.
"What's essential in this summit for George W. Bush is to make sure the world economy does not spin downward," he said.
