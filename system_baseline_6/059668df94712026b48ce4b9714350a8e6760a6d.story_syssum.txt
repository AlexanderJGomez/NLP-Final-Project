Washington (CNN) -- Republicans are spending the final weekend of campaigning before Tuesday's election sizing up the possibility of their first Senate majority in nearly a decade, but with key races still too close to call.
In Kentucky, Sen. Mitch McConnell, the man in line to cap a long career on Capitol Hill by becoming Senate majority leader if Republicans win on Tuesday, appears to have opened a small gap over his Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes.
Georgia will meanwhile on Sunday hold the final debate before election day of a compelling race between Michelle Nunn and Republican David Perdue, in which Democrats are hopeful of pulling off a shock win.
Two Senate races, in Louisiana and Georgia could trigger run-off elections, so it is possible the fate of the chamber will be in limbo for weeks.
