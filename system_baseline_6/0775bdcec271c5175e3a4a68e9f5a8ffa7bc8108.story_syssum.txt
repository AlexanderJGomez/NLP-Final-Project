The New Zealand activist from the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, standing trial in Tokyo District Court, said that he believed bottles of butyric acid he threw at the Shonan Maru 2 whaling ship were non-toxic and would not harm anyone.
In court last week, Bethune admitted to all the charges, except for assault.
Prosecutors say the butyric acid burned two crew members of the Japanese whaling fleet, but Sea Shepherd calls it a harmless, albeit rancid, liquid.
