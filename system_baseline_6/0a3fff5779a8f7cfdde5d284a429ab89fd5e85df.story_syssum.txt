Three months after the White House released a single photograph taken during a photo op of "Air Force One" flying over New York -- a flight that caused panic on the streets below -- the U.S. Air Force on Friday released the remaining 145 photos taken during the flight.
"Thanks for the heads up on sensitivities in the New York area," an Air Force colonel wrote in an e-mail two days before the flight.
"We...need to construct some sort of timeline on when folks became aware of it if that is possible," one Air Force official wrote, responding to the public interest.
It continues: "Web site blog comments 'furious' at best.
Admit mistake," it concludes.
The VC-25 aircraft is designated "Air Force One" only when the president is aboard.
"I have concluded that the controversy surrounding the Presidential Airlift Group's aerial photo shoot over New York City has made it impossible for me to effectively lead the White House Military Office," Caldera said in a letter to Obama.
