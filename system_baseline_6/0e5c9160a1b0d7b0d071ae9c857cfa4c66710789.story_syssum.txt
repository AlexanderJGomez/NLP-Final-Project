Roland Martin says there's an assumption the word "qualified" needs to be used for women, minorities.
(CNN) -- I couldn't help but laugh this morning when I saw the headline for a debate on Politico.com: "Should Obama feel obliged to appoint a qualified woman, African American or Hispanic to the Supreme Court?
If you think about it, there never seems to be an assumption when white men are being discussed that they are unqualified.
Why do we as a society feel the need to say it's important to have "qualified" women or minorities?
She would go on and on about being a white liberal but would often talk about how hard it was to find "qualified" minorities for jobs.
And yes, I've seen a host of qualified white men, white women, African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians and Native Americans hired for jobs, and they've done a fantastic job.
It's simply time that when it comes to women or minorities, we should retire the use of word "qualified."
