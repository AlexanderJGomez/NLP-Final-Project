(CNN) -- "You've got to save your best leadership for home."
I'm on my way home," she said after school was dismissed early, and parents were rushing to get their children.
Midnight approached and my wife told me she hadn't been able to move the car at all since 10 p.m.
I called Georgia State Patrol and explained to them that my wife and kids were stranded in a vehicle among hundreds of other vehicles.
I called local authorities and was told the same thing.
On Facebook, I posted: "More than 14 and a half hours, my wife and kids remain stranded in car stuck in traffic because of snow.
I felt so guilty about it all.
I called the Georgia State Patrol and local authorities one more time.
I told them if police couldn't get my family , it was time for me to try.
Against advice of the local and state authorities, I'm going to try."
I was leading my family home.
