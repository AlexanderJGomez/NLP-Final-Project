Video from the patrol car of North Charleston's Michael Slager shows an initial traffic stop and early interactions between the officer and Scott.
Scott family attorney Chris Stewart told CNN the man with Scott was a co-worker and friend.
When asked what might have motivated Scott to run, Justin Bamberg, another attorney for the family, speculated that Scott might have been concerned about child support issues.
In the police report that CNN obtained, a responding officer said that Slager said that at one point he started to chase Scott down a street.
He had control of Scott," Santana said.
She saw Scott and Slager at the entrance to a vacant lot.
Feidin showed the video to the Scott family.
The video shows Slager shooting eight times at Scott as Scott runs away.
Scott, who was unarmed, was black.
"He has his family, and Mr. Scott also has his family," he told Holt.
"I have watched the video, and I was sickened by what I saw," North Charleston police Chief Eddie Driggers told reporters Wednesday.
Summey said that the city has ordered an additional 150 body cameras "so every officer on the street" in the city will have one.
"We can't get into the brain of another individual, so we can't state that," Scott family attorney Stewart said.
"There was not a struggle for the Taser," Anthony Scott said.
And, so far, the demonstrations have been passionate but peaceful.
