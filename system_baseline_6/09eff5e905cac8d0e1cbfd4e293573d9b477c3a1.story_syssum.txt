(CNN) -- When looking at the world's lowest unemployment rates, one of the first things you might notice is that many of the countries are in Southeast Asia.
Speaking of the U.S., its unemployment rate is 9.2%, which ranks it close to the bottom among the countries on our table of 67 countries.
Tunisia, the first government to fall, had an unemployment rate of 13% one month before its revolution.
But it's Spain, at 21.3%, that has the highest unemployment rate in the EU.
