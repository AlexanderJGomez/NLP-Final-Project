On Sunday, Europe inflicted an identical comeback on Davis Love III's Americans as Martin Kaymer held his nerve to hole the most dramatic of putts and ensure a 14 1/2 - 13 1/2 point victory for Jose Maria Olazabal's team.
While the U.S. had dominated the first two days of the competition, they simply had no answer to a European team determined to honor Ballesteros' memory.
"Ollie said to us at the start of the week, Ryder Cup is what memories and dreams are made of, and he's been awesome," explained an emotional Poulter.
Scotland's Paul Lawrie, playing in the Ryder Cup for the first time since Brookline 13 years ago, claimed Europe's second point of the day, thrashing FedEx Cup playoff winner Brandt Snedeker 5&3.
Big-hitter Dustin Johnson got the first point of the day for the U.S. following a 3&2 win over the equally powerful Nicolas Colsaerts of Belgium.
That left Europe on 14 points and Italian Francesco Molinari secured the half point needed to win the cup outright after finishing level with 14-time major winner Tiger Woods.
"They played very, very well," said U.S. captain Love III.
It's not good for us, but it's good for golf this Ryder Cup."
