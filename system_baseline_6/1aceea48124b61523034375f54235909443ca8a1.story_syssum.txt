Lakey didn't know who Schaffner was at first, but said he felt something wasn't right after seeing Schaffner and his car, partly because Schaffner didn't make eye contact with him.
Schaffner faces charges including bank robbery in Tennessee; burglary in Indiana; armed robbery in Illinois; and receiving stolen property in Ohio, Price said.
A spokeswoman for the Callaway County Jail, in Fulton, Missouri, said Schaffner was booked into the facility about 8 p.m. Saturday.
"This guy has made no effort to hide the gun," said FBI agent Kevin Keithley last month.
When Schaffner was identified, the FBI said he was released from an Indiana prison last year following an armed robbery conviction.
The man said he'd known Schaffner for about two months, according to a federal criminal complaint.
