But Macdonald said that the situation involved Dobbs and his Dobbs Group hiring contractors that she said used undocumented workers.
Dobbs, who called the article a "hit piece," countered that he had no legal right to do so.
Macdonald said Dobbs is responsible for those working at his properties.
In the article posted Wednesday on The Nation's website and headlined "Lou Dobbs, American Hypocrite," the leftist political magazine reports that Dobbs hired contractors who used illegal immigrants for landscaping work and caring for horses ridden by his daughter, Hillary Dobbs, a champion show jumper.
In particular, he has said that employers who hire illegal immigrants should be prosecuted.
According to the article, the man said an old friend worked at a stable owned by Dobbs and promised the man work as a groom at a Vermont stable contracted to care for horses owned by the Dobbs Group, which is headed by Dobbs.
"You put out an article that is being used by the left-wing press as a hammer on me," Dobbs told Macdonald.
Dobbs said he has done nothing wrong and is being targeted.
