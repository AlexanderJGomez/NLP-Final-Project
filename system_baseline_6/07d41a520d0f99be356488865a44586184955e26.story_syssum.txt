says Huntsman.
His family "has put about $400 million into the cancer center, and we've raised about a billion dollars for cancer research (overall)," he says.
"There's just a certain joy in your heart to be able to help somebody else -- even when you're struggling," he says.
That dedication goes back decades.
Huntsman himself has also battled cancer, and has survived prostate cancer, mouth cancer and two types of skin cancer.
