(CNN)Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has called for a "religious revolution," asking Muslim leaders to help in the fight against extremism.
"We need a revolution of the self, a revolution of consciousness and ethics to rebuild the Egyptian person -- a person that our country will need in the near future," the President said.
It's antagonizing the entire world!
The real question is: How credible can such a state-empowered counternarrative be?"
We will love each other," el-Sisi said in that speech.
