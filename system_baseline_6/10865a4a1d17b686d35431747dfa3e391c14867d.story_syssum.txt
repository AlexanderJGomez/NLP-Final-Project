Despite all this, Lilly's heart is really in writing.
Lilly: Tauriel was half as daunting as a character from the book.
CNN: Since she is not in the book, we don't know what will become of her.
But there's a lot more emotional material for Tauriel in this film, which is good to see.
There's nothing as pleasurable to me as writing.
If this wasn't the right fit -- an amazing job that most people would covet -- I thought that writing would be that.
Lilly: She is the daughter of the founders of The Avengers, Ant-Man and the Wasp.
This one is very much a heist film.
