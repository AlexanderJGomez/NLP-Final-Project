(CNN) -- In brief remarks to the media just after returning to her hometown of Seattle, an emotional Amanda Knox thanked those who believed in her and supported her fight to overturn her murder conviction in Italy.
Knox and her family were on a British Airways flight that landed in Seattle about 8:12 p.m.
Knox supporters in Seattle said they planned a rousing welcome.
Asked what she'll say when she sees Knox, Ralph told KOMO, "I won't say anything.
Whitney said she "cried with joy" when Knox's conviction was overturned.
Jordan Adams said he thought Knox was guilty, but he was willing to accept the decision to overturn the conviction.
But later, another resident walked up to a CNN crew to say that she could not "care less about Knox returning home" and that she believed Knox committed the crime.
