Gary Leon Ridgway, dubbed the Green River serial killer, pleaded guilty in 2003 to killing 48 women, including Major, though her remains hadn't been identified at the time, West said.
"We are grateful to finally know what happened to Sandra after all these years," the family statement said.
Since the last contact with Sandra had been the letter from Seattle, we decided to make contact with investigators to see if Sandra was one of the unidentified victims," the family statement said.
A total of three sets of remains in the Ridgway case have yet to be unidentified, West said.
