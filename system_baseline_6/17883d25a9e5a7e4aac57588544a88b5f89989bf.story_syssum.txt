(CNN) -- A spike in napa cabbage prices has South Koreans sweating over their national side dish, kimchi.
Some Koreans are looking for the government to do more, such as subsidize cabbage sales, said Eun Jeong Lee, a researcher at Seoul-based ZenKimchi.com.
Korean families typically gather and make kimchi together in late October or early November, before winter sets in.
