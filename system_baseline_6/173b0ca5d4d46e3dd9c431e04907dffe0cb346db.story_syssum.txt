Washington (CNN) -- Public schools in Western states can continue teacher-led reciting of the Pledge of Allegiance, after a federal court ruled against a group of atheist parents.
Among them is Michael Newdow, a prominent attorney and atheist, who had brought his long-standing dispute to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2004.
Newdow said he'll ask for a rehearing and, if that fails, will appeal to the Supreme Court.
The same court in 2002 agreed with Newdow and other atheist parents.
It was originally worded: "I pledge allegiance to my flag and the republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."
"Today, the court got it absolutely right: Recitation of the pledge is a patriotic exercise, not a religious prayer.
