PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (CNN)  -- At least 50 people have died in a school collapse in in Petionville, near the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince, officials said Friday night.
Haitian press reports said the school has kindergarten, primary and secondary students.
Michaele Gedeon, president of Haiti's Red Cross, said she heard the voices of distraught children as rescuers tried to calm them while she was on the phone attempting to coordinate emergency rescue efforts.
Trinite is the only hospital open in Port-au-Prince, the group said.
