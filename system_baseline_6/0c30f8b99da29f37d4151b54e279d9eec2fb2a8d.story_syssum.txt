Thomas at first didn't want to turn to the United States' food safety net, the food stamp program, for help.
In October, more than one in 10 people -- about 31 million -- were using the food stamp program to get by, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Thomas, who said he had been working steadily since he was 13 years old, now receives $175 per month for food.
"It's definitely been a blessing to me," he said of the food stamp program, which, since October, has gone by the name Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
Even with federal assistance, she said, she sometimes has to make a meal for herself out of crackers or food scraps.
Her monthly food stamp payment is $489, she said.
The SNAP program is meant to supplement a person's food budget, not cover all food expenses, said Jean Daniel, a spokesperson for the USDA, which administers the program.
With food prices high, she said, grocery shopping is stressful.
Food stamp "benefits aren't really enough for a healthy diet," said Jim Weill, president of the nonprofit Food Research and Action Center.
All SNAP recipients are eligible for free nutritional counseling to help people stretch their food budgets, said Daniel, of the USDA.
"I say about food stamps what Winston Churchill said about democracy: 'It's the worst possible system except all the others,' " said Joel Berg, executive director of the New York Coalition Against Hunger.
But the food stamp program is somewhat successful, he said.
For now, he's just happy to continue the job search without the pain of hunger nagging at his stomach.
