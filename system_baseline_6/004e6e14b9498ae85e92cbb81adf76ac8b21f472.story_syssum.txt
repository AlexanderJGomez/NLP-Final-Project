"We're not just robots they send out there," umpire Tim McClelland (2nd from L) told author Bruce Weber.
Umpires?
Umpires, on the other hand, rarely get written about at all -- in fact, they're often treated as less than human.
Umpires need that presence because they're often baseball's most disrespected men.
And yet Major League Baseball doesn't participate in umpire training or development, entrusting it to two umpire-run private schools, Weber observes.
He talks about panic overtaking a pitcher, as it did for Darling in a 1984 game in which he got pasted by the Cubs; he also addresses the rush of pitching in a World Series game and -- in a treat for baseball fans -- goes over the extra innings in perhaps the most famous college baseball game ever, a 1981 extra-inning contest that Darling's Yale Bulldogs lost to Frank Viola's St. John's Redmen, 1-0.
Pitchers get more support than umpires, of course.
Weber says his time with umpires has made him much more sympathetic to their judgmental tasks.
"Umpires are people, too," veteran ump Tim McClelland told Weber.
We're not just robots they send out there."
