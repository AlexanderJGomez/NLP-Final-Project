"The entire Grand Prix of America team is thrilled to join the 2014 FIA calendar and we look forward to bringing world class Formula One racing to New Jersey," race promoter Leo Hindery, Jr. said.
Korea, the destination for the next race of this season, has been moved forward to April and has also been given provisional status on the 2014 calendar.
The New Jersey race has already been postponed once, having been initially scheduled for June this year.
The race will be held at the Red Bull Ring, which staged the Austrian Grand Prix between 1970 and 1987 in its former guise as the Osterreichring.
But Pirelli have since introduced a new tire structure for the second half of the season and the FIA has agreed the company will continue to showcase its rubber in motorsport's elite racing series.
