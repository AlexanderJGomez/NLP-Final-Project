The battle over health care reform has energized people on both sides of the debate.
Acknowledging the skepticism at a town hall meeting Tuesday, Obama tried to alleviate fears that reform would take something away.
"I think that's the fear," said Diana Owen, an associate professor of political science and the director of American studies at Georgetown University.
"I really do think that it was an issue, and I think the opponents of the health care plan, by bringing that back up again ...
"It's not anti-reform -- it's anti-bad reform," Cannon said.
Coming out of one of her town hall meetings Monday, Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, said that "people are just getting information that's flat wrong."
"I don't think that this is debate that is going to go away," Owen said, noting that given the outpouring seen at the town hall meetings, Congress can't just pick up where it left off when it returns from break.
