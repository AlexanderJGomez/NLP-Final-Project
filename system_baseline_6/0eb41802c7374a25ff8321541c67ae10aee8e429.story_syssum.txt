(CNN) -- "The Voice" crowned Texas teen Danielle Bradbery its new winner on Tuesday, proving to the country singer that she could do what she'd thought to be impossible.
Bradbery is "The Voice's" youngest winner, and also the third victor in a row from coach Blake Shelton's team.
New "The Voice" coach Usher Raymond saw one of his mentees, Michelle Chamuel, land in second place, while the Swon Brothers from Shelton's team came in third.
If you can figure out how to do that, and I think 'The Voice' has, then you're doing something right."
