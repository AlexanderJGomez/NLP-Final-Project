I tested the Powerbag messenger bag for about a month, and I also spent a brief time using the backpack, which is very similar.
For one, the idea of carrying a battery about the size of a deck of cards on my back in the rain is not comforting.
Now I need to charge my shoulder bag, too?
On a single charge, it can completely fill about two small gadgets -- a phone and iPod, for example.
The cap and charging port located on the side of the bag snapped off a few days after I started testing it, and so from then on, I had to take the battery out and plug the cord in directly whenever I needed to refuel.
The RFA spokesman said this was only an issue with pre-production models, like the one I tested, and that it's been fixed for the bags sold in stores.
