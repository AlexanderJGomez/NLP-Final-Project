(CNN) -- Britain and France are calling for an additional 3,000 United Nations troops in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the U.N. already has its biggest peacekeeping mission, a senior British diplomat said Wednesday.
"Since August 28, fighting has intensified in many areas, causing deaths, rapes, lootings, forced recruitment and further displacements of civilian populations," the local coalition wrote.
Another aid group, World Vision, says the conflict in the African country is the deadliest since World War II.
Georgette Gagnon, the executive director for the Africa division of Human Rights Watch, said she also would like to see the European Union send troops.
A spokeswoman for the British mission to the United Nations said London is "not ruling in or out EU forces," instead focusing on strengthening the U.N. presence in eastern Congo.
