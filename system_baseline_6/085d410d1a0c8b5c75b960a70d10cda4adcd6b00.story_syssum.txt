The U.S. announcement came after North Korea recently threatened a pre-emptive nuclear attack on South Korea and the United States in response to stepped-up U.N. Security Council sanctions over its latest nuclear test last month.
North Korea on Saturday responded to the U.S. announcement by criticizing what it described as the Americans' "hostile policy" and saying it won't negotiate with them over its nuclear program.
North Korea responded angrily to the U.N. measures, vowing to carry out its third nuclear test.
