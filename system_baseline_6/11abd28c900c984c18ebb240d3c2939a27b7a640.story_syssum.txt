Washington (CNN) -- When Rosalind Cron left home in the 1940s to join a teenage girl jazz band called the International Sweethearts of Rhythm, she had no idea what it would be like, as a white girl, traveling with the predominantly black band.
And as far as I know, we didn't," she said.
"The director of the music was named White," Wong said.
The name "Rabbit" has stuck to this day.
Cron told the group that if music is your passion, you need to stick with it.
"Don't let anyone come between you and your horns, or music," she added.
