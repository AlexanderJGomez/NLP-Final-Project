(CNN) -- Lawyers for former Penn State assistant coach Jerry Sandusky, who was convicted on multiple counts of child sex abuse, argued a motion for a new trial Thursday.
Cleland could easily rule that evidence presented at the criminal trial was so overwhelming -- the victims' testimony, for instance -- that the defense's concerns would not have changed the end result, said Karl Rominger, one of Sandusky's lawyers.
Jurors convicted Sandusky on 45 out of 48 sexual abuse counts.
Amendola and Rominger have also filed a motion to have Sandusky's sentence reconsidered.
