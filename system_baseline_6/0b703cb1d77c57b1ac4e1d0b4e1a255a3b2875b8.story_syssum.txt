Military action in Syria, he said this weekend as he sought congressional approval, will be limited.
But a U.S. attack could potentially widen, rather than halt, the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
By intervening now to inflict limited punishment on al-Assad because chemical weapons have been used, the United States is erecting a precedent that could be exploited in the future by the more unscrupulous factions of the opposition looking to provoke further interventions.
So what will the United States do the next time chemical weapons are used in Syria?
Can it refuse to live up to its own precedent if 10,000 Syrians were killed in a fresh massacre after Obama's "limited" intervention has concluded?
But in Syria, there's every chance that it will escalate the conflict.
Ultimately tantalizing the losing side in the Syrian civil war with a brief, punitive, "limited" entry on its behalf will only hasten the creation of conditions that will eventually suck America back into the conflict.
