Among 2013 films, Man of Steel had the second best debut of the year behind Iron Man 3, which started with $174.1 million in May.
Man of Steel also clobbered the debut of 2006′s Superman Returns, which opened with $52.5 million and earned $200 million domestically against a $270 million budget.
In about one week, Man of Steel will likely have surpassed that film's domestic total.
Internationally, Man of Steel soared with $71.6 million in its first weekend, including $17.6 million in the United Kingdom and $9.8 million in Mexico.
The $160 million Universal release has now earned $219.6 million total, surpassing Fast Five's $209.8 million cume and making it the highest grossing Fast film domestically.
The thriller, which earned a weak "C" CinemaScore has now earned $51.8 million and may have to settle for a finish in the $60-65 million range — a very low number considering The Purge opened with $34.1 million.
Man of Steel -- $113.1 million
The Purge -- $8.2 million
