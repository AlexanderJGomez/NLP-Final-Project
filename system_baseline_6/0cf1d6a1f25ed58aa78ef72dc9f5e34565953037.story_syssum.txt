(CNN) -- What do NSA leaker Edward Snowden and a red panda at the National Zoo in Washington have in common?
And both have connections to China: Red pandas are native to southwestern China while Snowden recently traveled to Hong Kong, off southeastern China.
The zoo had tweeted several facts about Rusty, warning zoo visitors that he is still a wild animal and would bite if cornered or scared.
"Now Putin has a Super Bowl ring, Ed Snowden AND a red panda," tweeted @MicahGrimes.
"Is there bamboo in Ecuador?"
This isn't the first escaped zoo animal to inspire an attention-getting parody account.
The @NationalZoo account thanked its fans on Twitter and Facebook for helping recover Rusty.
