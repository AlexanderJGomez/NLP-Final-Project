It's Huawei.
At company headquarters in Shenzhen in southern China, I talked to Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei's Consumer Business Group.
Despite the trust issues and the fact that many Americans can't even pronounce the name of the company, Huawei has sold and will continue to sell its phones in America under the Huawei brand.
"Gradually, step by step, more and more people will trust Huawei," said Yu.
But that's not good enough for Huawei.
Would you buy a Huawei smartphone?
Not yet.
