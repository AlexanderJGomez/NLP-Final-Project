It's doable, according to the Union for International Cancer Control and International Agency for Research on Cancer, if countries adopt measures to meet the "25 by 25" targets the World Health Organization set last year.
In fact, "more (cancer) deaths occur in lower and middle-income countries, than in high-income high cancer countries, even though there are twice as many cases in high-income countries," said Peter Boyle, president of the International Prevention Research Institute in Lyon, France.
According to his report, more than 1.6 million women worldwide will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year, compared with about 641,000 in 1980.
For example, in Kenya and Uganda, 100% of women seek help with advanced or metastatic breast cancer, said Boyle.
Two had breast cancer, and one had cervical cancer.
The summit launched its own "25" goal: to improve breast cancer survival and quality of life in 2.5 million women living in low- and middle-income countries by 2025.
