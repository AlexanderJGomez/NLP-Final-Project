(CNN) -- Elvis was singing in the men's room.
.
The other night I was eating at the restaurant and, of course, Elvis was singing in the men's room.
But now, in the dwindling weeks of 2011, in the BrickTop's men's room, here was Elvis singing, and here was Barbara Hearn's autograph.
"Well, I suppose it's all right if my name is on a restroom wall," she said.
Jim Smith went out to their car, where he knew there was a photo of Elvis and Barbara; he brought it into the restaurant, and she signed it so the waiter could give it to the boss when he came in.
Why?
Elvis?
In the photo, Barbara is prim in a white dress with dark polka-dots; Elvis is slouched and shirtless.
I said yes, I thought it was.
("I didn't hold it against him at all," Barbara told me.
She said she'd had no idea, until I told her.
