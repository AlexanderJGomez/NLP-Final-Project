Now, however, comes the time to be explicit: to speak out loud his affiliation, his fraternal pride and concern.
African-American men certainly could use an intervention from the most successful African-American man in history.
Asked why he hadn't done more to remedy the catastrophic rate of African-American unemployment, Obama said, "I can't pass laws that say I'm just helping black folks.
Nobody understands, like this audience will, the contortions a successful African-American man has to make to fit in but stand out, to be strong but not intimidate or frighten, to be black enough but not too black.
The president isn't the only black man who needs to step up support of his brothers.
President Obama cannot, on his own, reverse this course, but he can do much more than he has to disrupt the flow of the one in three young black men who are headed to prison.
African-American men feel a special kinship with this president.
