Republican House Speaker John Boehner informed President Barack Obama that he would not bring a vote on immigration reform to the floor this year.
Then, Republican leadership announced they wouldn't move on immigration reform unless the majority of the Republican caucus supported it, even though the votes were there to pass reform and poll after poll showed the majority of the American people support reforming our immigration system.
A week later Republicans said they couldn't move on immigration reform because they couldn't trust the President to enforce the law.
Republicans have used every excuse in the book to block a bill that would have actually addressed their biggest priorities when it comes to immigration reform -- border security, enforcement, employment verification, high tech visas etc.
No more.
The President proved that he's willing to go to bat for immigration reform.
Mr. President, America is behind you on this every step of the way.
