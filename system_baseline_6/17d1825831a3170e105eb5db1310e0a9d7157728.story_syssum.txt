Officers also have used excessive force on those "who are mentally ill or in crisis," the Justice Department said.
The Justice Department's report said it now appears that what they heard was the car backfiring.
After the suspect was handcuffed and lying on the ground, officers used excessive force by kicking him in the head numerous times, the report said.
Many officers were there, but none identified any fellow officers who had exacted excessive force on the suspect, and no officer was disciplined, the Justice Department said.
Mark had committed no crime, was strapped down and was in the midst of a medical crisis," the Justice Department report says.
It's one illustration, the Justice Department's report says, that "officer training instills in officers an 'us-against-them' mentality."
The incident sparked even more outrage amid high tensions over Michael Brown's shooting death in Missouri and similar situations that have put police use of force under a microscope.
Williams told reporters his officers are committed to improving the department.
"We will work to make this police department better," he said.
