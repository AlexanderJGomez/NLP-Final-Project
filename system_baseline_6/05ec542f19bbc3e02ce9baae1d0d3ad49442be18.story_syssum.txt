(CNN) -- In an auction featuring memorabilia from the Beatles, Madonna and Elvis Presley, it was Michael Jackson who proved to be king.
The jacket wasn't the only piece of history from the late King of Pop that was part of the auction.
The King of Pop's closest competition at the auction was the Beatles, which had a number of items for sale.
