(CNN) -- Zabiullah Mujahid, one of two spokesmen for Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, spoke recently with CNN's Nic Robertson about the war in Afghanistan and the Taliban's relationship with al Qaeda.
And No.
Mujahid: First I want to tell you this is not an election, it is selection.
I told you clearly it is what the U.S. wants in Afghanistan, and yesterday as announced by our leader Mullah brother we will target the Afghan parliamentary members and government officials so if there are elections yes it is clear we will target them.
Mujahid: I want to tell you clearly we have different kinds of tactics.
Where there is the combat war, we will do it in that place.
We will fight them and we will target them.
Mujahid: I will clearly tell you.
CNN: Some people say President Obama has made Afghanistan a very big part of his foreign policy.
I want to tell you clearly we will win, and they will die.
We want to negotiate and they will not interfere in our affairs.
Third, leave the Afghan people to do what they want to do, like the Islamic government they want to establish.
We will announce the people.
Mujahid: I want to tell you clearly it is war.
I will tell you we will win; we have the support of Muslim nations and this is what we believe.
Mujahid: Taliban is one thing and al Qaeda is another.
?
Mujahid: We are from this country; we are the boss.
