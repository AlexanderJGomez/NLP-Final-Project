But a recently leaked video suggests the war between the Communist government and its opponents has shifted to a new battlefield: the internet.
CNN wasn't able to verify the authenticity of the video.
But she said there are also very important differences -- namely Cuba's low internet penetration.
According to the leaked video, the Cuban government's fear is that U.S.-backed dissidents will use social networks like Twitter and Facebook to incite unrest.
Nonetheless, Cuba isn't turning its back on the internet.
"They have their bloggers and we have our bloggers," the unidentified man in the video says at one point.
As a result, the government has said it cannot offer internet access to the broader population, lacking the money to create the necessary infrastructure to support it.
