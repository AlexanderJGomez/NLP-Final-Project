While its supporters say "KONY 2012" has raised much-needed awareness about Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony, critics say the film is inaccurate, oversimplified, and distracting from more effective charity work in Uganda.
Invisible Children has been criticized for everything from how the group made "Kony 2012" to how it spends its money.
Co-founder and film narrator Jason Russell told CNN's Piers Morgan that the group is not a traditional on-the-ground development charity.
Critics say "KONY 2012" will draw resources away from more effective charity organizations while reinforcing the idea that Africans are helpless and that Westerners must intervene to save them.
Despite the negative attention heaped on Invisible Children, CNN's Amanpour says that any raised awareness of Kony and his crimes is a net positive.
