(CNN) -- I was born in Tallahassee, Florida, in 1954, the year of the landmark school desegregation case, Brown v. Board of Education.
But 60 years after racial segregation was outlawed in schools, public education is again segregating along racial lines.
As school districts move back to "neighborhood school" policies, white students will likely have less school contact with people of color than their parents had.
At most highly segregated white schools, middle-class students are in the majority.
Children of color in under-resourced, racially isolated schools also need these same tools.
Providing these resources equitably is a daunting task, one that has never been accomplished in the history of education in the United States.
