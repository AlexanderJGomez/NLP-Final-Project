(CNN) -- Two Alaskan volcanoes that began minor eruptions weeks ago are showing their strongest seismic activity yet, emitting small amounts of lava and ash along with smoke plumes, the Alaska Volcano Observatory said Tuesday.
Veniaminof, about 60 miles from Pavlof, started showing activity in early June and began erupting June 13, Schneider said.
The main hazard now, Schneider said, is ash fall, which is more of a nuisance than anything else.
