New York (CNN) -- New York City will pay  more than $7 million to settle a civil lawsuit brought by the estate of a man killed by police outside a Queens' nightclub in 2006 and by his two friends, who were seriously wounded, a spokeswoman for the city's Law Department said Tuesday.
Undercover officers, who were investigating the club regarding prostitution allegations, said they identified themselves as police, but witnesses and the wounded men said they did not.
The department issued a  statement saying that after a "careful and thorough" review, there is not enough  evidence to prove that New York Police Department detectives "acted willfully"  when they opened fire on Bell and his friends.
"We will always pursue justice for the family of Sean Bell, Joseph Guzman  and Trent Benefield."
