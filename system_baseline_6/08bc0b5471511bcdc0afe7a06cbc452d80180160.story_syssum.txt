New York (CNN) -- For Angel Rojas, the daily bus ride through the streets of Brooklyn provided a respite from a hardscrabble existence juggling two low-paying jobs.
A young man boarded the bus, police said.
"The stupidity of those gangs that basically, over nothing, are trying to kill each other and, unfortunately, in the process, kill innocents as they did with this hard working young man trying to raise his family," Bratton said.
"He was the sole provider," Guerrero said.
Guerrero said, "He was just sitting on a bus.
His laughter and his presence stayed with you."
