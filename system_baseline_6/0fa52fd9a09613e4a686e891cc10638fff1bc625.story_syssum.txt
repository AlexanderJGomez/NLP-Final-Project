Fans of the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy can tour a New Zealand farm that was used as the setting for Hobbiton.
It was like, 'I can't believe I'm actually here,' " Maro said.
Tours highlighting sites used during the filming of "The Sound of Music" have many visitors singing with joy in Salzburg, Austria.
The movie was played on the bus during the tour, and the sightseers were encouraged to sing along, prompting Van Baren to wonder what the locals must think of the visitors.
Movie and TV fans who want to stay closer to home to explore famous locations have plenty of movie tours to choose from in the United States.
But the most popular tour focuses on sites used in the television and big screen hit "Sex and the City," Gacanja said.
For Maro, the experience in New Zealand was so unforgettable, she went again a year later for another look at "The Lord of the Rings" sites.
It was just a great trip," she said.
