(CNN) -- Here's what Katie Roche expected when she went into the hospital for spine surgery: two titanium rods, a bone graft, 17 screws in her vertebrae, eight hours in the operating room, and a week's stay in the hospital to recover.
The study looked at 10.5 million pediatric patients from 1997 to 2006, of whom 21,274, or 0.2%, had C. diff, as the bacteria are commonly called.
Doctors found Katie had an infection -- not C. diff, but another bacterium -- and did a surgery to clear it up.
Katie and her parents didn't know it, but her situation was the perfect storm for a C. diff infection.
Three years ago, the hospital had 5.3 C. diff infections for every 1,000 hospital admissions, and in the past three years it's had none at all, according to Dr. Alfonso Torress-Cook, epidemiologist for the hospital.
If your hospital doesn't offer yogurt, Torress-Cook suggests that you bring it in yourself and that one serving a day is enough to help protect your child.
Know the signs of C. diff infection
"Parents are with their kids all the time," he says.
The Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths has more information on how routine cleaning by hospital staff might not be enough to control C. diff.
Kathleen Roche says they'll never know how Katie got sick, but they wonder if she got it from a feverish little girl who shared a room with Katie during both her first and second hospital stays.
"There should be no difference whatsoever between precautions for the parents and precautions for the staff," Pronovost says.
