(CNN) -- South Carolina social workers were familiar with Timothy Jones Jr. long before police accused him of killing his five children and dumping them off a dirt road in Alabama, according to documents from the state Department of Social Services.
Jones and the children were listed as missing persons last week after Jones failed to drop off the children with his ex-wife.
The caseworker told Jones the home wasn't safe for the kids, and Jones took them to a hotel, it said.
Four months ago, a South Carolina DSS case manager spoke to one of the children, who said Jones made them do exercises for punishment.
Jones admitted to the case manager that he had spanked his son, and the case manager told Jones to refrain from physical discipline.
Jones said his ex-wife had left him for a younger man and she hadn't seen her kids in four months, the report says.
It's unclear how or why Jones allegedly killed his children, but acting Sheriff Lewis McCarty of Lexington County told reporters that Jones drove for several days with their decomposing bodies in the back of his SUV.
When Jones was picked up Saturday at a police checkpoint in Mississippi, he seemed "very strange, maybe somewhat disoriented, a little bit on the violent side," McCarty said.
"We know that the angels are with us, but your prayers are helping us cope," Tim Jones Sr. said.
