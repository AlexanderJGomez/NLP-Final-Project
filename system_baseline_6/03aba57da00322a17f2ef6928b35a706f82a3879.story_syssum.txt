So how do you become a Davos delegate?
And once in Zurich there's the small matter of the transfer to Davos.
Finding accommodation in Davos during the week of the World Economic Forum is not easy, with a limited number of large hotels.
A chalet sleeping up to ten people for the week can command as much as 60,000 Swiss Francs ($63,600) - though catering might just be included.
$40,000-per head well spent.
