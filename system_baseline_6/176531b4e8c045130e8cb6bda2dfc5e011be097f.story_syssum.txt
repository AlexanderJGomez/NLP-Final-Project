"I want to thank Paris Saint-Germain and (sporting director) Leonardo for the great work they've done," Ibrahimovic told a press conference at the club's Parc des Princes stadium.
In my mind I was very clear, and I knew what I wanted.
Ibrahimovic left after falling out with former coach Josep Guardiola and returned to Italy to play for AC Milan.
I was very happy to be at Milan.
PSG also announced the signing of 19-year-old midfielder Marco Verratti from Serie A club Pescara and the club's sporting director Leonardo said that their transfer business had now been completed.
"With Zlatan we've finished in the transfer window this year."
