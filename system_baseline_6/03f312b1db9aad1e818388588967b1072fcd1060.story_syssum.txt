Kaka waves to supporters during Milan's match with Fiorentina on Saturday.
Selling him on would generate a massive profit on his investment -- in cash and paid up front.
"Hands off Kaka" read one banner, while another said: "I thought the devil could not sell its soul, but I was wrong," referring to Milan's devil's head logo.
Likewise, the 5,000 supporters who signed a petition to keep the Brazilian star in Milan would have to pay $100 a week each to match the offer.
Was he saying goodbye to them -- or to a $150 million move to Manchester?
