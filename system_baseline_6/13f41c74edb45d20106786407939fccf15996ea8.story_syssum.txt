(CNN) -- Chelsea reclaimed the lead in the English Premier League as Didier Drogba continued his hot scoring run against title hopefuls Arsenal with both goals in a 2-0 victory on Sunday.
Chelsea successfully bounced back from the shock draw with lowly Hull in midweek, which came as speculation about the future of England captain John Terry reached fever pitch.
Arsenal poured forward in the second half but were unable to penetrate as Chelsea could afford to sit back and absorb the pressure.
But the 36-year-old Phillips scored twice in the last 10 minutes in a rare first-team outing this season to leave promoted Wolves in the bottom three.
