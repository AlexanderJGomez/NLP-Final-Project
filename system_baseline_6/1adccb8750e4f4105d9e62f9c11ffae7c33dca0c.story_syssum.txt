Cicciaro died that night, and White was arrested.
The night Cicciaro was killed, he was at a party with the girl when they spotted Aaron White.
John and Aaron White walked out of their house, both holding guns, and had a heated exchange with Cicciaro and his friends.
But the rape threat that sparked the confrontation between Daniel Cicciaro and Aaron White was not real.
White's attorneys say that racism lies at the heart of the confrontation and that John White feared Cicciaro and his friends were going to kill his son.
With tears in their eyes, Daniel and Joanne Cicciaro say their last image of their son was in the hospital, drenched in blood and being given CPR.
"I saw his blank eyes open, staring at the ceiling."
