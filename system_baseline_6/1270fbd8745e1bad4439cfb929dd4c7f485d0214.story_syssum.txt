"It was thrilling to be in Iran, just plain old thrilling," said Ganis.
"It's hard to get Iranian films distributed in Iran because ... there aren't that many cinemas," Ganis said.
But, citing a recent Iranian film called "About Elly," directed by Asghar Farhadi -- scheduled to be screened at this year's Tribeca Film Festival -- Ganis said Iranian filmmakers are still able to release high-quality films.
"Iranian melodrama from the 1960s and 1970s replicates American melodrama," she said.
"When a film is banned, people are even more eager to see it," Dabashi said, pointing out that many Iranians acquire films through the black market.
Dabashi said Iranian cinema has been prominent on the international scene for years, adding that many Iranian actors are beginning to cross over to the American film industry -- from veteran Iranian film actress Shohreh Aghdashloo, who starred opposite Ben Kingsley in 2003's "House of Sand and Fog," to newcomer Golshifte Farahani, who starred as Leonardo DiCaprio's love interest in the 2008 thriller "Body of Lies."
Shortly after the delegation's arrival, Javad Shamghadri, the arts adviser to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said the Academy representatives should apologize for Hollywood's depiction of Iran through the years.
"It's a start," Ganis said.
