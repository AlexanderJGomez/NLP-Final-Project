Tokyo (CNN) -- The light bulb above our dining room table begins to swing.
But not for long.
Then a buzzer sounds and an instructor comes into the room.
The Tokyo Earthquake Simulation Center is located on the fourth floor of the city's Ikebukuro Bosai-kan fire station.
The computer-controlled earthquake mimics a quake measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale.
The world's biggest earthquake is believed to have been the 1960 Valdiva Quake in Chile, which was a 9.5.
A serious earthquake with accompanying aftershocks is simulated every half hour every day except weekends and Tuesdays at Tokyo's Life Safety Learning center.
The center has a permanent exhibition to the 1923 Tokyo earthquake.
The shock started a tsunami tidal wave that reached a height of 36 feet at Atami on Sagama Bay, where it destroyed a further 150 houses and killed 60 more people.
Students learn how to protect themselves and prevent fires from spreading after an earthquake.
They just enjoy being in an artificial earthquake scenario.
Would you like to enjoy another one yourself?"
The room begins to shake again.
"But it won't be so much fun," my earthquake examiner says.
Tokyo Earthquake Simulation Center: Ikebukuro Bosai-kan, (5 minue walk from the west exit of Ikebukuro station); closed Tuesdays and every 3rd Monday of the month; Open 9 a.m.-5 p.m.; +81 (0)9 3590 6565.
