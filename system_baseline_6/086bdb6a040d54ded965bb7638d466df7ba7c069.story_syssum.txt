For French football clubs it's a new punitive tax law that's worrying them to death.
If it goes ahead it would France's first football "strike" since 1972.
"The high-income tax of 75%, which was included in the 2013 draft budget of France, will have a disastrous effect on the competitiveness of French football," said the Professional Union of Football Clubs (UCPF) in a statement.
French football has a strong tradition of developing young players through its academy system, but a French club hasn't won the Champions League -- Europe's top competition -- for over 20 years, though last season PSG reached the quarterfinals.
"In the short term clubs would have to buy cheaper players for lower transfers and would pay lower salaries to avoid paying the 75%," said Karlsen as he outlined a grim future for French football.
"I'm not totally for (the strike) personally, what worries me of course is that there is this tax, but, all French people suffer from having to pay taxes.
