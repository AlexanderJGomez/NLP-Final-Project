Why?
Awful.
Shapiro and the show's two other hosts -- Chris Dimino and Nick Cellini -- were fired Monday evening.
Gleason also explained his struggles with, and triumphs over, the disease.
"The pressure is to try to do a good radio show, and that wasn't a good moment," Shapiro recalled.
All three hosts have apologized on Twitter and personally to the Team Gleason foundation, as Gleason himself wrote on Facebook.
Since the story broke, Gleason said, there's been a lot of talk about ALS, an ailment he characterizes as being "not (well) understood ... and largely ignored."
At the same time, he's personally shaken for his part in offending so many -- including Gleason, those fighting ALS and the city of New Orleans.
Those radio hosts were suspended, not fired.
The Atlanta saga would have ended better if the fired radio hosts, after being suspended for some time, had returned to talk about ALS with Gleason and raised money for the cause, said Thomas.
