Benghazi, Libya (CNN) -- Doctors at a field hospital in Martyrs Square in Zawiya said Friday that 17 people were killed and another 150 were wounded when government forces attacked the city.
"They told me they are being shot at and they were doing it in self-defense," Gadhafi said.
"These are our children," he said.
Gadhafi said Libya has peaceful ways for its citizens to address their grievances.
"These acts cannot happen by Libyan men," he said.
"I believe Zawiya will toe the line," he said, then directed his final comment to the city's residents themselves.
A formerly pro-government newspaper in Libya reported Thursday that African mercenaries were shooting at unarmed civilians in Tajura, about 25 miles east of Tripoli.
The woman said unarmed people had been fired on indiscriminately.
"People are crying," she said, calling for help from the world.
Witnesses and reports also said the town of Az Zintan was under opposition control.
Gunfire erupted at dawn Thursday as chanting crowds dispersed.
She said she was risking her life by talking to a reporter.
The resolution would condemn "the massive and unacceptable violence currently being perpetrated in this country," French Foreign Minister Michele Alliot-Marie said Thursday in a statement.
A ferry chartered by the United States to evacuate U.S. citizens remained in port in Tripoli because of bad weather, diplomatic sources said.
