The news came as Masters champion Bubba Watson tipped young Japanese golfer Ryo Ishikawa to become the first player from his country to win a major title.
They were 11 shots behind South Africa's Charl Schwartzel, who took a five-stroke advantage over Sweden's Daniel Chopra into Sunday's final round -- when he will seek to win his first title since earning his maiden major at the 2011 Masters.
Meanwhile, China's Shanshan Feng won the Ladies European Tour's season-ending event in Dubai on Saturday, having led from the first round.
