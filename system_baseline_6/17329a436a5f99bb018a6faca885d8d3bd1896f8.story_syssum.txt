Lt. Timothy Breen flies missions close to Iranian air space almost every day in his U.S. Navy F-18 Hornet, often encountering Iranian military aircraft over the strategic waters of the Strait of Hormuz.
Shoemaker says his crew takes care not to provoke Iran through its maneuvering, but at the same is prepared to answer any military escalation by Iran's navy.
And aboard the Abraham Lincoln, the crew works round the clock to ensure the carrier is always capable of launching its aircraft.
"We can launch four aircraft in about a minute, then we takes a few minutes to re load the catapults and get next batch of aircraft into position," said Lt. Cmdr.
The U.S. Navy speaks of scenarios in which Iran could launch sudden, almost insurgent style attacks on larger, better-equipped U.S. warships.
