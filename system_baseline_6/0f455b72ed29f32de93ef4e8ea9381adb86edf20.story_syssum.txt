Can you tell me what Joe Cotton did?
Each of them won the Kentucky Derby horse race.
Bet you don't know Burgoo King.
In 1932, when a lot of people were depressed with a capital D, a lot of them were impressed by Burgoo King when he won the Kentucky Derby by three lengths and then the Preakness by a head.
Would you like to know why?
In 1958, when folks were giving thought to buying one of Ford's really cool new cars, the Edsel, a lot of them were impressed by Tim Tam when he took the Kentucky Derby with a tremendous stretch run, then ran first in the Preakness, as well.
A horse for the ages.
That was him.
To see Smarty Jones.
He could run Secretariat-style and leave everyone else gagging on his dust, as he showed at the Preakness while winning by more than 11 lengths.
"Nobody else," I said.
We observed a minute of silence for President Reagan, who passed away that same day.
Smarty Jones ran second that day.
Horse racing.
But you know what?
