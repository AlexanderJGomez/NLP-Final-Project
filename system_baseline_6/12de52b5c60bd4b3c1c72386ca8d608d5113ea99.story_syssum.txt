Officials and many residents have long known they live in landslide country, Pennington said.
As rescue teams still seek survivors in the mud almost a week later, the disaster prompts new questions about how the local government allowed homes and a community to remain in the path of a potential landslide -- a peril that was highlighted as recently as 1999 in a Seattle-based geomorphologist's report to the Army Corps of Engineers.
"This is a valley lined with landslides, going back 14,000 years when the glaciers left," Haugerud said.
Seattle-based geomorphologist Daniel Miller said he would never have built a house around where the disaster occurred.
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers spokeswoman Patricia Graesser said the study spoke to how people were living in the landslide area but the report wasn't a risk assessment of landslide hazards.
"I currently have no basis for estimating the probable rate or timing of future landslide activity," Miller's study states.
Local officials apprised residents of the perils as public improvements were made after the 2006 landslide, Pennington said.
"Ultimately, there was no way to know when a landslide would occur," Miller said.
"Fishing is a big deal here in Washington," Haugerud said.
"This is a corner of the world where the majority of the people are very happy not to have much government regulations," Haugerud said.
Speaking as a Washington state resident -- and not as government geologist -- Haugerud said reforms may be needed to ensure local officials impose stricter regulations in landslide zones.
