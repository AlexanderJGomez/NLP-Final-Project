New Delhi, India (CNN) -- India and Pakistan traded bitter accusations Wednesday after New Delhi said Pakistani troops had killed two of its soldiers in the disputed territory of Kashmir, a flash point between the two nations since their creation.
"Pakistan is prepared to hold investigations through the United Nations Military Observes Group for India and Pakistan on the recent cease-fire violations on the Line of Control."
Pakistani army troops repulsed the attack, but one Pakistani soldier was killed and another critically injured, Pakistan said.
U.N. officials urged "both sides to respect the cease-fire and de-escalate tensions through dialogue," Dwyer said.
The conflict over Kashmir dates back to 1947, after Britain relinquished control of the Indian subcontinent, giving birth to modern India and Pakistan.
Islamabad has always said that majority-Muslim Kashmir should have been a part of Pakistan.
