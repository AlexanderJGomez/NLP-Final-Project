In the West, emissions contributing to global warming even dropped last year.
Globally, greenhouse gases are being emitted at a slower rate this year than they were last year, and in both years the climb in emissions was less intense than in the past decade taken as a whole, said researchers at Britain's East Anglia University.
But the world's largest carbon emitter, which wrested the dubious title from the United States in recent years, pumped 5.9% more into the atmosphere in 2012 than in the previous year.
On an individual basis, China and the EU were at the same level, with 7.7 tons of carbon gas emitted per person and year.
