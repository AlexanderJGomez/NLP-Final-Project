The unprecedented punishment was handed down in March after an NFL investigation found the team had an "active bounty program" during the 2009, 2010 and 2011 seasons.
Head coach Sean Payton suspension for the entire 2012-2013 season will begin April 16, the league said Monday.
Goodell has said he's also considering imposing penalties against players involved in the bounty program, but he hasn't given a timetable and has insisted he'll first consult with the NFL Players Association before doing so.
