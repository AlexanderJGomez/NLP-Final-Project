Obama and many Democrats say House Republicans are to blame for rejecting Senate-passed immigration reform last year without coming up with their own plan.
Where previously Mexican children made up the bulk of them, a surge more recently from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador has been seen.
An administration program that defers the deportation of children brought in illegally by their parents or guardians has also had unintended consequences, immigration policy and law experts say.
Last year, federal agencies noticed an uptick in minors crossing the border â€” particularly in the Rio Grande Valley, according to a report from U.S. Customs and Border Patrol.
The same agencies have also realized those "children present unique operational challenges" for Border Patrol and Health and Human Services.
Obama is vowing to act on his own and use his executive authority to sidestep the House, changes some proponents say could help address the problem.
Though now, the administration plans to spend roughly $100 million in aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to help the immigrant children get back home and stay there.
Perhaps, immigration law and policy experts say.
However, White House officials say he has no plans to visit the border now.
Rick Perry has loudly called for Obama to visit the border.
