Schneider is also accused of attempted murder, the court said.
When Gelowicz, Schneider and Yilmaz were arrested, they were found with sophisticated and difficult-to-obtain detonators, authorities with knowledge of the arrests have said.
German authorities had said the three men trained at the group's camps in northern Pakistan.
The group said it wanted to target the United States' Ramstein Air Base and other U.S. and Uzbek military and diplomatic installations in Germany, Sachs said.
