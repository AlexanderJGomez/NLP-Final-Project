A plea deal so generous that the abuser's arrest record will be expunged -- totally clean, as if the whole thing had never happened -- if he receives some counseling in the next few months.
The woman identified as Kelli Fuller said her drunk husband was assaulting her.
About a minute into the call, as dispatchers summon help, Kelli Fuller is heard saying "I hate you, I hate you."
Then, Fuller will have to undergo a once-a-week family and domestic violence program for 24 weeks.
The parallels between the Rice and Fuller cases extend further.
Consider that last line: "my family, where they should be resolved."
When husbands beat up their wives, that is not a matter that should be resolved within the family.
Whether the Rices and Fullers stay married is their business; but whether Ray Rice and Judge Mark Fuller committed crimes should be a question for prosecutors, and ultimately, juries to decide.
