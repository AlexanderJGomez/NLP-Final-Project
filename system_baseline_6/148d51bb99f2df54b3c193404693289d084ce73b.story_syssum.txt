(CNN) -- The mayor of Nogales, Arizona, was arrested Tuesday on charges he took bribes to protect contracts or obtain business contracts with the city, the state attorney general said.
A spokeswoman for the city said Garcia-Von Borstel, who has been in office since April 2008, was taken into custody around 9:30 a.m.
The mayor's father, Garcia Suarez, was an agent for Western Union authorized to sell Western Union money orders from his money transmitter business, ACE Cash Express, in Nogales, officials said.
The money orders were then cashed by Garcia-Von Borstel and deposited into a bank account he controlled, the statement said.
