Queen Elizabeth II's much beloved Royal Yacht Britannia carried members of the monarchy on almost 1000 official voyages over 44 years, from her launch in 1953 to her decommissioning in 1997.
"Any royal yacht is around for some time," says Ken Freviokh.
"A new royal yacht shouldn't be conventional," he says.
Tony Castro wants onlookers to be captivated by any royal yacht he would design.
"It's a great way to get people together to sell a message -- no one could turn down an invitation to the royal yacht."
"In the current market, it's so much cheaper to buy an existing yacht and re-fit and condition it," says Huish.
But if the Queen did not want a pre-loved model, Huish believes there's never been a better time to commission a yacht with an industry facing tough economic challenges; the royal is more likely to get more for her pound.
