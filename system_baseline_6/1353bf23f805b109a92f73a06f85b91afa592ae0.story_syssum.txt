Savvy cyber criminals are taking advantage of our increasing reliance on computers and the Internet.
Last year, antivirus maker McAfee saw a 500 percent increase in malware types -- more than the company had seen in the previous five years combined.
"They have R&D departments, strong distribution networks and Web sites for the discerning cyber criminal," Fraser said.
Although the techniques of cyber crime have evolved, online criminals prey on human vulnerabilities like criminals throughout the ages.
"With the arrival of spam in 2001 and 2002, the big difference was it was commercial malware," Negi said.
"Once it became a business, then (cyber criminals) began to look at what companies like us were doing, and figure out weaknesses," he said.
"It's like the arms industry ... it's not a crime to build and sell them," Negi said.
Often criminal networks are run in countries such as Russia and China, where government officials turn a blind eye to these activities -- so long as their victims reside outside the host country, Spafford said.
"I'm not saying (cyber criminals) are involved in physical violence, but it's not out of the realm of possibility," he said.
