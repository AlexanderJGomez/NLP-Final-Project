Washington (CNN) -- Before Tuesday night's debate, polls showed Mitt Romney had gained ground with women voters.
President Barack Obama was quick to use the "binders" line against Romney on the campaign trail Wednesday.
During the debate at Hofstra University in New York, Romney, who worked in business before serving as governor of Massachusetts, said he "learned a great deal" about the inequalities between men and women in the workplace when leading his state.
But there is a lingering perception behind the comedic Internet takes on Romney's "binders full of women" response and pre-emptive advertising aimed at women that he is disconnected from the day-to-day issues facing that critical group of voters.
A USA Today/Gallup poll conducted last week showed Romney had closed the gap with women and was within one point among women who are likely voters, 48% for Romney and 49% for Obama.
Socarides gave Romney points for trying to hire women but said in doing so, "Romney demonstrates that he's living in another world."
Romney campaign surrogate Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee, said one reason more women may be looking to vote for Romney is because of his economic message.
