(CNN) -- An anonymous video that appears to show several police officers torturing young male suspects in Argentina has outraged many people in the South American country.
They are surrounded by several men in civilian clothes who are apparently the police officers implicated in the case.
The police source said officials believe the video was shot by one of the arrested officers.
Officials don't know who posted the video to YouTube he said.
"Torture is a common tool which is applied constantly in many detention centers and even to suspects held at police station cells before their court appearance," Verdu said.
