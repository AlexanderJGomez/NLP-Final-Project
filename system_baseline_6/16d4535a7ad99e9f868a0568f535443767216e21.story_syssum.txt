"Baltimore County Police has learned of allegations that William Parente may be involved in questionable financial dealings," Johnson said.
Authorities previously have said Parente was an attorney.
The bodies of Betty Parente and the two daughters were found on a king-size bed in the hotel room, while William Parente's body was found in the bathroom, police said.
There was no evidence they were restrained, Johnson said.
Hill said police believe the family was together Sunday morning for breakfast, and they know what time the card key was last used to unlock the room.
"There's a safety net in place," he said.
