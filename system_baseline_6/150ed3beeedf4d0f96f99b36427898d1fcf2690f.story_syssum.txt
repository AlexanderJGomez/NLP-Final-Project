"A panic attack gripped me and prevented me from going because I thought no woman should go through this," said the 29-year-old.
While the group consisted of men and women, Bahgat said it was generally men who intervened when an assault was detected, to prevent women bodyguards from being sexually assaulted themselves.
At first I thought they were catching a thief or there was a fight," he told CNN.
The group has quickly learned what works in breaking up the assaults, he said.
Sexual harassment is a longstanding problem in Egypt, said Bahgat.
But Bahgat said her focus was not speculating on the causes of the attacks, but stopping them.
"But the ones behind these attacks are not the true Egyptians," she said.
The true Egyptians are the men who volunteer with us and get emotionally involved in getting women out of these situations."
