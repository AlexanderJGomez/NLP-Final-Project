Edwin Edwards was released from federal prison Thursday after serving about 10 years, the federal Bureau of Prisons said.
At Edwards' trial in 2000, star witness Edward J. DeBartolo Jr., former owner of the San Francisco 49ers, got a reduced sentence in exchange for testifying about his own $400,000 bribe to Edwards.
"Edwards named blacks to key state positions and his support of black politicians resulted in a mutually beneficial relationship," the biography says.
