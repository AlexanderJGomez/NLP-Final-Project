As the Democrat challenging the Senate's top Republican in a state that voted for Mitt Romney two years ago, Grimes has been perhaps the most high-profile candidate to keep her distance from Obama.
Sen. Mark Begich, Alaska.
And earlier this year he told CNN that he doesn't need Obama to campaign for him in Alaska.
Sen. Mark Udall, Colorado.
Sen. Kay Hagan, North Carolina.
Hagan is running for a second term in a state that voted for Obama in 2008 but not in 2012.
Last year Landrieu declined to attend a visit by Obama to her state, though she still hitched a ride aboard Air Force One with the President on his way to Louisiana.
"I don't think it makes sense for the president to come to New Hampshire," she continued, while answering the question at the CNN/NH1 debate last week.
Like other vulnerable Senate candidates -- such as Shaheen, Udall and Hagan -- Pryor has also called for travel restrictions to help prevent Ebola from spreading to the United States, a policy the Obama administration has not pushed.
