(CNN) -- Throngs of revelers gathered around Times Square in New York City early Sunday to ring in the New Year amid cheers, glittering confetti and fireworks in one of many festivities worldwide.
Samoa and Tokelau -- historically the last to celebrate the new year -- reveled in being the first to party this time round, after skipping west across the international dateline, missing out on December 30 entirely in the process, in a move intended to boost trade.
The final ones set to ring in the new year will also be in the Pacific, specifically on the U.S. Midway Islands and American Samoa.
Russia started by kicking off its new year in a grand way with fireworks over the Kremlin.
