It's a great experience for me," Shevchenko told the European Tour website.
"I am not a big fan of football so I didn't really know much about Andriy but it was great to play with him.
He entered this tournament as one of several amateurs in the 130-strong field, having initially taken up golf to help ease the pressure of playing elite football.
"It's the first event for me and also in Ukraine so it's big for golf here," he said.
"I love golf and I'm so happy that golf is starting to pick up in Ukraine and the people are starting to invest money long term."
