Oscar Hernandez, the mayor of Bell, California, said the City Council accepted the resignations of City Manager Robert Rizzo, Assistant City Manager Angela Spaccia, and Police Chief Randy Adams, who reportedly had a combined salary of more than $1.6 million.
"These outrageous salaries in Bell are shocking and beyond belief," he said.
Cory Christ, a resident of the city, said to CNN affiliate KTLA.
"...
So, Mr. Rizzo with his salary and compensation package, around $800,000 is about one-fifteenth of the budget for the city of Bell," De La Torre said.
Hernandez appointed Pedro Carrillo, assistant to the city manager, to be the interim city manager.
