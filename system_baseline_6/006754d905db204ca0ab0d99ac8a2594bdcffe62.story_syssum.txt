"The last thing you would have thought about Arlen Specter was that he was born in Kansas," Madonna said.
After graduating from Russell High School in 1947, Specter first went to the University of Oklahoma.
Even though he was a registered Democrat, Specter ran successfully for Philadelphia district attorney on the Republican ticket in 1965 and eventually registered as a Republican.
Specter ran for the U.S. Senate in 1976, but he was defeated in the Republican primary by John Heinz.

"No member of Congress shaped the Supreme Court more than he did," Madonna said.

"From his role in sinking Robert Bork's Supreme Court nomination to his cross-examination of Anita Hill, from stem-cell research to the impeachment of Bill Clinton, Specter's greatest talent may be his unique ability to put himself -- somehow, some way -- in the center of the nation's most important debates," the article said.
