(CNN) -- A year ago Wednesday, Malala Yousafzai was riding the bus home from school when a Taliban gunman climbed aboard and shot her in the head.
Her public fight to get that education and for the right of girls to get one, too, is what put her at odds with the Pakistani Taliban.
The Taliban have denied Malala was targeted for promoting education for girls.
Fighting the Taliban is important, but through peace, dialogue and education, she said.
Malala was left in critical condition.
The U.N. started a global education program for girls called "I am Malala," the name she has chosen for her biography.
This year, the Malala Fund was created to support education for girls around the world.
