Smart, now 25 and married, spoke to CNN's Anderson Cooper Monday about her book "My Story," which she said tells 100% of what happened to her.
"I want them to know that these things do happen, but that doesn't mean that we have to be defined by it for the rest of your life.
"I kept looking, I kept waiting for something to happen, for some way for me to get away," she said.
because, in my mind, I wanted my parents to know what had happened to me," she said.
And then we kept going and I remember we got a little further and I stopped him again and I said 'Well, don't you realize what you're doing, I mean, if you get caught you'll spend the rest of your life in prison?'
I mean, if hugs could speak this hug would have said, 'You're mine, you will do exactly what I tell you to do.'"
I mean, not just once, multiple times a day."
I mean, just every time I thought it couldn't get worse, something always happened."
I mean, they just don't know," she said.
The second half of Smart's interview with Cooper, in which she reveals details of how she was rescued, will air on CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360" Tuesday night.
