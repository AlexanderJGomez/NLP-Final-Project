One Friday evening in 2009, NASA engineer Stephen Altemus arrived home from work feeling, well, kind of frustrated.
" 'You never talk bad about NASA, Dad,' " Altemus recalled his son saying.
"
They were in.
"
"It was nothing like what NASA was used to."
But it resulted in an offshoot project called the Morpheus planetary lander.
It's the first NASA prototype spacecraft to be propelled using liquid oxygen and liquid methane.
Today, the latest version of the Morpheus lander "is a centerpiece for the agency to show what a fantastic team it is, and what incredible things can be done with just sheer willpower to imagine," said Altemus, who in 2013 ended a 25-year career at NASA to start an engineering products business based on space technology.
The sophisticated self-guided system that prevents Morpheus from setting down in hazardous landing zones could be used on a lander that could safely put astronauts on another planet.
Amazingly, NASA planners hope to design a robot spacecraft that would capture an asteroid and haul it into a stable orbit near the moon.
The fuel-making spacecraft would then harvest methane from the atmosphere, said Altemus.
We as human beings will find a way to strive to create, to invent.
