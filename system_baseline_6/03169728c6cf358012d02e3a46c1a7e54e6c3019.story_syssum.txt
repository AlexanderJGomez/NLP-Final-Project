"She was like: 'You're a girl,'" says Gul.
Today Gul is one of seven women who are trained and ready to fly Pakistan's F-7 supersonic fighter jets.
To become a fighter pilot takes three years of training at the Air Force Academy in Risalpur, Pakistan, where the halls are lined with grainy black-and-white pictures of nearly six decades of male graduates who went on to fly for the Pakistan Air Force.
Here, equal opportunity means equal treatment.
Ambreen Gul says her goal now is to fly in combat.
But women rarely fly in combat anywhere in the world and it's never been done in Pakistan.
