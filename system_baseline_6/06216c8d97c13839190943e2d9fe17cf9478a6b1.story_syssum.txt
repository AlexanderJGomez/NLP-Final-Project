The comparison between smartphone data usage on Verizon's network and iPhone data usage on AT&T's network is important to note, because iPhone users have typically been viewed as the heaviest data users in the entire mobile market.
So far, Verizon's network hasn't faced any major hiccups due to the onslaught of new data traffic.
For example, 71.2 percent of all AT&T cell phone subscribers, which includes users of smartphones like the iPhone as well as feature phones, use data services, while only 43 percent of all Verizon cell phone users subscribe to data services.
According to data analyzed by Validas, about half of AT&T's iPhone customers use less than 200MB of data per month.
This means that about 2.5 percent of AT&T's users consume more than 2GB of data per month.
In an effort to keep iPhone data usage in check so it doesn't completely overwhelm its network, AT&T recently eliminated its all you-can-eat data plan.
According to the Validas report, a little more than 4 percent of Verizon's smartphone users consume more than 2GB of data per month compared with only about 2.5 percent of AT&T's iPhone customers.
Validas' analysis also clearly shows that heavy data users are primarily using AT&T and Verizon Wireless, while customers who tend to use less data, are subscribing to Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile USA.
So it will be interesting to note whether the launch of this device will significantly move the needle on data usage on Sprint's network.
