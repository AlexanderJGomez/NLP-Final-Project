There is little suspense as to the outcome: Every reliable source indicates that South Sudan will vote for separation, dividing Africa's largest country and taking with it some 80 percent of known Sudanese oil reserves.
But exactly how the North and South will simultaneously separate while remaining interconnected must be.
Millions of Southerners displaced by the war will continue to live in Khartoum, and Northerners will live in the South.
Even as America asks how it can help Southern Sudan prepare for the likely burdens of statehood, it must also consider the Sudan that remains.
Although the Sudanese themselves will own their future, America must now help North and South Sudan to find a peaceful path forward.
