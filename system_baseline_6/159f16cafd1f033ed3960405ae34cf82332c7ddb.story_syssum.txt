Washington (CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama is considering airstrikes and humanitarian airdrops to help save thousands of Iraq's Shiite Turkmen, who officials said Wednesday are facing a potential slaughter at the hands of fighters with the so-called Islamic State.
There are Sunni and Shiite Turkmen in Iraq, and they account for up to 3% of Iraq's population.
On Wednesday, American warplanes carried out three airstrikes near Irbil, destroying a number of vehicles and a building, the U.S. military said.
The airstrikes in Iraq came as a U.N. human rights investigators accused both ISIS and Syrian government forces of committing war crimes and atrocities in their brutal fight in Syria.
"Among the most disturbing findings in this report are accounts of large training camps, where children, mostly boys, from the age of 14 are recruited and trained to fight in the ranks of ISIS along with adults," said Paulo Pinheiro, the chairman of the U.N. commission of inquiry on Syria.
Some are having difficulty breathing, several are treated with oxygen masks.
