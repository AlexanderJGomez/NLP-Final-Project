LONDON, England (CNN) -- London commuters crammed onto buses, scrambled for taxis, cycled or simply walked on Wednesday as a strike by Tube workers shut down most of the subway network.
TfL was running extra buses and free shuttle services across the River Thames during the strike.
While most services on the Tube were shut because of the strike, one line -- the Northern line -- was running normally and five others were running on a reduced schedule, TfL said.
The RMT represents about half of the 20,000 employees on the Tube, a TfL spokeswoman said.
