New York  (CNN)New York's iconic Statue of Liberty and Liberty Island will reopen to the public Saturday -- one day after a bomb threat that led to its evacuation was declared unfounded, officials said.
A sweep by U.S. Park Police canine units "alerted on an area of interest near the lockers at the base" of the Statue of Liberty, Rambo said.
Approximately 3.5 million people visit the Statue of Liberty every year.
The last time the island shut down to the public was in October 2013, when it closed for 12 days because of the a government shutdown.
