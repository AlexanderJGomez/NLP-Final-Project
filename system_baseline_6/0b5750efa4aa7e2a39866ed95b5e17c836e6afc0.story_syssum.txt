The annual Sleep in America poll estimated the hours of sleep have gradually decreased.
Over the last decade, the poll indicates that a growing percentage of Americans is getting less than six hours of sleep and the number of people who get eight or more hours is dwindling.
The economy is a major factor why people are losing sleep."
The mean hours of sleep on a weeknight dwindled from an average of 7 hours in 2001 to 6.7 hours this year, according to the Sleep Foundation's poll.
Centuries ago, people routinely slept eight to nine hours a day, he said.
"There has been no decline in sleep.
"I think a lot of people need 8.6 hours of sleep, but I think very few people get it."
"You may actually sleep four hours, but you're in bed for eight hours," said Drake, who is a board member with the National Sleep Foundation.
If a person is working more, he or she borrows that time from sleep.
"Our society has valued people who brag about being able to function on very little sleep as a mark of someone who is aggressive, dynamic, successful," Kavey said.
