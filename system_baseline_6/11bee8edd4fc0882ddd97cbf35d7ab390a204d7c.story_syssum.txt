This man is simply one of the millions of people who have watched Dr. Oz on TV over the years.
Because, the plaintiff claims, he was injured when he tried Dr. Oz' home sleep remedy known as the "Knapsack Heated Rice Footsie."
More?
However, Dr. Oz expressly warned viewers, "Don't get it too hot, just warm."
How?
Blame the lawyers.
But it's easy for even a non-corporate lawyer to see that these ridiculous lawsuits give the reputable plaintiffs' attorneys -- and, frankly, all lawyers -- a black eye.
And this will make it even more challenging for lawyers to earn a living.
As for Dr. Oz, I hope that he doesn't settle quickly out of court.
