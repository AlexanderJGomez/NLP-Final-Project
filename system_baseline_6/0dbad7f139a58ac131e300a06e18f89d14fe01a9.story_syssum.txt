New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- BP has put off crucial "integrity tests" on the new stacking cap on its ruptured Gulf oil well so it can review testing procedures, a review expected to take place through the night and into Wednesday.
Retired Adm. Thad Allen, who is leading the federal response to the oil disaster, says the well cap placement is part a "very complex, nuanced and broad-based response" to the rupture of the underwater well in April, an accident that killed 11 oil workers and caused worst environmental disaster in U.S. history.
Allen was asked what he thought the odds were to the success of being able to shut the well with the new cap.
What we can't tell is the current condition of the well bore below the sea floor and the implication of the pressure readings," he said.
Meanwhile, in another development Tuesday, the Obama administration sent BP and other responsible parties a fourth bill relating to the oil spill.
But BP doesn't expect the first relief well work to be completed until August.
"There's still a significant amount of oil out there, and the oil recovery and the impacts of this oil will probably extend well into the fall in terms of oil coming ashore, tar balls, beach cleanup, and then we will be moving of course at that point of the natural resources damage assessment trying to understand the long-term environmental ecological impact of the event," Allen said.
