Earlier this month, the same jurors took less than two hours to decide that Arias was "exceptionally cruel" in 2008 when she stabbed ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander 29 times, slit his neck from ear to ear and shot him in the face.
Now, the jury is weighing whether Arias, 32, should get the death penalty.
It was a stark reversal from two weeks ago, when she told a journalist she preferred death to life in prison.
"Please don't give up; please don't give up," Arias said she told her.
Arias told jurors that she had been a victim of abuse as an adult and as a child.
She told jurors Tuesday that she could teach people to read in prison and pledged to dedicate her life to good causes.
"I'm not going to become a mother because of my own terrible choices," she said.
Prosecutor Juan Martinez said pointing to Arias' artwork as evidence that her life should be spared wasn't a valid defense.
He argued that jurors should sentence Arias to death.
After her arrest, Arias told an elaborate lie about masked intruders breaking into Alexander's house and killing him before she narrowly escaped.
