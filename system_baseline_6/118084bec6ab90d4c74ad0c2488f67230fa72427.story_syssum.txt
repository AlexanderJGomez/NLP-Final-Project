LONDON, England (CNN) -- Nobel laureate biologist James Watson was suspended Friday from his longtime post at a research laboratory and canceled his planned British book tour after controversial comments that black people are not as intelligent as white people.
"I cannot understand how I could have said what I am quoted as having said," Watson said during an appearance at the Royal Society in London.
It said the board publicly disagreed with the comments attributed to Watson in the Sunday Times.
