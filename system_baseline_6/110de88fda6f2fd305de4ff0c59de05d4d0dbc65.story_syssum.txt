WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Conservative columnist and former CNN "Crossfire" co-host Robert Novak has died after a yearlong battle with cancer, his family said Tuesday.
Novak was a veteran columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times and a regular commentator for CNN for 25 years, beginning when the network launched in 1980.
While staunchly conservative, Novak opposed the invasion and was frequently critical of the Bush administration.

Veteran Democratic consultant and on-air sparring partner James Carville said Novak "had the best sources in the Republican Party," making his weekly column a must-read for political insiders.
Novak left the network in 2005 after an on-air blowup with Carville, who had been needling him over the CIA leak case.
