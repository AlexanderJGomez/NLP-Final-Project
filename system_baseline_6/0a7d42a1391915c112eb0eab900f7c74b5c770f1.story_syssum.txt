(Matador Network)  -- From choosing the right festival to tips on camping and pacing yourself through the shows, here's (almost) everything you'll need to know about preparing for your next music festival.
Festival passes range from $50 to $250 or higher, depending on venue, location and who's headlining and promoting the festival.
For festivals like Bonnaroo and Coachella, much of the experience is about pitching your tent and camping out for the weekend.
Depending on how much sleep you want to get or how close you want to be to the action (many festivals run 24 hours), you'll want to know if the camping sites are near the stages, scattered across the grounds, or both.
As with all travel, having a cultural awareness of where you're going can enrich your festival experience and take you beyond simple enjoyment of the music.
One of the best parts about the summer music festival experience is observing the meshing of different cultures and being around new groups of people.
At most festivals, you're going to be thoroughly searched before you even get though the gates.
Knowing the festival ground layout and scheduling in time to relax is the most important tip I can give.
