Then, most recently, a cadaver dog picking up the scent of human remains in a basement near Etan's home.
In the two weeks following Etan's disappearance, police put in more than 4,000 hours on the case, interviewing some 500 people, Cohen writes in her book.
Police found photos of young boys among the man's possessions, and took them to Etan's parents to see if their son was one of them.
Like the other leads, nothing came of them.
Three years later, in 1991, after helping secure another conviction against Ramos, federal authorities visited the Patz family again.
They were there to deliver the news the family had long dreaded -- that investigators believed their son was dead and they believed Ramos was responsible, Cohen writes.
But none of those milestones brought them closer to what the family has long said it wants, barring the return of their son: a criminal conviction.
Authorities had looked at the basement workshop years ago, but never tore up the place as they were doing last week, she noted.
Mike Huff, a retired police detective and cold-case investigator in Tulsa, Oklahoma, who now heads the International Association of Cold Case Investigators, said as he watched coverage of the case, the kinds of details that were emerging led him to believe investigators were confident they had finally come up with a solid line on hard physical evidence in the case.
Through his attorney and daughter, Miller has denied any role in Etan's disappearance.
"It's a success that 33 years later, somebody is still looking at it," he said.
