"I've decided to come to Hong Kong because opportunities in my country aren't very promising," former Spanish La Liga player Lander Panera told CNN.
Ken Ng, head of Hong Kong Kitchee, one of the top local teams, has been working with former Spanish athletes for years to develop local players.
"We will give them a view of the world," Ng told CNN, "every year we will take them to Spain."
In the meantime, Spanish players like Panera are considering Hong Kong as a permanent home.
