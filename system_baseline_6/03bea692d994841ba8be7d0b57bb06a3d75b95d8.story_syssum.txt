"It's a time when Israel is really joining the family of modern nations, and Playboy is just part of modern global culture," says Dan Pomerantz, who emigrated from his native Chicago to Israel 15 months ago.
Some observers believe that reading the Hebrew edition of Playboy could still be seen as political statement.
"If you want nudity, there's the internet," says Sarah Tuttle-Singer, a blogger for the Times of Israel.
"We don't see ourselves as a magazine company," says Pomerantz.
"From the statistics on our website and Facebook, we can tell that a number of our followers are Arab speakers and Palestinians within Israel and neighboring countries," he says.
We've seen so far a real interest that we want to encourage."
