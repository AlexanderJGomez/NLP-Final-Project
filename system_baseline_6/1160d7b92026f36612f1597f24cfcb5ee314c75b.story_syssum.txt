Kasab is one of 10 Pakistani nationals who police say reigned down terror on Mumbai, India's financial capital, for four days and three nights.
Police say Kasab is the only suspected gunman caught alive.
Late in the day Kasab's newly appointed defense attorney Abbas Kazmi said Kasab was now retracting his statements, saying he confessed under police pressure.
That victim also happens to be a witness against Kasab in this trial.
