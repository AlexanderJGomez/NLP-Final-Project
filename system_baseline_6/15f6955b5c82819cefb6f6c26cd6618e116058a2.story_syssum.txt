Not just any party.
Tonight Steiner decides to stop by Planned Parenthood Political Action Fund's "Sex, Politics, and Cocktails" party first.
Steiner says he tried but failed to get into the Americans for Prosperity party in Tampa.
A woman clutching one of the "We love Michelle" banners that had been handed out on the convention floor earlier in the evening keeps knocking it into people as she joyfully dances "The Electric Slide."
"This party seems like a way to drum up enthusiasm with the base," Steiner says, as he makes his way to the bar to talk with someone he knows.
"The Democrats have clearly decided their work for women is a winning issue for them, and Pelosi is a rock star among the Democratic base," Steiner says.
Andra Gillespie, a political science professor at Emory University who was in Charlotte to observe the convention, says parties such as this energize the base on particular issues.
Steiner says there were several splashy events at the RNC.
The lobby has a different feel than the Planned Parenthood party.
Steiner says he noticed their names on a giant screen next to the dance floor.
Gillespie says some people may be uncomfortable with the role corporations play behind the scenes at such events, but she thinks they are necessary.
"This is more a top-flight party than Planned Parenthood's, as the guest list is more exclusive and the food, drink and space itself is some of the most expensive I've seen," Steiner explains later.
"These conventions are supposed to be merely ... events to rally for these candidates," Holman says.
It's past 1 a.m. when Steiner leaves the party and heads off to another.
