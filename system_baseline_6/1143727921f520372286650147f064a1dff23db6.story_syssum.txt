But Karl Rove's insistence that Barack Obama had not carried Ohio -- despite the call by his own network, Fox News, that the president had done just that -- represented something larger.
Rove, to be sure, is a smart guy.
Rove, who also has a Wall Street Journal column, helped create two political action committees, American Crossroads and Crossroads Grassroots Political Strategies, that raised and spent about $175 million in this campaign, most of it on television ads promoting Mitt Romney or attacking Obama.
Fox News, CNN and MSNBC were each in the process of calling Ohio -- and thus the presidential race -- for Obama.
Rove was, of course, wrong; Obama won Ohio, and a second term.
So he not only doesn't accept that the president was born in Hawaii, he doesn't accept that Obama won the election fair and square.
But for a brief moment on Election Night, we got a glimpse of pure partisanship in the guise of journalism.
