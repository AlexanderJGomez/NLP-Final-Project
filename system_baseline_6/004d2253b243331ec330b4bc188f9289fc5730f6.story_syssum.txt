The cables show that Mubarak has taken a persistently hard line toward Iran, telling U.S. diplomats in 2008 that he had warned Tehran "not to provoke the Americans" on the nuclear issue and insisting Egypt could never accept a nuclear-armed Iran.
To that end, the cables describe the Mubarak government as a helpful partner in stopping smuggling into Gaza from Egypt.
But given Mubarak's sensitivities, the U.S. has trodden carefully in pressing the Egyptian government on human rights.
A cable from 2008 cites Egyptian experts as describing a "disgruntled mid-level officer corps" with military salaries falling far behind the civilian sector and the top brass averse to Gamal succeeding his father.
Even so, one cable concludes: "The military still remains a potent political and economic force."
