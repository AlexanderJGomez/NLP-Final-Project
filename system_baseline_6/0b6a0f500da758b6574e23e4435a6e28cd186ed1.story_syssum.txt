"It was certainly a rare day that there were so many tornadoes that caused so much damage in populated areas," CNN Meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said.
An official count is not immediately available, but Jeras said she expects that the numbers will reveal a historic April with a record number of twisters.
"Almost like when you pull the drain in your tub," said CNN Meteorologist Chad Myers.
With the latest outbreak, April may turn out to be a historic month for tornadoes, he said.
"We may finish out April with more than 300 tornadoes," Carbin said.
