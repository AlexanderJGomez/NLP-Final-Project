The Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, released its list Thursday as cardinals held meetings at the Vatican in a prelude to the selection of the next pontiff.
Tagle would normally be considered too young for the role, but Benedict XVI's almost unprecedented resignation might have changed the way the cardinals think, he said.
No date has been set for the conclave, or secret election, for the new pope, said the Rev.
The discussions they are having in the general congregations are a vital part of the process, he said, since once the conclave starts there won't be much time between votes for reflection or the exchange of ideas.
The cardinals have to have all the information they need in order to make a mature, responsible judgment in the election, especially at a time when the church faces complex issues, he said.
Lombardi said 152 cardinals met Thursday morning.
Thursday morning's business included reports on the financial state of the Holy See, Lombardi said.
"They want to say what the next pope will hear, because he's probably in that room, and they also want to alert the people who haven't spent so much time in Rome just what the situation really is here as they see it," Cardinal Francis George of Chicago said.
In the 13th century, the election of one pope took two years and nine months, the diocese said.
