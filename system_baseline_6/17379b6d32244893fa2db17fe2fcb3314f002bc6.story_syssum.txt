(CNN) -- Argentina's Congress debated a broadcast reform bill Wednesday, a proposal analysts say is the latest blow in a fight between President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and media conglomerate Grupo Clarin.
But critics said it targets the powerful Grupo Clarin.
"It hits other media groups, but Clarin is the one it hurts," said Daniel Kerner, an analyst at Eurasia Group.
If anyone is applying unfair pressure, it is monopolistic media companies, Fernandez de Kirchner said.
In response, Fernandez de Kirchner has come out swinging at the Clarin newspaper and its parent company, observers said.
The Kirchners "have a hostile stance, not just against Clarin but against all the press," he said.
It's paradoxical."
