Washington (CNN) -- Top White House and congressional negotiators failed to reach agreement Tuesday on a spending plan for the rest of the current fiscal year, bringing the federal government closer to a shutdown at the end of the week.
Obama and Reid, D-Nevada, both insisted Tuesday that Democrats are agreeing to more than 50% of the spending cuts sought by Republicans, which they said should be sufficient for a compromise on an issue that has little overall effect on the deficit and debt issues.
The president then made an unannounced appearance in the White House briefing room to tell reporters that Boehner and Reid would meet on their own later in the day.
Boehner, meanwhile, insisted House Republicans wouldn't let Senate Democrats and the White House put them "in a box" by forcing them to choose between a government shutdown or continued government funding with insufficient spending cuts.
"We want the largest spending cuts that are possible," said Boehner, R-Ohio.
A senior Democratic source with knowledge of the ongoing negotiations said the biggest obstacle to a deal involves whether reductions in mandatory spending programs, known in appropriations parlance as "Changes in Mandatory Spending" or CHIMPS, should be part of spending cuts.
Republicans, who want any spending cuts to reflect a reduction in the size of government, note that reducing the spending in a mandatory program for one year doesn't prevent the amount from returning to its original level the following year.
