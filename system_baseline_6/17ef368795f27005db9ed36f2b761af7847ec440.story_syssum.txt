Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani's decision to cede power willingly is a first in the modern history of the region.
"God only knows I never wanted power for personal reasons and I never sought power for any personal motive," the outgoing emir said.
Jamie Ingram, a Middle East analyst at IHS Global Insight, said that while Sheikh Tamim had been groomed for power for some time, especially over the past two years, it was still a surprise to see the handover come so soon.
But how greatly it will be involved in Syria under Sheikh Tamim "is the big question," said Ingram, since Qatar has already started to pull back on that front and let Saudi Arabia take a lead.
"The United States looks forward to working with Sheikh Tamim to deepen the ties between our two countries, and to continue our close partnership on issues of mutual interest," Obama said.
Sheikh Hamad was probably motivated by the desire for an orderly transition, having seen close-up what can happen if an older generation clings to power or an impatient crown prince plots a coup, said Ingram.
