2.
It started while I was doing research for a story on illegal animal trafficking, and I was reading books, including Dana Goodyear's "Anything that Moves" -- about how the American foodie scene is trending toward the bizarre and endangered (witness the 2010 bust of a California restaurant serving whale) -- and Jonathan Safran Foer's "Eating Animals," which argues, in part, that one cannot eat meat and also earnestly claim to be an environmentalist.
Is it possible to eat meat in modern-day America, consider yourself an environmentalist and sleep soundly without being a hypocrite?
Here are a few:
(Chocolate, by the way, is actually worse than all of these, requiring 24,000 liters; but it's clear that a vegetarian diet is far more water- and energy-efficient than one that includes meat.)
Per capita meat consumption in the United States appears to have peaked around the year 2000 at more than 180 pounds of meat per person per year, or about half a pound each day, according to the Earth Policy Institute.
Animal agriculture pollutes the water: Last summer, like pretty much every summer, there was a "dead zone" in the Gulf of Mexico the size of Connecticut.
Eating meat adds to your greenhouse gas footprint: Finally, eating animals, like doing almost anything, contributes to a person's greenhouse gas footprint.
So: Knowing all that, I would encourage you to consider giving up meat -- or even just one of the most resource-intensive meats, like beef -- for Earth Day.
(I like TreeHugger founder Graham Hill's idea of eating meat only on the weekends; and singer Paul McCartney's idea of Meat Free Mondays.)
But one day?
And it's one that -- even for a day -- can have real impact.
