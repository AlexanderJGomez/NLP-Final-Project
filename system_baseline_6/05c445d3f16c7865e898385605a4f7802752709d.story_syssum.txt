After talking about the need for the anti-ISIS coalition to be "inclusive, engaging the widest possible coalition of countries as possible," Cameron touched on his conversation with Rouhani.
Then again, Cameron added, "Iran's leaders could help in defeating the threat from ISIL," using a commonly used acronym for ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State.
Gen. Amir-Ali Hajizadeh even said that members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard "stopped" ISIS from entering the Kurdish city of Irbil, according to a report Wednesday from state-run Press TV.
Rouhani on Wednesday criticized the coalition airstrikes in Syria, saying they do not have "any legal standing" because U.N. members haven't sanctioned them.
