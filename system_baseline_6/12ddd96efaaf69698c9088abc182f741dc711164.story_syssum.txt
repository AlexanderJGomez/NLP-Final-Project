CNN obtained a copy of the police report Friday, as news of the allegations against Joseph Rogers Jr. spread around the media.
The accuser "was forced to endure the harassment and demeaning treatment by Rogers because she was a single mother and needed her job to support herself and her son," according to police.
No charges have been filed in the case.
