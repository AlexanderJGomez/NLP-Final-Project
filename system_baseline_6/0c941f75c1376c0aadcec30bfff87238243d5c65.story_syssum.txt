Former President George W. Bush has a number of accomplishments under his belt: Texas governor, U.S. president, and now, a New York Times best-selling author.
"He's an extraordinary person, not only because of his accomplishments but because of his character," Bush said.
The fact that the elder Bush is still alive to see the book also meant a lot to him, Bush said.
"Secondly, I'm glad that a lot of his friends are alive and can take it in and say, 'wow, this is the guy I know.'"
