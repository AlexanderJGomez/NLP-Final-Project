It was not known whether Wilson -- an officer for six years, including four in Ferguson -- had been placed on modified assignment.
Brown was African-American; Wilson is white.
Shepard said Wilson "has a huge heart" and cares about people.
The Ferguson police chief, before speaking to reporters, told CNN's Don Lemon that the officer was devastated by what had happened.
The documents said Wilson, who was treated for injuries after the shooting, was in the area of the shooting after leaving a report of a sick person when he spotted Brown.
A police officer who responded to the robbery said he identified Brown as the robbery suspect by comparing surveillance images of the incident to the body of the slain teen.
The police chief is white.
The mayor also is white, and so are five of the six city council members.
