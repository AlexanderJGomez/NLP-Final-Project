Scientists hope to glean more clues about the origin and evolution of the universe, and in particular our own galaxy, after a camera of this incredible scale -- fitted to the Gaia space telescope -- was launched Thursday.
It's the biggest camera ever put into space," said Ralph Cordey, head of science and exploration at Astrium.
"Gaia is an amazingly ambitious mission," he said.
He may have not have too long to wait, as Astrium is already working on design concepts to examine exoplanet atmospheres -- which may provide signs of seasonal variations.
