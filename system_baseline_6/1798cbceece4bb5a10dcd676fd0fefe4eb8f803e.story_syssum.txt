Oil-rich Equatorial Guinea and Gabon are the smallest countries ever to ever host the Africa Cup of Nations, with a combined population of just over two million.
"It is only the second time that Central Africa has the honor to host the most prestigious competition on the continent.
"When you award AFCON to places like Burkina Faso, Mali, Angola or Gabon, you find that coffers for sporting infrastructure that would be normally be difficult to open suddenly emerge and you're leaving a legacy of football infrastructure," he told CNN.
The deadly attack on Togo's team led to questions about the tournament's organization and security, but according to Gleeson, the Africa Cup of Nations can't be judged by similar standards to the World Cup or the European Championships.
Suleiman said security arrangements are the responsibility of the host nations, not the ruling body.
"Finally hosting the tournament means so many opportunities for Gabon and its people," he said.
"The security in Gabon will be the best organized of any country which hosted the tournament before us.
AFCON is the planet's third biggest football tournament, behind the World Cup and the European Championships.
In Gabon a new 40,000-seater stadium has been built in the capital Libreville, with help from the Chinese government, and will host the final.
The qualified nations are: Group A -- Equatorial Guinea, Libya, Zambia, Senegal; Group B -- Ivory Coast, Sudan, Burkina Faso, Angola; Group C -- Gabon, Niger, Morocco, Tunisia; Group D -- Ghana, Botswana, Mali, Guinea.
