Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea said Wednesday that it had put a satellite in orbit for the first time, giving a lift to its homegrown space industry and matching a feat achieved last month by its hostile neighbor, North Korea.
The pressure on the South Korean rocket scientists to get the satellite into space increased after North Korea carried out its own successful launch last month in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions.
South Korean authorities say their latest attempted satellite launch is a crucial step for the development of the country's civilian space program.
The successful launch puts South Korea among the small group of nations that have sent a rocket into space from their own soil.
