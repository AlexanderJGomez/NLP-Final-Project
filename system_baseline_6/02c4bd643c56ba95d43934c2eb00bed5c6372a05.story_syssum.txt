According to the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities, it's here, at a spot known as Abusir, that the tomb of Marc Antony and Cleopatra might be located.
Martinez went on to earn a law degree but continued to be fascinated by the saga of Cleopatra.
In short, Martinez believes, Cleopatra was a woman way ahead of her times.
Marc Antony was a no less fascinating character than Cleopatra.
Shortly afterward, Antony and Cleopatra committed suicide, he by his own sword, she by a poisonous asp.
The sudden focus on Antony and Cleopatra has also reignited an old debate over the latter's looks.
At Abusir, he showed me one of the coins with Cleopatra's likeness.
In any event, it's just one of many mysteries in Egypt.
Who built them?
There has been plenty of excitement in the past few days over reports that Martinez and her team are about to find the long-lost tomb of Antony and Cleopatra.
I guess we can wait a few more months.
