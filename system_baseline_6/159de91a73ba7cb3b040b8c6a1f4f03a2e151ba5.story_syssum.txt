JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Citing security concerns, the U.S. State Department has revoked the visas it recently issued to three Gaza students who were awarded Fulbright scholarships to study in the United States.
According to Sari Bashi, the executive-director of Gisha, an Israeli non-governmental organization that advocates freedom of movement for Palestinians and has been working closely with the students, four of the seven Fulbright students were cleared for travel out of Gaza by Israel, but the remaining three were prevented from leaving Gaza by the Israeli government, citing security concerns.
Bashi said that while the situation of the three students is one of "tremendous concern," it only underscores what she says is the larger problem of lack of access to higher education for hundreds of Gaza students who have been accepted into universities outside of Gaza but are prevented from leaving due to Israeli restrictions.
"We do act to facilitate students wishing to study at Western universities where they are exposed to liberal and democratic values," an Israeli government official said on Tuesday.
