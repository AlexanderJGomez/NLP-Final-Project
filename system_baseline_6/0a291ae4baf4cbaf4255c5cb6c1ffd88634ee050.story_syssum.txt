BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Half of Iraq's registered voters turned out for peaceful provincial elections this weekend, the election commission said Sunday.
The highest turnout -- 65 percent -- was in the Salaheddin province in northern Iraq, the commission said.
The results should spell out the status of the Sunni Arab "Awakening" movement -- which opposes al Qaeda in Iraq -- and the popularity of the Shiite factions, such as those backing al-Maliki, Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, and the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.
There were no casualties.
