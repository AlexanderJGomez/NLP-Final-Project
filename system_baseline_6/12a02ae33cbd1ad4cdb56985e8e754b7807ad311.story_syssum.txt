Despite being unable to replicate the form he showed prior to his first retirement, Schumacher said he is still hungry for success as he prepares for a 19th season in the elite division of motorsport.
The former Williams pilot was looking forward to learning more about the new car ahead of the season getting under way in Australia next month.
"We have had a good start to our 2012 testing program, and it was a great feeling to drive the first laps in the new F1 W03," the 26-year-old said.
