(CNN) -- Heavy rain, hilly terrain and inadequate equipment slowed efforts to recover hundreds of people feared killed by a massive landslide in eastern Uganda, officials said Thursday.
The terrain also is inaccessible by road, Ecweru said.
A select few attended the service, because of the risk of more landslides, Ecweru said.
Most of the bodies were recovered from a hospital engulfed by the landslide after residents sought shelter, officials said.
Flooding also has destroyed roads and washed away bridges in at least seven districts.
