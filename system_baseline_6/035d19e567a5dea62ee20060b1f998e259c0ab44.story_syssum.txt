WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Obama declared Monday that his stimulus plan is "starting to work" and that 2,000 transportation projects -- costing much less than expected -- are under way.
"This is great news."
Obama said the highway projects from the stimulus bill will create or save 150,000 jobs by the end of next year.
