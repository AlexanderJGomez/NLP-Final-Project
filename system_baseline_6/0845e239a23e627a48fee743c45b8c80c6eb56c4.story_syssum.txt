(CNN) -- A judge has ordered mediation in the case of a teen girl who says her family threatened to kill her for converting from Islam to Christianity.
At a court hearing Thursday in Orlando, the girl's parents denied all the allegations against them.
But Bary conceded he would have preferred that his daughter practice the Muslim faith first.
In the court filing, Rifqa Bary stated her father said, "If you have this Jesus in your heart, you are dead to me!"
Another hearing is scheduled for September 29 if the family is not able to resolve the conflict through mediation.
