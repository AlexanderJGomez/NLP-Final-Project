No shape more aptly fits the diamond nickname "ice" than the emerald, a rectangular cut with lean facets extending down the sides.
Characterized by a flat top and step-shaped side facets, an emerald cut cries out for a clean setting.
The long shape is especially flattering.
It's often called the round brilliant because it has triangular facets, arranged to direct light from the bottom of the stone up through the top for maximum sparkle.
Most diamonds have a flat top with facets on the edges and bottom, but a rose-cut diamond is domed and covered with facets.
