(CNN) -- A news anchor and four other people were killed on Monday in a suicide bombing after armed militants stormed a TV complex in Tikrit, Iraq, police said.
The Committee to Protect Journalists, a watchdog group, said in a report this month that journalists have been subjected to threats and killings.
Violence occurred in other regions of Iraq on Monday, police said.
Three people died in shootings in Mosul, and an attack on a bus in Baquba, northeast of Baghdad, left three others dead, police said.
