Masri agreed, according to the plea agreement.
The plea agreement says the associate asked Masri how they would link up with Al-Shabaab once they arrived in Somalia.
Masri was arrested when he left the store.
Masri is scheduled to be sentenced on October 16, and his plea agreement calls for a sentence of nine years and 10 months in prison on the conspiracy to provide material support charge.
