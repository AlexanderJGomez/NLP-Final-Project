Sony Pictures Television, the studio behind the original series, is said to be shopping a pitch for a spinoff series centered on David Faustino's girl-crazy Bud Bundy.
"Married ... with Children" premiered in 1987 and went on to have 11 seasons, becoming the first prime-time series to air on Fox and one of the network's first breakout hits.
"Married ... with Children" is just the latest '90s series that could have a revival.
And last month, TV Guide reported that a "Full House" reboot is in the works with some of the original actors reprising their roles.
