But Holmes was hardly a cartoon.
Holmes says he was insane at the time of the shootings, and that is his legal defense and court plea: not guilty by reason of insanity.
Just before the shooting, Holmes was a doctoral student in neuroscience, and he was studying how the brain works, with his schooling funded by a U.S. government grant.
A jury will ultimately decide Holmes' fate.
Holmes also has a sister, Chris, a musician, who's five years younger, the newspaper said.
His family then moved down the California coast, where Holmes grew up in the San Diego-area neighborhood of Rancho Pe√±asquitos, which a neighbor described as "kind of like Mayberry," the San Diego newspaper said.
Holmes was one of six pre-thesis Ph.D. students in the program who were awarded a neuroscience training grant from the National Institutes of Health.
Holmes was "denied access to the school after June 12, 2012, after he made threats to a professor," according to court documents.
Holmes began to fantasize about killing "a lot of people" in early June, nearly six weeks before the shootings, the station reported, citing unidentified sources familiar with the investigation.
What caused this turn for the worse for Holmes has yet to be clearly detailed.
Nine minutes before Holmes went into the movie theater, he called a University of Colorado switchboard, public defender Brady has said in court.
"It was," Holmes wrote her, according to the Times.
It was her last contact with Holmes.
The matter will be settled by the jury.
