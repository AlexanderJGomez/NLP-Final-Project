(CNN) -- The case of a Christian woman in Sudan who was sentenced to die for refusing to renounce her faith has cast new light on the plight of persecuted Christians worldwide.
Since 1999, the U.S. State Department has tracked the world's worst abusers of religious rights.
The country has arrested and deported Western Christians suspected of spreading their faith, according to a State Department report.
Harsh detentions for religious dissenters are the norm, according to the State Department report.
Last year, Christian migrant fellowships were raided, and worshipers were detained and deported, the group says.
Boko Haram, an Islamic extremist group, vowed in 2009 to rid the nation's north of all non-Muslim influence, including Christians, according to The Voice of the Martyrs, another group that tracks the persecution of Christians.
The militant Islamist group, al-Shabaab, targets Christians and local communities," the group says on its site.
