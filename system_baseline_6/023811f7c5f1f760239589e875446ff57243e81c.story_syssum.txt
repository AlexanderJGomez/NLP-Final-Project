"If I didn't do something about my health, then I was concerned I'd never live long enough to get married and have children or be healthy enough to spend quality time with my future family," the Evansville, Indiana, man said.
Schmitt jump-started the first six months of his weight loss journey back in July  2009 by reducing his food portions.
During the first six months of his weight loss plan, he made the daily choice of moving his body more than he had in the past.
It took Schmitt about six and a half months to lose his first 100 pounds and then he shed the last 77 pounds over the next eight and a half months.
Schmitt's family doctor, Dr. Michael Allen, said he was comfortable with the pace of the weight loss, since he was a young male and didn't have  major health issues, beyond his high blood pressure.
Schmitt said his family members, with their various health issues, have closely watched his transformation, and he hopes his new healthy life will inspire them to make their own changes one day.
"Life is good for me right now and the future is bright," said Schmitt.
