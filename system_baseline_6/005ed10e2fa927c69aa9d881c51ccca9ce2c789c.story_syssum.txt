(CNN)At least 10 people and two attackers were killed in Tuesday's attack against the luxurious Corinthia Hotel in Tripoli, Libya, a spokesman for a security division of the Ministry of Interior in Tripoli said.
Al-Naas earlier said at least two Libyan security personnel had been killed in the attack and that three gunmen were holed up in the hotel.
"We are trying to take possession of the hotel back to assess the damage," he said, but Libyan security forces were not yet allowing that.
A witness to the events told CNN that all roads leading to the Corinthia Hotel had been sealed by security forces.
