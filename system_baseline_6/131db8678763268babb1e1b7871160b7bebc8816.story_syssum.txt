The psychiatrist said he questioned Hinckley in November about being dishonest about his activities, and that Hinckley minimized it and called it "nitpicking."
Patterson said he had asked Hinckley about Secret Service reports Hinckley had gone into book stores and looked at shelves of history books which included volumes about presidential assassination.
Patterson said Hinckley lied to his parents and psychiatrists prior to the 1981 Reagan shooting.
Patterson said that relationship was a delusion and noted that years after the assassination attempt -- in 1995 -- Hinckley said he was over his feelings for Foster.
The hearing on whether Hinckley should get increased freedoms will resume on Monday.
