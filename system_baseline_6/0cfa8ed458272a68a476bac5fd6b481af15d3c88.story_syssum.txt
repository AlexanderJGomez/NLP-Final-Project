However, she says, local and state investigators have done neither to support their theory that Lennon Lacy hanged himself one summer night.
I listen for him and I don't hear him," Lacy says.
According to medical documents, his body was covered in fire ants.
"He didn't do this to himself," Lacy says.
However, North Carolina's Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Deborah Radisch declared his death a suicide.
The family says Lennon had not changed his routine and was focused on college and football -- and distracted by his girlfriend.
I also, initially told him how I felt - that I did not approve of it," Lacy says.
The crossbar of the swing set frame he was found hanging from was 7-foot-6, according to the NAACP review.
Those were not his belts," Lacy says.
Also, the shoes Lennon was wearing when his body was found were not his, according to his family.
Those shoes were not with Lennon's body when he arrived at the state medical examiner's office, according to the NAACP review.
However, in the summary of the case, written the day Lennon was found, the local medical examiner asked "did he hang self?
"The comments that were released by the NAACP were a synopsis of a professional exchange between the NAACP's independently-retained forensic pathologist and Dr. Radisch," according to a spokesperson for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.
That's all I can say," Lacy says.
