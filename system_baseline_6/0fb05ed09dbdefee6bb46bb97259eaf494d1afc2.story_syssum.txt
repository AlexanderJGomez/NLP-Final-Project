Although the company's primary business remains aircraft storage, it has stripped 12 planes completely since its inception
All parts that are saved can be sold on by the aircraft owners.
While the efficiency savings this process brings are obvious, Tarmac also believes that dismantling old planes will allow engineers to better design more efficient aircraft in the future.
It will also ensure aircraft are disposed of in a way that is efficient and makes the most of valuable materials.
