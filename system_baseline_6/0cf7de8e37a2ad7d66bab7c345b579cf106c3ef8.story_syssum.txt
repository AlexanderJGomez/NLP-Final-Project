"We're hoping that the world attention does not end from what the Iranians are doing right now, because this is not going to end in the next few days, because this is a long haul, a long battle," said Washington protest and group organizer Morteza Ahmady.
The speed with which the election results were released -- two hours after polls closed -- insulted the Iranian people, said Ahmady, who cited that as a sign of fraud.
"And we're saying that, yes, if they indeed did win the vote, then the election should be theirs, because we are a democratic people.
We're just asking for a revote."
