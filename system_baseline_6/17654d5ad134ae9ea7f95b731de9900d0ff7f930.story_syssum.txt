(CNN) -- European leaders meeting in Brussels Thursday need to send Russia an unmistakeable signal that its military intervention in Ukraine will not be tolerated.
Putin wants to rebuild his influence over Ukraine as a whole and recognizes that the occupation of Crimea is more likely to unite the country against him.
Indeed, the only metric by which Russia remains strong is its ability to generate scary headlines in the western media.
Assistance should also be given to help Ukraine realize its goal of energy independence from Russia.
The EU should be willing to talk to Russia about its interests in the region and the creation of a common economic space provided Russia ends its military intervention, restores friendly ties with Kiev and doesn't assume a right of veto over Ukraine's future.
Travel bans and asset freezes aimed at Russian officials who supported and facilitated the invasion of Crimea should be combined with a rolling program of money laundering investigations into Russian financial assets held in western banks.
So far the measures European leaders have been prepared to discuss fall far short of what is required get Russia's attention.
