Sawyer's father, Matthew Jones, said he was sure the tigers couldn't escape from their zoo exhibit.
"I assured him they couldn't," Matthew Jones said.
Matthew Jones said that after many trips to zoos around the country, he thought this zoo was "perfectly adequate" and saw nothing odd about it.
But Jen Williams of Hollister, California, said she felt safe during her June 2007 visit and didn't think the animals could jump over anything.
"They're pretty spectacular animals when you see them up close," Arnold said.
Reflecting on the mauling, Williams said she will continue to go see the animals and added that she's observed that renovations go on all the time.
