More than 400 tribal gunmen took over Taiz in southwest Yemen, witnesses there said.
Meanwhile, President Ali Abdullah Saleh was in Saudi Arabia Tuesday, recovering from burns over 40% of his body and a collapsed lung, a U.S. government official briefed on the matter said.
A man trying to cross into Yemen from Saudi Arabia early Tuesday fatally shot two security officers and wounded another, the state-run Saudi Press Agency said Tuesday.
Yemeni investigations are "focusing on what happened inside the mosque," not a rocket or mortar attack, diplomats said Monday.
The official, who asked not to be identified, said that Saleh was in the mosque when two "projectiles" were fired during Friday prayers.
A U.S. government official said Monday he could not imagine the Saudis letting Saleh return.
The Yemeni government has had a "big impact on acquiring information on AQAP," the official said, referring to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.
