As someone who grew up in poverty, watching his single mother work 16-hour days to provide as much as she possibly could for us, I have lived the power of the American Dream.
Over the past 50 years, we've seen the War on Poverty struggle in its core mission -- to help lift folks up.
It is not enough to simply rebuild, or as some would call it gentrify, our tougher neighborhoods -- we have to provide the opportunity to the folks living there already to take part in a brighter future.
Opportunity knocks for all of us at some point.
