Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- What is most shocking about Gabby Giffords now is how much she looks like her old self.
That's how Giffords describes herself.
The right-handed Giffords still has no use of that hand and that arm is paralyzed.
She is also still aided by nurses, who come to her home, and by speech therapists, who constantly work with her to help improve her ability to communicate.
That makes Giffords giggle.
Before Giffords was shot, she jetted between her home in Tucson and work in Washington, while Kelly lived and worked in Texas, home of Johnson Space Center.
Giffords says she would like to learn to shoot again, but it's not a high priority.
"No.
Move ahead," said Giffords.
