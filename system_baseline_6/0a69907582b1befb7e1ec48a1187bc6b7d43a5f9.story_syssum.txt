(CNN) -- Debbie Benzine lost her first husband to heart disease when he was 44.
He was.
"One day ... you find out that you're 56 years old and if you want to see 66 you better do something about it," he says.
Benzine decided to do the gastric bypass surgery.
The psychiatrist told Benzine he rejected upward of half his patients because they weren't prepared to make the necessary life changes after the surgery.
The day of his surgery, his wife recalls she was an emotional wreck.
The surgery was a success, but he was far from the ideal patient.
"We didn't go to happy hour or dinner with friends because he was uncomfortable," Debbie Benzine says.
It was like being a baby and learning to eat all over again, Benzine says.
He had to learn to reward himself with activities instead of food.
More importantly, "I will have my husband and best friend around for a long time," his wife says.
