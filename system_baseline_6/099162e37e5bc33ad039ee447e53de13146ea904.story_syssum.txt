(CNN) -- The man police say opened fire inside a crowded Colorado movie theater may have been planning the attack for months, the local police chief told reporters Saturday.
By Saturday evening, police said that "all hazards" had been removed from the suspect's apartment.
All occupants except those who live in the suspect's building were allowed to return home Saturday night, police said.
Police Chief Oates said he hoped his officers would be out of the theater by Monday to allow the suspect's defense team in there Tuesday.
But Holmes soon went out a rear door leading from the theater to the parking lot, leaving it propped open, the source said.
Police said Holmes set off two gas-emitting devices before spraying the theater with bullets from an AR-15 rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun and at least one of two .40-caliber handguns that police recovered.
Holmes had bought the guns legally at stores in the Denver area over the past two months, Oates said.
