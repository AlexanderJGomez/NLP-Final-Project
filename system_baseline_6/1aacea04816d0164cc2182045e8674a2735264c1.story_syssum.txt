I don't want revenge," Petro Poroshenko said after taking the oath of office.
The country will build the means to do so, Poroshenko said, and re-arming the Ukrainian army must be a priority.
Poroshenko, one of the world's richest men and an experienced politician, took the oath of office in the country's parliament Saturday.
"The people stood up," he said, declaring his country's new direction toward the West.
The names of the cities Donetsk and Luhansk have transformed into monikers for flashpoints of tension between Russia and the West as the government in Kiev breaks its ties with Moscow to embrace Europe and the United States.
"New powers will be allocated to regional powers," Poroshenko said.
Ukraine will be one unified country, the President said.
"Yesterday I made a firm statement about it to the Russian leadership in Normandy," he said.
