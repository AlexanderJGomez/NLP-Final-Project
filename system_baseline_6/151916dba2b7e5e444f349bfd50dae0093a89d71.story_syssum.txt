(CNN) -- Gore Vidal, the eclectic author who faithfully chronicled the major shifts and upheavals in the United States in books, essays and plays, has died.
Vidal also appeared in a number of films, including the political satire, "Bob Roberts," where he played a U.S. senator.
The more they communicated, the more impressed he was by McVeigh, Vidal said.
Vidal "was always a gadfly," Bram said.
Author Truman Capote once said he felt sad about Vidal, "very sad that he has to breathe every day."
He was born Eugene Luther Gore Vidal on October 3, 1925.
And when his mother, Nina, remarried, Vidal shared a stepfather with Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.
From the congressional record, from American history, poetry," Vidal said.

Vidal himself once said of the book, "I sold a million copies and it caused much distress at The New York Times."
Steers, Vidal's nephew, did not elaborate on funeral arrangements for the author, only saying that the family asks people to donate to the Alzheimer's Association instead of sending flowers.
"We share a plot, and I'll be there," Vidal said.
