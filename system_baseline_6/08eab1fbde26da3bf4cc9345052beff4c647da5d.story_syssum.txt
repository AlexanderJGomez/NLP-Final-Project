Manama, Bahrain (CNN) -- Security forces in Bahrain stormed the main hospital, beating doctors, and attacked demonstrators in Manama's Pearl Roundabout on Wednesday, witnesses in the Bahraini capital said.
The crackdown comes a day after Bahrain's King Hamad imposed a three-month state of emergency and two days after Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates dispatched troops to the Persian Gulf island nation to "protect the safety of citizens," the Bahraini government said.
Security forces then stormed the hospital and beat staffers, several doctors there said.
Fatima Haji, another doctor, also said she was trapped in the hospital.
Haji said two people had died in the hospital Wednesday morning, and she feared for the other patients there because the doctors were not able to work.
We could see tear gas being dispersed," Jamjoom said.
Officials at another private hospital, Salmany Hospital, also said they were being besieged by troops.
The king's decree mandates that security forces should "take the measures and procedures necessary to preserve the safety of the nation and its people,"  a government statement said.
"The world is watching to see whether Bahrain will respect the basic rights of all its citizens."
