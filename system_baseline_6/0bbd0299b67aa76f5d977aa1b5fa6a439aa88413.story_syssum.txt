That was then.
More than 2 million World War II veterans went to college on the GI Bill.
The GI Bill and the Truman Commission Report touched off a golden age of higher education in the United States.
While 52% of World War II veterans enrolled in private colleges and universities under the GI Bill, only 20% of the veterans of Korea and Vietnam were able to do so.
We must also insist that Congress make it a high priority to provide the opportunity for our servicemen and women -- and for all young men and women in the United States -- to use higher education to fulfill the American Dream and go as far and as fast as their ambition, discipline and talent will take them.
