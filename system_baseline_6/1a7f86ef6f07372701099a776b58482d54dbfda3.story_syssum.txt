The police officer was arrested Tuesday, according to Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld.
According to a medical report, Nowarah was pronounced dead in a hospital less than two hours later, having suffered a single bullet wound that entered his chest and passed out his back.
After a CNN report on the incident, the Israeli military suspended a soldier shown firing that day at demonstrators, according to an Israeli military source who asked not to be identified because of the continuing investigation.
The bullet, found at the time of death in the teen's backpack, and the three bullet fragments, found in his body, were handed to Israeli investigators, Michaeli said.
And experts were able to "calculate the firing angle from which the shot was taken" based on where the bullets entered and left the teenager's body, according to the human rights advocate.
