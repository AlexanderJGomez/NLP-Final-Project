A Washoe County, Nevada, jury convicted James Michael Biela, 28, of first-degree murder and sexual assault in the death of Brianna Denison.
A pair of panties that did not belong to Denison were found near the body, in what police said was a "calling card" that helped them connect Biela not only to Denison, but also to the other assaults.
The woman testified that her assailant asked for her panties and took them with him.
A friend of Biela's girlfriend saw the photo of the panties, and thought she recognized the truck police described.
Biela's defense attorneys challenged the DNA testing method, claiming it was not accurate.
