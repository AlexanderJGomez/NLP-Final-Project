Investigators found a letter in the waste bin of his Dusseldorf, Germany, apartment saying that Lubitz, 27, wasn't fit to do his job, city prosecutor Christoph Kumpa said Friday.
They found no goodbye note or confession, authorities said.
The only sounds, authorities said, were those of pounding on the cockpit door, Lubitz's steady breathing and, eventually, screaming passengers.
Reuters reported that a German newspaper said Lubitz had been treated for depression about six years ago.
Dangerous and windy condition at the remote site, which covers more than a square mile, are hampering efforts to recover bodies and evidence, he said.
There were five on Friday, Bloy said.
It could be weeks before all the bodies are recovered, identified and released to the families, authorities said.
Lufthansa and other German airlines have already adopted the rule, the airline said.
