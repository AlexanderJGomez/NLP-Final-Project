1 Rory McIlroy reiterated his support for 2012 vice captain Paul McGinley on the day he announced a new multi-year sponsorship deal with Nike.
"He's been vice captain a few times, he's holed the winning putt in the Ryder Cup.
But Poulter took to micro-blogging site Twitter to say: "Darren (Clarke) has taken his name out of the running for Ryder Cup captaincy.
It would be fantastic to have Paul McGinley as the 2014 captain."
