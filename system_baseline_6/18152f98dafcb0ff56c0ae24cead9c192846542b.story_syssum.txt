"Egypt has room for everybody, and we are keen to save every drop of Egyptian blood," Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the country's defense minister, said after days of clashes between pro-Morsy demonstrators and security forces that left hundreds dead.
An earlier report by the state-run news agency EGYNews said a group of armed men attempted to free the prisoners.
"The Egyptian people are free to choose whoever to govern them, while the armed forces will remain the safeguard of the will of the people and of their choice," he said.
But Muslim Brotherhood spokesman Mahmoud Ghazlan said al-Sisi's comments "are a clear proof that the end of the coup is near," Ghazlan said.
On Saturday, Egyptian security forces arrested more than 350 people at a mosque where throngs of Morsy supporters were hiding, including a handful from outside Egypt -- three Irish citizens, one Turkish and one Syrian, the Egyptian Interior Ministry said.
The new government urged the global community to listen to its side Sunday, accusing international media of being sympathetic to Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood.
In a statement also released Sunday, the interim government said it would set up a National Council for Human Rights and document "all the events that took place during the crisis."
Fahmy also said he greatly appreciated the foreign aid that Egypt gets.
U.S. law bars support of a government that has taken power by extraconstitutional means, but the administration has said it won't make a formal determination as to whether Morsy's ouster was a coup.
Members of the European Union announced Sunday that the body will "urgently review in the coming days its relations with Egypt and adopt measures" aimed at ending violence, resuming political dialogue and returning to a democratic process.
