London (CNN) -- Olympics fans will revel in track and field's most anticipated event Sunday, and the men's 100 meters will not lack for drama as Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt attempts to defend his title against his fellow countryman.
Only Andre Agassi and Rafael Nadal have achieved the feat of claiming a full set of grand slam titles and backed it it with Olympic gold in the singles.
But history on Saturday also favored the leaders, as the most decorated Olympian of all time tallied another win with his American teammates in the 4 x 100-meter medley relay, handing Michael Phelps his 18th gold medal in the last race of his storied swimming career.
In the last day of London's swimming competition, the American women won the 4x100-meter medley relay race, setting a new world record with a time of 3:52.05.
Elsewhere in London, Serena Williams completed a "career Golden Slam" at the 2012 Games, adding for the United States an Olympic women's singles tennis gold medal to her four tennis major titles.
