News that the Australian team bus will wear the words "Socceroos: Hopping Our Way Into History!"
Australian Football Federation CEO David Gallop took an equally dim view of it as the country's 30-man preliminary squad for Brazil was announced.
The U.S. stick with the motoring theme with "United By Team, Driven By Passion," while Dutch fans will hope the slogan "Real Men Wear Orange" can help steer the Netherlands all the way this time around after losing to Spain -- "Inside our hearts, the passion of a champion" -- in the 2010 final.
But Chadwick has some sympathy for Gallop and the Australian team.
Let us know what you think.
