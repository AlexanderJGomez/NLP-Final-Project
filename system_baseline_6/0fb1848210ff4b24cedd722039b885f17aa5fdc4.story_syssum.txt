Davern offered a new account in November about how Wood's death was reported, saying that Wagner waited hours to call the Coast Guard after Wood went missing off Catalina Island, near the California coast, following an argument the couple had.
It's possible we could yield new information that changes this case," the sheriff's spokesman said.
Authorities haven't gone into specifics about who they've interviewed, but did say when they reopened the case that Wagner wasn't a suspect.
In 2010, Lana Wood told CNN she believes a highly charged argument between her sister and Wagner on the yacht's back deck preceded Wood's drowning.
Davern has said he believes Wood's death was a direct result of a fight with Wagner.
Wagner admitted his jealousy in his book "Pieces of My Heart," also published in September 2009.
After Wagner argued with Walken and broke the wine bottle, Wood left in disgust and went to her stateroom, Davern told CNN.
Wagner shrugged and poured them both drinks, Davern said.
Wagner writes that he went to check on Wood, but she wasn't there.
She was nominated for Oscars in both of those films, as well as for "Love With the Proper Stranger" (1963), according to IMDb.
