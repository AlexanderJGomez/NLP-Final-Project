Bono suffered a serious back injury Friday while preparing for the resumption of the band's U.S. tour, the band said, and had emergency surgery.
"The ligament surrounding the disc had an 8-millimeter tear, and during surgery we discovered fragments of the disc had traveled into the spinal canal," Tonn said in the statement.
U2 Manager Paul McGuinness said the band is working with Live Nation to reschedule the tour dates.
