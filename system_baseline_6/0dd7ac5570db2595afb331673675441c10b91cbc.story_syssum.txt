Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- Anders Behring Breivik's defense counsel had warned that the self-confessed killer would show no remorse.
There were smiles and handshakes with the psychiatrists and prosecution at the start.
These are people who would prefer never to have to speak Breivik's name again.
There is a sense the people of Norway want to see due process done and then move on.
