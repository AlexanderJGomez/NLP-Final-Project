(CNN) -- Costume designer Mark Bridges can create eras with fabric.
He spoke with CNN about how his job combines the best of all worlds, and what (or "who," for those who prefer the favored Oscar pre-show word) he'll be wearing on the red carpet.
Bridges: Without the color to communicate the language of telling the story, I was trying to tell the story through textures, whether it be lamÃ©, sequins and beads for Hollywood, or very flat rough textured wools to communicate down-on-your-heels, or the elegance of satin lapels for evening wear, or the shimmer of a beautiful nightgown.
Bridges: I was always involved in theater and drama.
As a child, I loved movies, I always drew, I always loved fabric, I loved clothes, I loved color, I loved telling a story.
