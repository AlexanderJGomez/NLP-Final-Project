It showed, apparently, that significant numbers of Hispanics are now identifying as white.
That means there are black, white, even Asian Hispanics.
What it found was that growing numbers of Hispanics, when told by government forms that they were not a race unto themselves and that they had to choose a race, chose the category called "white."
An earlier Pew report indicated that the longer their families had been in America, the more likely Hispanics were to check the "white" box.
For proof, look no further than the invention of the white race itself.
They're not becoming white.
Correction: An earlier version of this article misidentified the source of the new research reported on by Pew.
