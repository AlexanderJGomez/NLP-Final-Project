One year after the Boston Marathon bombings and almost three years after his death in a CIA drone strike in Yemen, Anwar al-Awlaki, the New Mexico-born American cleric who was an operational leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, continues to be a major influence on violent jihadist extremists in the United States.
In 1994 while living in Colorado, al-Awlaki married his first wife, a cousin from Yemen.
For politicized, fundamentalist Muslims such as al-Awlaki, the presence of thousands of "infidel" American troops on the holy land of Saudi Arabia was a deep irritant.
Tsarnaev also downloaded the first issue of Inspire magazine, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's English-language webzine, which al-Awlaki helped to produce.
Even today, court documents continue to cite al-Awlaki and Inspire as influencing factors in terrorism cases.
The criminal complaint alleges that Sheikh posted a link on Facebook to a propaganda video narrated by al-Awlaki.
It is not just the U.S. government that continues to view al-Awlaki as maintaining, even in death, his power to influence.
Trying to eliminate al-Awlaki's writings on "holy war" on the Internet just won't work.
