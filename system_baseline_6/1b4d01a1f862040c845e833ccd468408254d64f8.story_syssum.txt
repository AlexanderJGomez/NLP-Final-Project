Khadija Madawili, technical manager at SABMiller Tanzania, said the red wine has a smooth, rounded taste and is best with "Nyama Choma," a local delicacy of roasted spiced meat, while the "natural sweet" wine is the perfect complement for light salads or simply enjoyed as an aperitif.

Yibrehu added that sales of Tej wine are increasing internationally as social media and international wine competitions raise awareness of alternative African wines.
