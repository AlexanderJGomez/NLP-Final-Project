Atlanta's FBI field division topped Los Angeles in reporting the most bank heists, with 350 for the 12 months ending September 30, 2007, according to the FBI, which annually names areas most prone to bank robberies.
Just Thursday, two suspects overpowered a security guard at an Atlanta, Georgia, bank, took his gun, robbed the bank and fled with money in hand, police said.
"We would attribute a lot of that [bank robberies] to the growth and the fact that the banking industry has matched that growth with an increase in bank branches throughout the area," Emmett said.
Atlanta's rise in bank heists comes just as Los Angeles has aggressively countered once out-of-control bank robberies.
While Emmett said there is no "typical" bank robber, he said he has seen some trends, most notably that they are often people battling drug addictions.
Emmett says typically very little money is taken in a bank heist.
But Brannen says profiling people like that can be problematic.
Emmett said as long as metro Atlanta continues to grow, so will the number of bank robberies.
