Four people believed to be connected to the drugs found in Philip Seymour Hoffman's apartment were arrested late Tuesday night, law enforcement officials told CNN.
Police discovered the largest amount of what is believed to be heroin in his apartment, the source said.
"He used to practice at night," said the former neighbor, recounting that Vineberg played keyboards.
Also found in Hoffman's apartment was his personal journal, resting on a living room TV stand, two law enforcement sources said.
Last week, Maryland officials said heroin tainted with fentanyl had claimed at least 37 lives since September.
On Tuesday,  a law enforcement source told CNN that the night before Hoffman died, he withdrew $1,200 from a grocery store ATM near his  apartment.

And at that point, he took off his hat and he said, 'I'm a heroin addict,'" Arundel said.
But actor George Clooney said he had dinner with Hoffman a few months ago, and he seemed  fine.
On Wednesday night, the famed Broadway theater district will dim its marquees for one minute at 7:45 p.m. in Hoffman's memory.
"I just was really profoundly affected by his death and felt like it was important for me to be here," said Leslie Kritzer, a fellow actor.
Kritzer said she had long admired Hoffman from afar.
