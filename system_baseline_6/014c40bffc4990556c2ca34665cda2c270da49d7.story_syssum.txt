(CNN) -- One of the three guns Adam Lanza used to kill 20 children and six adults at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, was a military-style semiautomatic rifle known as an AR-15.
"Every month or so I take my guns out to the range and shoot.
Another reason for these guns is hunting.
It may not be the best or most important reason, but military-style weapons often appeal to the enthusiast side of the American gun owner.
"There are people who buy certain types of firearms because they have a certain image -- the AR-15 is one of them," says Austin Nikel, a former AR-15 owner in Boulder, Colorado.
I don't own these guns to target shoot, though I do that with them.
Like most firearms, military-style weapons such as the AR-15 are semiautomatic -- increasing protection because the shooter can fire off many shots without having to manually chamber a new bullet.
Military-style weapons look more dangerous than other guns, he says, but really, there are many weapons available which are just as lethal, but which are not designed in a military style.
Perhaps the notion that people feel safe with our government after over 200 years is a testament to the Second Amendment value in balancing power with the citizens."
