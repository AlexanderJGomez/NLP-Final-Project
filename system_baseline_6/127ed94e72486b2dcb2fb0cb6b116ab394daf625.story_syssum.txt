In the wake of skyrocketing gun crime in Chicago, police have bitterly complained about the flow of firearms there via straw purchases from other states.
"I hope that those who have been concerned about Fast and Furious, whose investigation established that it was the local ATF agents in Arizona who initiated and so poorly implemented that effort, will join with us to close the loophole in the law that Mexican drug cartels are continuing to exploit," Leahy said.
The meeting will likely also address three other pieces of legislation aimed at reducing gun violence, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein's controversial assault weapons ban.
