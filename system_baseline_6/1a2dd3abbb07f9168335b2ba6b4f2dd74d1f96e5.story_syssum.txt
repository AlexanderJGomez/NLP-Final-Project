Craig Murray, former British ambassador to Uzbekistan, has gained notoriety as one of the few diplomats to ignore the wishes of his government and openly criticize the country in which he was stationed.
Two cases of torture that were brought to his attention propelled Murray to speak out.
In a report titled "Nowhere to turn: torture and ill-treatment in Uzbekistan", published last month, Human Rights Watch concluded that torture is "endemic to the criminal justice system" in Uzbekistan.
Murray was recalled to London for a reprimand.
Murray did not aid his cause by beginning an affair behind his wife's back with a 23-year-old English teacher turned lap dancer, Nadira Alieva.
Mr. Murray was withdrawn from post because it was considered that he was no longer able to perform effectively the full range of duties required in conduct of our relations with Uzbekistan.
But Murray argues that this does not apply in a country such as Uzbekistan where most of the NGOs have been expelled and local journalists risk imprisonment, torture and death if they speak out.
Craig Murray may now speak out from the cold but it is apparent that he believes that his stance has achieved significantly more than he would have in twenty years of quiet diplomacy.
