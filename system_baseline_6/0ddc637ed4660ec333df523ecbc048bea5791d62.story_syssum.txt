Chievo took the lead shortly before the Eto'o incident, when Sergio Pellissier headed home after 29 minutes.
The result means his team is now in sixth place, nine points adrift of leaders and city rivals AC Milan.
In the battle at the bottom of the table Brescia lost 2-1 to Cagliari at home.
Andrea Caracciolo gave Brescia the lead after 20 minutes when he converted a penalty, but two second half goals within three minutes of each other from striker Alessandro Matri and midfielder Daniele Conti.
