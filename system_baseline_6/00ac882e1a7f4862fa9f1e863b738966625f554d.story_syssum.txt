Below are some of the more interesting questions and my answers to them.
Moss: One of the interesting things about the relationship between Jesus and John the Baptist is that John doesn't lay down his tools and follow Jesus after he baptizes him.
There are some hints in the New Testament that Jesus and his followers had to differentiate themselves from John by stating that Jesus' baptism was better (Acts 11:6) and countering the idea that Jesus was actually John raised from the dead (Matthew 14:2) Some scholars argue that these references are evidence of tension between followers of Jesus and followers of John.
Moss: (These questions are on a similar topic, so I've chosen to answer them together.)
This gives us another -- arguably more historical -- perspective on why John was executed and provides further evidence about just how important John was in his own day.
In the Gospel of Luke, one of Jesus' disciples says, "Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples."
But if you were just reading Luke you could come to that conclusion.
