Some of them are great individual goals, some of them are great team goals, but all of them are outstanding examples of the ball being put into the net.
The best team goal of all time.
A miracle of technique, this goal had Zidane written all over it.
Arnold Muhren pumped over a ball from wide on the left and everyone was expecting Van Basten, in space on the far right of the box, to either pull the ball down or head it back into the area.
David Beckham found the 18-year-old in space 35 yards from goal and the fearless striker brought the ball under control as he raced towards goal.
A rival to Carlos Alberto's goal against Italy, the ball was shifted effortlessly between dark blue shirts 24 times, in and out of Serbian players, before Cambiasso played a one-two with Hernan Crespo in the box and thumped home.
Goals that see players run the length of the pitch with the ball are always crowd favorites.
It looked liked he'd lost the ball in the center circle but twisted his way out, flicked the ball round the final defender and ran on to slot home.
