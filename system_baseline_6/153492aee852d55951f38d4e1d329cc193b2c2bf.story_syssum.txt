In the short term, Vice President Nicolas Maduro will take over as president of Venezuela until an election is held.
Maduro has been Venezuela's vice president and foreign minister and has been the recent author of some the country's most radical policies, said Javier Corrales, a professor of political science at Amherst College in Massachusetts.
Though Chavez has held a tight grip on his presidency for 14 years, there is an opposition movement in Venezuela.
The United States will stay out of the upcoming election, an Obama administration official said.
The U.S. may seek Venezuela's help in imposing sanctions on Iran for its nuclear program, senior American officials said.
Chavez will be buried after the ceremony but officials have not said where.
Chavez allies, such as leaders of Ecuador, China, Iran and Cuba, expressed sorrow and solidarity.
Carlos Quijada said he fled Venezuela 10 years ago as a teen because there was no future there.
