(CNN) -- For many families, the school year just started, but for Karen Suffern, it's not too early to start planning for Christmas.
Suffern felt tears fill her eyes as she read her son's letter asking Santa to help stop the bullying his overweight sister was experiencing at school.
Ryan would come up to Suffern to tell her in private about classmates bullying Amber -- how the kids in gym class would laugh at her when she could not do the bear crawl on the floor, tease her about her weight in class or tell her that she was adopted because she is multiracial.
"Every day when she goes to school, she says, 'Mommy, can I just stay at home?'
Study authors Gianluca Gini and Tiziana Pozzoli write, "Given that school bullying is a widespread phenomenon in many countries around the world, the present results indicate that bullying should be considered a significant international public health problem."

And Suffern says she is glad to have a selfless son like Ryan -- plus Santa -- watching out for Amber, too.
