(CNN) -- Gonzalo Higuain scored the first hat-trick of the 2010 World Cup as Diego Maradona's Argentina took a big step towards qualifying for the second round by crushing South Korea 4-1 in Johannesburg on Thursday.
South Korea pulled a goal back on the stroke of halftime as Lee Chung-Yong pounced on an error by Argentina defender Martin Demichelis, but Yeom Ki-Hun squandered a golden chance to level in the 58th minute.
Victory for Greece was their first in the World Cup finals but owed much to a moment of madness by Nigeria's Sani Kaita.
Even Nigeria are not entirely out of it, but would require a big win over South Korea to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stage.
