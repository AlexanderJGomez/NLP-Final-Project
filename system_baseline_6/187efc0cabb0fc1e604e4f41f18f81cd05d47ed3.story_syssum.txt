No.
Yes, because the jury is most definitely out on that one.
"The point is, you have to get him home as a way to keep faith with our troops," says a former senior national security official.
In a way, it's all surreal and hard to unspool.
"This (The Bergdahl swap) is tying up loose ends," says another former senior national security source.
They're tweeting their joy about Bergdahl's release one minute, then un-tweeting it the next.
That's why the White House needs to make it clear why the swap was a matter so urgent that there wasn't enough time to notify the appropriate people, much less consult with them.
Because right now, it looks like the lack of consultation is about one thing: the knowledge that there would be pushback.
Guess it's too late for that now.
And as my national security source adds, "people opposed the deal because it wasn't great."
Bergdahl gets to go home.
