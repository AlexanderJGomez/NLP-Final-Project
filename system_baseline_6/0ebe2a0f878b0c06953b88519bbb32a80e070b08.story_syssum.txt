Johnson has fashioned himself the "clear alternative" to Republican candidate Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama in November's presidential election.
Johnson first ran for governor of New Mexico -- a state with a majority of Democratic voters -- in 1994 as a Republican.
And Johnson, who first announced his candidacy as a Republican, only switched to Libertarian when his campaign failed to gain much traction during the primaries.
Johnson says he is more liberal than Obama on social issues and more conservative than Romney on fiscal issues.
"No other third party is going to come close to this 50 ballot access," Johnson says proudly.
"The only way I am (going to be) president of the United States is if I am in the national debate between Obama and Romney," Johnson said.
It is unusual that the Libertarian candidate for president is being forced to court other libertarians, but that's exactly what Johnson has to do with the unflinchingly loyal base of libertarians who support former Republican hopeful Ron Paul.
According to Johnson, the Paul supporters are "absolutely pivotal" to his success.
Or to me?"
"Gary is very much in line with Dr. Paul on many issues," said Jordan Page, a performer who traveled with the Paul campaign.
Johnson endorsed Paul in 2008, when the Texas congressman was running for president, and when Johnson dropped out of the race as a Republican in 2012, he urged his supporters to vote for Paul in the Republican primaries.
"I am the Libertarian nominee for president," Johnson said.
