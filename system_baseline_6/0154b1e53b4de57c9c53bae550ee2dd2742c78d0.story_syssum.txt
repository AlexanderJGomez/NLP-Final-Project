One of France's most renowned philosophers, Voltaire published his "Treatise on Tolerance" in 1763.
The French publisher Folio says sales of the "Treatise" have increased significantly since the Charlie Hebdo attacks.
"What?
Voltaire wrote the "Treatise" because he was outraged by the execution of a Protestant man, Jean Calas, who was wrongly convicted of murdering his own son to prevent him from converting to Catholicism.
"We can draw anything, including a prophet, because in France, the France of Voltaire and irreverence, we have the right to make fun of religions," she said.
Some of the marchers waved copies of "A Treatise on Tolerance" as they walked and left them at impromptu memorials in the Place de la Republique.
Voltaire never actually said that.
Two-hundred-fifty years later, the words have new resonance.
