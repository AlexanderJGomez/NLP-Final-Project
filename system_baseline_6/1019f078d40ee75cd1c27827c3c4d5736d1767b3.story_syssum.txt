Adel Imam, one of Egypt's most beloved comedic actors, was sentenced to jail for insulting Islam.
What makes this court ruling even more preposterous is that these films are not recent films.
As a child, I remember watching Adel Iman films when I visited my family in Egypt during summer break.
During my first show in Cairo, maybe four or five years ago, I remember one local comedian was so nervous because he thought he "might be arrested" by the government just for telling jokes.
That a country, which was the "beacon of hope" less than one year ago, is now a catalyst for a "return to the dark ages."
This doesn't just prevent comedians, writers and artists from finding humor in the single biggest aspect of every Egyptian's life but it also will suppress creativity in general.
Regardless of the outcome in the Adel Imam trial, if Egyptians don't raise their voices against this ridiculous verdict, this may not just signal the demise of comedy in Egypt -- this could very well be the demise of the country itself.
