Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- A local court has set free a teenage boy after finding him guilty of stealing a policeman's sandals in a case that caused furor among Indonesians frustrated with perceived injustices against the poor and defenseless.
To be on the safe side, the boy was returned to his parents.
"We came up with the idea of a thousand sandals which we see as being the symbol of resistance also as compensation for the sandals that was allegedly stolen," Kurniawan said.
The Child Protection Commission, however, said the parents had filed a complaint with the Palu police after the alleged victim, 1st Brig.
The parents, according to the commission, wanted a case filed against those policemen.
According to the Commission, in 2011 alone, 6,273 minors were reported to be serving time in jail, some of them in adult prisons.
We don't want minors in jail," Ihsan explained.
