"I'm just happy to be alive," said passenger Jarrod West, who slid down holding his black Chihuahua.
Actor Jackson Rathbone was on the flight with his wife and child.
It grew so thick that passengers could no longer see the people seated next to them, said passenger Jonathon Hubbard.
"Everyone was crying," passenger Dean Delbaugh said.
He did good," West said.
JetBlue spokeswoman Jessica Felipe said everyone evacuated the plane by using emergency slides.
Passengers were led to a room, where they were debriefed, Rathbone said.
Rathbone and his family went home to celebrate their living through Thursday's scare with a wine and champagne tasting, he said on whosay -- they opened a half-dozen bottles.
