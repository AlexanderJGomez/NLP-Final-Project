The appeal doesn't necessarily mean either the verdict or the sentence against Pistorius will be thrown out, said CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps.
Prosecutors are arguing that Judge Thokozile Masipa misinterpreted a complex South African standard defining a technical form of intent that proved to be a central aspect of the case, Phelps said.
In their appeal of the sentence, prosecutors would have to prove the five years given by Masipa is "shockingly inappropriate" in light of sentencing guidelines and similar cases, according to Phelps.
