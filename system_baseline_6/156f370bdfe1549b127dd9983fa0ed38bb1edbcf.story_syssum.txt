In the opening scenes of "Safe House," you can tell what a good time Denzel Washington is having as Tobin Frost, an American spy in Cape Town, South Africa, who is five steps ahead of everyone else.
As a crew of Langley officials (Vera Farmiga, Brendan Gleeson, Sam Shepard) purse their lips with importance, Frost is placed in a CIA safe house overseen by Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds), who's been twiddling his thumbs there for a year.
Some of this stuff is well-done, and some of it has been done a lot better.
Which is why the trickiness of Washington's performance begins to ebb, replaced by something somber that might even look tragic if this movie were actually about anything.
