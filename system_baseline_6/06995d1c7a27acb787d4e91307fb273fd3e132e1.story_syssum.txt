Plate had already had the conversation about the drug with his daughter.
Add in the statistics about the drug's popularity -- one in every nine U.S. high school seniors has admitted to smoking fake weed, according to a 2011 study -- and parents were alarmed.
While parents like Plate sympathized with the Bauers, others said it would never happen to their kid.
Emily's stepfather, Tommy Bryant, welcomed the conversation because he wants to raise awareness of the drug, even if some of the comments weren't so kind.
While Bryant knows there will be critics and people out there questioning his parenting, he said he's just thankful to have more time with his daughter.
Why or why not?
