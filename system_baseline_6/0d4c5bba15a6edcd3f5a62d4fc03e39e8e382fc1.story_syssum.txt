Los Angeles (CNN)Conrad Hilton, the younger brother of celebrity heiress Paris Hilton, has reached a plea deal: He would admit guilt to misdemeanor assault against flight attendants in exchange for a federal felony charge being dropped, court papers says.
Hilton also "punched at, but missed" another flight attendant, the court documents said.
Hilton's father is Rick Hilton, the grandson of the Hilton Hotel empire's founder, Conrad Nicholson Hilton.
Another flight attendant said Hilton rose from his seat at least 20 times during the 10Â½-hour flight, court documents said.
Hilton also accused the flight attendants of "taking the peasants' side" and then said he was angry because he had just broken up with a girlfriend, court papers said.
The captain authorized crew members to form a "restraint team" to constrain Hilton before he woke up, authorities said in court papers.
Hilton admitted to calling people "peasants" on the flight, but he "denied having a confrontation with a flight attendant near the start of the flight but acknowledged having other issues with flight attendants," the affidavit said.
