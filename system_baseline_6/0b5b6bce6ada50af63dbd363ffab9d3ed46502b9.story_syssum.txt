My mom was a very good cook.
On holidays, we would go to work with her.
I just started playing around.
We went to Mass once a week, while in school, as well as on Sundays.
It was something I was going to do out of high school, and I put it off.
I didn't wake up one morning and just sit up in bed and stretch and say, "Well, I think I'll try the priesthood."
I have a spiritual director I work with, and I started out with that at first.
I will miss the people.
I would love to do something for the needy or poor, during the holidays when people really feel their lowest.
I want to give all of myself, and I don't think you can do that when you have a lot of baggage.
The prayer life, the rules that a priest is supposed to live by, that really excites me.
