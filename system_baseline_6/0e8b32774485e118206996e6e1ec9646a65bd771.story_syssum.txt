The team got him," Robert O'Neill said in an audio interview with freelance journalist Alex Quade, a former CNN correspondent, that aired Friday on CNN's "AC360."
The killing of bin Laden will go down in history, O'Neill said.
O'Neill, who had been serving as a SEAL for 15 years at the time of the bin Laden raid, had participated in other missions, but he said he feared this mission would be his most difficult.
And that's closure," he said in the audio interview.
In the audio interview, O'Neill says he believes some details about the bin Laden mission, such as how he was killed, were no longer classified because they had been repeatedly leaked in the aftermath by high-level officials.
The Shooter said the al Qaeda leader was standing up and had a gun "within reach," and it was only then that the Shooter fired two shots into bin Laden's forehead, killing him.
Another member of the secretive SEAL Team 6, which executed the bin Laden raid, told CNN's Peter Bergen the story of The Shooter as presented in Esquire is false.
And unfortunately for me, there was two people in the room, and one of us is dead and that's Osama bin Laden."
