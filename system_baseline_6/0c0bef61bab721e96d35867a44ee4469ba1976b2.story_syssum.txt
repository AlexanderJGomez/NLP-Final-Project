For most people, it doesn't get much worse than that -- and yet one out of every 20 children with measles also contract pneumonia, and one or two out of every 1,000 children with the disease die from it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
On Monday, a Southern California day care shut down because an infant there -- who is too young to be vaccinated -- contracted measles.
