Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actor Charlie Sheen on Friday declared "we are at war" following canceled production of the hit CBS sitcom "Two and a Half Men" and his impending loss of $1.2 million per episode.
"I was told if I went on the attack, they would cancel the show and all that, so I'm just sort of seeing if they're telling the truth or not," Sheen told Jones.
A Warner Brothers spokesman said that at least 250 members of the cast and crew will be out of work during the canceled production.
Sheen said the employees should be focused, patient and to understand "there are ways to deal with these clowns and take all their money."
I cured it with my brain, with my mind," Sheen told the show.
"
That's what we do for him."
"I healed really quickly, but I also unravel really quickly, so get me right now guys," Sheen said.
Sheen was "very, very intoxicated, also apparently in a lot of pain" on the morning of January 27, according to a 911 call from a doctor who had just talked to the actor.
