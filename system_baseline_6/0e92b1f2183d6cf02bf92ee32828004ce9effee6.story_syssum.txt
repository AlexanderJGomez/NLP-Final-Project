(CNN) -- Residents of a North Dakota town got the all-clear to return home after a fiery crash this week involving a derailed train and a second one carrying crude oil.
"We are not optimistic that we will be able to retrieve data from those two recorders," Sumwalt said.
On the ground, they will search for signs of the cause of the derailment, including marks on wooden cross ties and on rails, Sumwalt said.
