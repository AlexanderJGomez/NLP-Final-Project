But when the Senate Armed Services Committee meets on Thursday to discuss the nomination, McCain will be one of Hagel's biggest skeptics.
When Hagel was elected to the Senate, the two men shared a bond over their service in Vietnam.
"His life has been committed to something larger than he is," Hagel said after McCain suspended his campaign effort to make way for an ascendent George W. Bush.
A source close to McCain said the friends just drifted apart as friends sometimes do, not because of policy differences.
But citing their long friendship, McCain said he would not oppose Hagel before the hearing.
