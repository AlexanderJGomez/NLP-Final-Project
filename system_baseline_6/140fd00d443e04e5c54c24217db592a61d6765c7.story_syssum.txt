Dante de Blasio, the son of New York City mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, is a typical nerdy, smart, shy 16-year-old Brooklyn boy.
Dante and his gravity-defying, nonconformist hairstyle helped signal to New Yorkers that his father, Bill de Blasio, understands equality, empathizes with the victims of systemic bigotry and is more than qualified to lead the most diverse metropolis in America.
To some black voters, Dante's afro reflected that this boy and by association his father, respected the civil rights struggle, since the afro is considered an icon for black pride and progress.
Parker's parents pulled her out of the charter school and placed her in a new school where hopefully she can lead a hair hassle-free childhood.
Let's hope that one day, hairstyles from the black community will no longer trigger powerful emotions or suspicions.
