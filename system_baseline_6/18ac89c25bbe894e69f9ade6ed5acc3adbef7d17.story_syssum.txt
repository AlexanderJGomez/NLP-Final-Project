A Blomkamp reboot of "Alien" seems promising (although we haven't seen "Chappie" yet).
But why would you?
Chatter about a Blomkamp "Alien" movie began almost two months ago when the South African filmmaker started posting "Alien"-themed concept art to Instagram -- including images of Weaver as her Ripley character.
Thankfully, Blomkamp seems to have done just that with his early concept art.
Ridley Scott's 2012 film "Prometheus" was a prequel of sorts to the first "Alien."
Just kidding.
