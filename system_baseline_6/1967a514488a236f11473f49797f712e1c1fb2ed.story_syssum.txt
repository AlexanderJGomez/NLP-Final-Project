In the Richmond case, the victim escaped from captivity in 2012 with help from a relative, who brought her to police, Richmond Police Chief Chris Magnus said in a letter to the city council, confirming a local newspaper account this week of the crime.
But authorities didn't publicize the incident until this week, after the newspaper account was published, the chief told the city council.
Ochoa's wife and children, who resided in the house, also lived in fear of Ochoa, authorities told KGO.
Police arrested Ochoa after having the victim place a phone call to him, Hill said.
One neighbor told KGO that she always sensed something was not right at the Ochoa house.
"Although I can't get into all the details, it would have been SO easy for them to have interacted with this victim and never figured out what was really going on," the chief wrote.
Ochoa, who pleaded guilty to one count of forced lewd acts on a child and two counts of forcible rape, is now being held on $30 million bond, according to a detention facility in Contra Costa County.
