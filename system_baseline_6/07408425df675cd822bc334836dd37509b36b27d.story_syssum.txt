In a trifecta of potentially bad news for fire crews, the Texas Forest Service said a low-pressure system will push temperatures into the 90s, humidity to 10% or less and winds up to 45 mph on Monday and Tuesday.
One such fire scorched nearly every inch of a 10,000-acre north Texas ranch, about 70 miles west of Fort Worth.
Covering some 7,101 acres, it was caused by an oil well flare.
Wet weather over the past few days helped firefighters maintain control over many of the fires burning in the state, the Texas Forest Service said.
On Sunday, crews were able to focus on patrol and mop-up operations, according to the Texas Forest Service.
Two firefighters have died since the latest outbreaks began, with numerous others injured, state officials said.
