Caught in the middle are the approximately 7,000 students attending schools in the district.
Jones, who says he was "lucky" because he went to a private school, lived next to an East St. Louis middle school.
According to the most recent U.S. Census statistics, more than 25% of youth in East St. Louis did not graduate high school.
East St. Louis High School student Danasia McDonald says some of her teachers will show movies during class time.
Mitchell says many of her students will attend middle and high school in East St. Louis.
I don't care how good the teachers are or how much money you have inside of the school district.
CNN iReporter and East St. Louis native, Louis Jones, says the federal government has to do more to improve public education, especially in blighted areas.
Jones also says he would like to see inner city students given more of a voice in their education.
