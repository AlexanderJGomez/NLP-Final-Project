It was touch and go whether one of the Saudi women, Shaherkani, would even participate this year when the president of the International Federation of Judo said women wearing headscarves would not be allowed to compete for fear of choking and injury.
Saudi women in general are denied the right to practice sports.
More Muslim women are competing in sports today than ever.
In sports and in daily life, women have few rights in Saudi Arabia.
The signs of change for Saudi women are yet to come.
