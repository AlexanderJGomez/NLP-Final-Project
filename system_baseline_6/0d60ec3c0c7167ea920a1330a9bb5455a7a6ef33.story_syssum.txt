On Tuesday night, Instagram was on fire thanks to two posts made by Kim and Khloe Kardashian.
The result is one cover in which Kim poses in a floor-length gown, balancing a glass of champagne on her rear, while the other cover puts the reality star's best known asset front and center in all its glistening glory.
Khloe hasn't explicitly commented on the reaction, but some believe one of her recent Instagram posts is an attempt at an apology.
"We're all equally f****d up," says the photo in the post, which was shared Tuesday.
