Manning will be eligible for parole in 10 years, Coombs said.
"Mr. Manning's treatment has been intended to send a signal to people of conscience in the U.S. government who might seek to bring wrongdoing to light," Assange, now holed up in the Ecuador's embassy in London, said in a written statement.
"Bradley Manning betrayed his country, his obligations as a soldier and the trust of all Americans.
