The District of Columbia Court of Appeals "ruled resoundingly in favor of the Chung family and denied Mr. Roy Pearson's appeal of the case completely," said Christopher Manning, an attorney for the Chung family, who own Custom Cleaners.
The saga began in May 2005, when Pearson took several pairs of pants to Custom Cleaners for alteration as he prepared to start his new job as an administrative law judge.
Pearson may request that the appeal be heard again by the entire panel of D.C. Court of Appeals judges, Manning said.
"The 3Â½ years this case has been pending and appealed have been very difficult for the Chungs," he said.
