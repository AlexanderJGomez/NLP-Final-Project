(CNN) -- Mark Webber claimed his first victory of 2011 as he relegated his Red Bull teammate Sebastian Vettel to second place in the season-ending race in Brazil.
It would have been nice to have a race with Seb all the way through but he had a problem," he told the post-race media conference.
Kamui Kobayashi of Sauber and Vitaly Petrov for Renault rounded out the point-scoring.
