Yemen has become a major new battleground for al Qaeda, but Yaqoub denied it could become a "failed state" with no effective central government, like Somalia.
"I don't think Yemen is a collapsing state.
A U.S. official said Monday the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency continues to expand its intelligence operations in Yemen with more operatives and analysts working closely with the Yemen government and other U.S. partners inside the country.
Regarding the threat of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula compared to al Qaeda Pakistan, the official said "this is not a zero sum game."
Another U.S. official also said it "wouldn't be a surprise if he ends up implicated in this."
This official said experts are examining the devices to determine how they would have worked and whether they had the capability to work as intended.
