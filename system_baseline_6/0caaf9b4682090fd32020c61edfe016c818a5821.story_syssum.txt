"It is very disappointing that we have lost our first home match," Van Gaal told BT Sport in his post game interview.
The feelgood factor had seemed to have returned to United since Van Gaal's appointment earlier in the summer.
United began with a 3-5-2 system similar to that employed by Van Gaal's Dutch side at the World Cup earlier this summer before switching to a 4-4-1-1 as the game progressed.
Like many a visitor to Old Trafford, Swansea sat in deep and attempted to play on the break.
With more solid, mature performances like this over the coming season such predictions will be made to look badly placed.
