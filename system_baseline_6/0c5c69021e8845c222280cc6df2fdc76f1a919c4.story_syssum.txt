It's a laborious process, but it's necessary to ensure the best questions make the cut for the CNN/YouTube debate between Republican presidential hopefuls in St. Petersburg, Florida, which will take place Wednesday at 8 p.m.
"You watch hundreds of these questions and you really get a sense of what's on people's minds."
While the GOP debate will also face a YouTube audience, don't expect to hear the same questions.
Each of the eight GOP hopefuls will answer to real people displayed on a 25-foot screen (or their animated creations, as witnessed in the Democratic debate).
And some of those submitters will be in the room -- creators of some of the most compelling questions will be flown to St. Petersburg to watch the debate in person and offer reactions afterward.
"I'm not going to give you any hints about what sorts of questions we're going to pick or we're not going to pick," Feist said.
"There are plenty of animated figures out there, there are certainly some funny questions, but more importantly, there are hundreds, if not thousands of really, really good, solid questions from real people on real issues."
