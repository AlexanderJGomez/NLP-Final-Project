El-Sisi is not the first Egyptian leader to fear Islamist militancy.
These two imperatives -- a sense of Egypt's historic role and the traditional animosity of the Egyptian military toward Islamist radicalism -- have propelled Egypt to take a central role in the on-off cease-fire talks to end the latest Gaza conflict.
The Egyptian government is not directly negotiating with Hamas, but with a Palestinian delegation of which Hamas and Islamic Jihad are a small part.
El-Sisi wants to see Gaza demilitarized as much as Israel does, not just because of Hamas but because of other actors there such as Islamic Jihad.
El-Sisi blames the Muslim Brotherhood for opening Egypt to an influx of jihadists.
One talk-show host, Mazhar Shahin, declared the Egyptian people were "not ready to sacrifice even a single hair from the eyebrow" in defense of Hamas.
But ultimately Hamas knows -- as do the other Palestinian factions -- that Egypt's is the only game in town.
Israel wants el-Sisi to succeed.
