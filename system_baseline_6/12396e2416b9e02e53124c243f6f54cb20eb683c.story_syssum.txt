The group, al-Nusra Front, also denies an earlier claim that it has merged with Iraq's al Qaeda affiliate, according to an audio message purported to be from al-Nusra general commander Abu Muhammad al-Joulani.
Al-Joulani, acknowledging that al-Nusra Front fought with jihadists in Iraq before turning its attention to the Syrian civil war, said he would delay consideration of a merger with al Qaeda in Iraq in part so his group can consult with various supporting groups.
Kerry urged the opposition to work together and organize more effectively, the officials said.
Opposition officials said they were in the process of doing that.
The United Nations says more than 70,000 people have been killed in Syria's two-year civil war.
