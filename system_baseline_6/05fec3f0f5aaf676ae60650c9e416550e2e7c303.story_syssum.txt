In a 55-minute video released less than two weeks ago, the current leader of al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, promised to "raise the flag of Jihad" and to spread Islamic rule across the South Asia by operating in India, Bangladesh and Myanmar, under the new rubric "Qaeda al-Jihad."
This would be an obvious and natural thing for al Qaeda to do since ISIS clearly has far more success both globally, in terms of publicity, and locally, in that they have eclipsed the local al Qaeda affiliate, Jabhat al Nusra.
ISIS has also managed to do things al Qaeda never could.
With the Pakistani market being saturated and ISIS increasingly dominating the Middle East, one can understand why al Qaeda has decided to push into this largely untapped market, especially since so few jihadist recruits, in relative terms, have been from these two countries historically.
It is clear is that al Qaeda is panicking and witnessing the rise of ISIS with dread and jealousy.
