Slack is the executive director of the Harry Potter Alliance, a nonprofit organization dedicated to engaging Potter fans in social activism.
In the "Potter" books, "implications toward public policy are profound," Slack said.
Slack sees parallels between the magic in the "Potter" books and expanding one's mind to come up with solutions in a creative way.
Slack said they raised over 13,000 books, 4,000 of which went to youths in Rwanda who were very young at the time of the Rwandan genocide.
Rowling herself has praised the Harry Potter Alliance, one of Slack's proudest moments.
Rowling has also written personally to Slack about his efforts.
Members of the Harry Potter Alliance, 4,500 of whom make up the most hardcore group, are inspired by what it has done.
Like Slack, Bolton condemns the "Muggle mindset," what members call an ignorance of or refusal to act on the important issues facing the world.
Noth Lang and Bolton say they are more knowledgeable about world affairs because of the organization's connection to Harry Potter than they would be otherwise.
"There are issues I didn't know much about or hadn't thought about too deeply that I'm now involved in, like Darfur," Bolton said.
