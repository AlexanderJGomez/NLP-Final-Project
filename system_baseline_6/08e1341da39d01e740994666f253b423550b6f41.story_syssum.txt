The idea of in-flight gambling may seem like a new one, principally because no airline is currently doing it.
Singapore Airlines took gambling up in the air in 1981, when they installed lightweight slot machines in the aisles on a flight that operated between Singapore and San Francisco.
However, the idea of in-flight gambling re-emerged a few years ago.
Ryanair announced in 2004 that it would introduce gambling through an in-flight entertainment system, though this too has yet to come to fruition.
Houssard and Alfano also don't see online gambling as competition to their own concept.
It's difficult to imagine that airlines would be willing to give over potential passenger space (and the fares that come with it) to a social arena, but Alfano says if designed properly, there shouldn't be a conflict.
The biggest obstacle to in-flight gambling, however, is a legal one.
A lot of things are changing."
