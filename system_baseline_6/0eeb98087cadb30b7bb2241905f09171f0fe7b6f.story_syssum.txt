Martin O'Malley is laying the groundwork for a presidential campaign with the intent of being ready should Hillary Clinton not run, a source close to the governor told CNN.
And that may be with good reason, as an O'Malley vs. Clinton race would likely be an uphill slog for the governor.
Looking more closely, here how it breaks down for O'Malley and what's likely influencing his thinking around Hillary Clinton and a presidential run.
In a November 2013 CNN/ ORC International Poll, 2% of Democrats said they would like to see O'Malley nominated for President in 2016.
For example, Ready for Hillary -- a super PAC urging Clinton to run -- raised more than $4 million in 2013.
Politics: If O'Malley were to run, he'd be running from the left of the Democratic Party.
And while Clinton would support most -- if not all -- of the proposals O'Malley has pursued, new polling shows the space for a liberal alternative to Clinton isn't that big.
The point of all this: Should Clinton run in 2016, O'Malley would likely be a supporter.
