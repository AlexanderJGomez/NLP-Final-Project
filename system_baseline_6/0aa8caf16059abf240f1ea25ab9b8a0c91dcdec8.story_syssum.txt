The 32-year-old from Pasadena, California, recently filed a petition on Change.org asking Disney to make an animated character out of a pangolin, a little-known, scale-covered mammal that's notoriously shy and, to Kit's point, can protect itself from pretty much anything in the wild -- lions, tigers -- by rolling up into a ball.
I hadn't heard of pangolins before readers voted for me to cover the illegal animal trade as part of that project; and Kit hadn't heard of them until she read the story last week.
Disney and Disney Pixar have the reach to make the pangolin popular.
CNN readers are voting on a name for pangolin P26, which was rescued from the wildlife trade and was recently released back into the wild in Vietnam.
"When you introduce a character in a Disney film the animal suddenly gets more recognition and people start talking about it," said Kit, who is a Disney fan.
But not for Kit, who is Chinese-American and who told me her father likely has consumed endangered wildlife products while doing business in China, possibly including pangolin.
She doesn't think she'll be able to persuade her dad to change, but younger generations may be the ones to save animals like pangolins and rhinos, she said.
"Maybe I didn't have enough friends and the animals were always super friendly all the time," she said.
"I can tell you many Chinese citizens do not support this cruelty, and I believe we can bring wildlife advocates from around the world together to ask Disney to take this simple, fun, positive step to help pangolins."
