If we could see off camera, we might see Bieber's attorney subtly shaking his head in frustration.
What is a deposition?
But a deposition is not a trial.
Watch, for example, when he answers: "Guess what?
You can't answer if you don't know the question:  Bieber can be seen interrupting questions to answer.
Depositions are not soapboxes:  At a deposition, you will never "show up" the other side's lawyers.
Objection to the objection: Bieber can be heard warning the lawyer not to ask about sensitive subjects, like his possible relationship with other celebrities.
At a deposition, the lawyer asks the questions, not the witness.
Bieber may not like the questions, but he takes his chances with the judge if he refuses to answer.
We all know it's nearly impossible to tell the same story twice, but a good cross-examiner will make minor inconsistencies from an earlier deposition look like a flawed memory, or worse, paint the witness as a liar.
He can object "for the record," which means the judge can later decide if the answer is ultimately admissible at trial.
Bieber appears on the video to really think about the meaning of the questions and his answers.
If he could carve out his other behavior, in some respects, he's not half-bad as a deponent.
