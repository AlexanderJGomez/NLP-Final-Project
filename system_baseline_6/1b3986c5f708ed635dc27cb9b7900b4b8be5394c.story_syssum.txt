It can be exhausting nursing a child through a nasty bout with the flu, so imagine how 22-year-old Fatu Kekula felt nursing her entire family through Ebola.
Instead Fatu, who's in her final year of nursing school, invented her own equipment.
UNICEF Spokeswoman Sarah Crowe said Fatu is amazing.
Her Ebola nightmare started Juy 27, when her father, Moses, had a spike in blood pressure.
Fatu took her father to Monrovia, the capital city, about a 90-minute drive via difficult roads.
They said he had typhoid fever and did little for him, so Fatu took him home, where he infected three other family members: Fatu's mother, Victoria, 57; Fatu's sister, Vivian, 28, and their 14-year-old cousin who was living with them, Alfred Winnie.

Now he's working to find a scholarship for Fatu so she can finish her final year of nursing school.
