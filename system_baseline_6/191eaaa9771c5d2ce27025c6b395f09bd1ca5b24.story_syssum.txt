Since revealing her plans on a website and in a column this week for CNN, the Oregon woman has become the new poster child for the "death with dignity" movement, which advocates that terminally ill patients be allowed to receive medication that will let them die on their own terms.
Since Oregon passed its Death with Dignity Act in 1997, fewer than 1% of its 752 doctor-assisted deaths have been people Maynard's age.
She moved from California to Oregon to take advantage of that state's law and says she plans to end her life soon after her husband's October 26 birthday.
"Because (Maynard) is young and vibrant and articulate, she has generated a lot of attention," said George Eighmey, a board member of the Death with Dignity National Center, which advocates for physician-assisted death for terminal patients.
But polls have shown that most Americans support having a say in how they die, especially if the process is described not as doctors helping a patient "commit suicide" but as ending a patient's life "by some painless means."
When surveyed about why they wished to end their life, Oregon's terminally ill patients said they most feared losing their autonomy as their illnesses worsened.
