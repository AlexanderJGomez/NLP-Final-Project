Monrovia, Liberia (CNN) -- Two children orphaned by Ebola play in the empty corner of a Liberian orphanage.
As Ebola killed parents, the fear of contact with orphaned children spread, even after they persistently showed no symptoms.
Extended family usually takes orphans in, but fear has broken the chain, said Manuel Fontaine, UNICEF's regional director.
Ebola survivors are considered immune to the disease.
"They sit in my living room with my family," he said.
As Ebola has thinned out his flock, the pastor has given them spiritual comfort to fight their fear.
