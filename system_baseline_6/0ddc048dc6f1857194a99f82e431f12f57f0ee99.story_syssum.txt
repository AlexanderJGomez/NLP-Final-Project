US Aerospace said its bid arrived at Wright-Patterson half an hour before the deadline.
Because of the late arrival of the bid, the Defense Department will not consider US Aerospace's proposal, according to Pentagon chief spokesman Geoff Morrell.
A spokesman for US Aerospace, Chuck Arnold, said the Defence Department "still feel[s] the cold war is on" and doesn't want US Aerospace to succeed in the bid.
Chuck Arnold, a spokesman for US Aerospace, said the bid proposal was on time.
Morrell said he is confident that the dispute with US Aerospace will not slow the process again.
