New York (CNN) -- Staring down a smoking homemade bomb and dismantling it is dangerous enough.
I identified it as a bomb, and I had to look twice," Clair said.
"We think they're great," one man said.
It was.
Put on gloves, and it's hard to imagine that anyone in such bulky gear could maneuver and dismantle possible bomb components.
"The more you do, and the more you get involved, the better you'll get when it's the real thing," Clair said.
The bomb squad was called to check out a backpack found in a park near a police headquarters checkpoint.
John Ryan said it's necessary to assume the worst until the team moves in.
"At the end of the day, it's just one day down and a lot more to go," said Det.
