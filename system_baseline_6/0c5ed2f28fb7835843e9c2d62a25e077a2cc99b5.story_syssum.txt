TRIPOLI, Libya (CNN) -- Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met Friday with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who asked for the latest news on the hurricanes plaguing U.S. coasts in recent weeks.
After their meeting, Rice joined Gadhafi, who once called Rice "Leeza ... my darling black African woman," in a traditional Muslim evening meal breaking the fast during the holy month of Ramadan.
It also dropped Libya from its State Sponsors of Terrorism list, the only country except for Iraq to have been removed.
Since then, several U.S. officials have visited Tripoli and Rice has met several times with her Libyan counterpart.
Last month the United States and Libya reached a deal to resolve outstanding claims for the bombings, but Libya has yet to contribute hundreds of millions of dollars to a fund set up to compensate the bombing victims' families.
European companies have had much greater access to Libya's energy sector, but Libyan officials say the improved relations with the United States will result in more deals with American oil companies, including exploring vast areas of the country that remain untapped.
