Supporting Small Trades also means supporting factory owner Gary Pleam, whose great-great grandfather built a water wheel in 1873 to power the hat factory that became Mohnton Mills in 1906.
Today, Deysher is the sewing floor supervisor who "makes everything work," Pleam said.
Small Trades is just one brand that will be featured on Zady, a shopping site launching this week dedicated to fashion transparency.
"People care about where their clothes come from, and they want to know the story behind the label."
Co-founders Darabi and Maxine BÃ©dat say they are targeting people like themselves, style-conscious and socially aware shoppers who have outgrown their trendy wardrobe of cheaply made goods.
"We've seen through the whole farm-to-table movement that people care about where their food comes from," she said.
"Consumers want to feel like they're supporting something positive and authentic, not just rejecting something negative when they buy," she said.
Showing where clothes were made seemed like the natural next step, he said.
"I think the fact that sites like mine are able to thrive is proof that there's a demand for ethically made goods," he said.
When it launches this week, Zady will include information on where products are made, the raw material sources and a story about each brand's origin.
The last good year was 1998, Pleam said.
"It's just so tough," she said.
"It just gives us our drive and motivation to make Zady work."
