Somer Thompson, 7, went missing Monday on her way home from school.
You don't take from somebody.
The body of her daughter, 7-year-old Somer Thompson, was found in a south Georgia landfill, Clay County, Florida, Sheriff Rick Beseler said Thursday morning.
The sister said she brought up the fight while she and her brother walked Somer home from school, and that Somer ran off from them, apparently upset.
The sister said she lost sight of Somer in a group of other kids leaving the school, according to the police report.
Thompson, he said, was devastated.
"There is a child killer on the loose," the sheriff said.
