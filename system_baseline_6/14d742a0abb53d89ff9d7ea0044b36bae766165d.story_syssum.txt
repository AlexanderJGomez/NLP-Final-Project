(CNN) -- A Florida grand jury this week found that two deputies in Pensacola should not be criminally charged in the wounding of an unarmed man, who was shot at 15 times while he was in his own driveway.
Middleton's attorney, Lorenzo Williams, told CNN on Wednesday that his client was distraught over the grand jury decision.
"The tragedy of this is the noncompliance to the directions of law enforcement officers," Morgan said in August.
It provided a report to the Escambia County State Attorney, which took the case to the grand jury.
In the FDLE report, Middleton allegedly told investigators that he used crack cocaine and alcohol the day before, but only drank two beers earlier on the day of the shooting.
Middleton was among those testifying before the grand jury.
But Williams believes the grand jury's message to the sheriff bolsters his client's case.
"It sends a strong signal to the sheriff's department that they are negligent in the training of their officers in the use of deadly force."
