(CNN) -- Eleven people died as Hurricane Sandy pummeled Cuba on Thursday, state media reported.
We have never had a storm hit like this," said a woman named Dulce, a doctor in the city of Santiago.
He said they will be confined to the hotel, which gave them food and drink to take to their rooms, until 8 a.m. Friday, when officials expect most of the storm to have passed over.
It is a "small storm" with "mediocre wind," he said.
ET, the eye of the storm was 105 miles (170 kilometers) east of Nassau, sparing the Bahamas' largest city the worst part of the storm.
"It depends on where it hits."
On Friday, more high waves and rip currents are likely along the coastal beaches of Florida's east coast and into southern Georgia, as well as tropical storm force wind gusts up to 50 mph.
The five-day forecast from the National Hurricane Center predicts the center of the storm will shadow the East Coast in the coming days, with Sandy potentially making landfall as a tropical storm in New Jersey the day before Halloween.
There were some good Samaritans, too.
The government ordered evacuations of high-risk zones and canceled schools.
