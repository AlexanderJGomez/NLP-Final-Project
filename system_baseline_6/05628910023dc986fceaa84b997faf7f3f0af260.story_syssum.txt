For Father's Day, my wife gave me some boxer shorts and a tiny reading light, so I can flip through a book in bed without disturbing her.
Why?
This would be a weekend in which I couldn't do only the fun stuff -- like playing blocks and watching cartoons -- with the girls.
If this were 1897 or even 1974, I could have coasted through the weekend, serving potato chips and cold cereal to Isabelle, and I would have brought the girls to my wife's bed for her to do the changing of the diapers.

I grew more confident in my parenting skills and even gave both girls a bath -- at the same time -- not once, but two nights in a row!
Now, I'm not comparing our girls to Iraqi insurgents, but I do appreciate more than ever that mothers are usually the soldiers in the parenting battlefield.
Fathers tend to play the part of the dashing news reporter, swooping into parenting duties just long enough to get our hands dirty.
Just as much as the moms, we appreciate the cards, the praise, and being treated special on our day.
