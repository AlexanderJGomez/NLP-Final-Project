Yeager talked with Heidi Collins on Tuesday on "CNN Newsroom."
Collins: All right.
Yeager: You know, they are.
And again, I don't really talk about a life of sacrifice.
Collins: OK. Wow.
Yeager: If these things apply to your family.
Yeager: Give up the cellulite life.
I've got to push back for a second, because a lot of people will tell you you can be happier with a cell phone because you're out of the office and you're with your family more, still able to still do business.
Can you give up one?
You can cut that by 80 percent by cooking those same meals at home and you know, maybe recapture some family time around the dinner table.
Yeager: Yes.
Yeager: And again, less than 2 percent of the clothes we throw away are worn out.
Collins: All right.
Now, of course, most kids go away to school, take out student loans.
Let's skip the money step!
