Asked by CNN whether it will be a loss for the Pentagon to have a defense secretary without combat experience, Hagel said he will not judge.
They want us to help them assist, advise, train," Hagel said.
Still, while the U.S. draws down in Afghanistan the danger for forces remaining in the country does not.
Hagel said he has confidence in the Afghan security forces ability to protect Afghanistan from terror by the hands of al Qaeda and the Taliban.
