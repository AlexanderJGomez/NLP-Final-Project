One day after Ai Weiwei was released on bail, the dissident artist remained at home, unable to speak with anyone about why he was detained or what awaits him now.
Ai looked haggard and thinner.
But later Ai called for a boycott of the games because he said China was using them as propaganda.
Beijing police accused him of evading a "huge amount" of taxes, Xinhua reported in May, more than a month after he was detained.
Observers in Beijing said it may not be coincidental that Ai's release on Wednesday took place on the eve of Premier Wen Jiabao's upcoming visit to Hungary, Britain and Germany, where Ai enjoys wide support among artists and politicians.
International reporting on Ai, including on CNN, was blacked out.
Beijing police told state media that Ai had been released on bail because of his good attitude in confessing his alleged crimes and also said he was suffering from a chronic disease.
Ai has also said that he is willing to pay the taxes he allegedly evaded, police told Xinhua.
