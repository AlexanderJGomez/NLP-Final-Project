NATO-led forces in Afghanistan and the U.S. military have repeatedly denied targeting civilians.
I'm scared I won't be able to go home.
Last week, the U.S. military distributed pamphlets in eastern Afghanistan in an effort to locate him.
The U.S. military said it believed Bergdahl may have been moved to various locations.
They were made available to CNN by U.S.
Days after Bergdahl went missing, a senior U.S. military official said Bergdahl and the Afghan soldiers were captured by low-level militants and then quickly "sold" to the clan and network led by warlord Siraj Haqqani -- believed to be deeply involved in the action.
A source with the U.S. military denied the claim that Bergdahl was drunk.
