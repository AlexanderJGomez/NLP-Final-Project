Far from being subsumed by China's political system, Hong Kong would in fact lead it towards democracy.
Why?
Yet Hong Kong has hardly exploded in anger or frustration.
Occupy Central with Love and Peace, a protest group committed to true universal suffrage, had threatened a campaign of bringing business in downtown Hong Kong to a standstill if China didn't allow for a more democratic process.
Before 1997, the pragmatists were doing what they could to have a Plan B -- a way of getting out of Hong Kong if they needed to -- or working hard to ingratiate themselves with Beijing.
And neither Beijing nor Hong Kong's leadership can ill-afford to ignore them.
