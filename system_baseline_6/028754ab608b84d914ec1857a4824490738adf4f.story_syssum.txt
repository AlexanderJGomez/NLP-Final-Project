"This was the doctor's testimony," said Mana Ostad-Mohammad.
Surgery was not an option, but Ostad-Mohammad's oncologist prescribed the cancer drug Nexavar.
But beginning last year -- soon after Washington and Western powers imposed additional sanctions against Iran to rein in its nuclear program -- Iranian doctors, pharmacists and patients say finding Nexavar and several other drugs that treated deadly diseases became increasingly difficult.
But Iranian officials say with the Western ban on Iranian banks doing business with much of the outside world, even medical goods that are exempt from the sanctions are often impossible to import.
Medical tests then showed her father's feto-protein level -- an indicator of cancer -- skyrocketed over the four months he went without Nexavar.
On July 25, Ostad-Mohammad lost his fight with cancer.
