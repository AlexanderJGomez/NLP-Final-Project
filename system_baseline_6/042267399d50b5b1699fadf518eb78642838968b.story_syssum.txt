First, I have concerns that a strike in Syria will only further muddle the administration's disjointed foreign policy approach to the region.
Rather, a strike on Syria must consider the greater strategic implications of military action and should be about one thing: the best strategic interests of the United States.
Next, the administration has yet to clearly articulate the goals, objectives and potential costs of a military action in Syria.
We must be careful and quite clear with the types of actions we take as we use our military force in this fiscally strained environment, and at a time when we are drawing down the end-strength of our forces.
Such a situation would likely warrant a U.S. military strike.
In the end, if we are going to engage our military, there must be a clear threat to our national security interests at home and a clear strategy of what we are going to achieve.
