Underscoring the cultural differences between France and the United States, many French recoiled from images of Strauss-Kahn, who is charged in the alleged sexual assault of a New York hotel housekeeper, in handcuffs and in court -- photographs that would be prohibited under French law to protect the presumption of innocence.
"The forensic evidence, we believe, will not be consistent with a forcible account, and we believe there is a very, very defensible case, and he should be entitled to bail," Brafman said during the hearing Monday.
"Since yesterday we've been overwhelmed by the images and also by the charges against Dominique Strauss-Kahn," she said.

"If you are pro-Sarkozy, you are happy," French teacher Paul Verite said Tuesday.
Many French also said they feel Strauss-Kahn hasn't been given a chance to present his side of the story adequately, King said.
And we are waiting for that other voice, the one of Dominique Strauss-Kahn and his lawyers, which we will hear in the days to come."
When the scandal involving President Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky broke during the 1990s, many French said it proved Clinton was strong and could lead the country, King said.
In addition, sympathy for Strauss-Kahn may be eroded, King said, by allegations from French politician Anne Mansouret, who said following Strauss-Kahn's arrest that he attacked her daughter, French journalist Tristane Banon, in 2002.
In arguing against allowing the IMF chief to go free on bond Monday, prosecutors said during his arraignment they believe Strauss-Kahn has engaged in "similar acts" at least once before.
