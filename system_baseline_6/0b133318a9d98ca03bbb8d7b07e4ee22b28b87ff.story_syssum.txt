A trawl through court records on Thursday revealed a more complete picture of Tareq and Michaele Salahi, who have left an extensive paper trail in federal bankruptcy and state court filings.
"At this time the Salahis will not make any formal comments regarding the rumors and media speculation surrounding the White House state dinner," their publicist, Mahogany Jones, said in a statement.
One of the lawsuits against the Salahis was filed by Robb Levin of Fairfax, Virginia, who held his wedding at the Oasis Winery in August 2005.
But, he said, he discovered the winery was adding a "significant profit" to what the vendors were charging them.
After he signed a contract to hold his wedding there, "They were very, very, very hard to get a hold of," he said.
In the end, Levin said, he paid up to make sure the wedding went ahead, then sued the Salahis afterward to get his money back.
Tareq Salahi is listed as company president in the filing.
Among the debts listed are more than $60,000 in credit card debt and an "unknown" amount in federal back taxes.
According to the February filing, Oasis made $1.7 million in 2007 but only $35,000 in 2008.
The business had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December 2008, with Salahi's mother, Corinne, listing herself as president.
If they lied to federal agents in order to get into the White House dinner, that is a federal crime, said Fran Townsend , CNN national security contributor.
The couple also appears to have posted pictures on Facebook purportedly showing them gaining access to high profile events during inauguration week, according to The Washington Post's Reliable Sources gossip column.
