Gonzaga University, a private, four-year university in Spokane, Washington, says the students violated the school's weapons policy by having firearms in their apartment, which is in a complex near the campus.
As the man started coming through the door, Fagan said, he yelled for his roommate, Daniel McIntosh.
Dean Chuang, attorney for Fagan and McIntosh, said the shotgun is owned by Fagan, who uses it to hunt periodically, and it wasn't used in the incident.
Meantime, Fagan and McIntosh have asked university security to return their firearms, but that hasn't yet happened.
McCulloh's statement said he has asked the Vice President for Student Development to work with several campus organizations to "facilitate a campus dialogue focused on this issue."
