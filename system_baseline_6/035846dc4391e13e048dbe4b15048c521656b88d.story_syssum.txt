Although he was known for many things, Baker's most enduring moment came in the middle of the Watergate scandal, when he asked: "What did the president know and when did he know it?"
The Watergate scandal had a devastating effect on American politics.
For Democrats, who many thought would have been the beneficiaries of a scandal that brought down a Republican president, the level of distrust that the scandal generated among the public has been an ongoing challenge.
Whenever some kind of scandal breaks, it doesn't take long for the story to escalate and for questions to arise as to whether this will end up as big as Watergate.
The worst effect of Watergate is that it created a climate where Americans fundamentally don't trust their government.
It is extremely difficult for government to do its job or for voters to have the kind of faith in government, which is necessary for a healthy society.
Until we take those kinds of steps, voters will always be seeing the shadow of Richard Nixon when they look at their elected leaders.
