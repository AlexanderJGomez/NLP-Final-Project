"There has been an unusually high number of sea lions stranded since January," said Justin Greenman, assistant stranding coordinator for NOAA on the West Coast.
Dave Koontz, director of communications for SeaWorld San Diego, said SeaWorld has rescued nearly 500 sea lions this year.
"We have been seeing emaciated or dehydrated sea lions show up on beaches," Greenman said.
If the animal has died, the local dead animal pickup service should be alerted.
