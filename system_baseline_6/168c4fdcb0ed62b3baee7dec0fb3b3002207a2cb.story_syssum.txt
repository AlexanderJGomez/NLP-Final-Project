Why aren't air traffic controllers using it to constantly track all commercial airliners?
Why don't all airliners stream their so-called black box data to satellites in real time?
Throughout most of the world, air traffic controllers still track airplanes with radar -- which uses technology dating back to the 1940s.
Aircraft flying more than about 200 miles from land over oceans are not tracked by air traffic control radar screens.
In these cases, air traffic controllers see only a blip on radar screens.
â€¢ Later, an orbiting satellite checks in with the plane's satellite transceiver, kind of like a cell tower pinging a mobile phone.
We might know more about what happened to MH370 if air traffic controllers used orbiting satellites to track airliners, instead of radar.
An aircraft outfitted with this system determines its location using GPS and transmits that data back to controllers by radio -- which has a greater range than radar.
Another emerging technology that might have helped us know more about what happened is called AFIRS, the Automated Flight Information Reporting System, developed by a Canadian company called FLYHT.
Possibly.
Although technology continues to shrink the planet in terms of communication, the tragedy offers a bitter reminder of how easy it still is to lose an entire airliner full of people.
