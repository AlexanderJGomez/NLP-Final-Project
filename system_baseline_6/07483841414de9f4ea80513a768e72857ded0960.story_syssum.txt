(CNN)French police say two suspects in Wednesday's terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine are still on the loose after escaping onto the streets of Paris.
"Everything will be done to arrest (the attackers)," French President Francois Hollande said in a speech Wednesday night.
These developments come after at least two heavily armed men entered the Charlie Hebdo office in Paris' 11th district, close to Place de la Bastille, and opened fire, Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said.
A witness who works in the office opposite the magazine's told BFMTV that he saw two hooded men, dressed in black, enter the building heavily armed.
Charlie Hebdo editor and cartoonist Stephane Charbonnier, known as "Charb," is among the dead in the attack, a police spokesman in the district where the office is located told CNN.
"Parisians will not be afraid," Klugman said.
That means there will be reinforced security at media company offices, major stores, religious centers and on public transport, his office said in a statement.
Thursday will be a national day of mourning for those killed in the attack, Hollande said.
The attack on the magazine spurred a wave of support for the publication and its practices around France and the world.
