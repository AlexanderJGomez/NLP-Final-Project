It might seem like a smart idea to buy everything together, but ultra-coordinated, flat bedding and stiff comforters often found in bagged bedding are the enemy of an inviting bedroom, said Holly Browning, DIY blogger and former home accent and interior designer.
Pillows are key, decorators said, and they must be chosen carefully.
The calming, white master bedroom she decorated is "the most comfortable place for me in our home," she said.
"Don't do it!"
"I feel like a bedroom can be uncomfortable if it's too formal."
"Whether it's a full bed frame or even just a pretty quilt hanging on the wall behind the bed, a headboard makes the room feel more finished."
"We have an Ikea Malm bed, something that was in our price range when we first bought it, but it never really stood out on its own," she said.
Soft light makes a bedroom cozier, she said.
"I know for so many a TV in the bedroom is a big no-no, but I have to have a TV in the bedroom.
"I'll be hated for this one," said Holloway, who says TVs destroy the cozy vibe of a bedroom.
