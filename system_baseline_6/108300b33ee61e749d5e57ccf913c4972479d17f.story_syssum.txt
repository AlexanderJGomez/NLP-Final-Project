York County Prison correctional officers David Whitcomb, 28, Mark Haynes, 26 and Daniel Graff, 37, were charged with official oppression and harassment on Friday after a state police investigation, Pennsylvania State Trooper Robert Hicks told CNN.
Like Wright, James Hicks also was given food in exchange for letting the officers punch and choke him, police said.
All three correctional officers have been placed on administrative leave, Trooper Hicks said.
No court date has yet been set, Trooper Hicks said.
