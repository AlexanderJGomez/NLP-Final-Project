My first game was in 1961 when Burnley were reigning league champions.
When we played Scunthorpe -- the game we won to get promoted to the First Division under Stan Ternant in 2000 -- up until then I'd been in Northern Ireland.
Bertie Ahern [Taoiseach of Ireland at the time] was a big Manchester United fan and he had tickets for a game the next day.
Our wage bill is the smallest in the league by a mile, we've got a small stadium, we've got the smallest squad and we're the smallest town that has ever produced a Premier League football club, so with all that it's quite an uphill battle to stay up but I think we will, and by playing good football.
He was one of these players that when he got the ball you just leaned forward a bit and you thought something is going to happen here and quite often it did.
The Orient game, obviously, was the most emotional for every Burnley fan.
