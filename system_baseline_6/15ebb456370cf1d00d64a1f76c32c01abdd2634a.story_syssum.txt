Speaking to ABC's "This Week," Clinton also said the president has answered the central question she raised about him when she was his chief rival for the Democratic nomination last year.
"I never had any dream, let alone inkling, that I would end up in President Obama's cabinet," she said.
"And then when he called and asked me to come see him, and we had our first conversation, I said, 'You know, I really don't think I'm the person to do this, I want to go back to my life.
But Obama "was quite persistent and very persuasive," Clinton said.
Asked whether there is any room for compromise on that issue, Clinton said the administration would not "prejudge the effort."
Several lawmakers have asked the president to put North Korea back on a list of state sponsors of terrorism.
"We're going to look at it," Clinton said.
