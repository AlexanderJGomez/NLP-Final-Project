The English language Buenos Aires Herald said Argentina's government had been silent on the death of Thatcher, who led Britain into the 1982 war over the Falkland Islands, a territory Argentina claims and refers to as Las Malvinas.
In its article on Thatcher's death, the English-language Santiago Times in Chile recalled the Iron Lady's support for the country's former dictator Augusto Pinochet, whose regime it said had supplied Britain with intelligence during the Falklands War.
It said Thatcher's "restoration of the British economy represented one of the last glorious achievements of Great Britain, or even Europe."
South Africa's Times said the "divisive effect" of Thatcher's foreign policies were still felt in the country.
"But Mrs. Thatcher knew how to stand up to Ronald Reagan when she needed to â€” for example, over the ill-considered United States invasion of Grenada," the newspaper said.
Thatcher's legacy continued with Blair's "third way" and Clinton's policies, it said in its editorial.
Its headline contrasted with the Daily Mirror's: "The woman who divided a nation."
The Mirror's editorial was headed: "Margaret Thatcher broke Britain and replaced it with something crueller and nastier."
