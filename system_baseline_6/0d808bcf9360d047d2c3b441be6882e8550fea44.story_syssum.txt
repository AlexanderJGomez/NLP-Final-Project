I'm going to look like a complete fool, she thought.
But she came back the next day.
Tomsche was an overweight child, but it wasn't until her best friend committed suicide when she was 16 that she started packing on the pounds.
But overeating had already taken its toll.
Instructor Maria Venegas remembers when Tomsche first tried her Zumba class.
Venegas teaches seven Zumba classes a week in Arkansas City in addition to working as an office manager and professional photographer.
"Every class is always different," Tomsche says.
Tomsche does Zumba five to six times a week and tries to stay active the rest of the day.
Tomsche is just happy she's gotten her smile back.
