Malaysian authorities apparently did not check the stolen documents on an international law enforcement agency database, CNN has learned.
The police official said that Maraldi had reported his passport stolen in Malaysia last August and had obtained a new one.
The names of the persons whose passports were stolen have been circulated and checked, the official said.
CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director, was told by sources at Interpol, which keeps a database of lost or stolen travel documents, that the stolen Italian passport was in the agency's database.
Referring to the stolen documents, Fuentes added, "You wonder who was using it?
In the United States, Fuentes said, passports are routinely checked against the Interpol database.
"It's rare that you have one stolen passport, much less two stolen passports on a flight.
"For a stolen passport, stolen two years ago -- these visas only last for a certain amount of time.
No one is sure what happened to the plane.
