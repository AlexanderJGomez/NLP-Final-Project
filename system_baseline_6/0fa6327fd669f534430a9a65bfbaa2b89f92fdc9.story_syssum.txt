The French investigation into the slayings of the three Kurdish women -- named by Turkish officials as Sakine Cansiz, Fidan Dogan and Leyla Soylemez -- is ongoing.
Kurdish activists have pointed the finger at possible Turkish involvement, while political leaders in Turkey have nodded to a possible feud within the PKK.
"How can France hold talks with these people who are members of PKK that was also declared terrorist organization by the EU?"
The Turkish government issued a security warning to Turkish diplomatic missions in France and throughout Europe.
"This could be a bullet that is shot in the head of the peace talks," said Sebahat Tuncel, a parliament member from the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party, speaking to CNN after Friday's peaceful protest.
