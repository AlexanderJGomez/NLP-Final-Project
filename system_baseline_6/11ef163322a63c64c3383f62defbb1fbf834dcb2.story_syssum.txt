"We will have a more open, transparent and empowering culture," said Davis.
Investigators said 178 teachers and principals working at 44 schools were involved in the cheating scandal.
Whether to bring criminal charges will be up to prosecutors, Deal said.
"I do not accept a focus on performance causes people to cheat," Davis said.
Investigators compared the results with test results from other Georgia schools and found that such patterns did not occur normally, Deal said.
Marcia Klenbort, whose three children attended Atlanta Public Schools, said the school board failed to hold Hall accountable and did not adequately address the cheating before the state stepped in.
Administrators must ensure there are equal opportunities at all schools, she said, while parents must become more involved in their children's education -- both at school and home.
