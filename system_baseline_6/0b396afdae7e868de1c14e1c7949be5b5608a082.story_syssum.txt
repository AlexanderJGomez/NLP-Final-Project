Washington (CNN) -- Ralph Nader floated the idea this week that a primary challenge to President Obama will help the president and the country.
If Nader were being honest with himself, he'd look to 2000 as an example of what the consequences can be for the country and progressive causes when progressives don't stick together.
Look at the record: Bush took President Clinton's budget surplus and squandered it.
Bush policies cost millions of Americans their jobs.
And Nader thinks a primary challenge is a good idea?
Nader knows there is another progressive activist: Cornel West, who also seeks to stir a primary challenge against Obama.
Obama repeatedly called for a tax system in which all people pay their fair share, including the wealthiest Americans.
The question facing progressives is not whether Obama should have a primary challenger.
Rather, it is: Do they want to return to the disastrous economic and social policies advocated by the tea party and the Republican presidential candidates today?
