(CNN) -- Tiger Woods has not only declared himself fit to play at this week's PGA Championship, after playing nine holes of practice at Valhalla on Wednesday, but he's also eying a fifth title.
"(To) try to go out there and win this event, that's all I'm focused on," said Woods, who won the PGA Championship the last time it was held at Valhalla Golf Club in 2000.
Woods' confidence about any potential victory flies in the face of his recent performances in the majors, having failed to win any of the last 19 he has contested.
In a separate development on Wednesday, PGA Championship organizers announced that the 2016 edition of the competition will be held in July.
