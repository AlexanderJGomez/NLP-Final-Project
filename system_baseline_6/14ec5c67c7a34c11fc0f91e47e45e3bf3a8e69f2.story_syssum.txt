"We've come here today not just to make news, but to give you a better sense for how Wii U will change the way you play games, how it will connect your gaming friends and how it will change the way you watch television," he said.
While it's not certain how many new titles will be available at launch time, at least 50 games will be available for the Wii U by March, Fils-Aime said.
"The Wonderful 101" and "Bayonetta 2," both from Platinum Games, will be exclusive to the Wii U.
"Loyal Nintendo fans will snatch this up like crazy," he said.
