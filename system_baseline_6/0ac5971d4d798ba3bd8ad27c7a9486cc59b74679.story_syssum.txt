The company says each of its portable LED lamps provides one week of light to a rural household.
And human power really came to mind," says Sameer Hajee, chief executive and co-founder of Nuru Energy.
With help from the World Bank, Hajee co-founded Nuru Energy and in 2009 the company started testing its products in the field.
"If you look at this from the standpoint of the customer," says Hajee, "they would purchase the light for $6 and then they would pay about 20 U.S. cents per week for lighting.
"I really hope that what we're providing here is a stopgap solution to the immediate energy needs of...rural populations," says Hajee.
It'll take some time."
