Last week, a 25-year follow-up of the Canadian National Breast Screening Study was published -- one of the eight major randomized trials of screening mammography.
The allegation of cheating -- purposely putting women whom researchers knew had advanced cancers in the mammography group -- is an incredibly serious one.
The new study provides evidence that randomization did exactly what it is supposed to do: It created two identical groups of women.
Why?
A new generation has openly acknowledged the problems of mammography.
Most of the other randomized trials simply compared regular mammography with doing nothing.
Further, the Canadian trial confirms that the harm of being overdiagnosed by screening mammography is real: One in five invasive cancers found by screening represents overdiagnosis.
It is important to recognize this estimate doesn't include the smallest, earliest form of breast cancer found only by mammography -- ductal carcinoma in situ or DCIS.
It's time to get the science back in screening mammography and to recognize that mammographers may not be the ideal source for balanced information.
