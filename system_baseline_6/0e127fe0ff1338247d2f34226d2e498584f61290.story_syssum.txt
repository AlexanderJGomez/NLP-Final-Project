Two cables from 2007 detailed the discovery of uranium in "multiple containers" in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
There were also land mines planted around it," one cable says.
The Congo informants were "anxiously waiting for some sort of indication from us that we are willing to pay for it," according to the cable.
In 2006, U.S. diplomats toured a non-functioning nuclear research center that included two reactors in the Congo capital, Kinshasa.
"It is relatively easy for someone to break into the nuclear reactor building or the nuclear waste storage building and steal rods or nuclear waste, with no greater tool than a lock cutter."
A cable from the U.S. Embassy there earlier this year noted, "The lone security guard standing watch at Yemen's main radioactive materials storage facility was removed from his post on December 30, 2009, according to (name redacted)."
One of the more bizarre incidents occurred in Portugal in 2008, when a man walked into the U.S. Embassy to try to help sell "uranium plates" owned by an unidentified ex-Russian general living in Portugal.
In another case that is not covered by the leaked cables published so far, two Armenians pleaded guilty last month to smuggling highly enriched uranium into the nation of Georgia, hiding it in a lead-lined box on a train from the Armenian capital, Yerevan, to Tbilisi in Georgia.
Their illicit cargo was not detected by alarms, but they were eventually caught by a good old-fashioned sting operation.
