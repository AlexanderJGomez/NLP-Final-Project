The girl -- Aja Daniell Johnson -- was reported missing from Geronimo, Oklahoma, late Sunday, the bureau said.
Lester Hobbs is not Aja's biological father, police said.
Lester Hobbs and Aja were gone, Goss said.
The Comanche County, Oklahoma, Sheriff's Office said Aja has a medical condition that requires medication.
Lester Hobbs was supposed to appear in court in Lincoln County, Oklahoma, on a DUI charge, Goss said, and did not appear, so a warrant has been issued for him.
Lester Hobbs is about 6-foot-1 and 190 pounds, with hazel eyes and brown hair, according to the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation.
