Specifically, Congress hasn't passed a budget in almost four years.
If members of Congress can't pass a budget on time, they wouldn't get paid until they did.
In fact, it is a violation of the 1974 Budget Control Act (PDF).
The proposal was the cornerstone of the "Make Congress Work" plan released last year.
"No Budget, No Pay" is a no-brainer.
Not incidentally, that's also the reason "No Budget, No Pay" does not violate the 27th Amendment, which forbids salary increases or reductions during a current Congress: Their salary is not being reduced, it is being withheld until they actually do their job.
But the House GOP vote to at least extend the debt-ceiling deadline and impose a common sense measure like "No Budget, No Pay" is sign of sanity at the start of the second Obama term.
