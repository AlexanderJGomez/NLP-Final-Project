(CNN)Searchers have found the tail section of AirAsia Flight QZ8501 in the murky depths of the Java Sea, raising hopes that the plane's black boxes and the precious information they hold might soon be recovered.
But it's still uncertain if the black boxes are in the piece of wreckage the searchers discovered.
The plane lost contact after the pilot requested permission to turn and climb to a higher altitude, according to Indonesian officials.
Soelistyo said Wednesday that divers were preparing to go back underwater in the same area, which is in one of the priority zones where search efforts have been focused.
Soelistyo also said Wednesday that another body had been found in the sea, bringing the total to 40.
The vast majority of the people on the plane were Indonesian.
