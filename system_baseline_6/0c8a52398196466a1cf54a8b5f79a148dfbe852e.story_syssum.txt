There are a few thousand Egyptians left in Tunisia awaiting evacuation after more than 40,000 were taken home, said Firas Kayal, a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency, on Saturday.
Kayal said Saturday more than 10,000 Bangladeshis are awaiting transport in Tunisia.
Meanwhile, three people died and 14 were missing when they tried to get off a ship headed from Libya's capital, Tripoli, to Crete, the Greek Ministry for the Protection of Civilians said Sunday.
The U.S. State Department said Saturday it would donate $3 million to the International Organization for Migration (IOM) as part of a joint U.S.-IOM partnership to help get home thousands of Egyptians and other nationals from Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia.
