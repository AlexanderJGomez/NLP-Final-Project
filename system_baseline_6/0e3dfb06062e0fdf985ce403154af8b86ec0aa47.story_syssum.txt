Morgan was interviewing the agent for a documentary titled "Marilyn Monroe: Murder on Fifth Helena Drive," he said.
Monroe changed her name from Norma Jeane Baker to Marilyn Monroe early in her acting and modeling career.
The film was made in the late 1950s; Gretchen said she could not recall the exact year.
