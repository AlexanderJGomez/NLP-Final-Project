"Due to concerns regarding our February 16 appearance at SeaWorld, we have chosen to cancel the performance," the rock band said on its Facebook page on Friday.
SeaWorld is working to book replacement acts, Gollattscheck said.
"It wasn't that hard a deal for me."
SeaWorld said it would like the musical artists to learn for themselves about SeaWorld.
