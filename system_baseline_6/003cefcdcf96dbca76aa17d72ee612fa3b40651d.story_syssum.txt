Save the Children Chief Executive Jasmine Whitbread said the "vast majority" of children on their own in Haiti are not orphans, but were simply separated from their families in the chaos.
Between Haiti's "lousy [child welfare] oversight system," and all the challenges that Haitians have endured, it's not uncommon for Haitian parents to put their children in orphanages temporarily, de Bono said.
Adoptions without consent are child trafficking.
"It's a bit sad, as I have several wonderful children who waited literally for years for new families, and no one ever came," she said.
For those who want to help Haitian children, Whitbread said, they should donate to aid agencies that are working on reuniting children with their families.
