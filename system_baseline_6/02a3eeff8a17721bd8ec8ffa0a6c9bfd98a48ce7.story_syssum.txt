Police in Phoenix arrested Jonathan Dwyer after practice on multiple allegations of felony assault.
Peterson then took a leave of absence and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell placed him on the exempt list, which gives the team the opportunity to continue to pay him while he deals with his legal issues.
He has proclaimed his innocence of the charges, which were filed after police said he assaulted his then-girlfriend and threatened to kill her.
Dwyer, 25, was spending Wednesday night in the Maricopa County jail and the Arizona Cardinals deactivated him.
The running back without a team is appealing his indefinite suspension by the league.
Three days after Goodell created a new NFL policy against domestic violence on August 28, San Francisco 49ers defensive tackle Ray McDonald was arrested on an accusation of felony domestic violence.
He pleaded not guilty, ESPN said, adding that the player was still practicing with the team.
