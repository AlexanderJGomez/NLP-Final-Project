In addition to the 12 Somali and 11 Yemeni suspects, the Indian navy seized two small boats and "a substantial cache of arms and equipment," the military said in a statement.
The Indian warship Mysore, which carried out Saturday's operation, is on anti-piracy patrol in the Gulf of Aden, the release said.
Last month, the Indian navy said it had sunk a pirate "mother vessel" in the Gulf of Aden.
The ship's owner said the sunken vessel was a Thai trawler that was being seized by pirates when an Indian warship fired on it.
He said the ship the Tabar fired on was laden with ammunition.
The Pentagon said Friday, however, that there are no plans for U.S. forces to go ashore in pursuit of pirates in Somalia.
