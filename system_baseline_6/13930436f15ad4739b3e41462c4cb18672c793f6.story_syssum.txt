Sarah Palin.
Meanwhile, in small towns, I detected great affection for Palin.
Some say the deciding factor was when Koch described life in upstate New York as "sterile" and said he dreaded living in the "small town" of Albany, if elected.
It wasn't.
"What is this hatred for conservatives and small-town people and Sarah Palin?"
The idea isn't that people who live in small towns have better values than people who live in cities.
Palin acknowledged that she didn't come from elite stock, but said that she was grateful for that.
Too bad many Americans don't understand Sarah Palin.
