(CNN) -- College costs too much, both for students and for society as a whole.
Indeed, the typical successful university president views his or her key constituencies not to be the customer (students and their parents who pay tuition charges or the granters of research funds), but rather others -- the faculty, important alumni, key administrators, trustees and occasionally politicians.
Yet for American universities, the "bottom line" is measured by college rankings that often reward schools for turning people away, becoming more "selective."
Like health care, prices are rising rapidly for higher education because of the predominant role of third-party payments -- federal student loans and grants, state government support for institutions and students, private philanthropic gifts and endowment income.
Customers are ignorant of college outcomes because we do not measure in any coherent and consistent manner what students actually learn, how well they do after graduation or whether they think better in a critical manner as a result of the college experience.
If information and incentives are provided, innovation will come.
Like it or not, American higher education is in for big change in the next generation.
