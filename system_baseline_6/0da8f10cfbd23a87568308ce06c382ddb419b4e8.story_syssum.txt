(CNN) -- In the scorching desert of Qatar, scientists are showing that saltwater can be used to help grow crops.
"Qatar is one of the most challenging climates in the world to work in for this kind of thing," says Dr. Virginia Corless, the science and development manager.
Lastly, the saltwater is also used to cultivate algae, which can be used for large-scale bio-energy production -- though currently the algae plant is still in the research phase.
"The biggest issues right now are climate change and water resources globally, and these simple technologies can tackle both," he says.
Some experts, however, question if the Sahara Forest Project is the best use of resources.
"It helps when people can see it on the ground, and taste the cucumbers and see that this is real," he says.
