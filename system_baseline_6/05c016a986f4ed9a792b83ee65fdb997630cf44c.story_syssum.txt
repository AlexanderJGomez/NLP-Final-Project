After years of speculation and rare case reports, a study suggests that stimulant medication -- mostly used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder -- may have played a role in a handful of cases of sudden, unexplained death in children and adolescents.
This compared with only two cases of stimulant use, or 0.4 percent, among healthy children who had died in motor vehicle accidents -- a group used to represent a general population of healthy children and adolescents.
Strattera, another medication approved for ADHD in children, is not a stimulant medication.
"Review of Novartis safety data has failed to detect an increased risk in sudden cardiac death associated with methylphenidate use."
Although the researchers are confident that the results are not due to any underlying factors -- children with ADHD often have asthma and heart conditions also linked with sudden death, and so these cases were eliminated from the analysis --"one can never be 100 percent sure that there aren't other unknown or undiagnosed issues," says Gould.
"The study adds very little to what we already know, i.e., that some children who receive stimulants experience sudden unexpected death," says Dr. Perrin, who was not involved in the study.
When deciding whether to put a child on stimulant medications, both clinicians and parents should weigh the seriousness of the situation, says Gould.
Future research should focus on new ways to detect which children are most at risk for sudden death when taking stimulants, says Gould, since not all cases seem to be detectable with routine screenings.
The study was funded by a grant from the NIMH and a contract with the FDA.
