Tom Waits in Paris on the European leg of his tour.
Waits' place in the folk tradition is something he has acknowledged, consciously or otherwise, in his music.
Like all great writers, Waits is a conscientious observer of people and their strange foibles.
"Bukowski had a story that essentially was saying that it's the little things that drive men mad," Waits said.
Waits took to the stage dressed in a Chaplinesque suit, delivering his set from a slightly raised platform that gave up a cloud of dust each time he bashed his feet into it.
Lopsided or not, it's an authentic voice we could surely do with hearing more from.
