Yet for Maroney, it wasn't simply a fun opportunity -- it's part of a larger goal to one day become a working actress.
I've always been drawn to it and I've always wanted to pursue it, just like gymnastics," she said.
"I'm kind of more into movies, because I'm really into getting into [character] and being that person and selling it as well as she always does."
"It was my first time ever doing anything like that," Maroney said.
I really like the character Rose on the show ... and I thought if I was ever going to be on the show, I'd really want to play her, and then I ended up being her best friend.
I really just take things one step at a time.
I really want to try to go to this next Olympics, [and] after I heal up I'll be back in the gym working as hard as I possibly could just like I did for this Olympics.
So I'll really be getting into trying to work for the next Olympics, and in between that I'll be doing, hopefully, little things like what I just did."
