A man shot four men with whom he had worked -- two of them fatally -- in northern Florida on Saturday before shooting and killing himself, the Union County sheriff said.
The Union County Sheriff's Office said Allen went to a Lake Butler farm owned by Pritchett, where he fatally shot Gonzalez-Delgado.
A short distance away, Allen shot and killed Pritchett, authorities said.
Griffis was taken to the hospital for immediate surgery; he was in critical condition.
