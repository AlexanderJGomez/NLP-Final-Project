(CNN) -- A vaccine not licensed for use in the United States will be offered to thousands of Princeton University students beginning Monday, after a string of meningitis B cases at the college this year.
Princeton will cover the cost of the vaccine.
Meningitis is caused by inflammation of the membranes that cover the brain and the spinal cord, known as the meninges.
