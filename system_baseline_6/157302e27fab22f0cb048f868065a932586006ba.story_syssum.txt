Kandel won the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work with Aplysia -- or more specifically, for his work on the biological mechanisms of memory storage.
One is complex forms of memory, which require the hippocampus and (are called) explicit memory storage.
And the two involve different systems in the brain.
You've got to see how a memory is formed.
But if you have a long-term memory, you alter the expression of genes in the brain and you grow new synaptic connections.

With Alzheimer's disease, you lose explicit memory, complicated memory, so he would have difficulty recognizing people.
And he did some beautiful paintings when he had fairly advanced Alzheimer's disease.
The other reason memory is so important is there is a number of a diseases that affect memory storage, and we'd like to know how they work so we can try to remedy them.
It's Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease -- dreadful disorders that we want to be able to help people with.
With Alzheimer's disease, I think the understanding is surprisingly good.
By the time they come to us with symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, they've had the disease for 10 years.

There's much, much more to be studied, and much, much more to be learned.
