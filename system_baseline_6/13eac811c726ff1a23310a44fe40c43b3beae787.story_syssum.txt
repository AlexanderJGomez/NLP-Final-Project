British Airways plans to reduce capacity by 4 percent next winter by parking up to 16 aircraft.
This is by far the biggest crisis the industry has ever faced," said Willie Walsh, British Airways' chief executive.
Total traffic fell 3.4 percent and while the airline carried 33.1 million passengers last year, it was a drop of 4.3 percent from the previous year.
