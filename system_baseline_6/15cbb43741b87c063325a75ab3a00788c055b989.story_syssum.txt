The world finally knows how to address the latest addition to the British royal family: HRH Prince George Alexander Louis of Cambridge.
He was followed by a line of kings with the same name, including George III, who was known for his bouts of insanity.
The name "Alexander" is a feature of the Dutch royal family: Willem-Alexander ascended to the throne after the abdication of his mother Queen Beatrix earlier this year.
No British monarch has been named Louis, but it is very popular across the English Channel in France, where 18 kings have taken the name from 814 onward.
