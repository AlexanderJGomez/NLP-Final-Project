Henderson teaches that prayer should be about worshipping God, having a one-to-one relationship through prayer.
Such is the demand for the prayer summits that Henderson speaks at 20 to 30 churches and to as many as 13,000 college students annually, he said.
Henderson cites The Lord's Prayer in the sixth chapter of the book of Matthew as the blueprint for Christians, containing what could be called the four Rs of prayer.
"The disciples asked Jesus how to pray, and he gave The Lord's Prayer."
For Henderson, the prayer statistics point to a yearning for God.
"It's a personal thing and very real beyond the walls of church."
