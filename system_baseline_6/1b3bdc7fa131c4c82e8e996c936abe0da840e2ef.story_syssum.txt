Velentzas and her former roommate, 31-year-old Asia Siddiqui, were arrested and accused of planning to build an explosive device for attacks in the United States, federal prosecutors said.
Velentzas and Siddiqui did not enter pleas when they appeared in federal court in Brooklyn on Thursday.
In the past 18 months, the Justice Department's National Security Division has prosecuted or is prosecuting more than 30 cases of people attempting to travel abroad to join or provide support to terrorist groups.
Velentzas and Siddiqui repeatedly expressed support for violent jihad, the complaint said.
"As alleged, the defendants in this case carefully studied how to construct an explosive device to launch an attack on the homeland," Loretta Lynch, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a statement.
In a statement, Islamic Circle of North America said Velentzas was formerly homeless and provided shelter by the relief organization.
Velentzas appeared to have experienced hardship in her life but was "working towards self-development and long-term stability," the statement said.
