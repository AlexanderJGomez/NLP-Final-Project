Earlier, the Air Force said only a small number of body parts had been buried in a commercial landfill and claimed it would be impossible to make a final determination of how many remains were disposed of in that manner.
They don't understand the degree of dishonor involved in all of this," Holt said.
When bodies are not intact -- for instance, in the aftermath of a crash or explosion -- a body may be released to the family before some parts have been identified by the Air Force Mortuary at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware.
"That makes us proud to be an American, that we would do that," Holt said.
"I think the secretary is comfortable with the way the Air Force has handled this," said Pentagon spokesman Capt.
Later Thursday the Air Force said it was ready to apologize to any family that objected to the disposition of a loved one's remains.
Jones said only nine people have contacted a hotline seeking information about body fragments that may have been cremated, then incinerated and finally dumped with medical waste in a landfill prior to 2008.
So far since 2008, he said, only 14 urns containing body fragments have been disposed of at sea.
