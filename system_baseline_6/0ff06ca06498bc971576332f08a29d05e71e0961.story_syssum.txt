Iran now is in a position to direct Shiite militia mobilization and integration into Iraqi security operations and to shape Iraq's military and intelligence operations through Iran's Quds Force advisers.
He will also probably urge Iran to quiet Shiite opposition to his premiership so that he can perform the urgent work of commander in chief.
During the "surge" period of 2007-08, al-Maliki repeatedly asked for U.S. air power and artillery capabilities to pound Sunni neighborhoods (both of which he was denied) while vehemently protesting the use of precision munitions in Shiite militia-controlled areas.
A defiant al-Maliki -- with the support of Iran, Syria and Russia and absent U.S. constraints -- will aggressively target Sunni Arabs, who in his view are active supporters of ISIS.
Regardless of who the next Shiite prime minister will be, the sectarian actors responsible for executing al-Maliki's heavy-handed tactics against the Sunni population in 2006-09 are now back in key positions.
Meanwhile, U.S influence and leverage with al-Maliki and other Shiite leaders is waning, if not altogether gone.
Tehran will see any such reforms as limits on Iranian influence, something the Iranians will not let happen.
