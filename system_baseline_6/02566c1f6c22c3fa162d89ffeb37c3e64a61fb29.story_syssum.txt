Kaufman County Judge Bruce Wood said he thought there was a "strong connection" between the slayings of Mike and Cynthia McLelland and the shooting death of Kaufman County Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse, who was killed on his way to work in January.
Just two months ago, McLelland vowed to find the people who killed Hasse, one of his top deputies.
"He never stated to me that he was worried," Wood said.
McLelland was an Army veteran who later earned a master's degree in psychology and became a psychologist for the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation, the district attorney's website said.
Hasse had feared for his life and carried a gun to work, said a Dallas attorney who described herself as his longtime friend.
She said the prosecutor told her he had begun carrying a gun in and out of the county courthouse daily.
"I hope that the people that did this are watching, because we're very confident that we're going to find you," McLelland told reporters.
