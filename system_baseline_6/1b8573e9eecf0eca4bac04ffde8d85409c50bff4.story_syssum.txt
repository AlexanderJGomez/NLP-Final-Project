London (CNN) -- A court in central London this week found itself in the world's spotlight, as a small army of celebrities staked their reputations by turning up to offer support -- and bail money -- to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
"I think we are entitled to know the dealings of those that govern us."
Meanwhile, Vaughan Smith, the founder of London's Frontline Club which claims to "champion independent journalism," offered to accommodate Assange, who has no British address, at his sprawling family home in order to meet another of the bail conditions issued by the court Tuesday.
Pilger, a long-time critic of U.S. foreign policy, has been particularly vocal in his support for Assange and the work of WikiLeaks.
He told reporters: "It's quite clear that the U.S. government and other governments have kept secrets hidden from us.
However in a post on his Twitter page the previous week, he wrote: "Julian Assange might be guilty of sex crimes.
Bianca Jagger, human rights advocate and former wife of Rolling Stones singer Mick, also gave her support to Assange, telling reporters in central London that she was concerned that the case had become politicized.
