(CNN)It was a very telling mini-scandal, the faux-fury over Michelle Obama's short visit to Saudi Arabia.
The presence of an American first lady on Saudi territory embodies the intense unease that surrounds U.S. and Western relations with the Saudi kingdom.
The U.S. needs Saudi Arabia -- and Saudi Arabia needs the U.S.
In fact, the claim that her attire and performance created a firestorm in Saudi Arabia is plainly false.
Countless prominent women have appeared in public meeting Saudi royals without wearing headscarves.
The story made headlines because people in the United States and in the West feel a scandal in the relationship, because much of what goes on in Saudi Arabia is an affront not just to Western principles but to human rights conventions endorsed by most of the world.
For decades Saudi women have protested the indefensible rule that bans them from driving, making Saudi Arabia the only country in the world with such a ban.
There is no freedom of religion in the kingdom, where everyone by law must be a Muslim and the public practice of other religions is forbidden.
The answer is a frustrating balance of realism and idealism.
A condolence call was not the time for public criticism, and Michelle Obama's presence in Riyadh was a meaningful sign that the United States believes women belong in the public sphere.
