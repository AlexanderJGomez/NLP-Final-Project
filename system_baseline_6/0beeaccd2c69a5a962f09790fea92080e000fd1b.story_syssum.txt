iReporter Clinton Wood, who lives outside Portland in Tualatin, Oregon, acknowledges that Seattle is prettier than Portland.
Absolutely not, Wood claims in his defense of Portland, and goes on to list why "Portland thumps Seattle."
"While I love Seattle, let's be clear, Portland is my city," writes Moon, who grew up in Portland.
Commenter Laura Minnick says Cameo Cafe has the best breakfast in town "hands down."
"If you visit Portland, Mount Tabor is a must-see," says Moon.
iReporter Crummett suggests a Duck tour for Seattle visitors.
"The city is full of surprises and great shopping," says Crummett, and she recommends excursions to neighboring Bainbridge Island and Bremerton.
Bill, who has lived in both cities but currently calls Seattle home, cast his vote firmly for Portland.
