(CNN) -- After years of setbacks and controversies, the Kenyan deputy president went on trial Tuesday at the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands for alleged crimes against humanity.
Kenyatta and Ruto have denied accusations that they coordinated violence among their respective ethnic groups after the disputed 2007 election.
Opening for the defense, lawyer Karim Khan said that the case against Ruto was based on an "exceptionally deficient" investigation and that the deputy president should never have been accused.
A lawyer for Sang will give his opening statement Wednesday, the court said.
We are the ones who experienced the atrocities the court cites, because there were atrocities, and there was pain and suffering by the victims."
Ruto and myself cannot therefore be away at the same time," he said.
"The ICC is not, under any circumstances, a substitute for domestic criminal justice systems; it only intervenes if the national judicial system is either unwilling or unable to ensure that justice is done," the court said in a statement.
The ICC intervened "only after the Kenyan efforts to establish a domestic mechanism to investigate the violence failed," Bensouda said.
The first phase of Ruto's trial is expected to end on October 4.
