Wayne Nelson Corliss, 58, was arrested at his apartment in Union City, New Jersey, about midnight Wednesday by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, Interpol said in a written statement.
Interpol announced Tuesday that it was attempting to identify the man, who was featured in 100 photographs sexually abusing at least three boys between the ages of 6 and 10, it said.
Corliss is charged with producing child pornography, according to prosecutors.
The complaint alleges that the suspect's face is clearly shown and the background suggests the images were taken in Thailand.
A search of U.S. passport information found an image of Corliss that police compared to the photographs, the complaint said.
