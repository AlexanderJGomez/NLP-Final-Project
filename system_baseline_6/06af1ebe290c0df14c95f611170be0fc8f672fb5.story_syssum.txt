To Sony, releasing the Move is an obvious move for the PlayStation, given it believes it started the motion controller era with its Eye Toy.
While Sony is expecting consumers to use Move with a range of brand-new games, the company also clearly thinks that it will enhance game play in existing titles.
And later this year, the forthcoming game SOCOM 4 will incorporate both Move and the sub-controller.
