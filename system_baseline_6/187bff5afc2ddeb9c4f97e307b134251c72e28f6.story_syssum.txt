Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- Nepalis went to the polls Tuesday amid tight security to elect an assembly that will draw up a new constitution.
Earlier reports said that three people had been injured.
But people largely ignored the call and are voting "enthusiastically," said Election Commission spokesman Bir Bahadur Rai.
Two years later, in 2008, Nepal held elections for the first time.
