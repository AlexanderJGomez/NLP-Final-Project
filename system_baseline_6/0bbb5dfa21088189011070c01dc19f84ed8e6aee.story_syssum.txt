Her lawyer worked out a deal with the prosecutor Monday morning in which Witherspoon will go through a pre-trial intervention program to avoid getting a conviction on her record, an Atlanta Municipal Court spokesman said.
"Mrs. Witherspoon began to hang out the window and say that she did not believe that I was a real police officer," Pyland wrote.
When the trooper warned her again, Witherspoon allegedly told him she was a U.S. citizen and allowed to "stand on American ground."
"You're about to find out who I am," she replied, the arrest report said.
Their car was impounded, and Witherspoon and Toth were taken to the Atlanta city jail, the report said.
"But I do want to say, I clearly had one drink too many and I am deeply embarrassed about the things I said," the actress said in a statement.
