(CNN) -- England went into the Rugby World Cup quarterfinals on Saturday after a dramatic late 16-12 victory over Scotland at Eden Park in New Zealand.
"Full credit to Scotland, we knew this was going to be an incredibly tough game and they made it that way," said England skipper Lewis Moody.
"We played really bad rugby," France captain Thierry Dusautoir said.
Wales and Fiji will battle for second place in Group D on Sunday, with the British side needing just one point to progress.
