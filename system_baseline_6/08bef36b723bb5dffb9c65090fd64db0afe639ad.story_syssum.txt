(CNN) -- An overwhelming vote by residents of the Falkland Islands to remain under British rule didn't quell claims from Argentina on Tuesday.
Before the results were announced, one lawmaker from the islands criticized Argentina for arguing that the vote was illegitimate.

The two countries went to war over the territory in 1982 after the then-military government in Argentina landed troops on the islands.
British officials have rejected Fernandez's call for negotiations, saying the people of the Falkland Islands have chosen to be British and "have a right to self-determination as enshrined in the U.N.
The islands, which raise their own taxes but rely on the United Kingdom for defense and foreign policy, are one of 14 British Overseas Territories and have been under British rule since 1833.
Before results were announced, Halford said she didn't think the vote would put an end to Argentina's renewed bid for control of the islands.
