The Punjab police department ordered Azad and tens of thousands of his fellow officers to shape up because police officials said they couldn't find enough fit officers to fill jobs at 40 new state-of-the-art police stations that are scheduled to open by the end of the year.
"They are responsible police officers.
They can do it," Iftikhar said, when asked if the police force will shape up.
"No matter what we're asked, we'll do it."
