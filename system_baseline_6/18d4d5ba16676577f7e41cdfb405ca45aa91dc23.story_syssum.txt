(CNN) -- Foxconn, the high-profile electronics company that builds Apple's iPhone and other products in China, is back in the headlines after workers rioted at its Taiyaun factory.
Although employees at Apple and Foxconn are treated very differently, the two companies are known for keeping their workers and others in the dark.
I believe a company can benefit by sharing some of its intellectual property given the right conditions.
Apple is obviously super-secretive with its customers about product announcements.
And as Apple continues to lag well behind Android in market share, eventually it will be forced to be more open with consumers, as well.
But increasingly Apple pays a price for this employee secrecy.
This is an enormous problem for Apple, not just for its reputation, but also the disruptions such working conditions can cause in the supply chain.
Foxconn promised to improve conditions, and Apple said "We think empowering workers and helping them understand their rights is essential.")
It is a design and marketing company at the heart of an enormous business web of suppliers and software developers -- based on openness.
Apple also has failed miserably in terms of sharing within society and the global community.
With Tim Cook now having been CEO for a year, Apple seems to be increasingly aware that in the long term, business cannot succeed in a world that's failing.
And increasingly as it comes under more intense competitive pressures, Apple will need to become an even more open company.
