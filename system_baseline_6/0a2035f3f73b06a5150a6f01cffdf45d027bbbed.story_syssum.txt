Paula Broadwell, a woman who was romantically involved with former CIA Director David Petraeus, will not face federal charges of cyberstalking another woman friendly with Petraeus.
U.S. officials said the FBI discovered Petraeus was involved with Broadwell, a woman who was under investigation for sending allegedly harassing and anonymous e-mails to Jill Kelley, a Tampa socialite who was friendly with Petraeus and his wife.
Sources close to Broadwell acknowledged that issue has not been resolved.
