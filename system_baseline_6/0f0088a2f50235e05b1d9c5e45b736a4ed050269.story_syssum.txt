The zoo says the high calorie and sugar content of bananas grown for human consumption -- which are sweeter than those found in the wild -- are bad for the monkeys' health and can rot their teeth.
"Sweet and juicy bananas are good for humans but not for monkeys," Knowling said.
The zoo has seen "definite changes" in the monkey's behavior since the bananas were slowly withdrawn from their diet, Knowling said.
Knowling said there was no obvious sign that the monkeys were missing the fruit.
