(CNN) -- A California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) employee who allegedly wrote a letter to a transgender woman and condemned her to hell has resigned, officials said Thursday.
Yust said she also got a pamphlet from a church, which she said contained offensive material directed at her sexual orientation and gender.
The DMV employee went through a discipline process and received sensitivity training and counseling after that incident, Marando said.
Dolan said of the DMV field representative.
