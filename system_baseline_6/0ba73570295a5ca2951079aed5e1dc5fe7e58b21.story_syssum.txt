(CNN)The sun hadn't risen at Garissa University College.
According to AFP, the gunmen separated the students by religion and allowed Muslims to leave.
It wasn't until about 15 hours after the attack began that the explosions and gunfire around Garissa finally ended.
Some of those students, at one point or another, were believed to be hostages in one of the four dormitories on campus.
"I am lucky to be alive, because I jumped through the fence with other students."
Needless to say, that aim isn't shared in most places -- particularly in Kenya, where more than 80% of citizens are Christian.
What makes Thursday's attack different is what was targeted -- an institute of higher learning, presumably filled with innocent students with no direct part in the Kenyan and allied governments' fight against Al-Shabaab.
It's too early to tell what the future now holds for Garissa University College.
