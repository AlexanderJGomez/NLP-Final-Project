Washington (CNN) -- Ahead of direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians on Thursday, President Barack Obama said Wednesday night that he was "hopeful -- cautiously hopeful" that the talks could achieve a two-state solution to the long running Mideast conflict.
Also attending the dinner were Secretary of State Hillary Clintonand Middle East Quartet Representative Tony Blair.
"We are under no illusions," he said.
"Terrorists ... are purposely trying to undermine these talks," Obama said.
Netanyahu will have "closed the door in my face" if settlement construction resumes, Erakat said.
Netanyahu can have settlements or peace, but he can't have both, Erakat said.
Mitchell, however, told reporters Tuesday that both Netanyahu and Abbas are noting polls showing fear of intensified conflict if negotiations fall apart.
But simply resuming talks was a critical step, and a comprehensive Middle East peace deal has been one of Obama's top foreign policy goals, they said.
