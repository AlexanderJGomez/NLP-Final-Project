If you think that the media and the public have gone hog wild over Prince Williams' wedding to Kate Middleton, you'd be surprised by how we were whipped into even more of a royal frenzy by the Diana and Charles nuptials.
Diana was just like us!
While we watched Diana ride in a beautiful traditional carriage to St. Paul's, we munched on scones and clotted cream, and drank endless cups of tea.
And as romantic as it was, Diana herself with her adorable shaggy haircut looked perfectly modern.
The first occasion was when Diana hosted a party honoring English designers at London Fashion Week in Flare, 1987.
Diana was stunning, and you could see her toned arms in a sleek navy gown.
Having met Diana, I have no doubt she would have made Kate, her soon-to-be daughter-in-law, feel like her BFF from the moment William brought her home.
There's no doubt in my mind that she's beaming in heaven!
