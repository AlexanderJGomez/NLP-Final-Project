When one of her colleagues in Boston got diagnosed with breast cancer, Mom organized a food drop-off for the family.
Now, she desperately needs a bone marrow transplant as soon as possible.
Once we learned that Mom needed a transplant, her former students, friends, and colleagues -- even those she did not know personally -- started setting up bone marrow drives around the country.
It didn't occur to us that none of the 12 potential matches would work out, or that people would back out of donating their bone marrow.
Although we have not yet found a match for my mom, at least six of these people have proved to be potential matches for other people desperately needing a transplant.
Two weeks ago, we found out that Mom had a match from India.
Being a bone marrow donor is easy.
My dream is to give Mom the gift of life -- in the form of a bone marrow donor.
If you would like to try to donate for Mom, please submit the code "nalini" so that your swab kits can be expedited.
