NEW YORK (CNN) -- The Justice Department and federal prosecutors will investigate allegations of discrimination against Latinos by police in Suffolk County, New York, officials said.
Lucero's stabbing also prompted the Southern Poverty Law Center to undertake an investigation in Suffolk County.
The organization also found what it called a trend of "racial profiling, selective enforcement and outright bullying," specifically in the Suffolk County Police Department.
Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer said law center researchers did not speak with him during the course of their investigation.
Justice Department spokesman Alejandro Miyas said the department hopes police will cooperate with the inquiry and work with investigators.
"We're very proud of the way the police department interacts with our minority communities."
