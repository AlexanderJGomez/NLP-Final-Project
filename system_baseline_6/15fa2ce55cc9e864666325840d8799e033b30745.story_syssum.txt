(CNN) -- Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom should leave office during the investigation into whether he was connected to three recent slayings, his 2007 presidential opponent said Thursday.
The crisis started Monday with the surfacing of a video in which Guatemalan attorney Rodrigo Rosenberg said Colom, the president's wife and a top aide would be responsible if something happened to the lawyer.
Perez said Vice President Jose Rafael Espada could take over until the investigation is complete.
"We are only asking that the state be strengthened," Perez said.
"The president has not wanted to confront this and has given evasive answers," Perez said.
Very damning," he said.
"I fear that this crisis will lead to violence and destabilization of the government," Carrera said from Guatemala City.
"The powers that be are trying to make it a social issue -- the wealthy against the poor," he said.
The investigation, he said, will be handled by an independent attorney general who does not report to the president.
Colom and Velasquez said the meeting had been planned days ahead of time.
A just investigation is necessary, he said.
Rosenberg said the same thing in the video, bemoaning the "narcos, assassins and thieves" who have taken over the country.
Instead, his funeral was held that day.
