That is so rewarding," Tilders told CNN.
He was also the robotic brains behind the hugely successful "Walking with Dinosaurs -- The Arena Spectacular" stage show, but the scale of King Kong was unlike anything he had attempted before.
"But to cut a long story short, we were so impressed by what the manned puppet could do that we had a change of heart and said we should do the whole show with marionette puppets.
Suspended from the ceiling, Kong's limbs are manipulated on stage by 10 specially trained stage circus artists who scurry over and around the puppet, shifting his arms and legs by hand or using ropes.
"It's a machine that allows Kong to both move around the stage and be raised up and down but also take different positions," said Stage Technologies' Group CEO Mark Ager.
The company, which is currently helping pop star Pink fly around stage on her world tour, has previously assisted Tilders with the Walking with Dinosaurs project, helping create a flying prehistoric bird called an Ornithocheirus.
The critics like it too.
It's only a matter of time before audiences worldwide get their chance to feel the towering stage presence of Kong, said Tilders.
