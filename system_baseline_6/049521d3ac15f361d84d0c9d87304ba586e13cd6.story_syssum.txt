The official government list of victims from this week's earthquake in central Italy reached 287 on Friday, as Italians held a mass state funeral to lay the victims to rest.
The funeral was being held outside a hangar in Coppito, a town adjacent to the earthquake's epicenter of L'Aquila.
Bertone said the funeral was a "precious moment" to understand the meaning of life and death.

Recovering from such losses and rebuilding the city of L'Aquila will take several years, according to Miozzo.
In the nearby village of Onna, 40 people -- more than one out of every eight residents in the town of 300 -- were killed in the earthquake.
"My son died here," she said.
"There is no way I'm leaving this town -- not ever."
