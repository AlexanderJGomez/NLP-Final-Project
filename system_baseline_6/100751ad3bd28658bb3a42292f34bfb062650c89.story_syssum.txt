Once she arrived home, Donnelly implored firefighters to get her cat, but they were busy trying to control the blaze.
Jen Leary, a former firefighter who founded the group, met with building residents and, once the fire was out, retrieved the animals.
"When (someone) loses everything in a fire, they shouldn't then be forced to lose their pets -- their family members -- as well," Leary said.
said Leary, 36.
Now, whenever the Red Cross responds to a disaster and discovers that an animal is involved, they call Leary.
Rescuing animals is only part of what Red Paw does.
Red Paw, which runs on donations, provides care for most animals for around 60 days.
"Food, cat litter, bowls, medicine, whatever they need," said Leary.
For Leary, helping families and their pets is what her work is all about.
