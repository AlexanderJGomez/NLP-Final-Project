(CNN) -- So it looks like President Obama got the message.
Both substantively and stylistically, Romney operated in Obama's shadow in this match, second banana to the president's leading man.
Romney may believe this assertiveness makes him look strong and in command.
The town hall debate was a particularly inappropriate setting for Romney to display this side of himself.
After the president brought up his rival's overseas investments, Romney cited Obama's own holdings: "Have you looked at your pension?"
Before this debate, I wondered whether Obama would acknowledge the elephant in the room: his shoddy performance in Round 1.
