(CNN) -- If the U.S. election race conjures up images of mud flying through the air for many Japanese, campaigning politicians in the Land of the Rising Sun evoke visions of a more white-gloved affair.
The notion that American campaigning is a complicated "show" was mentioned repeatedly by the people I spoke to, and Twitter is filled with Japanese observers likening U.S. politics to "watching a movie".
Religion simply isn't as loud a voice in Japanese politics as it is in the American election race.
Japanese candidates park their cars at intersections with heavy foot traffic and make speeches with microphones plugged into portable amps in front of some of the busiest train stations in the world.
Many Japanese are intrigued by the idea of the U.S. candidates' debates.
Many Japanese people say that they don't fully understand the U.S. election system, and I am quick to reassure them that many of us Americans wouldn't want to be tested on it, either.
Since the campaign season is so short, they often look for candidates who will have good name recognition.
Even if the American election itself seems inscrutable to Japanese voters, the result -- a leader who is in office for at least four years -- looks good.
Japan will be looking at what parts of the U.S. system it might want to draw from and what it could improve.
