The Texas Attorney General's office, in a news release Friday, said the state expects "its case to be consolidated" with others -- all of them intent on recouping "damages associated with harm caused to the Gulf."
The lawsuit also asks for civil penalties for every barrel as well as every day that oil was discharged into the Gulf.
In November, Attorney General Eric Holder announced that BP will plead guilty to manslaughter charges stemming from the explosion and the spill.
With the exception of seafood claims, there is no cap on the amount BP will pay to those who agree to the settlement.
