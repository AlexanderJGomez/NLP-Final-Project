Some of the thousands who fled into the bush have begun to return to Pibor, said Barnaba Benjamin, South Sudan's minister of information and broadcasting.
The nonprofit group Medecins sans Frontieres, also known as Doctors Without Borders, was still trying Monday to reach 117 of its 130 aid workers who fled into the bush along with the populations of Pibor and Lukangol before the attack, said Sarathy Rajendran, head of the group's South Sudan mission.
She similarly said that the town of Pibor is secure now, though the situation there remains fluid.
The violence in Jonglei state is the latest to rock South Sudan, which officially gained its statehood in July after separating from the north.
