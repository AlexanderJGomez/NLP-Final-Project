LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's autopsy is done, but its release is on hold, as is the court case over the iconic singer's estate.
The court case about Jackson's estate also has been stalled.
The judge has already approved a contract to allow Columbia Pictures to use video that AEG Live shot of Jackson's last rehearsals for a documentary due out this fall.
Katherine Jackson and Jackson's three children are the main beneficiaries of the estate, which is controlled by Jackson's former lawyer, John Branca, and longtime Jackson friend and music executive John McClain.
Katherine Jackson was appointed last week as the guardian for the children, but she was not made the guardian for their interest in her son's estate.
