The University of North Carolina failed some of its students "for years" by allowing them to take classes that did not match its own academic standards, Chancellor Carol Folt has admitted.
CNN has asked UNC Chapel Hill for the number of students who were specially admitted because they did not meet the usual academic standards and who majored in or took the classes now acknowledged as fake.
UNC told CNN last year it has a program that alerts it if too many athletes are enrolled in a single class, but it's not yet clear whether this is different.
The NCAA told CNN on Monday it won't comment on whether the university will take a second look.
