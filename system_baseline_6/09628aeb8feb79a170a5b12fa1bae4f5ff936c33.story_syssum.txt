Chief of Naval Operations Jonathan Greenert was at his residence at the Yard on Monday and was evacuated, CNN's Barbara Starr said.
The Yard includes the headquarters for the Naval Historical Center and the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps, among others.
Vandroff added that he was very happy that his staff remained calm, though they were scared as they hunkered down in a conference room.
The Yard was created in 1799 by an act of Congress, the Naval History and Heritage Command says.
Amid World War I, the Yard made Navy ordnance, including the 14-inch naval railway guns used in France in the war.
