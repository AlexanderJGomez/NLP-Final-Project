2:15 a.m. Jack (1 month) is sleeping between me and my wife because this way she can nurse while she dozes.
We're trying to get Jack (9 months) to sleep through the night.
Lying next to his crib didn't work -- Jack kept crying, waking both of us.
I have to get up to drive my wife to New York, then turn around and drive back home with Jack, all on about three hours of sleep.
10:11 p.m. Jack (15 months and a week) is in his crib, alone and asleep.
11:21 p.m. Jack (18 months and a week) is no longer sick, but now he's back in our bed, every night.
Jack (2 years) is nestled into his mother's chest, perpendicular to us, with his feet lodged against my throat, trying to push me off the bed.
I pull the covers up.
2:15 p.m.
I am lying in the new twin bed we bought Jack (4 1/4 years), to show him how it works.
We told Jack that on his fifth birthday he'd have to sleep in his own bed, because that's what big boys do, and he agreed.
I get back into bed with my wife and snuggle up next to her.
Hearing a noise, my wife and I go upstairs to check on Jack (6).
His breath is still sweet and milky on my cheek.
