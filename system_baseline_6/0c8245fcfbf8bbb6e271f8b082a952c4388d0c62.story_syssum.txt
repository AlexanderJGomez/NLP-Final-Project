At the time she was playing for the U.S. National Team and had begun feeling extremely fatigued; regular training sessions left her with joint pain and muscle soreness.
She went public with her lupus diagnosis in April 2012 and is now working with the Lupus Foundation of America to create awareness about this chronic autoimmune disease that affects 1.5 million people in the U.S.
I deal with fatigue and joint pain just like with lupus, but it also affects my skin, my eyes and my mouth.
Now add in a disease where my main symptoms are extreme fatigue and joint pain, and that standard becomes a little bit more difficult to maintain.
The medicine I am on now helps control the amount of "flare-ups" I may have, as well as control the amount of inflammation in my body.
The best solution for me is, if I start to feel more fatigued than normal, I will train lighter that day or even just take it off completely.
I understand that people with lupus and/or Sjogren's range from mild to severe and no two people are alike in their struggle with either of these diseases.
As I am nearing the tail end of my career, I have realized it is a lot more important to use my voice to help bring awareness to lupus and Sjogren's.
If I can help spread the word about what lupus or Sjogren's is and what the symptoms are, maybe I can help get people in to visit a doctor sooner.
My hamstring healed and I was able to start in the final game and help my team to an Olympic gold medal.
