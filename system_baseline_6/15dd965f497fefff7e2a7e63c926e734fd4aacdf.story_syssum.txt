Thank you.
Stuff I could eat: Brown rice or wild rice, plain chicken or lamb, honey, apple, melon, banana, leafy green salads (no dressing), plain low-fat yogurt, celery, spinach, broccoli, corn, sweet potato pear, papaya, apricot, grilled fish, turkey, wholegrain muffin or bagel, bran, almonds, low-fat milk, wholegrain pasta.
Grilled lamb with salt, pepper and honey -- white sauce over it, (made with wholewheat flour, milk and seasoning).
Sweet tooth: Baked bananas, stewed apple or pear, plain low fat yogurt with fruit, pomegranate, dates, cantaloupe, fruit salad, whole grain, apricots and prunes.
I imagined making a deal with my psoriasis, I would maintain the diet, and it, in turn would go away.
The clinic is now closed.
For more information on psoriasis, Verjee suggests visiting the National Psoriasis Foundation (U.S), Psoriasis Association (UK) or Africa Psoriasis Organization (Kenya).
Medical advice is that sufferers work with their doctors to establish a treatment plan.
