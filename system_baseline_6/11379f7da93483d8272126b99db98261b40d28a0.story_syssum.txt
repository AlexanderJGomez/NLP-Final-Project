(CNN) -- Colin Ferguson and the Syfy channel have built a loyal following for the show "Eureka," now in its fourth season.
Ferguson: Yes, absolutely, well being in CNN right now, I'm jonesing to live at the epicenter of something.
Ferguson: Being the lead of the show is more difficult, it's harder on my body, it's more strenuous, it's harder on my mind but it's rewarding in a day to day manner, but what I love about being the director is you get to protect the story for longer, so you can take all these talents you know, all the people you work with and you get to make sure they get to do all they can do.
Ferguson: I improvise on a regular basis on the show, so I get to do it in that format.
