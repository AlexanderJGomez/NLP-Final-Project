Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova were released about two months before their prison sentences were due to end.
But Tolokonnikova, released from a Siberian facility on Monday, told CNN she felt that the amnesty was a publicity stunt to bolster the government's image before it hosts the Winter Olympics in February.
Tolokonnikova went on a hunger strike during her prison term to protest what she said were poor conditions at a Mordovian prison.
Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova have young children and therefore qualified for the amnesty, Russian media reported.
He was due for release next year.
