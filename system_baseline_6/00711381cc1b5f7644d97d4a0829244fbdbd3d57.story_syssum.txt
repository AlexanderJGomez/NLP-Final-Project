Turbulence struck the flight, from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Houston, Texas, unexpectedly, injuring seven passengers badly enough to require hospitalization after the pilot diverted the flight to Miami, Florida.
Police said 26 passengers were injured, four seriously.

"The majority of injuries actually happen to flight attendants," Dorr said.
Passengers said most of those injured were not wearing seat belts.
No passengers were reported seriously injured in turbulence incidents in 2008, and five flight attendants -- down from a high of 19 in 2003 -- received serious injuries, according to the FAA.
