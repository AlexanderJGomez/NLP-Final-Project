Madonna, that is.
For those of you keeping score, that's more than Elvis, more than The Beatles.
That's not "over," that's now.
The two pop icons released debut albums within two years of each other, Madonna in 1983 and Houston in 1985.
And that, in a nutshell, is why Madonna is who she is.
"Seriously... like your Madonna?"
But then again, it wouldn't be Madonna if a song like that was.
