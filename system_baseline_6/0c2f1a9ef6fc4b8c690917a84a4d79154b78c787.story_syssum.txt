"He woke up in the middle of the night and started screaming and told everyone to run out of the house," said Chris Dronett, Shane Dronett's wife.
"There is evidence of CTE in his brain making him yet another former NFL player who had definite CTE," said Chris Nowinski, co-director of the traumatic encephalopathy center.
"He thought the guy was shaking the ice weird or something, and he took him down in the restaurant," added Chris.
Researchers believe that the battering Shane Dronett took as an NFL lineman -- and the hits he accumulated over two decades of playing -- might explain his brain's deterioration.
"Shane didn't come out of games because he always said NFL players are so expendable," said Chris.
Shane played through dizzying hits.
Shane's neurosurgeon said that he most likely had the tumor all his life and that the benign growth could not explain his behavior, Chris said.
"I saw the gun, and I ran out the front door," said Chris.
"He was always so full of life," said Chris.
I didn't know other players were going through this type of stuff," said Chris.
Chris says that if she could speak directly to players, "I would tell them what I went through, what Shane went through and what other people I know have gone through and then let them make that decision.
