(CNN) -- The lawyer for a U.S. man being held in Aruba in connection with the case of a missing American woman urged authorities on Sunday to release his client.
This weekend, authorities said that crews searching for the missing woman have looked in Aruban phosphate mines.
"In anticipation of any possible reason of prolongation of the client's detention, we can state that no felony has been committed by him," Lopez said in his Sunday statement.
"The Department of Justice at this time does not have any basis to request prolongation of his detention."
