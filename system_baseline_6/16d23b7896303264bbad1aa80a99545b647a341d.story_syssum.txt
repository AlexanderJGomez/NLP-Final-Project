Every girl should have the right to that life, but there are millions of girls in my country who are not so fortunate and are subjected to child marriage.
It is estimated that two-thirds of Bangladeshi girls are married before the age of 18.
For the past three years I have lost at least two friends to early marriages at an age where I didn't even know what marriage was.
If a girl can feed her family, it will help parents rethink the idea that their daughters are a burden.
Building awareness through films like "Girl Rising" that pressure governments to implement laws against child marriage and educating communities like World Vision does in Bangladesh.
I am a part of World Vision's child forum and just this year we have used our voices to stop three child marriages in our community.
My hope is that my friends in Bangladesh and girls around the world will get to chase their dreams, too.
