In a daring operation worthy of a movie, three men escaped from a Canadian jail by helicopter, prompting a massive manhunt, authorities said.
In March 2013, two men posing as tourists commandeered a helicopter from a Canadian tour company, ordered the pilot to fly over a detention center near Montreal, hoisted two inmates into the hovering aircraft using cables -- and zipped away.
Last year, another prison escape in Greece tried to use the same tactic.
In 1971, Joel David Kaplan escaped from a Mexican jail aboard a helicopter.
