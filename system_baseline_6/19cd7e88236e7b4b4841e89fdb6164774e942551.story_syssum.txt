Timothy P. O'Neill says there are striking similarities in the backgrounds of the Supreme Court justices.
Many commentators have noted that this is the first Supreme Court in American history in which every justice has come from exactly the same job: judge on the U.S.
For the first time in American history, eight of the nine justices attended one of only two law schools: Harvard or Yale.
Yet it has been almost 30 years since a justice has been confirmed who was not then a federal appellate judge.
The Court decided 72 cases.
The best example of how there is no single "judge's answer" to Supreme Court issues can be found in the eight death penalty cases decided during the 2006 term.
Looking for a single "judge's answer" to an issue before the Supreme Court is usually futile.
We should welcome, and not irrationally restrict, the variety of experience that can be brought to Supreme Court decision-making.
