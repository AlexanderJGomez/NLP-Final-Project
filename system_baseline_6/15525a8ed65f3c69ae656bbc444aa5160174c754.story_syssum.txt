I've been a huge supporter of "The Imitation Game" from before its premiere and see it as this year's best film because, as I said, it so poignantly reminds us that we cannot ignore history.
"The Imitation Game" and efforts inspired by it, like Matt's petition, guarantee that Turing and men like him won't ever be forgotten.
