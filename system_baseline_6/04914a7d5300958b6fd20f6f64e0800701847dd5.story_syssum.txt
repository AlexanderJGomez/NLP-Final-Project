(CNN) -- An atheist sign criticizing Christianity that was erected alongside a Nativity scene was taken from the Legislative Building in Olympia, Washington, on Friday and later found in a ditch.
The sign, which was at the Legislative Building at 6:30 a.m. PT, was gone by 7:30 a.m., Gaylor said.
Gaylor said that police are checking security cameras pointed at the building's entrances and exits to see if they can see anyone stealing the sign.
Barker said the display is especially important given that 25 percent of Washington state residents are unaffiliated with religion or do not believe in God.
He said if anything, it's the Nativity scene that is the intrusion.
the advertisement asks.
That ad has caused the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority to field hundreds of complaints, the group said, but it has heard just as much positive feedback, said Fred Edwords, the association's spokesman.
The ad campaign, Edwords said, is to make people think.
The governor's office told The Seattle Times it received more than 200 calls an hour afterward.
The atheist message was never intended to attack anyone, Barker said.
-- we respond that we kind of feel that the Christian message is the hate message," he said.
