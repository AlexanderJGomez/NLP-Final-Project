Powell was convicted in the 1999 murder of Stacie Reed and the rape of her 14-year-old sister in their Manassas, Virginia, family home.
Powell claimed double jeopardy after state prosecutors put him on trial for a second time in the killing.
The sexual assault and attempted murder of Stacie's younger sister was upheld, and Powell was given a long prison sentence.
"Since I have already been indicted on first degree murder and the Va. Supreme Court said that I can't be charged with capital murder again, I figured I would tell you the rest of what happened on Jan. 29, 1999, to show you how stupid all of y'all ... are," wrote Powell, who is white.
With this firsthand account from Powell, he was indicted again and charged with murder and attempted rape of Stacie -- a capital-eligible crime.
The Supreme Court appeal is Powell v. Kelly (09-21).
