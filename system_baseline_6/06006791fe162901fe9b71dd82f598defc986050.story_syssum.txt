As the world awaits the impending birth of William and Kate's second baby, potential names have become the topic of rampant speculation and heated debate.
In a recent Today Show poll, 32% of Americans predicted the name was a shoo-in, and in the UK the bookies' odds of a baby named after her late grandmother change almost daily as Diana becomes an increasingly popular choice.
That said, in the event the couple do welcome a baby girl, I would hope that they do not opt to name her Diana.
Diana's name conjures up both positive and negative responses the world over, and whichever side of the fence you're on, the moniker seems to me an almighty burden for a newborn baby to carry.
I still miss Diana.
Diana's tragic, untimely death and iconic status will ensure her memory is kept alive for generations to come.
