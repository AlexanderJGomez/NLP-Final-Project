Martin, such reactions to "The Red Wedding" are nothing new.
I killed Ned because everybody thinks he's the hero and that, sure, he's going to get into trouble, but then he'll somehow get out of it.
The next predictable thing is to think his eldest son is going to rise up and avenge his father.
So the entire book was done and there was still that one chapter left.
I try to make the readers feel they've lived the events of the book.
Robb wasn't one of your "viewpoint characters" in the books and Catelyn wasn't really a beloved personality.
There's also secondary characters killed.
It's not just two people.
And she does.
It's going to be hard for me to watch it [on the show].
People read books for different reasons.
And you read that certain kind of fiction where the guy will always get the girl and the good guys win and it reaffirms to you that life is fair.
So I'm not dismissive of people who want that.
It's like you're smacking the reader upside the head for being so dense â€” "Of course they're not going to follow that silly rule ALL the time!"
The Red Wedding is based on a couple real events from Scottish history.
The king of Scotland was fighting the Black Douglas clan.
They brought out a covered plate and put it in front of the Earl and revealed it was the head of a black boar â€” the symbol of death.
No matter how much I make up, there's stuff in history that's just as bad, or worse.
