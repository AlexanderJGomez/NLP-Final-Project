(CNN)Most airline pilots have an above average ability to compartmentalize personal problems.
As the world learns more about Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot on Germanwings Flight 9525, it is readily apparent that this young man had psychiatric issues far beyond clinical depression.
Considering the hoops Lubitz had to jump through to have established himself as a Germanwings co-pilot, it's curious to me how the red flags of his illness were missed.
Glider flying is one of the purest forms of aviation.
Second, Lubitz had to compete successfully in a selection process just to have the opportunity to train through Lufthansa's flight program, a requirement of Germanwings employment.
The purpose of an MPL is to funnel airline pilot candidates having little or no flight time into the right seat as first officers.
Using both actual flight experience in a single-engine airplane and simulator time, the student receives about 250 hours of training.
According to reports, Lubitz took a leave from his training -- a very untypical behavior.
Over the course of a career, an airline pilot spends thousands of hours sharing the confined space of the cockpit with colleagues.
Depending upon a pilot's monthly flight time, salary for pilots can be as much as 20% lower than the mainline carrier.
Perhaps enough of a disparity existed for Germanwings pilots such that medical leave benefits would not have covered Lubitz's absence.
