The display was the work of New York artist Tenzing Rigdol, 29, who clandestinely trucked in sacks containing 22 tons of dirt from Tibet to Dharamsala to construct his installation.
The only wish his father had was to see Tibet one more time.
"And many more who have never been to Tibet."
"He was saying he had this idea to transport a large amount of soil from Tibet," Dorjee said.
Rigdol carried with him some of the Tibetan dirt.
"It was very exciting," said Tenzing Geche, 22, a monk who was a baby when his family left Tibet.
"Today, (Rigdol) made it a little bit possible," Tfuengue said.
But when it closes, Tibetan exiles will be allowed to take some of the dirt with them, a reminder always of the land they long to see.
