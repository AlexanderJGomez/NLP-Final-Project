Two people died during the ceremony at Angel Valley Retreat Center.
Ray also encouraged participants to hydrate throughout the retreat and warned them the sweat lodge would be very hot, his attorney has said.
While they were not prevented from leaving, participants have said they were encouraged to wait until the breaks between rounds.
Ray had conducted the Spiritual Warrior Retreat for six years at a cost of about $10,000 to participants.
Prosecutors maintain that Ray psychologically pressured participants to remain in the lodge even when they weren't feeling well, contributing to their deaths.
