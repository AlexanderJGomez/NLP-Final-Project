(CNN) -- On January 26, a ruling by the Librarian of Congress made unlocking a cell phone for use on other carriers illegal under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998.
I teamed up with Sina Khanifar, an entrepreneur whose company had been shut down for unlocking phones, and we led an advocacy effort for a White House petition.
The White House also came out in support of finding legislative fixes to solve this problem.
Other members of Congress are also coming out in favor.
Use of these technologies has to be approved for personal use every three years by the Librarian of Congress -- but even when approved -- developing, trafficking and selling the technologies is still illegal.
Currently, there is an exception for personal jailbreaking (allowing individuals to install unapproved applications by altering the phone's operating system), but developing, selling, trafficking or discussing the underlying technology is still illegal and there are no personal exceptions for tablets or other devices.
This technology should be made permanently lawful for personal use, creation, trafficking and selling.
A free society shouldn't have to petition its government every three years to allow access to technologies that are ordinary and commonplace.
Congress must act to legalize cellphone unlocking substantively, but then it must legalize other technologies that have been banned without explanation.
