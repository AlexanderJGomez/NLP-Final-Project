Electronics makers use CES as a platform to show the types of products they plan to release in the coming year.
And Microsoft, which will deliver its 14th CES presentation Monday, announced recently it will not have a booth or participate in the keynotes after this year's event.
At CES, tech companies will showcase plenty of phones with that software, but the touchscreen tablets with Android 4 will be prevalent.
Analysts expect to see a bevy of Windows 8 tablets at CES.
Microsoft will enable this anti-disc computer with the application store in Windows 8.
TVs have long been the centerpiece of CES and of the consumer electronics industry as a whole.
Google has reportedly invested more in its TV platform, which should be evident at CES.
Don't expect Apple to show up at CES with a big screen though.
And since last CES, Pandora has more than doubled the number of cars that tap into its streaming radio service, Pandora founder Tim Westergren said in a phone interview.
"It's no longer an optional part of the business."
"It's the only trade show I attend all year," she said.
