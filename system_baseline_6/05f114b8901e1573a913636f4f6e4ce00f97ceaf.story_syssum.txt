Earlier Thursday, the Orleans Parish district attorney's office in Louisiana had said Sharper, 38, and Erik Nunez, 26, each face two counts of aggravated rape.
Last week, Sharper pleaded not guilty to the California charges, which included two counts of rape by use of drugs.
Las Vegas police said Friday that "an active and ongoing investigation surrounding Darren Sharper" was being conducted by the department's sexual assault unit.
In addition, a Florida woman last month filed a sexual battery complaint in Miami Beach against Sharper relating to a 2012 incident, a police report said.
