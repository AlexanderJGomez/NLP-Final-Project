Three months earlier, over dinner, I'd learned about a doctor in Sudan's Nuba mountains, Dr. Tom Catena, who was treating thousands of people -- many of them children -- who'd had limbs blown off in the Sudanese government's bombing raids.
But when I got home and looked up Dr. Catena, I read about one of the patients he'd treated: Daniel -- a 12-year-old boy who, in attempting to protect himself from an aerial attack, wrapped his arms around a tree.
There was no way I could get my head around that.
But I could help one.
The crash course done, and just three short months after that initial dinner, I found myself in Yida -- a desolate, dusty refugee camp in South Sudan -- a home to 70,000 hungry and desperate people, driven from their homes by bombing campaigns and unimaginable horrors.
Daniel.
Every time I got frustrated, or something wasn't working right, I just had to look over at Daniel and nothing else mattered.
He turned back, looked at the small crowd that had gathered around him, broke into the biggest grin you'd ever seen, then went back in for more.
Just one step.
Just one person.
We talked about how many limbs we wanted to make, how many people we wanted to help, how many arms we wanted to have done by the time I return.
