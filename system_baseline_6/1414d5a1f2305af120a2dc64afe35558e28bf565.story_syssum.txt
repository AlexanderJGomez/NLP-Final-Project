But Heene, in an interview airing Friday, told CNN's Larry King he pleaded guilty to save his wife, Mayumi, from being deported to Japan.
Mayumi Heene pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of false reporting to authorities in the incident involving the couple's 6-year-old son, Falcon.
Mayumi Heene called 911 and said Falcon was inside the craft.
"You know, after I saw him in and out of this craft, and Bradford [Falcon's brother] told me that he went inside, at first I didn't believe Bradford," Heene told King.
"No, no, no.
"You guys said we did this for the show," Falcon said in the interview, when his father asked him why he had not come out from hiding when his parents were looking for him.
I asked Falcon after that, I asked him -- I said, 'Why did you say that?
But, he said, his son was not implying the family staged the incident for a reality show.
