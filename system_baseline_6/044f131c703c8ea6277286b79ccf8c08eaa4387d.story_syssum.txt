(CNN) -- The president of Ukraine's top football club has warned six of its players who have gone AWOL they will "suffer" if they don't return to the conflict-torn country.
"Hopefully, the mind and heart will prevail over misunderstanding, and the players will not follow temptation and fear," said the Shakhtar president.
"Despite the fact that we will be weakened in the Super Cup match against Dynamo Kyiv, our players will do their best to make the game hard for our opponents," added Akhmetov.
Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk will play in the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League while Chornomorets Odessa are in the Europa League.
