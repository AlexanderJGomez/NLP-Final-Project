"The whole bridge from one side of the Mississippi to the other just completely gave way, fell all the way down," survivor Gary Babineau told CNN.
"I realized there was a school bus right next to me, and me and a couple of other guys went over and started lifting the kids off the bridge.
Occasionally, a pickup truck with a medic inside would drive to get an injured person and bring him back up even ground, Hink told CNN.
"I could see the whole bridge as it was going down, as it was falling," Babineau said.
"So I stayed in my car until the cars quit falling for a second, then I got out real quick, ran in front of my truck -- because behind my truck was just a hole -- and I helped a woman off of the bridge with me.
Babineau said he had no rescue training.
Babineau told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune: "On the way down, I thought I was dead.
After the bridge settled and his car remained upright, "I just put in park, turned the key off and said, 'Oh, I'm alive,' " he said.
