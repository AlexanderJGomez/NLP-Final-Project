(CNN) -- Each Father's Day, I thank my father for giving me life -- twice -- the first time in the traditional sense and the second when he donated his kidney to me.
Many people are not as fortunate as I was.
I believe that many more people would do what my father did for me if they knew more about the transplant process and outcomes.
Every day I remind myself what a precious gift my father has given me.
And I plan on giving that gift to him for many Father's Days to come.
