(CNN) -- Japan won the Women's World Cup for the first time on Sunday, denying the United States a record third title after twice coming from behind in the final and then winning a penalty shootout in Germany.
"I truly believe that something bigger was pulling for this team."
The U.S. had last reached the final at home in 1999, winning the tournament for the second time after triumphing in the inaugural event in China eight years before then.
The U.S. made the worst possible start to the shootout when Kaihori blocked Shannon Boxx's attempt with her trailing leg, then Miyama put Japan 1-0 ahead.
"We made just a couple of mistakes.
"We have some very good players on the team and that is why we won the final.
"I just got the highest hopes that this great team, which has shown such resilience, will be coming back and winning for the U.S.," Clinton told reporters, adding that she plans to watch the game from Greece.
The Japanese players had won over their share of fans, with Solo of the U.S. team calling them "the sentimental favorites" for helping to lift the spirits of their devastated nation.
