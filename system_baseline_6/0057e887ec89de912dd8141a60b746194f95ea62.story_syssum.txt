HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- In the decade since the 1997 handover of Hong Kong to China, local movie-makers have faced daunting changes in the industry.
By 1997, that number dropped to 85 films grossing $69 million, according to the Hong Kong, Kowloon and New Territories Motion Picture Industry Association (MPIA).
The new Chinese market has translated into an emphasis in contrasts of Hong Kong-made films, says film archivist Cheng.
In 2006, Hong Kong closed five small cinemas and re-opened one multiplex.
Tim Youngs, Hong Kong consultant for Italy's Far East Film Festival, says changing tastes among Hong Kong movie-goers has also affected the industry.
How is South Korea's film industry different from its Hong Kong counterpart?
"Around 1997, like lots of Hong Kong people, I kind of lost myself," says independent film-maker Chan Wing-chiu.
Many Chinese say that now that Hong Kong is part of China, Hong Kong people must learn Putonghua.
Because our language, our culture, our values, our way of thinking are different.
After 1997, we lost the confidence to be Hong Kong people."
