Until the end of August, all foreigners are expected to always have on them a valid passport, visa and resident permit, as stipulated by an announcement on Peaceful Beijing, the official Beijing Public Security Bureau account on popular Chinese micro-blogging site Sina Weibo.
Beijing police announced on Thursday that the city's friendly attitude toward foreigners has not changed.
It has gone from curiosity to hostility," commented Park.
These events will make his decision easier, he said.
Beijing police revealed the foreigner in the video to be a Briton on a tourist visa.
When Beijing resident Mandy Zhang's mother caught wind of the video, she called her 26-year-old daughter and asked her not to visit places that foreigners frequent.
According to statistics provided by the city government, Beijing is home to about 120,000 foreigners.
