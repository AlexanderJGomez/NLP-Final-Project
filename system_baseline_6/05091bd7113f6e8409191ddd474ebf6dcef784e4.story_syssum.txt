Studies have indicated that long-term cell phone use may be associated with brain cancer, according to Dr. Ronald Herberman, director of the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, and Dr. David Carpenter, director of Institute for Health and the Environment at University of Albany.
The evidence for the connection between cell phones and cancer is inconclusive and more research is needed, he said.
Interphone, a series of multinational studies on the risk of cancer from cell phones, has not found an increase in tumors associated with the first 10 years of mobile phone use, he said.
Carpenter and Herberman testified that the risk of brain cancer for children is far greater than for adults.
But the SAR standard reflects a biological response to cell phone radio frequency energy heating tissue, Kucinich said.
Herberman had issued a warning to physicians, scientists, and staff at the University of Pittsburgh in July advising them to limit cell phone use because of the possible risk of cancer.
She believes the tumor is the result of cell phone use.
