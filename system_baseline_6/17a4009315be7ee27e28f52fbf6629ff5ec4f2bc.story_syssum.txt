(CNN)Shortly after the 10th anniversary of the Iraq War, paralyzed veteran Tomas Young spoke with me about why he intended to end his life.
He said he would refuse his feeding tube and allow himself to die.
Former television host Phil Donahue, co-director and executive producer of "Body of War," said Wednesday that Tomas and Claudia made a remarkable love story.
On Monday, Young died at home in Seattle.
Young had moved with his wife to Portland, Oregon, where, as he stated in his Twitter profile, he was a "happily married man who's happy to live in a medical maryjane state."
And she did.
Young was a self-avowed atheist, but somehow I could feel him smiling down at his friends, glad that they were remembering him as a nice guy.
