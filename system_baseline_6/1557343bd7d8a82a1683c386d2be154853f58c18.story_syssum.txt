"I don't want to characterize how everybody else feels about what I said, but I think it was a good opening to the conversation," Paul said in an interview set to air Friday.
I think the shooting has brought this to the surface, but there's a sense of unease in the country," Paul told Blitzer.
Asked by Blitzer if Paul thinks he could garner African American support in a run for president, Paul said Republicans "won't ever win again" unless they start competing for minority voters.
"We've got no business having no-knock raids at one in the morning, scaring the bejeezus out of people and getting them frightened," he said.
Paul argued earlier this week in an interview that he was "just a physician in a small town" at the time of his comments.
John Gaskin III, spokesman for St. Louis County NAACP, said in a statement that Paul had called the local leaders to have a meeting.
