I say mysterious because the business of yacht building is full of rumors and speculation until the ship is seen leaving the sheds of the family-owned builders, whether in Amsterdam, Hamburg or Bremen.
Aly said the bigger yacht side of the business is coming back faster than the smaller side.
His famed Lurssen shipyard in Bremen will soon unleash the world's longest mega yacht, codenamed Project Azzam.
We could ask one of the owners, but they tend to like the yacht to do the talking.
And they have his.
And de Vries has something new and special coming out of the shed soon.
With the business of big yachts coming back, it's possible other builders might want to get in on the action.
At a time that Europe is very worried about jobs, the uptick in interest for mega yachts should be looked at in a positive light, even if news reports will soon be filled with gossip (and jealousy?)
