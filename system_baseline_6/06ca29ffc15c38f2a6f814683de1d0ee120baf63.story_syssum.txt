Washington (CNN) -- When you consider the array of public men who have been forced, in one way or another, to come clean on their bad behavior, the list is not insubstantial: a president (Bill Clinton), presidential candidates (John Edwards, Gary Hart), governors (Mark Sanford, Eliot Spitzer), senators (John Ensign, David Vitter).
Or both.
But here's the rub: Cain also tells us that the National Restaurant Association investigated the charges against him and found them to be "baseless."
And there's another plus: The partisans and the interest groups will have to start dealing with the facts.
Feminist groups are outraged by the charges against Cain and lots of Republican partisans are defending him, choosing to level their scrutiny on the women instead.
Then take a turn, and start decrying "anonymous" charges.
And the fact that Hillary was right about those who were "out to get" Clinton does not mean he was in the clear.
The bar may be set low for the politicians, but the public somehow manages to rise above it.
