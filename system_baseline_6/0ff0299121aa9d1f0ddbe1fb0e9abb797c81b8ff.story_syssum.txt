Maybe Twitter can tell us.
To demonstrate the unique power of Twitter data, our research group at Northeastern University and Harvard Medical School recently began a study to infer the mood of Twitter users in the United States from their public tweets.
Never before have academic researchers had access to this much real-time public information about what people are thinking and saying.
Because most users leave their tweets public, Twitter represents an unprecedented opportunity.
Unlike many existing tools, such as surveys and polls, researchers cannot ask a question of the Twitter users directly; instead, researchers must determine whether the question is one that the Twitter data can answer.
From a scientific standpoint, Twitter data can shed light on how information spreads through society.
