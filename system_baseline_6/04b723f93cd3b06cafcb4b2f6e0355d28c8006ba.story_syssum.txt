Christopher Coleman sits in the back of a police car after his arrest Tuesday in the slayings of his wife and two sons.
Coleman said he was calling the house to make sure the boys were waking up for school, Connor said.
The message in the Coleman home was written in paint of a similar color, the article said.
Neither Coleman nor his attorneys have commented on that report, the Post-Dispatch said.
