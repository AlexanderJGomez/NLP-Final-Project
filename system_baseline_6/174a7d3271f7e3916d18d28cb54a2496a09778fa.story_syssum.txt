So, maybe genetics explain my inappropriate hilarity when I heard that the U.S. House killed the Violence Against Women Act this week -- or at least stood by and did nothing while it died.
This trend came to a sickening halt this week when the Senate sought to extend critical protections to immigrant and Native American women, as well as LGBT people.
The need is clear: A full third of Native American women will be raped in their lifetimes; an even higher number will experience physical and emotional abuse.
These same husbands often threaten deportation and separation from children if their wives seek help or report abuse.
These reforms seem like no-brainers in the face of so many brutalized women.
More protections for these immigrant women would cost Spivack's company a lot of money.
