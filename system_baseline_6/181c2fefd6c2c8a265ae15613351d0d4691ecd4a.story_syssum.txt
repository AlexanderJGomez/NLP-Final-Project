Soon, those photos spread on social media, with Twitter users mimicking her passed-out pose and adding the hashtag #jadapose.
Jada chose to show her face with the support of her mother, Sukiedia.
The teen began speaking to local and national media about the incident and took a photo with the hashtag #iamjada to reveal the real person behind the viral photos.
"With the case of Jada, the very technology that was used to make matters worse was used to improve matters," said Stephen Balkam, who has a teenage daughter and is CEO of the Family Online Safety Institute.
Even as public support for Jada is swelling, it's clear that online abuse isn't going away anytime soon.
More teens are pushing back at this meme-ification of violence by speaking up and creating communities of kindness.

Having a dialogue with kids around acceptable online behavior can begin by talking about events in the news, such as #iamJada, or at school.
Parents "should encourage their kids to be up-standers and not bystanders when they see something as negative as what was happening to Jada," Balkam said.
