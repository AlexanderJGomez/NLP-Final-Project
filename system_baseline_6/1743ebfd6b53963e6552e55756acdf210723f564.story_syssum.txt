Racing in a global championship has helped Hamilton gain fame across international borders.

Thomas, who is originally from Guyana in South America, has also been galvanizing global support for Hamilton through social media for the last five years.

Hamilton has also always worn his heart on his sleeve against a backdrop of fierce racing rivalry -- usually with his teammates --- and an on-off romance with Scherzinger.

"Lewis is genuinely indebted to his fans," said Roope.
