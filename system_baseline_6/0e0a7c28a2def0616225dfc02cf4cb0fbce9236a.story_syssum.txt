Last year, a French court sentenced Noriega to seven years in prison for money laundering.
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton cleared the way for Noriega to be sent to France in April 2010 after he spent 20 years in a U.S. federal prison.
Noriega and his attorneys had argued the United States was violating the Geneva Convention by not sending him back to Panama, where he was seized by U.S. troops after the United States invaded that country in 1989 in Operation Nifty Package.
While in U.S. custody, Noriega suffered from prostate cancer and had a stroke.
