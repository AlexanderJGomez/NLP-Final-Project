It is September 2003, and I just found out my daughter is going to be born with Down Syndrome.
Does it really matter what kind of shoes she has on?
It doesn't.
She rocked those shoes for a good couple of months.
Had she not been born with Down Syndrome I don't think I would be as good a person as I am now.
Jaylin is such a special child.
She will keep doing what she loves, in great shoes, just to make me happy.
