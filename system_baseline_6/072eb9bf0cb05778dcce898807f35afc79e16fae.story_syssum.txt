As a part of this initiative, in December FIS convened a panel of six top Alpine competitors, including Didier Cuche, Scott Macartney, and Svindal, to drill down on how to make racing safer.

FIS works closely with the Vancouver Organizing Committee to design the Alpine courses at the Olympics, but ultimately, it's VANOC that sets them  -- save the downhill, which FIS still oversees; it's an old, complicated tradition.
