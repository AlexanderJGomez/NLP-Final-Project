(Parenting.com) -- I am a 38-year-old father of two little boys living in Portland, Oregon, and I like my circumcised penis.
That's it.
Besides, my boys are lucky enough to be able to bathe in clean water just about every day.
Either the men were adamant that their son look like them or they just didn't care if they didn't.
I can't help but wonder if the practice of male circumcision, as with female genital mutilation, has something to do with a fear of human sexuality and a desire to control.
I believe that he was solely motivated by pressure to look like his male peers.
Besides, the perception of what a "normal" penis should look like is rapidly changing.
The day will come when one of my boys will want to know why his penis is different than mine.
