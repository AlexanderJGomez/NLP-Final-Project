Los Angeles (CNN) -- Octuplets mom Nadya Suleman faces welfare fraud charges as she's accused of not reporting money earned as a topless dancer and adult film actress.
"I wouldn't even kiss somebody for money," Suleman told CNN's Nischelle Turner.
Suleman dreams of building a business "empire" that will pay for food, shelter and college educations for her 14 children, she told Turner.
Suleman faces up to five years, eight months in prison if convicted, the prosecutor said.
