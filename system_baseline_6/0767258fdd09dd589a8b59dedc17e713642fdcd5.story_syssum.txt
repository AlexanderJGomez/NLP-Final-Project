(Real Simple) -- I live in Chicago, and one of my best friends, Phyllis, lives in San Francisco, so we aren't able to see each other as often as we would like.
"You're going to love this place," I kept saying, and Phyllis, in turn, kept saying, "Oh boy."
Suddenly I remembered that my neighbor Suzie had given me a recipe, saying, "I really liked this, and I think you will, too."
But now Suzie's recipe seemed just right for the occasion, even though neither Phyllis nor I, experienced (and good) cooks both, knew exactly what a "ragout" was.
Then Phyllis lowered the volume on the stereo and came to sit down at the kitchen table.
Phyllis is an extremely honest person, often quite blunt.
She's good at coming up with things you never would have thought of for yourself but instantly love.
I said, "It's not your gift I didn't like -- it was me I wasn't so crazy about."
That person did not look upon planet earth as a particularly good place to be, and in fact had articulated more than once the wish to be done with it all.
And some time after my birthday, I found myself paging through Phyllis's gift.
But the gift Phyllis and I enjoyed that day would never have happened if we had been out in public.
Sometimes that place is the stomach.
And sometimes, the best times, it's both.
