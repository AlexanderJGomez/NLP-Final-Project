In contrast, Espinosa said, there's no evidence linking high crime rates with illegal immigration, as some U.S. politicians have contended.
"This clearly shows that linking immigration directly with violence is not connected," Espinosa said.
According to the FBI, violent crimes reported in Arizona dropped by nearly 1,500 incidents between 2005 and 2008.
Espinosa also addressed comments by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton earlier this month comparing Mexico's drug war to an "insurgency" similar to the problem Colombia faced more than 20 years ago.
Espinosa said some governments in Central America have gotten weaker or don't have the technological capabilities to fight crime, and the drug cartels have taken advantage.
