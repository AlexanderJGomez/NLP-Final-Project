Sherri Goforth, an administrative assistant to state Sen. Diane Black, R-Gallatin, has admitted she sent the e-mail May 28 with the title "Historical Keepsake Photo."
"I want to be sure that everyone understands that the communication was sent without my knowledge," Black said Tuesday afternoon.
"This is an employee who has had a stellar record," Black said.
"I am calling on Sen. Black to reject this racist smear and fire this staffer who, on state government time, on state government computers, using a state government e-mail account, launched this bigoted attack on our president," Forrester said.
Grantham said Goforth told him she felt "very bad about accidentally sending it to the wrong list" of people.
I don't think she should be a part of the people who represent the state of Tennessee," Shaw said.
He said Goforth and Black, as well as Republican Lt. Gov.
Several other black Democratic lawmakers agreed Goforth should quit.
