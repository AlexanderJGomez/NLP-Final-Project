The mother of Brooke Stegall, 5, says opera gave her visually impaired child new confidence.
"These parents work so hard to make this happen," said Anne McComiskey, director of the program.
It helps parents understand what is possible for their visually impaired or blind children.
She says with the infants, it can be even more basic.
McComiskey says the performance reinforces lessons learned during the course of the program.
It's just many of the concepts that we have been teaching them for five years, coming to play in the opera."
McComiskey says that that is one of the goals of the program: to instill a sense of "I can" in the kids.
