(CNN) -- For 70 years, survivors of the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor have captivated listeners with their firsthand accounts, recalling buddies who died in their arms or the glasses worn by a low-flying Japanese pilot.
The Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors, with about 20 chapters, is helping to "carry on the legacy left to us," said national president Louella Large, whose father served at the U.S. Army's Schofield Barracks during the attack.
Large, like others, is concerned that most U.S. schoolchildren today know almost nothing about the surprise attack that pulverized battleships and aircraft stationed at Hawaii.
No Japanese military veterans of the attack are able to be on hand for ceremonies honoring U.S. dead at the World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument.
Those of Lee Soucy, 90, of Plainview, Texas, will be carried Tuesday by a diver to the USS Utah, which also is entombed off Ford Island.
Tora!
Soucy, a pharmacist's mate on the USS Utah, would vividly recall a peaceful Sunday morning that quickly turned to terror, she said.
The family will take part in the sunset ceremony, accompanied by full military honors, Tuesday at the USS Utah memorial.
McCormick said her father spoke at previous symposiums and met Japanese pilots.
"We were trained to fight the Japanese, and the Japanese were trained to fight us," Bennett said.
I harbor no ill will toward the Japanese today."
Hedley said he believes members of the U.S. government "sold us out" in 1941 and made the attack possible.
These days, Hedley said, he gives two principal admonitions to students.
"I've had college students who have asked me what Pearl Harbor was," he said.
Cross never was able to forgive the Japanese, Large said.
Large said the Sons and Daughters will take over a national scholarship the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association once managed and invite veterans to its 2012 convention.
He did so," Large said.
