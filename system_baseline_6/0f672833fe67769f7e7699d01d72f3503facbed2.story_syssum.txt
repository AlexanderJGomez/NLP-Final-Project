Hatch started the No Cussing Club.
I got a lot of death threats from people, but I realized that through this whole thing that these people were bullies and I wasn't going to let them win.
Lapin: Even with the bullies, even with the threats, is this now in 30 different countries with thousands of members?
Hatch: It's definitely worth it.
Hatch: Yeah, it's about talking to people with civility like you said, and making people feel good about themselves and talking to people with respect.
