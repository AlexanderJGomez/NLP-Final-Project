(CNN) -- There was no feeling in Matthias Lanzinger's leg when he regained consciousness in hospital after his skiing accident.
I think it's good for me that way right now."
"I know that maybe things could have been done differently," Lanzinger says wistfully.
Most immediately, he is looking forward to the 2014 Winter Olympics, his skiing career continuing but merely realigned after his life changing accident.
"When I get to Sochi, a medal is the goal," he says, "and obviously gold would be nice.
"I wanted to do my new life.
"After that first run, the feeling was back," he says.
Lanzinger has not watched his accident back, although he is slowly coming round to the idea that one day he will.
Guiding him to Sochi is his coach Manuel Hujara, who has worked with Lanzinger since his decision to return to competitive skiing.
"I've not thought about it," he says of life after Sochi.
"Let's see what I do there first."
