(CNN) -- A Southwest Airlines jetliner sustained substantial damage when its nose gear collapsed during landing in New York and it skidded down the runway, injuring 10 people.
Southwest, the largest domestic airline, did not respond to efforts by CNN to confirm the e-mails.
Another passenger said it felt like the plane crashed and then skidded to a stop.
Southwest said in a statement that it was working with the NTSB and Boeing.
The plane, which entered service nearly 14 years ago, was last inspected on July 18, Southwest said.
Nose gear problems on commercial jets occur from time to time, but the crew normally would be alerted to any issue during approach by warning lights and would have time to abort a landing or come in on just the back wheels.
