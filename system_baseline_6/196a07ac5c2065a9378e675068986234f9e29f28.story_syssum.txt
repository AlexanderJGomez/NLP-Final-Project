(CNN) -- With each day, the hunt for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 becomes one of the most baffling mysteries of the modern era, but history offers many great quests in which mankind searched for something or someone lost.
RMS Titanic was a British luxury passenger ship that sank in 1912 during its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City.
A long search for a commercial airliner like Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 isn't unprecedented.
Miniature submersible vehicles retrieved the Flight 447's voice and flight data recorders.
But where?
It's one thing to imagine of a paradise like Atlantis.
It's quite another to actually voyage into a strange new world in search of one.
"Many have searched for the tomb of Alexander the Great, but no one had searched for that missing piece of ancient Egypt's story -- the tomb of Cleopatra, who took her own life rather than surrender her homeland to the Romans," Hawass wrote.
The disappearance of Flight 370 has nothing on the Bermuda Triangle.
Some even blame the triangle disasters on supernatural forces, including influences from lost Atlantis or another time-space dimension.
Call them aliens.
"The significance of a finding that there are other beings who share this universe with us would be absolutely phenomenal, it would be an epochal event in human history," Sagan once declared.
