Haley Barbour has said he didn't know that retired IRS investigator Harry Bostick had been arrested for a DUI months after the state's parole board recommended that Barbour grant him a full pardon.
Jones and Hosemann were even urged by a lawyer in the firm that represented Bostick not to issue the pardon, according to the e-mails.
Barbour granted Bostick a full pardon in January for a felony drunken driving offense in March 2009.
A police investigation found that Bostick was under the influence of alcohol while driving but has determined that he was not at fault for the accident, according to the Mississippi Highway Patrol.
Neither Bostick nor his lawyers have returned calls from CNN seeking comment.
"Bostick is a friend.
Whitwell, an attorney in the firm that has represented Bostick in his DUI cases, said he called Hosemann, his old law school friend, to help with the pardon, even though the secretary of state's office has no official authority to issue pardons.
Sorry," Whitwell wrote.
Whitwell said the October e-mail was the last communication he had about Bostick's pardon.
"Haley Barbour had to have known.
"How do you do that?"
