JACKSON, Missouri (CNN) -- Debbie Shank breaks down in tears every time she's told that her 18-year-old son, Jeremy, was killed in Iraq.
Eight years ago, Shank was stocking shelves for the retail giant and signed up for Wal-Mart's health and benefits plan.
"We assumed after three years, they [Wal-Mart] had made a decision to let Debbie Shank use this money for what it was intended to," Graham said.
But I just wonder if they need it that bad," Jim Shank said.
Jim Shank said he believes Wal-Mart should make an exception.
"The recovery that Debbie Shank made was recovery for future lost earnings, for her pain and suffering," Graham said.
But just last week, the high court said it would not hear the case.
Jim Shank said he's disappointed with the Supreme Court's decision not to hear the case -- not for the sake of his family -- but for those who might face similar circumstances.
