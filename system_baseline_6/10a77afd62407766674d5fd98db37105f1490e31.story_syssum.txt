" MacFarlane-Barrow says.
After much thought and prayer, Magnus MacFarlane-Barrow quit his job, sold his home and dedicated himself to helping people in need.
Today, his program -- Mary's Meals, named after the Virgin Mary -- provides free daily meals to more than 400,000 children around the world.

"Pass rates go up dramatically in the schools where we start providing Mary's Meals," he says.
"I see the children's faces as they eat their meal, " he says.
MacFarlane-Barrow is driven by his Christian faith, but there is no ministry aspect to his work.
Check out the Mary's Meals websites at www.marysmeals.org and www.marysmealsusa.org and see how to help.
