The bank has admitted to overcharging approximately 4,500 members of the U.S. military on their mortgages and said it accidentally foreclosed on 18 service members' homes.
Mudick said an internal review would be conducted and that JPMorgan Chase would advise the committee on the results of that probe.
Mudick blamed much of JPMorgan Chase's mistakes on human error, citing the complexity of reading military orders that are needed to prove active duty service, and problems with not coding SCRA cases to reflect their eligibility for the interest cap and foreclosure prevention benefits.
"That is the weakest answer I have ever heard given in front of this committee, that we couldn't read the military orders, coming from one of the largest financial institutions in the world," he said.
JPMorgan Chase wasn't the only target in the committee hearing.
It didn't happen," Filner said to Col. Shawn Shumake, who was representing the Defense Department.
The committee's concerns that banks are not taking the civil relief act seriously enough were echoed in the testimony of one attorney representing service members in a class action lawsuit against Chase.
It's still in the back of your mind," said Rowles.
"Anything that's adding stress to a service member, especially in a combat zone, is incredibly risky behavior, so no stone should go unturned," said Walz.
