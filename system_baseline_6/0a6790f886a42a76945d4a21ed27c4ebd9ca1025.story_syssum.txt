And Genii had the plan to do the same this year.
"Red Bull or Mercedes, those companies are sponsoring the teams," said Boullier, whose driver management company Gravity also has connections to Genii.
"It is part of the strategy that partners join the team and Genii will get back their investment.
"It is no secret that for quite a while Genii have been looking for partners to make sure that we can bring more money to the team and have access to a bigger sponsor portfolio," the Frenchman added.
And that is what we are working on."
