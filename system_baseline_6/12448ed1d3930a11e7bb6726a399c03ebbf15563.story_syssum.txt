The demonstrators were supporters of deposed Egyptian President Mohammed Morsy, a former Muslim Brotherhood leader, Ahram Online said.
El-Sisi's decision is just one of the latest grievances expressed by Morsy supporters.
El-Sisi deposed Morsy last year following mass protests against Morsy's rule.
Monday's court ruling drew widespread criticism from international human rights groups.
