A British hostage whose life ISIS threatened in a video was helping to provide humanitarian relief in Syria when he was abducted last year, an aid agency said.
The threats on David Haines' life are intolerable," the aid group said in a statement.
The group does have relief activities in Syria that are managed from a distance, he said.
UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond provided scant details of the rescue attempt or any other plans in the works.
