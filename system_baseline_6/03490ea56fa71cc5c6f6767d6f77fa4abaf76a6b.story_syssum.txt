Ocean Sole is a Kenyan recycling company that's crafting whimsical pieces of art and fashion from discarded flip-flops and other plastic junk -- piles of rubbish that wash up on Kenya's sandy beaches.
"It gets people to think about the ocean and links them to waterways -- and we're doing it through business."
The inspiration for Ocean Sole came in 1997 when Church, a marine conservationist at the time, started working in a sea turtle preservation project on the remote island of Kiwayu near the Kenya-Somalia border.
Ocean Sole, which provides direct employment today to more than 70 people, aims to recycle 400,000 flip-flops every year.
There, Ocean Sole workers go through large bags full of broken flip-flops every day to select the ones they're going to use in their creations.
Church says that Ocean Sole is for her "a means to an end," a more effective way to spread her green message than working as a marine conservationist.
