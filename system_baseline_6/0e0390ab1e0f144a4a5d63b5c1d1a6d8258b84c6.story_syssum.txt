That personal app grew into Weduary, a real product that helps people design wedding sites, and Morin went on to create her own lifestyle how-to company called Brit + Co., which combines crafting, homemaking and a bit of tech.
One of Morin's favorite recent projects was an LED cowboy hat she wore to the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas.
In an effort to differentiate herself from the doyennes of DIY like Stewart, Morin avoids saying the word "craft," which she thinks makes people think of popsicle sticks.
At Brit and Co., Morin's agreeable, bubbly personality is a big part of the product.
"We're trying to recreate what it is to have a person as the core of the brand," said Morin.
Morin says that with so many people 35 and younger growing up with two working parents, there's been less time for passing on cooking, crafting and DIY techniques.
