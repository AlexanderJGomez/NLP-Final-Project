This effort must be stopped," Delaware ACORN board member Hugh Alleyne said during a news conference Wednesday.
"In nearly every case that has been reported, it was ACORN that discovered the bad forms and called them to the attention of election authorities, putting the forms in a package that identified them in writing as suspicious, encouraging election officials to investigate, and offering to help with prosecutions," ACORN said in an October 9 news release.
On its Web site, the group contends that those employees were lazy and didn't want to work for their pay, making ACORN, not the public, the victim.
As an attorney, Obama represented ACORN alongside the U.S. Justice Department in suing the state of Illinois to force state compliance with a federal voting access law, the campaign's Web site says.
Former U.S. Attorney David Iglesias said the Bush administration fired him and eight other federal prosecutors in 2006 for political reasons, among them his refusal to pursue election fraud charges against organizations like ACORN.
