(CNN) -- The battering that the U.S. image is taking in Egypt these days reflects that the sources of anger against America in the Middle East run deep.
And here's why:
It won't.
The U.S. would have to be much clearer about standing up to human rights abuses in the Arab world and much tougher on the Arab kings where America is reluctant to offend its conservative allies.
We lost our footing in Egypt because the tension between our values and interests results in unpopular and inconsistent policies.
But more than that, if Egyptians are confused, can't get their own house in order and don't produce big leaders or credible democratic institutions on which the U.S. can find a focal point for its policy, we're going to continue to stumble and bumble around.
And they do.
Expectations for America run high in the world; and too often we help raise them, particularly in the Middle East.
For Obama the middle class was always going to be more important than the Middle East.
And for better or worse, America's standing in that region shows it.
