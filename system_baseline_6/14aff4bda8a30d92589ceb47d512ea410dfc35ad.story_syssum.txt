Hong Kong (CNN) -- Featuring everything from hand-painted heels to a live (and semi-naked) woman, Hong Kong's latest art fair wrapped Sunday with sales topping HK$39 million ($5 million) -- up 50% on last year's inaugural event.
A section on Hong Kong's young artists appealed to local tastes, while an "Under HK$10,000 Wall" catered to the art collector on a tighter budget.
Organizers of Affordable Art Fair say price is just a small part of their mission.
If you missed the show in Hong Kong, you can always hit the Affordable Art Fair at one of its upcoming global tour stops.
