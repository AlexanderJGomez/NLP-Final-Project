(CNN) -- Malawi said it won't host an African Union summit next month because the organization wants Omar al-Bashir, the Sudanese leader accused of war crimes in Darfur, to attend.
Sudan asked the AU to move the meeting there after Malawi said al-Bashir would not be welcome.
After she took power, she said Malawi would host the summit but stressed that al-Bashir wouldn't be welcomed because of the arrest warrant.
"Civil society groups across the African continent have repeatedly urged governments to arrest -- not host -- al-Bashir," said Elise Keppler, senior international justice counsel at Human Rights Watch.
