(CNN) -- Manchester City have confirmed that absent Brazilian striker Robinho will be back in time for the Premier League side's return to training next week.
"Once he is back, I will sit down with him and explain my feelings, and decisions will be made after that.
Robinho is no stranger to controversy and had a reputation as a party-goer prior to his move to Manchester last year.
