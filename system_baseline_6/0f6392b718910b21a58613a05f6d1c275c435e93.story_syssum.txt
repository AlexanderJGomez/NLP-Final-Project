(CNN) -- Back in the pool for the first time since 2012, Michael Phelps was close to his peerless best.
Taking to the pool in competition for the first time in 628 days, he had cruised through his qualifying heat with the fastest time of 52.84 seconds, just ahead of Lochte who went on to win the final in the second fastest time in the world this year.
We push each other all the time," said Lochte.
But Phelps says he is taking "one step at a time."
"Now that he's back I've got a big ol' smile on my face."
