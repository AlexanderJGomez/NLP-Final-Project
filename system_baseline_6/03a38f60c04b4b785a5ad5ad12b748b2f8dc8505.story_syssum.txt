It is at least the fourth violent attack in two weeks believed to be motivated by anti-gay bias, police said.
The gunman confronted the two men again, before shooting Carson in the face, police said.
The identities of the suspect's two companions -- at least one of whom Kelly said left the suspect before the shooting -- are still not known.
On May 8, another gay man was assaulted by two men shouting anti-gay slurs as he left a bar in Manhattan's West Village, New York Police said.
