I hate Super Bowl parties.
Oh, I love the Super Bowl.
I wanted to watch a football game -- in peace.
Nothing ruins the Super Bowl like a Super Bowl party.
It wasn't.
I wanted to scream.
The Super Bowl is about football.
The Long-Suffering-Fan-in-the-Jersey-With-the-Price-Tag-Still-on Dolt: Inevitably, someone will arrive this Sunday wearing a brand new Ray Rice Ravens jersey while talking about "all the years I've suffered waiting for this day."
Not only have I gone 40 years without my team appearing in the Super Bowl, but I've had to sit through the likes of Blair Thomas, Rich Kotite and JoJo Townsell.
The Box Dolt: I can't remember the last time I attended a Super Bowl party where someone failed to pass around a sheet of paper with a bunch of boxes, and everyone was guilted into plunking down $5.
The wife has agreed that we'll stay home, order a pizza and watch Ravens-49ers in the den with our kids.
As long as no one talks, I'm golden.
