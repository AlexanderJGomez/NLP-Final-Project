The storm could dump up to 3 feet of snow in Boston and New York before it ends Tuesday, along with freezing rain and strong wind gusts possibly reaching hurricane level.
"I want everyone to understand that we are facing -- most likely -- one of the largest snowstorms in the history of this city," said New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.
Now is the time to get ready for this extreme weather," he said.
Wind gusts in the New York City area could hit 65 mph.
The Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency tweeted Sunday that the state would be under a blizzard watch Monday.
Eight counties in Massachusetts are already under a winter storm watch: Berkshire, Franklin, Hampshire, Hampden, Worcester, Barnstable, Nantucket and Dukes.
On Sunday they prepared to ride out the storm by being as prepared as they usually are, with plenty of food and water on hand.
Andrew Cuomo urged New Yorkers to prepare immediately for the storm, saying they should plan for "major disruptions" during Monday and Tuesday morning commutes.
