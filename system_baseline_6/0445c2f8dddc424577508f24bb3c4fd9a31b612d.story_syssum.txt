(CNN) -- I remember fragments of the story of SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau's killing in 2010 -- something about a ponytail, something about her slipping and falling, something about how this almost never ever happens because in these parks, the animals are happy and the trainers are safe.
I spoke to Tim Zimmermann who wrote a phenomenal article for Outside magazine about killer whales and asked him to come aboard as an associate producer.
Together we set out to tell this story of an incident at SeaWorld.
I can't say this was an easy film to make.
Two years after I wrote the treatment in 2010 we finished "Blackfish."
My hope is that we take the "Blackfish" momentum and use it to help evolve us out of animals for entertainment.
People always wonder whether I believe SeaWorld should be closed down.
I don't know if it will change the way you feel about animals in entertainment parks.
