(CNN) -- Small waves lap at the hulls of the ocean-going container ships as they approach the South African Port of Ngqura.
It's this combination of maritime port and landside infrastructure just outside the city of Port Elizabeth that is making the operation boom.
And it's not just the port that is seeing growth in the area.
"The Coega industrial development zone has a very important role to play in the economic growth of the area," says Christopher Mashigo, business development executive manager at the Coega Development Corporation.
As well as individuals gaining skills and jobs, small and medium size businesses in the area are also benefiting from the zone.
The port is allowing some small business owners to grow their existing operation, but it's also leading to the beginnings of totally new businesses.
While some of these successes prove the value of the port and industrial zone, there is much more to come.
