Editor's note: What's the best advice your father ever gave you?
My dad taught me that life is better when you have a good time -- and bring others along for the ride.
I've relied on this advice countless times over the years.
-- Hilary Heindl, Salem, Massachusetts
When I first entered the working world, my dad told me that it's as important to remember the assistant's name as the boss's.
And he should know: He's an incredibly industrious doctor who manages to get to know his patients well, play ball with his grandchildren, and pursue countless hobbies.
My dad always felt that if he was with a family member or a friend, that person took precedence over whoever might be calling.
The best advice my father ever gave was passed down from his dad: Never try to solve problems at night, because they always seem worse than they do in the morning.
To avoid the blues, my dad said, you should always have something to look forward to.
