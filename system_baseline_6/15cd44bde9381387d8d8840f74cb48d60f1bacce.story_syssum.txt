Cuban rap duo "Doble Filo" say hip hop allows them to embrace social issues.
Along with fellow Cuban rap duo "Los Aldeanos" ("The Villagers") "Doble Filo" work with U.S. hip hop audio/visual label, Emetrece Productions.
But "Los Aldeanos", who formed in 2003, are part of a younger generation of Cuban rappers.
Bian Rodriguez, also known as El B, the other member of "Los Aldeanos," says hip hop gives voice to the concerns of ordinary Cubans.
Like most other Cuban rap groups, "Los Aldeanos" aren't yet in a position to make a living from their music.
More than just promoting good music, she says Emetrece is trying to educate, and to challenge the U.S. embargo on Cuba.
Like Cuba's rappers, she sees hip hop as a tool for social change.
