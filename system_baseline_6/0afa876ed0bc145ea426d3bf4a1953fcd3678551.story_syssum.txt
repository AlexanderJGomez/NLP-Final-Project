Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Abu Ali is 58 years old.
Abu Ali doesn't stop crying the entire time we are with the family.
In July last year the family was preparing for their annual pilgrimage to the holy city of Najaf, where Ali is buried, to honor his memory.
Abu Ali has now lost all three sons.
Abu Ali and his wife, Umm Ali, at first couldn't face telling them the truth, instead saying he'd gone to Mosul for more watermelons.
His sister seems happy enough, playing on a sofa with her cousin and a tattered doll.
The family has a fourth son, Ammar, but after the second explosion he fell apart emotionally and was certain that one day he too would die.
The family hasn't seen or heard from him since.
Six people are crammed into the home, Abu Ali and Umm Ali, and Alaa's widow and three children.
"It's hard.
We leave Abu Ali and Umm Ali and the grandchildren they now raise and they thank us for telling their story to the world.
