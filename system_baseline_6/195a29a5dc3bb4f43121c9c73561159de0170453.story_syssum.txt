Like so many of the other children here, 9-year-old Mohammed Hoot is wandering around the camp, bored.
Unsafe in Syria, unwanted in Turkey, these people are living in limbo.
The U.N. says some 1.2 million Syrians are displaced inside Syria.
But after more than 20 months of conflict, there are signs that resources for wealthier refugees are running out.
As Syrian refugees go, Ali Moraly knows he is one of the luckier ones.
Now, this 32-year-old violinist -- who used to perform at the Damascus Opera House -- is one of the faceless millions of Syrians now living on the run.
He does not know where he will be living several months from now, and he has no idea when he will be reunited with his sister, who fled with her husband and children to the U.S., or with his parents, who remain in Damascus.
I just want people to feel for us."
