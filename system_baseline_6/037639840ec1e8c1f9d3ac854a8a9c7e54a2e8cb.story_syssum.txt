(Rolling Stone)  -- There are moments when "Move Like This," the first new album by the Cars in 24 years, sounds so much like a record by the Cars that you find yourself laughing out loud.
"Move Like This" is a reminder that New Wave can still sound new, especially when the Cars do it.
But for Ocasek, the sound is more important than the message -- in fact, the sound is the message.
"Your eyes are dim, your heart is blue/'Cause nothing ever lasts," Ocasek croaks over chiming guitar arpeggios in "Take Another Look"; on "Sad Song," he sings, "It's just a sad song that pulls you along."
