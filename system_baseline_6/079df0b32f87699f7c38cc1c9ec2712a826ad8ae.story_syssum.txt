And "never mind," is what Speaker Boehner might just as well have said Thursday when he all but declared the immigration reform legislative debate dead for 2014.
Of course not, and it was just a week ago that the same Speaker Boehner said this of the same immigration debate:
They insist people, primarily immigration activists and the media, read too much into what the Speaker said a week ago.
Veteran GOP strategist Alex Castellanos, who for years has been urging the GOP to act on immigration, said the politics behind Boehner's shift were easy to understand.
Not only does McConnell face a tea party primary challenge but, as we illustrated last Sunday on "Inside Politics," most GOP strategists see action on immigration this year -- whatever the long-term good it might do Republicans -- as potentially harmful to GOP prospects this year.
"And the GOP wants to do nothing to distract from that, certainly not start a food fight on immigration."
