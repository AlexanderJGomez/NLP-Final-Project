But two-time champion Alonso -- whose team was fined $100,000 in September for telling Felipe Massa to allow the Spaniard to win July's German Grand Prix -- says he is focusing on his own race, needing a first or second-place finish to ensure another title.
"I don't think I would lose even one second of my energy this weekend thinking of what is going to happen on Sunday afternoon," the 29-year-old told F1's official website when asked whether he would understand if Vettel assisted Webber.
"I know that I've been very fortunate even to have a chance to get to this point," the 34-year-old said.
Obviously I have to win this race.
