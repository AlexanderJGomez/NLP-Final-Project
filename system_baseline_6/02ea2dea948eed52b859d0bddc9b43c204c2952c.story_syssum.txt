For some, education in Finland is utopia: a dreamland where teaching is the most desired profession, authorities trust schools and political parties agree on the direction of educational reforms.
First, Finland has built a school system that has over time strengthened educational equity.
According to the most recent data provided by the OECD the average teaching load of junior high school teachers in Finland is about half what it is in the United States.
Schooldays are also shorter in Finland than in the United States, and primary schools keep the homework load to a minimum so students have time for their own hobbies and friends when school is over.
Frequent turnover of teachers in thousands of American schools undermines the entire education system.
One affordable and smart step would be to terminate policies and practices that prevent American teachers from teaching what matters most to their students.
Enhancing equity has been one key to success in Finland.
