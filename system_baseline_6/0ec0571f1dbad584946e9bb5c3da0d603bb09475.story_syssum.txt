Now, the designer of "Civilization" is ready to take over a completely new world -- social gaming on the pages of Facebook.
"Players have continued to respond to the game in spite of how far technology has come, in spite of how the world has changed, in spite of how the demographics of game players have changed," Meier said.
It felt like, both in terms of the technology and also where players were, that they would respond to having a strategy type game on their console."
Meier said there were things that a Facebook game can offer Civ players over a traditional PC game.
Meier points out that a typical "Civilization" multiplayer game can easily span 12 or more continuous hours, whereas a Facebook game will take place in stops and starts over days and week.
Players who succeed will be rewarded, and then another game can start.
He said designing a Facebook game does give them the ability to update things really quickly because players are essentially downloading the whole game every time they play.
"Games are really taking over the world."
