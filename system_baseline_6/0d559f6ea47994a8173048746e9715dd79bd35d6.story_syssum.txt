But on 10 minutes the referee took the decision that essentially ended the game as a contest.
But 18 minutes from time he rose unmarked in the box to head home a David Beckham corner.
Simone Perrotta opened the scoring on 17 minutes after a scramble at a corner and then Toni turned home Mirko Vucinic's cross on the stroke of half-time.
And, on the hour mark, Vucinic turned provider again for Toni to head home his second.
