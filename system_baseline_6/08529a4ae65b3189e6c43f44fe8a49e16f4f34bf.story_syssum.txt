Special Agent Daniel McMullen on Friday said the bureau, along with university police, will expand the investigation to determine whether  any federal laws were broken in the incident Sunday, when a noose and a flag bearing a Confederate symbol were found placed on the statue of James Meredith.
And an attorney for one of the three students sought for questioning in the statue incident said Friday there is video evidence that absolves his client.
Danny Blanton, director of public relations for Ole Miss, said he is not aware of any video of the incident.
Sellers said university police "had gathered enough evidence by late Wednesday to bring charges through the student judicial process against two of the students, and both state and federal authorities were working in close coordination to determine whether criminal charges were applicable," the statement said.
James Meredith became the first black student admitted to Ole Miss in 1962.
Ironically, James Meredith has said he is no fan of the statue, that he disapproves of it on biblical grounds and believes it should be removed from campus.
Not only would it expel the three students, the fraternity said, it was going to indefinitely suspend the whole Ole Miss chapter.
"To be honest, we haven't come as far as we think we've come," said another student, Bryston Tucker.
"Because it is not just white people towards blacks, it is blacks towards whites, whites towards Mexicans ..."
