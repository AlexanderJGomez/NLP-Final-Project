(CNN) -- When the Burj Khalifa officially opened in Dubai on Monday, much of the world press noted the irony of the world's tallest building unveiled just weeks after the emirate's debt crash.
* The 186-meter Singer building opened in New York in the wake of the market panic of 1907.
"It seemed strikingly similar to what happened during the building of the Chrysler Building in New York," he said.
The components that give rise to the skyscrapers give rise to the boom: loose monetary policy and easy credit drive up land prices, "and people want to build higher to offset that," he said.
The skyscraper correlation is "has a very polarizing effect on people" in the tall building industry, said Steve Watts, a partner with Davis Langdon & Seah international and co-chair of economics committee of the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, the international body which officially ranks the world's highest structures.
"My personal view is it will be a while before you'll see any other building built that beats the Burj," he said.
