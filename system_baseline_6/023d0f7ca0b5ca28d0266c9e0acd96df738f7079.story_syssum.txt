Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia are at the center of an Ebola outbreak that has already killed more than 800 people.
The 40-year-old man has symptoms of a viral hemorrhagic fever, the Saudi Health Ministry said Tuesday.
A Nigerian doctor has been diagnosed with Ebola nearly three weeks after a Liberian-American man with Ebola died after traveling to Lagos, Nigerian officials said Monday.
The Ebola virus causes viral hemorrhagic fever, which affects multiple organ systems in the body and is often accompanied by bleeding.
Ebola spreads through contact with organs and bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, urine and other secretions of infected people.
It has no cure.
On Tuesday, Liberia responded to British Airways' decision to suspend service to Monrovia because of the outbreak.
