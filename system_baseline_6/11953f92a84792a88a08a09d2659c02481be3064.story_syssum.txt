"It's a great honor to be asked to be the next manager of Manchester United," Moyes told United's official website.
"I have had a terrific job at Everton, with a tremendous chairman and Board of Directors and a great set of players.
"He was a young man then at the start of his career and has since gone on to do a magnificent job at Everton.
"Everton can confirm that David Moyes will leave the Club at the end of the season," the Merseyside club said in a statement.
Moyes took charge of Everton on over 500 occasions with the club qualifying for Europe four times during his time as manager.
United did not have to pay Everton compensation for Moyes, as his contract had been due to expire in July.
Moyes later sued the player and his publisher over remarks made in his autobiography, but they settled out of court.
