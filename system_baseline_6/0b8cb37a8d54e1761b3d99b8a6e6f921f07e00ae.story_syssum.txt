(CNN) -- Suspected cop killer Eric Matthew Frein appears to have left handwritten notes in the Pennsylvania woods in which he chillingly describes his ambush of two state troopers last month, State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Wednesday.
Bivens said Frein faces two additional counts of possession of a weapon of mass destruction after two booby trapped pipe bombs were discovered in the Pocono Mountains search area last week.
Bivens said the handwritten notes were discovered among items left behind at a campsite located by law enforcement agents on September 29.
It was only 15 to 20 minutes."
Authorities have said that a review of a computer hard drive used by Frein shows that he had planned the attack for years.
