"People thought it was not possible to break the monopoly of the existing company that was there, because it has been there for 80 years," says Karanja, who launched her company's first beer product, called Summit, in 2008.
But instead of bowing out of the industry, Karanja came up with a new product.
Although the company only holds about 5% of the country's market share, Karanja says the demand for Keroche's products outweighs the supply.
Karanja, a mother of four, says that startups are common in Kenya, but few survive the harsh business environment.
"I thought it would motivate the people, the Kenyans, and show them that even if you work very hard, struggle, meet all those challenges, at the end of it there'll be somebody who will recognize you."
