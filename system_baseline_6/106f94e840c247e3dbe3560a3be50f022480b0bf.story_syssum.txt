It's not just that each of the 18 homes of Green Village is constructed almost entirely from bamboo, but the form they take.
While some families live in the village, some homes are luxury retreats and can cost between $500,000 and $2million.
But the largest structural bamboo logs could last a lifetime, says Mokoho Sumerta, the chief builder from the nearby bamboo factory.
Before doing this a bamboo structure would last only seven years, now we're not sure how long a building can last."
