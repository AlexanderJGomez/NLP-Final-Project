Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has tossed out government fines against CBS Inc. and its affiliates for airing the infamous shot of brief nudity involving singer Janet Jackson during the 2004 Super Bowl.
After viewer complaints and national media attention, the FCC said the Jackson incident was obscene.
The television networks say their scripted shows no longer air nudity, racy images or expletives, even after 10 p.m., when some potentially vulgar words may be permitted.
But some indecent words can slip through, they admit, and they want to be protected from heavy government fines.
