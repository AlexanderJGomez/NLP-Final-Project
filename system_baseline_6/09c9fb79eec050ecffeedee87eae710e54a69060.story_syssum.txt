"Police express concern over the video clip showing several plainclothes officers who are suspected of using excessive force," said a statement issued by the Hong Kong Information Services Department Wednesday morning.
Leung said there was a set and effective mechanism in place to deal with complaints against police.
Another main protest group -- The Hong Kong Federation of Students -- issued a statement calling for the resignation of Police Commissioner Andy Tsang Wai-hunh, and other police commanders involved in preventing protesters from re-occupying Lung Wo road on Tuesday night.
A total of 45 people -- 37 men and eight women -- were arrested for alleged unlawful assembly and obstructing police officers, police said.
They're not.
At the peak of the protests, tens of thousands of demonstrators crowded onto the streets, calling for the resignation of leader C.Y.
He said student leaders had "almost zero chance" of pushing Beijing to change its stance on how Hong Kong's leader is elected.
That is impossible," he said.
The move was seen as a miscalculation and only served to garner support for the protesters, who accused the government of heavy handedness and of stifling free speech.
