Agadir, Morocco (CNN) -- In Agadir, the arid heartland of Morocco's indigenous Berber population, a quiet oil boom is gaining momentum, one drop at a time.
But times have changed, and according to the Argan Oil Society, all the co-operatives are now staffed and run by local women.
Charrouf says that the new-found international popularity of argan oil -- which she describes as "liquid gold" -- has not only provided about 5,000 jobs for Berber women across 170 co-ops, but also an important social lifeline.
"The purpose of this work is to preserve the argan tree, because it was in decline," she said.
But as yet, there is no machine that can do a better job at cracking open the argan nuts than the women.
