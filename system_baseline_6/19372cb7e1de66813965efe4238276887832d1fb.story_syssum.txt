South Africa has long been a voracious consumer of imported European House music, but over the last few years a small group of producers in Pretoria have begun experimenting with their own sound, more representative of the music of the townships they live in.
DJ Qness writes for South African dance music magazine BPM and works for Mujava's record label, Sheer Music.
The Township House pioneers began to give CDs of their tracks to taxi drivers.
Qness said that even without radio play the township sound began outselling imported dance music and the record labels began to take notice.
Once Pretoria's taxi drivers had generated a buzz about "Township Funk," Sheer Music stepped in, signing Mujava.
Only in South Africa -- and thanks to Pretoria's taxi drivers, in clued-up nightclubs around the world.
