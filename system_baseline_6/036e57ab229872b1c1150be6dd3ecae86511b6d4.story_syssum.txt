Tensions spiked in the Middle East on Tuesday as Iran extolled its "axis of resistance" with Syria, and the United States warned of proxy and terror activity.
The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said at least 170 people were killed across the nation Tuesday.
"The Islamic Republic of Iran believes in a Syrian solution based on national dialogue among all Syrian groups to settle the country's issues, and does not consider foreign approaches as useful," Jalili said, according to Iran's state-run Press TV.
An Iranian Foreign Ministry official said Washington is responsible for the lives of the Iranians because the United States supports the rebels.
Ventrell, speaking to reporters Tuesday, said Iran's contention that the United States is responsible for their security "doesn't seem to make sense."
The LCC said at least 33 people died in Aleppo, including 10 "field-executed" prisoners, as shelling engulfed the city.
Roughly 17,000 people have been killed since the Syrian conflict began, U.N. Secretary-General Ban said last month.
