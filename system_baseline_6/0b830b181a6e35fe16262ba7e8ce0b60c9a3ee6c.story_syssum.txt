(Budget Travel) -- In recent years, this fishing town -- and next-wave surf spot -- has turned into a popular rest stop for Inca Trail hikers.
Early risers can even surf with the owners, who ride tandem on a longboard (011-51/1-9830-5896, samanachakra.com).
The bumpy ride across town costs about a dollar.
The best deal in town is a cremolada (a crushed-ice beverage made with passion fruit, strawberry, orange, or pineapple) at Papa Mo's Milk Bar.
