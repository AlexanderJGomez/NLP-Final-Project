"The crickets have been thick for a couple of days now," he said Wednesday.
"There are always a few crickets around in the summertime, but never a swarm like this," he said.
Rick Grantham, an entomologist at Oklahoma State University, said a similar swarm of crickets occurred last year.
"I suppose if you have 10,000 dead crickets staring at you, they might seem like a plague," he said.
While the crickets are not considered an agricultural pest, Grantham said they are definitely a problem when they swarm, especially in commercial areas with bright security lights.
He knows because he has personally observed them.
Jervis said he is seeing an increase in calls from people wanting to know what to do about crickets.
Grantham said crickets will eat just about anything, including plant material and each other.
