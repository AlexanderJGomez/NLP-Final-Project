To do that, it will need technology companies to develop a new generation of security scanners.
DHS wants scanners that would add speed to the security process, allowing 250 passengers through per hour without having to remove their shoes and outer garments.
The government wants the new scanners to screen passengers as they walk without passengers being required to "significantly alter walking paths" or shed clothing.
