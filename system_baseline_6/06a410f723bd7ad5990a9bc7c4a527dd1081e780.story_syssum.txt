Guatemala's foreign minister said earlier Wednesday that officials there did not know how McAfee entered the country and that there was no record of McAfee entering legally at any official border crossing.
He said McAfee left Belize to escape police persecution.
Officials say the dogs' barking and aggressive behavior was a frequent source of friction between McAfee and Faull, a contractor who retired to Belize from Florida and lived next door.
McAfee told CNN in the interview that he did not kill Faull and did not pay anybody to kill the man.
