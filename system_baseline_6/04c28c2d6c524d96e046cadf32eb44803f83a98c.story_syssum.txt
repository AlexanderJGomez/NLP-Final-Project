Charleston, South Carolina (CNN)Police officers Saturday accompanied the hearse carrying the body of Walter Scott to his South Carolina funeral service, where hundreds of mourners celebrated his life and death as a catalyst for change in America.
The death of Scott, who was black, at the hands of a white police officer was "motivated by racial prejudice," Hamilton said.
"There is gong to be change," he said.
Chris Stewart, an attorney for the Scott family, said the death represented more than an race issue.
A passer-by caught the shooting on cell phone video, and Officer Michael Slager was swiftly charged with murder.
The video shows Scott running from an officer, who fires eight shots.

Criminal defense attorney Paul Callan said he believes Slager's defense will play up the reported scuffle in arguing that this is not a murder case.
He said he didn't see Scott go after the Taser, as Slager initially claimed.
Slager was being held in isolation and being "monitored for his mental health," Cannon said.
In a statement, one of Slager's lawyers said the meeting lasted about an hour.
"He said it was the best job he's ever had," Clyburn said.
Scott family attorney Chris Stewart said he was a co-worker and friend.
It said: "Tradition, the Cowboys way."
