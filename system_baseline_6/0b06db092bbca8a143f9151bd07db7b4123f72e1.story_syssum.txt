"I believe this procedure is justified because you need a face to face the world," Siemionow said.
The patient had previously "suffered severe facial trauma," the Cleveland Clinic said.
The patient said she is happy because when she puts her hands on her face, she feels a nose, Siemionow said.
Siemionow, who has been working on face transplant research for 20 years, received approval from the Institutional Review Board in 2004 to conduct a full facial transplant.
One of the French face transplant recipients was a man who had a genetic disorder that created large tumors on his face.
By looking at the genetic underpinnings of disorders that lead to facial deformities, scientists can also understand what accounts for the normal differences in face and skull types.
"These are going to be some of the genes that cause some of that variation," Jabs said.
