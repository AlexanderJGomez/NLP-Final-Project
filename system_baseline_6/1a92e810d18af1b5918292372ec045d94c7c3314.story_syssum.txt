Léogâne, Haiti (CNN)  -- Joanie Yestin walks through a small alleyway to what used to be home, now a pile of concrete and crushed belongings.
Yestin, like many of Haiti's almost 10,000 Boys and Girls Scouts, decided to contribute her share to the earthquake relief effort.
The Scouts have one other advantage: They are young.
But as determined as Yestin is to help, this particular community chore is hardly easy for her Scout troop.
By night, they sleep under the stars.
"I will do my very best to help others because that is what I have been trained to do," she said about her five years in the Scouts.
She had wanted to attend university, study communications.
"I love the way we work together," she said of the Scouts.
