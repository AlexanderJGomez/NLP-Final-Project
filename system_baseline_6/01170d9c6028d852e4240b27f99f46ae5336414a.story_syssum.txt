"I mean, my heart is totally with the congresswoman," says daughter Sara Taseer.
Qadri confessed in court Monday that he killed Taseer because of his support to change the blasphemy laws.
Sara Taseer says, "The difference is in Pakistan, this is not a message just to my father or my family.
People who support us can lose their own lives."
"It's because they fear for their lives," says Taseer's son Shehryar.
It makes me sick to my stomach," says Taseer's youngest daughter Shehrbano.
"There were over 200 lawyers who went and put garlands and rose petals around my father's assassin's neck.
Now his family is looking back at the life of Salmaan Taseer, a businessman and governor of one of the most-populated provinces in the world.
But on top of it all I say one thing: that he was a great father and even better husband."
His daughter Shehrbano says, "I hope his passing doesn't mean that the room for debate is over.
This country needed people like him.
The world, I think, needs people like him."
