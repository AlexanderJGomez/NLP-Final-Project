Los Angeles (CNN) -- Cast members of the hit television show "Happy Days," who are suing CBS, accused the company of "despicable conduct" for not paying them for merchandising revenues.
In interviews with CNN earlier this year, the four cast members said they decided to move forward after discovering "Happy Days" slot machines were popping up in casinos around the country in 2008.
CBS said this was "all done in a transparent attempt to introduce the specter of punitive damages" in the case.
The actors said CBS claimed it did not pay them for the "Happy Days" slot machine proceeds due "to oversight."
Williams told CNN this week that the case is "like 'Happy Days' versus Goliath.
I'm hoping this case gives visibility to not only help us, but to help thousands of other individuals in the entertainment business."
