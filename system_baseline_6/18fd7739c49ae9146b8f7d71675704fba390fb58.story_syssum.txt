The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights also said it deplores the kidnappings, arbitrary detentions, torture, sexual violations and illegal raids that the panel maintains other members of the political resistance have suffered since the June 29 coup.
Honduras' top law enforcement official said he "laments and deplores" violence that resulted from the coup that removed President Jose Manuel Zelaya from power and installed interim President Roberto Micheletti.
The OAS commission said that one of the recently killed activists was 29-year-old Vanessa Zepeda Alonzo, who was found February 3.
"The commission observes with dismay that it appears that sons and daughters of leaders of the Resistance Front are being killed, kidnapped, attacked and threatened as a strategy to silence the activists," the report said.
The violence can be political, from all sides of the spectrum.
"Unfortunately, Honduras has a history of violence," said Otto Reich, who served the past three Republican presidents in a number of high-level Latin American posts.
But political violence deserves special attention to safeguard democracy, the OAS panel said.
Reich said he hopes the OAS report does not blame the new government for the violence.
They are elected by the OAS General Assembly.
