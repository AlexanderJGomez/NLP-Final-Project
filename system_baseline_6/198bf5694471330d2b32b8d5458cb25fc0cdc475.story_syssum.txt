Toyota has announced no recall of these vehicles, however, and said it has not received any complaints about the brakes from consumers.
Ford said no injuries had been reported involving the problem.
NHTSA said its Office of Defects investigation has received 124 reports from consumers about problems with the Prius brakes, including four reports that involved crashes and two that resulted in injuries.
Toyota will cooperate fully with NHTSA's investigation," the company said in a statement.
The company also said it changed the braking system software in January for vehicles built since then.
