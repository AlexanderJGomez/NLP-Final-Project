Rather than having dinner with her husband, Walter E. "Eugene" Crum, she spent Thursday night mourning his violent death and taking over the job he held as sheriff of Mingo County, West Virginia.
It took two shots to kill Eugene Crum around noon Wednesday, as he sat in a parking lot near the Mingo County courthouse.
The suspect -- Tennis Melvin Maynard, 37 -- was in critical but stable condition Thursday at Cabell Huntington Hospital, said Rockel.
"We are unsure at this point," Rockel said, why the sheriff was killed.
On Thursday, a source with knowledge of the suspect's past told CNN that Maynard had spent time at a state hospital for mental health issues within the past couple of years.

"The flame that Sheriff Crum sparked cannot be extinguished," Mingo County Prosecuting Attorney C. Michael Sparks said in a statement read at Thursday's press conference in Williamson.
His slaying has shaken the rural county, which normally sees only one or two slayings per year, said Lt. Randy Hatfield of the Mingo County Sheriff's Office.
"It's quite obvious that the last 26 hours have been a difficult time," said Hubbard, president of the Mingo County commission.
