Unlike Dr. Craig Spencer, the 33-year-old now in isolation at Bellevue Hospital in nearby New York City, this second health care worker is not confirmed to have Ebola.
For all the scares, only four people -- starting with Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian who died in a Dallas hospital, followed by two Dallas health care workers who'd treated him, lastly Spencer -- so far have been diagnosed with the deadly virus in the United States.
A mandatory quarantine is called for those who had "direct contact with an individual infected with the Ebola virus,"  including medical workers who treated Ebola patients.
Up through that time, authorities said, Spencer limited his public interactions but did not eliminate them.
Bassett said the chances of anyone contracting the virus from contact with Spencer were "close to nil."
Spencer, employed at New York's Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, has been in isolation at Bellevue since emergency personnel took him there Thursday morning.
"He is a committed and responsible physician who always puts his patients first," the hospital statement said.
The doctor contacted Doctors Without Borders on Thursday to report a fever, the statement said.
Bellevue is designated for the "isolation, identification and treatment of potential Ebola patients" in the city, the statement said.
On Friday, the National Institutes of Health said one of the nurses, Nina Pham, had been declared free of the Ebola virus.
The other nurse, Amber Vinson, who is getting treatment for Ebola at Atlanta's Emory University Hospital, is steadily regaining her strength, and her spirits are high, her family said.
