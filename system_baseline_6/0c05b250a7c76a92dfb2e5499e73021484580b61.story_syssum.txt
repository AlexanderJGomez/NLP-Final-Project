Mhlongo, 49, is one of South Africa's very few senior trackers, honing the traditional skills of trailing animals in the Londolozi game reserve.
"It's the connection to nature, to wilderness," says van den Heever of the deep bond he's created with Mhlongo.
Today, Mhlongo and van den Heever use their vast knowledge and experience to pass on their Bushveld wisdom to younger generations.
Mhlongo says he is passionate about teaching his valuable skills to aspiring trackers.
