London, England (CNN) -- Passengers on Monday vented their fury at Eurostar management as train services between England and France were canceled for a third day, leaving thousands stranded.
There was some good news though for stranded passengers, as Eurostar said they would resume a partial service Tuesday.
However, Nicolas Petrovic, Eurostar chief operation officer said a full service would not resume until after Christmas, according to AFP.
The trains that broke down in the tunnel malfunctioned because the air inside was warmer than that outside the tunnel entrance in France, Eurostar spokeswoman Amelle Mouhaddib said.
It is 50.5 kilometers (31.4 miles) long, 38 kilometers (23 miles) of which are underwater.
