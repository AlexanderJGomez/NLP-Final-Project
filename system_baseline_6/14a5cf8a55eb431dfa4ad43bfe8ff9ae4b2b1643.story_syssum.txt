Davos, Switzerland (CNN) -- Free trade, transparency and a crackdown on tax cheats will be at the heart of Britain's G8 presidency, Prime Minister David Cameron told the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday as he set out his vision for a more competitive Europe.
Cameron said the European Union and the G8 -- made up of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Britain and the United States -- all face the "looming, insistent question" of how to compete and succeed in the global economic race.
Britain's desire to renegotiate the terms of its EU membership is based on the need to gain the consent of the people as they follow a path within Europe, he said.
Far from being isolationist, Britain is a "very positive player" in the European Union, Cameron added.
Cameron said the biggest thing that Britain and America could do together is to work on an EU-U.S. trade deal.
Meanwhile, transparency about the flow of money is key to poorer countries moving from poverty to growth, Cameron said.
But critics -- including his party's coalition partner, the Liberal Democrats -- say now is not the time to create uncertainty among businesses and industry over Britain's future in the European Union.
"I am confident that if there is to be a referendum one day, the UK citizens will decide to stay in the EU and contribute to shape its future," he said.
