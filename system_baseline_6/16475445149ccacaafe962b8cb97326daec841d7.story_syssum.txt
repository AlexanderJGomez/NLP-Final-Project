(CNN) -- He's known as "The Little Master" and now Sachin Tendulkar can lay claim to being the only man in cricket history to reach 100 international centuries.
"A year ago when I got my 99th hundred the media began talking about it.
Despite Tendulkar's heroics, Bangladesh eventually scored an upset victory in the Asia Cup match by five wickets.
It took only a little gloss off the earlier milestone for 39-year-old Tendulkar, who is India's most high-profile sporting icon in a country where cricket is a religion.
Tendulkar became the first man to reach 50 centuries in 2000 and surpassed West Indian batsman Brian Lara's record for the highest number of Test runs in 2008.
Tendulkar recorded his 99th international hundred over a year ago as part of India's successful World Cup campaign on home soil.
South Africa's Jacques Kallis is third on the all-time list with 59.
