AUSTIN, Texas (CNN) -- Monday, in the much anticipated New Haven, Connecticut, firefighters' case, the Supreme Court reversed an opinion joined by Judge Sonia Sotomayor, President Obama's Supreme Court nominee.
More significantly, after Burger had been confirmed, the Court reversed him again, this time in a major case -- Powell v. McCormack.
When the case reached the Supreme Court, a lengthy opinion by Chief Justice Earl Warren held that courts could rule in such a case and that a House of Congress could only exclude someone if that person did not meet the qualifications, age, citizenship and residence requirements set forth in the Constitution.
Only once in the past 15 years has the Republican majority voted in favor of minorities in an affirmative action case.
What the New Haven case showed was that Republicans have been winning presidential elections and therefore gaining Supreme Court nominations more often than Democrats for the past generation.
Some Republican senators may try to use the New Haven majority to paint Sotomayor as out of the mainstream.
