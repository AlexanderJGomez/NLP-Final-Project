"The media attention to protests in Delhi has raised awareness on issues of violence against women in Nepal," said Manju Gurung, of Pourakhi, an organization that advocates for female migrant workers.
"This case is representative of several others that go unreported," Gurung said.
On November 18, the woman returned home to Nepal on vacation from Saudi Arabia, where she works as a domestic worker, said Basanta Bahadur Basnet, a lawyer who represents the woman.
Parsuram Basnet has been suspended from his job as a police officer at the airport, but he cannot be removed from his job until the verdict, said Dhiraj Pratap Shingh, a spokesman for Kathmandu District Police.
Although married, he had told the woman that he would marry her, his attorney said.
"We are pushing for female immigration officers at the airport and strict monitoring to prevent such incidents," Gurung said.
