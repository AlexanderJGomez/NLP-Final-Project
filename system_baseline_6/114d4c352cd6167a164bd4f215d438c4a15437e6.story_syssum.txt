"We want to cover the top of nearly every building in the city with trees," said Melki.
"Even planting just one on each would result in as many trees as there are in New York's Central Park," he said.
Melki estimates the total cost of the project at $3.5-4 million and is currently lobbying for the Wonder Forest via NGO ReAct and a Facebook page.
"Even if all the trees and their installation is provided, if the residents don't subsequently get involved, then the plan will fail," said Melki.
