We use antibiotics to treat bacterial infections.
Over time, we are often forced to develop new antibiotics to beat infections that were previously treated easily.
In this case, CRE infections kill about half of patients who have bloodstream infections.
Over time, though, a strain of bacteria, known as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, became a problem in hospitals.
Every time we use antibiotics, we give bacteria a chance to evolve.
Each time we use antibiotics unnecessarily, say to treat a virus, we make the problem worse.
It's much, much more likely, though, that these same people will ask for antibiotics when they get a cold.
