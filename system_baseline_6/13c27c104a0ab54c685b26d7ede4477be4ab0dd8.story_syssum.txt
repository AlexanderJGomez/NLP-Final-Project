Eleanor Coppola with husband Francis.
Here Eleanor Coppola talks exclusively to CNN about her pride at seeing Sophia win an Oscar, what Francis is really like and just how close "Apocalypse Now" came to disaster.
I think because he spent his life as a director it's just in his nature.
EC: Definitely the ones he has written; the original pieces resonate with his life and aspects that reflect the way his life has evolved.
He realized it had more serious themes and considerations and it took him deeper and deeper into himself, the issues of life and death and all the heavy questions of war an epic brings to life.
It just got out of control.
I just had never shot a documentary before.
EC: When you do something that's the most extreme and hardest thing you have ever done -- everything is in jeopardy; your personal life, your financial life is in jeopardy and people's lives were literally in jeopardy.
That is just the way his life is.
EC: It has been deeply satisfying for them to find their way and find their voice, I think particularly for Sophia.
