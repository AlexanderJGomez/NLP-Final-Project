In another matter relating to Loughner, Burns said he would not make a ruling on a defense request to withhold two new mug shots of Loughner taken by the U.S.
Burns was assigned to the Loughner case by the 9th Circuit Court, where he's based, after Arizona federal judges recused themselves from the case because their state's chief federal judge was allegedly killed by Loughner.
Federal prosecutors also opposed publicly disclosing the inventory of their search of Loughner's house after the shooting, arguing in court papers that the media doesn't have a right to search warrant materials until a formal indictment against Loughner is made.
The publishing company for the Arizona Republic newspaper and the Phoenix television station KPNX Broadcasting Co. were seeking to make public the results -- or returns -- of at least two search warrants executed in the Loughner case, one issued by a Pima County judge on the day of the shootings and another issued January 12.
The federal government will prosecute Loughner before state prosecutors pursue a criminal case against him, federal and state prosecutors said this month.
Two federal judicial sources told CNN last month they expect Loughner's attorneys to ask that any trial be moved out of Arizona, possibly to San Diego, but the Justice Department indicated it would oppose a move.
Federal sources said Silver -- if asked to move the trial -- would consult with officials of the 9th Circuit, the federal judicial region that comprises nine Western states.
