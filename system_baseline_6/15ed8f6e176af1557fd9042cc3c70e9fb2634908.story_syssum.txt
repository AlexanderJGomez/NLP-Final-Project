CNN recently spoke with singer Patrick Stump, bassist Pete Wentz, guitarist Joe Trohman and drummer Andy Hurley about their surprise reunion.
Joe Trohman:  I think a lot of people don't understand that we were kids and that some of us grew up in this band, and we needed a little time away from the band.
Wentz:  I think that there was a lot of "ready, fire, aim" stuff that would go on.
There's the power of "No" and doing things the way that you want to do it and making sure quality is the most important aspect.
Wentz: I took my kid to preschool today, and he has a friend who is really into music there -- this little kid -- and he was like, "I want to play Fall Out Boy right now."
And my kid was like, "I don't.
How mind-blowing is this?
CNN: Fall Out Boy will be embarking on an arena tour later this year.
Wentz:  If you're bummed about the arena tour, you're going to be REAL bummed about the stadium tour!
