Washington (CNN) -- The sweeping health care reform law championed by President Barack Obama was upheld as constitutional by another federal appeals court Tuesday.
It is unclear whether the high court will include this latest ruling with the other pending health care cases already on its docket.
A federal appeals court in Atlanta, considering that suit, had earlier found a key provision of the law to be unconstitutional.
Obama signed the act into law in March 2010.
Among other things, the measure was designed to help millions of uninsured and underinsured Americans receive adequate and affordable health care through a series of government-imposed mandates and subsidies.
