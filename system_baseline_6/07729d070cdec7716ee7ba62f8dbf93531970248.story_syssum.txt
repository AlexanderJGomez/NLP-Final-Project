Chilean miner Edison Pena -- one of 33 miners trapped underground for more than two months before they were rescued -- completed the New York Marathon Sunday, taking five hours and 40 minutes to cover the 26.2-mile course.
During a press conference after the race, Pena said running the marathon was a way to cope with the trauma of being trapped and fearing for his life.
Pena -- a triathlete -- was invited by the NYC Marathon after stories spread about his daily runs in the mine to keep himself fit.
Star-gazing part of the experience of watching some 45,000 runners in the marathon.
