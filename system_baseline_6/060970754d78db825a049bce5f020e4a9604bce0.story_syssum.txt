Demjanjuk lost a U.S. Supreme Court case against his deportation.
The Munich state prosecutor brought the charges against Demjanjuk for his alleged role at the Sobibor death camp in Poland, where the Nazis and their accessories killed at least 167,000 people, according to the U.S Holocaust Memorial Museum.
A federal court restored Demjanjuk's citizenship, ruling the government withheld evidence supporting his case.
