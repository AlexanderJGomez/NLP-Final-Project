Despite the controversial shootings, American and Honduran officials say they both are happy with their collaboration and consider Operation Anvil -- launched in April -- a success.
"The amount of drugs seized and the disruption of narcotrafficking routes speak for themselves," said Jorge Ramon Hernandez Alcerro, the Honduran ambassador to the United States.
A U.S. official with knowledge of the incident said that the preliminary Honduran investigation, as well as a video of the incident, raises doubts about claims by those on the riverboat that they were innocent victims.
Anvil's major innovation is the use of military outposts closer to the drug trafficking routes, known as forward operating locations, for quicker deployment by Honduran police and their DEA advisers.
What's not new is the teamwork between the DEA and vetted Honduran police who participate in the operations, Posivak said.
The DEA "is in Honduras at the request of our government in a support and training capacity," Hernandez said.
"It's not a problem that can be solved by law enforcement alone," he said.
said Rodolfo Pastor Fasquelle, a Honduran historian and former minister of culture, arts and sports.
Hernandez, the Honduran ambassador, counters that Operation Anvil and other programs are not military operations, but law enforcement ones.
Drug cartels exert such influence in the region that both law enforcement and civilian government agencies have been corrupted, he said.
Posivak, the U.S. embassy spokesman, said Operation Anvil has already proven successful at disrupting criminal organizations.
