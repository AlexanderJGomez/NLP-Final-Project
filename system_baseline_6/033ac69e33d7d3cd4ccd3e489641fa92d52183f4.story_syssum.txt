This proliferation of protests is good.
That's especially true when people are willing to flex their citizen muscles during the start of peak shopping season.
Faith groups and grassroots organizers like Communities Creating Opportunity and the Organization for Black Struggle have, since this summer, been engaging people in Ferguson to organize and advocate for reforms, to register, to vote, to understand the makeup and the methods of the city council and the state legislature.
But what the grassroots organizers in Ferguson teach us is that there is no avoiding politics.
This is why the organization I run, Citizen University, is working with partners around the country to teach people about the skills and systems of power.
It requires organization.
It requires patient instruction in citizenship.
And so should we all.
