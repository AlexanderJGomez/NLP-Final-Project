I want to cry thinking that CNN and people recognize the poverty that is out there so we can help even more people.
For many years, I felt alone making money, giving it away helping the less fortunate, and now I'm being recognized for doing what I vowed to do.
By showing how we are coming together, networking with people to find solutions for helping them, I pray that other areas around the U.S. will come together with their local people to make a difference.
...
People who are homeless, we'll help them get shelter; people who are hungry, we're going to feed them; people who have utilities off, we're going to turn them on; people that need transportation, we'll help fix their cars.
I'm 60 now, and I'm going to keep that promise for as long as I can breathe.
