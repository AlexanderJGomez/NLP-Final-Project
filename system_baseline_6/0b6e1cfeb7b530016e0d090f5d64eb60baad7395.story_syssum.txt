Several states have attempted to impose specific limits on when and where the church members can protest.
Albert Snyder, Matthew's father, said his son was not gay and the protesters should not have been at the funeral.
During Wednesday's intense one-hour arguments, the attorney for the Snyder side -- Sean Summers -- told the court the pain Albert Snyder suffered occurred before, during and after the funeral.
There was no importuning anyone going to the funeral.
"I believe that the justices heard that and I hope that they realize that this isn't just a case about speech, it's about harassment, targeted harassment at a private person's funeral," Summers said afterward.
Ginsburg jumped in, noting Westboro had picketed the Maryland state Capitol the same day, just before going to the Snyder funeral.
"This is a case about exploiting a private family's grief," she said, "and the question is: Why should the First Amendment tolerate exploiting this Marine's family when you have so many other forums for getting across your message," such as standing in front of the Supreme Court.
Church members have participated in several hundred protests across the country.
Phelps, daughter Shirley Phelps-Roper and other church members had protested near the August 2005 funeral of a soldier in St. Joseph, Missouri.
