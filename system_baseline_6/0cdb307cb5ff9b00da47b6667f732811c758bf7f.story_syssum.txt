Five minutes into the ride, Prepas delivered the first twin with no problem.
Today, five years after delivering those twins in the midst of the chaos that Katrina wreaked, Prepas dwells -- not on the death and destruction that was so well-documented -- but on the life that emerged.
She went to Ghana, Namibia and Zimbabwe in the 1990s to teach midwives in those African countries how best to deal with emergencies.
"I had never in my life seen such a disaster as I had in New Orleans," Prepas says.
They set up three tents at the front of the airport -- green, for walking wounded and pregnant women; yellow, for slightly more serious conditions; red, for critical patients.
Prepas set up a privacy sheet in the tent and prepared a cot.
Prepas still doesn't know how the woman got there.
The paramedics radioed a hospital in Baton Rouge to let them know they were bringing a woman in labor with twins.
"Women are going to have babies out of place," especially during disaster, she says.
One of the toughest things about her job in New Orleans was delivering the babies -- and then walking away.
