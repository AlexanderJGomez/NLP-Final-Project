Tijuana, Mexico (CNN) -- Part of the fence separating the United States and Mexico sits about 50 yards away from hundreds of tunnel-like holes and makeshift tents where people live, stuck between two countries.
Miranda and the others living in El Bordo are stuck in between two countries and their laws.
Miranda was born in Mexico, and 25 years ago he illegally immigrated to the United States, the country where he worked and prospered, where his children were born, educated and given better opportunities.
He grew up in Los Angeles, having arrived in the United States with his parents when he was 4 years old.
"It just feels the gate itself is so far away, even if I'm standing right next to it," Valdez said, staring at the border separating him from the United States.
Since his deportation in April 2011 -- the result of a traffic stop -- Miranda has lived in the slums of the Tijuana River canal.
After having lived in the United States for 25 years, Miranda had a home, a job and, most important, a family: a wife and four children, all American citizens.

"They look at you as a criminal, a drug addict and stuff like that," Barajas said.

He doesn't hide the fact that some of the deportees living at El Bordo are heroin addicts.
"Why?
Back at El Bordo, Miranda wastes no time counting down the days until he returns home.
"I am just waiting for the right time to leave, just the right opportunity to cross over.
