I see signs of a revolution everywhere.
I see it in the faces of good parents, uprooting their lives to get medicine for their children -- and in the children themselves, such as Charlotte, who went from having 300 seizures a week to just one or two a month.
I see this medical marijuana revolution in surprising places.
I waited for the other shoe to drop, but it didn't.
I had my own turn around a couple of years ago, and at the time it was a lonely place to hold a supportive position on medical marijuana.
Even worse, I didn't even know if they would care.
This time around, you will hear from the heads of government agencies earnestly sharing their point of view, both Democratic and Republican senators, and even the President of the United States.
In anticipation of a scientific revolution, the production of research-grade marijuana there has increased 30-fold in just the past year.
There is now promising research into the use of marijuana that could impact tens of thousands of children and adults, including treatment for cancer, epilepsy and Alzheimer's, to name a few.
They want marijuana to be rescheduled.
They want their fellow lawmakers at the state and national level to acknowledge what most of the world, including the citizens of the United States, have known for a long time: Marijuana is a medicine, that should be studied and treated like any other medicine.
I needed to remind them that people, long before me or them, have been trying to do many of these same things for 40 years, and had been rejected every time.
At some point, common sense prevails.
So, here it is: We should legalize medical marijuana.
