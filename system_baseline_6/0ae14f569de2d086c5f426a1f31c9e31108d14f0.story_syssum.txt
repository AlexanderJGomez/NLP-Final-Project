She didn't notice she was pulling into a Delta employee parking lot, where she said she was waved through two security checkpoints and allowed to park.
The airport employee who let her into the secure area told her to go downstairs and go through security as she normally would, Reynolds said.
"TSA is conducting an investigation to determine how an individual without proper credentials accessed the secure area of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport via an airline employee parking lot."
The police report states that Reynolds "was transported back to her vehicle and allowed to move her car" from the parking lot, noting that the delay caused her to miss her 6:30 a.m. flight to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, then on to Costa Rica.
