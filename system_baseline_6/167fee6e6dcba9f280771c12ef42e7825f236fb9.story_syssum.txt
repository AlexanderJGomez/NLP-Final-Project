Baras stumps for money from evangelical Christians to support Jewish settlements in the occupied territories -- land she calls biblical Israel.
They support Israel -- which to them includes Jewish settlements on the occupied West Bank.
Christofaro and Baras are part of a growing alliance between evangelical Christians and Israelis.
One of the most successful Jewish fundraisers, Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, raised $39 million last year from Christian Zionists to fund human services and humanitarian work in Israel and the settlements.
Baras said God called her to this work.
"My parents felt very safe in America ... but there was always a part of them that said there needs to be an Israel in the event that we have another Hitler.
She said she fought back by encouraging support from evangelical Christians in America.
"It is a controversial issue here in Israel as to whether we should be partnering with the Christians in any way," Baras said.
"Israel has many enemies," she said.
