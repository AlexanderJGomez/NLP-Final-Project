Roberto Gomez Bolanos gained fame as a comedian, but he was also a writer, actor, screenwriter, songwriter, film director and TV producer.
Vivar, who played several Chespirito's characters, said that part of Gomez Bolanos' genius was "that he wrote (TV shows) based on the individual actor's or actress' acting ability," which allowed for better and funnier comedy situations.
His son Roberto Gomez Fernandez, also a TV producer, said his father had "an extraordinary knowledge of human nature in many respects," which allowed his TV shows to be translated into multiple languages without losing their comedic impact.
In "El Chapulin Colorado" ("The Red Grasshopper"), Chespirito dressed in a red bodysuit and wore vinyl antennae.
Televisa said Chespirito's TV shows "were watched in Mexico, just like they were watched in Brazil, Thailand or Russia."
