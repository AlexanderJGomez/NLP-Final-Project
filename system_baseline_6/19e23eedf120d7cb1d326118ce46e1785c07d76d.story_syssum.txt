Several hundred people gathered in this suburban community, some 25 miles northeast of San Francisco, with supporters of former officer Johannes Mehserle joined by critics, who said they were calling for justice for his victim, Oscar Grant.
"Free Mehserle," some said.
Police said at its peak, there appeared to be about 300 people at the event.
Mehserle, who is white, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the 2009 shooting death of Grant, an unarmed black man who was on a train platform at the Fruitvale station in nearby Oakland.
They said in a news release they want to make clear that "justice means that Grant's killer, Mehserle, stays in jail and they throw away the key."
Mehserle faces two to four years in prison at his scheduled August 6 sentencing.
Although police said they were prepared for possible clashes, some people in this normally placid town were not unduly concerned that the rallies might get out of control, even though protests after the verdict in nearby Oakland led to the arrest of 78 people.
Mehserle and other Bay Area Rapid Transit police had been called to the Fruitvale station after passengers complained about fights on a train.
