A second, named as Jade, told the court that she had been subjected to an "unsolicited" sexual act by Strauss-Kahn -- who's commonly known by his initials, DSK -- after going to a party at the Tantra sex club in Belgium.
But my behavior is the same with all women," Strauss-Kahn said.
Strauss-Kahn didn't ask and she would have said no had he done so, she said.
Strauss-Kahn on Tuesday denied knowing any of the women at the sex parties were prostitutes, saying he was told by Paszkowski that they were "libertines" who liked sex.
She did not sleep with Strauss-Kahn on that trip, she said.
The court also heard excerpts of testimony given previously by two other sex workers, named as Estelle and Marion, who joined a second trip to Washington with Strauss-Kahn.
The two women had been introduced to Strauss-Kahn as secretaries working for a construction company at which another defendant in the case, businessman David Roquet, was employed.
That comment came after she wondered aloud about the profession of women at a sex party they'd both attended, Ines said in a statement read in court.
Sex workers involved in the parties said they were like orgies.
The trial of Strauss-Kahn, who saw his stellar career plummet to earth after a separate sex scandal that resulted in his arrest in New York in 2011, opened in Lille just over a week ago.
