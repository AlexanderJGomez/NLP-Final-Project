This week, Suu Kyi made a triumphant and stirring return to the world stage, traveling to the West, her home for 24 years before she became an accidental leader of the revolution and the regime's prisoner in her home in Yangon, the generals' new name for Rangoon.
But the most poignant moment of her five-country trip came when she delivered the Nobel Peace Prize lecture in Oslo, Norway.
But then her mother became ill. She traveled to Burma from her home in Oxford to care for her.
Suu Kyi found herself as a top target of the regime.
She stayed a prisoner in Burma and never saw her husband again.
The technique worked because her charisma, spirituality and moral courage inspired not only her people, but the rest of the world.
Without Suu Kyi, the world would not have known about the misery and repression that the junta had foisted on the Burmese people.
For years she was the one who insisted the West should not lift economic sanctions, even when that meant more hardships for her and her people.
But if she and her supporters do, in fact, forge democracy in their country, as now seems probable, it is because she was able to leverage her appeal to bring harsh international sanctions against Burma.
