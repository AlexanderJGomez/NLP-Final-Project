Paris (CNN) -- France's first lady is filing a defamation complaint against the authors of a biography published Thursday which claims she had an affair with a former French minister while seeing President Francois Hollande.
Several books have been published about Hollande and his romantic partners since he was elected.
A friend of the couple goes even further and says in the book that Trierweiler is the "Achilles heel" of Hollande, who can "potentially create a lot of problems for him."
Trierweiler was embroiled in controversy in June after she tweeted support for Royal's opponent during the French parliamentary elections.
