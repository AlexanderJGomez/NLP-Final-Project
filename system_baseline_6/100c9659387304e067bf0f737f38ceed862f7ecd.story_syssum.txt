(CNN) -- Security forces under Hamas rule have tortured Gaza prisoners during the group's five years of rule, a new report said Wednesday.
Abdel Karim Shrair, for example, was charged with collaborating with Israel, the report said.
Islam Shawran, a spokesman for Hamas' Interior Ministry, said Hamas gave Human Rights Watch all of the information it requested, but was surprised that it wasn't taken into consideration.
CNN's Kareem Khadder in Jerusalem contributed to this report.
