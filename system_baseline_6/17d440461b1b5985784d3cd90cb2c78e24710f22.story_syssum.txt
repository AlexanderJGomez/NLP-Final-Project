Google launched a tool called Helpouts on Tuesday in which people can pay to get help from experts over a live video chat similar to Google Hangouts.
Yoga instructors can give personal lessons and suggest corrections based on what they see over the video.
Sometimes you need somebody to look over your shoulder, somebody to show you the way," said Udi Manber, Google's vice president of engineering.
Manber said Helpouts remove space and time barriers to make getting professional services more efficient and convenient.
For now, Google is screening people and companies that want to offer their services through Helpouts.
Google Helpouts are HIPPA compliant to address privacy concerns, and Google is checking credentials for any providers in the medical field.
Payment is handled by Google Wallet, and all the prices are set by the experts offing the Helpouts.
People who want to share their expertise for free could also flock to Helpouts, according to Manber, who said it could open up a whole new new way to volunteer.
