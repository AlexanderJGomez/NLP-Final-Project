At least four people were killed in the first attack Wednesday, Madale said.
Last month, another bombing at a hotel in the capital left five people dead and at least 15 wounded, a government spokesman said.
And a recent joint raid by Kenyan and Somali forces killed at least 30 people believed to be part of that group.
At least four Somali government soldiers and one African Union soldier were killed in that attack, according to journalists at the scene.
