(CNN) -- Scientists at the Large Hadron Collider managed to make two proton beams collide at high energy Tuesday, marking a "new territory" in physics, according to CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research.
The collider may help scientists discover new properties of nature.
"It will be the beginning of a long period of running the accelerator with beams at this energy," Sutton said.
"It's going into a new energy region," she said.
