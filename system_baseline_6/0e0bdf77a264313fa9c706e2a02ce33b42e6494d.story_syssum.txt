Since then, "drinking a chalice of poison" has became part of Iranian political lexicon, and many analysts have asked whether Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Khomeini's successor, would raise the chalice and surrender to demands by the West to end Iran's nuclear program.
Iran claims that its program is peaceful, but Khamenei's refusal to end uranium enrichment activities -- a process that can lead to making nuclear fuel as well as nuclear bombs -- has landed the country under crippling sanctions.
Iran can develop its gas and oil fields, and the economy can leap forward.
Another critic, Sadeq Ziba, said in December "the nuclear program has hurt the country more than the war."
The Lausanne agreement allows Iran to spin 5,000 centrifuges and avoid national humiliation.
Khamenei can claim that Iran is the winner in the country's decade-long confrontation with the West -- a legacy that he wants to leave behind.
