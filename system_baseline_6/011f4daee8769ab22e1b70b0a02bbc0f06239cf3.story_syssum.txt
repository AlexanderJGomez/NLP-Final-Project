The 46th Farnborough International Airshow will commemorate the first show ever held in 1948 at this year's event in Hampshire which runs from July 14 to 20.
As well as displaying aircraft for the public, Farnborough has also established itself as one of the world's premier showcases for the aviation business world.
The Airbus A380 also made its UK debut at Farnborough that year.
