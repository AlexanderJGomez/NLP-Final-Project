The judge greeted him with "Good afternoon, Mr. Coke," to which the seemingly calm Coke didn't respond.
Coke was extradited Thursday, two days after he was taken into custody in Jamaica and several hours after he had waived his right to an extradition hearing there.
"At Coke's direction and under his protection, members of his criminal organization sold marijuana and crack cocaine in the New York area and elsewhere, and sent the narcotics proceeds back to Coke and his co-conspirators," the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York said in a news release.
Coke was arrested on Tuesday when Jamaican police recognized him at a checkpoint.
