(CNN) -- Wildlife officials in Colorado say they have killed a bear believed to have been involved in an attack on a teenage boy Friday morning.
Wildlife officials who responded to the scene determined that the black bear had been poking around the campsite before it attacked the teenage boy.
Investigators said they found a ransacked cooler and evidence that food had been eaten before the bear entered the tent.
Earlier this month, a man was killed in a grizzly bear attack in Wyoming's Yellowstone Park.
