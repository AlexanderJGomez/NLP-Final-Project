Moore, Oklahoma (CNN) -- A search-and-rescue effort to find survivors of a monster tornado that pulverized a vast swath of the suburbs of Oklahoma City shifted Tuesday to one of recovery, officials said.
Damage assessments conducted Tuesday showed the tornado packed winds, at times, between 200 and 210 miles per hour, making it an EF5 -- the strongest category of tornadoes measured, the National Weather Service said Tuesday.
Rescue crews were expected to complete a search for victims by late Tuesday, Moore Fire Chief Gary Bird told CNN.
"But you know, that's how it goes," Wilkerson said, his voice shaking.
"I still can't believe this is happening," he said.
Moore residents had about 30 minutes before the massive storm entered the western part of the city, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said.
Of the nine children killed by the storm, authorities said seven died at Plaza Towers Elementary School where the tornado ripped the roof off and collapsed walls.

Todd Lamb said.
"If there is hope to hold on to -- not just in Oklahoma but around the country -- it's the knowledge that the good people there and in Oklahoma are better prepared for this type of storm than most," he said.
"We could have a round 3," CNN meteorologist Ivan Cabrera said.
