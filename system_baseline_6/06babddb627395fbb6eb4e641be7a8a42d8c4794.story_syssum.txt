Local police in Odisha told CNN's sister network in India, CNN-IBN, that seven people had been killed by falling trees.
The storm will continue to fall apart as it moves over land, but tropical-storm-force winds are still possible through early Monday, said CNN Meteorologist Judson Jones.
Many of those evacuated from low-lying coastal areas of Odisha left on foot or by bicycle, Kamal Lochan Mishra said.
Extensive flooding will also disrupt rail and road traffic, and crops are likely to suffer major damage, it said.
Some fear a repeat of what happened on October 29, 1999, when Cyclone 05B, also known as the Odisha Cyclone, made landfall in the same area, killing 10,000 people.
"In a storm of this magnitude there is the potential for widespread damage to crops and livestock in the low-lying coastal areas and houses completely wiped away," said Kunal Shah, the head of World Vision's emergency response in India.
CNN's Khushbu Shah, Tom Sater and Ivan Cabrera contributed to this report.
