At least 87 people were wounded, the center said.
Thursday's explosions took place near an elevated train station where the Red Shirts are gathered, said Col. Sansern Kaewkumnerd, spokesman for the Center for Resolutions under Emergency Situation.
The Red Shirts are occupying a large area nearby.
Abhisit declared a state of emergency April 7, hours after anti-government demonstrators stormed the country's parliament.
