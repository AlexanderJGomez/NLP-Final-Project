(CNN) -- It was like a scene from a big-budget Hollywood disaster movie -- a Godzilla of a fire roaring down the mountain, straight toward Brandon Hanson's Colorado Springs neighborhood.
Paperwork, passports, pictures.
The Hansons scoured through photos posted on online news sites trying see their house.
The fire has forced about 36,000 people to evacuate their homes.
Levinson said she doesn't believe her apartment has been affected.
"That's just one more thing I am having to deal with in the middle of all this," he said.
The family fled the Peregrine neighborhood in northwest Colorado Springs on a two-lane road that quickly turned into a parking lot.
"That is Colorado Springs, the city I was born and raised in, the city that is at war with nature," Sobecki said.
Mark Galley wondered whether he would see his house again in the Mount Shadows neighborhood.
"I keep telling myself it's going to be OK," she said.
"With much sadness we have to report that the Flying W Ranch as well as several homes in the Mountain Shadows area has in fact been burned to the ground," the website said.
Everything looked like it was on fire, smoke everywhere."
People were still trying to go on with life, as though that were possible.
The flames were among the people, in their city.
