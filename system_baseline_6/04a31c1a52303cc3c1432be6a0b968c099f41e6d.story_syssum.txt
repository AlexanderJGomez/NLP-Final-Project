New York (CNN) -- Buddy "Cake Boss" Valastro's gastronomical gifts were of little help when his 32-foot Boston Whaler got lost in heavy fog in New York Harbor.
"I can't see the city," said Valastro, who had owned a boat for about six years.
We started to get really scared."
The boat moved slowly in the dense fog, he said.
Valastro said a fire department vessel responded about 10 minutes after his distress call, followed later by a police boat.
"I want to bake them a cake," he said.
May Day."
