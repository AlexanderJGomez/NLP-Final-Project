Much of what we now take for granted as news has its origins in the information needed by people taking major decisions or at the center of national affairs.
Every day the news gives us stuff that is both interesting for some people and irrelevant to you.
So if you were wondering whether this might be a good time to launch your leadership bid, this would be a good piece to read.
We keep getting information that isn't really for us to know what to do with.
Indeed, we badly need people whose attention is not caught up in the trends of the moment and who are not looking in the same direction as everyone else.
The news wants you to keep reading, but you also know there are times you should stop.
We need news sabbaths.
A flourishing life requires a capacity to recognize the times when the news no longer has anything original or important to teach us; periods when we should refuse imaginative connection with strangers, when we must leave the business of governing, triumphing, failing, creating or killing to others, in the knowledge that we have our own objectives to honor in the brief time still allotted to us.
