Beck recently came out as transgender.
Though she's felt trapped in the wrong body since grade school, Beck didn't come out until after she left the military in 2011.
Beck says she doesn't need people to love, or even like, her.
Beck explains her years of hiding as living like an onion.
Though her identity was hidden, the rest of what Beck offered was true.
I did my best, 150% all the time, and I gave strength and honor and my full brotherhood to every military person I ever worked with."
