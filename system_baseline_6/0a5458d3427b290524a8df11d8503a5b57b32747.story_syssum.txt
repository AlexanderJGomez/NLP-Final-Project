While tending bar at the Holiday Inn in Clinton, New Jersey, Summitt got to chatting with a friendly couple before the night got busy.
The man said something about surgery being expensive.
Summitt said she started shaking and crying.
Just a really nice guy and humanitarian," Satanik said.
Summitt shared the story on Facebook and CNN iReport with a photo of the credit card slip and a picture of Tucker being held by her 16-year-old stepson before they left the dog at the hospital for surgery.
Tucker is recovering at home.
