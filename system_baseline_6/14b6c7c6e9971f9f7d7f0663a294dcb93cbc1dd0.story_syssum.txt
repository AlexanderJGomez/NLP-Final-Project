(Health.com) -- People who take vitamin E supplements regularly for years -- whether they are smokers or nonsmokers -- may lower their risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the lung condition that is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States.
Vitamin E did not lower the risk of asthma, a condition associated with a higher risk of COPD.
One limitation of the study is that the researchers relied on the women to report whether or not they had a diagnosis of COPD, says Michael Sims, M.D., an assistant professor in the pulmonary critical care division at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center.
Currently, no vitamin supplements are recommended to prevent or treat COPD.
The vitamin E intake in the study was far higher, at 300 IU per day.
For people concerned about their lung health, taking vitamin E and C is not a bad idea, says Blumberg.
According to Sims, the new study offers an incentive to look closer at the potential to use vitamin E or other antioxidants to help prevent COPD.
