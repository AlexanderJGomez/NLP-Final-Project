Vanuatu, Samoa and Tonga are this year's new entries to the list.
"For each of these categories we look at information past and present so that we understand not only the current state of a country, but how it has changed over time," says Ethical Traveler.
"We encourage these countries -- Cabo Verde, Lithuania, Mauritius, Palau, Tonga and Uruguay -- to do whatever is necessary to improve conditions," says the report.
