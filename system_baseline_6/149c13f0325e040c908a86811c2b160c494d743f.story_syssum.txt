Times are good, with double digit growth expected for sales of games this calendar year as well as for the hardware that's used to play those games.
"By any barometer," one company executive said in a conference call with analysts, "[it's been] another outstanding year for GameStop."
"Accelerating demand for next-gen hardware including the PlayStation 3 should benefit comparable store sales in the [present] period," Hickey said of the company, who added it is not just demand, but broad demand which is fueling GameStop growth.
Another game which should help GameStop tally record revenues this year is the second expansion pack for Blizzard Entertainment's phenomenally successful multiplayer game World of Warcraft.
Hickey, who is projecting that GameStop shares will top $70 in the next year, says investing in the company "offers investors an opportunity to participate in the growth of the video game market with comparatively less operational volatility than publishers and offers [an investment opportunity based] on the remarkable success of the Wii and DS platforms from Nintendo."
