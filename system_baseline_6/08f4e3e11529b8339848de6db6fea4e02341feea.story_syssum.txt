"It actually feels like a huge beetle shell, or cuticle," says Don Ingber, the director of the Wyss Institute.
"We can get the range of different properties of plastics by changing how we fabricate these."
Shrilk, on the other hand, is fully biodegradable, says Ingber -- a necessity if the product is to succeed.
There's plenty of raw material, says Ingber -- the seafood industry has so much shrimp shell discard "that they have to pay to get it cleared away sometimes" -- but there's still a ways to go.
Perhaps, a new part of the plastics industry will as well.
