Atlanta (CNN) -- Top officials from the Federal Aviation Administration and the air traffic controllers' union kicked off a cross-country tour of air traffic control facilities on Monday, two days after a seventh reported case this year of a controller falling asleep on the job.
"We will do better."
But it's up to the controllers "to take personal responsibility" and get adequate rest during their down time, he said.
On Saturday, the FAA suspended an air traffic controller for sleeping on the job at the Miami Air Route Traffic Control Center.
In at least one incident, the FAA has said, the controller deliberately went to sleep, while some of the others appear to have been accidental.
