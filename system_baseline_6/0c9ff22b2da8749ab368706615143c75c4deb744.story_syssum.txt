(CNN) -- Police are investigating reports that Zahra Baker, the 10-year-old disabled girl who was killed in North Carolina, may have been raped prior to her death, according to police search warrants that were unsealed Tuesday.
In one search warrant, dated October 27, police say they were looking for "latex gloves used while the body of Zahra Baker was dismembered."
Elisa Baker has been arrested on an obstruction charge after police said she admitted to writing a fake ransom note found at the family's home in Hickory.
Authorities said the charges were unrelated to Zahra's disappearance, and he was later released on bail.
