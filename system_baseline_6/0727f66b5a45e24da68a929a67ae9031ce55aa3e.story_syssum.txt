Other Taliban and intelligence sources, however, said doctors were treating Mehsud for wounds he sustained in the drone strike.
Meanwhile Friday, another suspected drone strike killed five people in the village of Zarini, in North Waziristan, two intelligence sources said.
It comes a few days after Mehsud appeared in a video the Pakistani Taliban released.
In the video, al-Balawi said, "We will never forget the blood of our leader Baitullah Mehsud, may God have mercy on his soul," according to a CNN translation.
If al-Balawi did know about the plot, it could indicate a greater degree of communication between the Pakistani Taliban and al Qaeda than previously thought.
Jordanian and U.S. intelligence agencies apparently believed al-Balawi had been rehabilitated from his extremist views and were using him to hunt Ayman al-Zawahiri, al Qaeda's No.
