The girl, Oceana Irizarry, and her father, Ommy Irizarry, 36, of Georgia were struck Sunday afternoon by a plane making an emergency landing, the Federal Aviation Administration said.
Kokomoor said that he was losing altitude fast and had little time to make a decision.
The death investigation -- which is being conducted by the sheriff's office -- will determine if Kokomoor will face any charges, said Rose.
He was a platoon sergeant assigned to Fort Stewart's Warrior Transition Battalion, the Army said.
"Our thoughts and prayers are with the Irizarry family."
