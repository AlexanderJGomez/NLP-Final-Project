Xavi told Barcelona's official Web site: "I want to hang up my boots here.
"I'm very grateful to president [Joan] Laporta and director of sport Txiki Begiristain because they listened to me.
From the moment he became one of the captains of the team, with players like Puyol, Iniesta, Valdés, Messi and Piqué, he has shown the personal and sporting profile which proves that the youth academy has triumphed."
The players will always remember him."
