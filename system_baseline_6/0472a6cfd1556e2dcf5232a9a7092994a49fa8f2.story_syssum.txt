(CNN) -- The shooting death of a 21-year-old Mississippi State University student in a campus dorm room is thought to be an "isolated incident," and there is no indication others are endangered, the school's president said Sunday.
Campus police stepped up patrols, Keenum said, assisted by officers from Starkville and the Oktibbeha County Sheriff's Office.
Campus safety, he said, is a top priority.
"Mississippi State University's main campus is located in a rural, low crime area," the university website said.
