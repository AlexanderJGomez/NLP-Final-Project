Under the command of one of Libya's most well known rebel commanders, Al-Mahdi al-Harati, more than 30 Libyan fighters have made their way into Syria to support the Free Syrian Army rebels in their war against President Bashar al-Assad's regime.
In the past week, at least three more former members of the Tripoli Revolutionary Brigade traveled from the Libyan capital to join their former commander in Syria, two former members of the TRB says.
Mohammed smiles as he recalls the fighting in Libya last year, like now he says, it was during the Holy Month of Ramadan.
We are going to support our brothers in Syria," he said.
Najjair says the no-fly zone enforced in Libya last year helped rebel fighters and allowed them to make great advances.
Last month, a senior Libyan security official told CNN the government was aware of Libyans fighting in Syria, but they were individuals and not government sponsored.
But Libya's government and people have been vocal in their support for the Syrian opposition.
In February, reports of at least four Libyan fighters killed in Syria circulated, but there has been no government confirmation.
If it's not my time it will be another amazing journey another amazing victory.""
