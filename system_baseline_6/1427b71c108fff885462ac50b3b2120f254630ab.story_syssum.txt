LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN) -- Police and soldiers killed at least 133 people during two days of riots between Muslims and Christians in Nigeria last year, Human Rights Watch alleged Monday.
This went on for about 10 minutes or so.
One of them said, 'Today you go die,' and then he shot him in the side.
Police then returned and shot tear gas into the neighbor's house, he testified.
Police and soldiers responded to the riots with deadly force, on the same day the governor of the state issued a "shoot-on-sight" order, Human Rights Watch said.
Human Rights Watch estimates that more than 1,000 people were killed in riots in 2001.
