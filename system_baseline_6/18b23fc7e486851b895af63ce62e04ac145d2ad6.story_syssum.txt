"This is the first time we have won the gold in men's doubles, so it's certainly historic," Sharath told the official Commonwealth Games website.
Elsewhere at the games, Australia won a thrilling women's hockey final, clinching the gold medal after a penalty shoot-out victory against New Zealand.
In shooting, the men's skeet singles title was won by England's Richard Brickell after he beat defending champion Georgios Achilleos from Cyprus in a shoot-off.
