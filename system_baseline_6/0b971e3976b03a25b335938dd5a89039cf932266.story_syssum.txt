ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The Bartendaz of New York want to serve as many young people as possible -- and that's a good thing.
Dozens of New York City schools have adopted Bartendaz moves into their physical education programs through grass-roots networking, Yasin said.
But the kids love it so much, she said, that it became "a tool to motivate the students to actually come to school."
The Bartendaz have also found success teaching juvenile and adult inmates at Rikers Island, the New York jail facility -- an idea met with resistance about five years ago.
And now I can get out of my cell,' " Yasin said.
Having built up respect from teachers and administrators at New York City schools, Yasin and his team were tasked with developing a program to get kids to stop cutting gym class.
said Dr. G (short for Dr. Goodbody), one of the Bartendaz whom Yasin consulted in developing the school initiative.
Crossroads South PE teacher Rachelle Bradley said she hoped to work further with the Bartendaz to incorporate their moves into her teaching.
... Our students don't like structure, and this is more creative," Bradley said.
