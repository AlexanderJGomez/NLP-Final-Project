McCarron got in his lineman's face and Jones pushed him some three yards back, a feat that Notre Dame could never do throughout the game.
"You can call us whatever you want but this was a total team effort," McCarron said after the game.
Notre Dame Fighting Irish head coach Brian Kelly said his team will learn from the loss.
