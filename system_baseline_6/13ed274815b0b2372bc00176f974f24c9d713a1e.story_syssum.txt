Lorna Irungu, 35, had to travel from Kenya to India to receive her third kidney transplant.
Irungu says what she couldn't find was a doctor who would do the tricky third transplant in her own country of Kenya.
The cost of a kidney transplant in the United States can be $25,000 to $150,000, also out of Irungu's price range.
"She had uncontrolled blood pressures, and she was having fever.
But Irungu made it to India.
Irungu said.
"From my experience, the cost here and the quality of care is worth it," Irungu said.
