Last week, citing potential cost overruns in the billions, the New Jersey governor stunned the political establishment by pulling the plug on the largest public transit project in the country.
Christie knows it and so does the Obama administration, which is why Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood was in New Jersey meeting with the governor face-to-face 24 hours after Christie's announcement.
With that, LaHood and Christie agreed to spend the next two weeks discussing proposed ways to save the project and, in Christie's view, limit risks to his state's taxpayers, currently on the hook for a third of the $9 billion project, plus any cost overruns.
Even though the State of New York and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey have committed to pay $3 billion each, New Jersey, like most states, does not have the capacity to absorb possibly hundreds of millions of dollars in cost overruns.
Faced with these realities, Christie seems to be betting the Obama administration won't let the project die, and he may be right.
If Christie is smart, he'll work out a new deal with LaHood, a fellow moderate Republican.
Christie should get what he can from LaHood and chalk up the win for New Jersey taxpayers, who according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, get back 61 cents for every dollar they pay in federal taxes.
