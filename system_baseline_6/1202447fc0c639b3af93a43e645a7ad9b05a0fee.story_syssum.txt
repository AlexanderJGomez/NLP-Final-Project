Much like the Obameter from PolitiFact.com, which tracks U.S. President Barack Obama's promises, the Morsi Meter lists numerous promises Morsi allegedly made while campaigning for the presidency, including offering incentives and promotions for police who restore security in their areas, new penalties for smuggling fuel, and changes on the streets to improve traffic.
Sobhy said that while it's unclear how much power the president will have, he hopes Morsi fulfills promises through selecting "a good government" and gaining public support.
"What matters to me here is how much support we are gaining, unexpectedly," for the Morsi Meter, he said.
Sobhy says the group will soon launch an official English version.
It's a new form of journalism that holds public officials accountable for their campaign promises.
