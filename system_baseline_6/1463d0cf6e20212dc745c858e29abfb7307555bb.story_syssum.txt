Virgin chief Richard Branson has put a time frame on his plan to launch tourists into space, claiming he and his family will blaze a trail for hundreds of fare-paying passengers by blasting off in December 2013.
Virgin executives said the figure was a milestone as it exceeds the existing number of space veterans.
"The initial flights will be sub-orbital, which will give people a taste of space," he said.
But Branson insisted his chief aim was to open space to researchers studying the "global crisis" of climate change.
"Some people will want to focus their time looking out of the vehicle, looking down at the planet or Milky Way, whereas others may want to do spins or tricks," Whitesides told CNN.
Adam Wells, Virgin Galactic's head of design, said the cabin's interior was being kept as minimal as possible to reduce weight and maximize space for floating.
Television screens will probably be too heavy -- and there will be no toilet.
He will be the first Portuguese poet to be read in space.
"If it's successful, it will eventually become much more common and whatever record I set will quickly be broken."
