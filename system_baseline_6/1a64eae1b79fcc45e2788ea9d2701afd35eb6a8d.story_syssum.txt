(CNN) -- Six inches of snow in Chicago.
Many drought-stricken states need a foot of rain, not snow.
Lake City, Minnesota, has received 11.5 inches of snow since Sunday morning, which amounts to about an inch of rain.
But the state is still plagued by "severe," "extreme" and "exceptional" drought, U.S. Drought Monitor said.
Total snowfall in the western half of the country is dropping, said Princeton climatologist Sarah Kapnick, which will mean less accumulation of moisture from snow.
As the current storm reaches the Atlantic coast, dumping snow on the nation's capital, the white precipitation should become slushier and deliver more moisture per foot of snow, according to CNN's Weather Center.
In the parched Plains states, snow hasn't helped enough.
They could use that rain.
