CDC quarantine officers met the plane after one of the 255 passengers was vomiting on the flight, officials said.
"The symptoms of one individual were found to be consistent with another, minor treatable condition unrelated to Ebola," the health department said.
CDC officials removed the man and his daughter while other passengers remained on board.
"He nudged me and asked me to get the flight attendant," Burchett said.
"Immediately they both left and some time passed and they came back and asked him for his name," Burchett said of the flight attendants.
The sick passenger and the girl were taken to the back of the plane, Burchett said.
Nearly two hours after the flight landed, Burchett said, an announcement was made: "Everyone can leave.
"My concern is, if this were something that were highly contagious, we did not seem to have a very good reaction plan," he said.
Costa said he had spoken with the man and his daughter before the flight left Liberia.
In a statement this week, the CDC said quarantine inspectors meet arriving aircraft and ships reporting ill passengers or crew to assist them in getting appropriate medical treatment.
