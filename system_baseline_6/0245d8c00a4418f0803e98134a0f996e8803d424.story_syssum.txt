How do you stand out as loyal to the people you are leading?
Self discipline doesn't have to be hard -- you just have to change the way you think about it.
The next time you feel yourself putting something off because you're afraid -- of uncertainty or failure -- just "do it scared."
Until one fireman said: "that's OK, just do it scared."
It's fine to be scared -- do it scared.
And by just doing something, you create movement and momentum that will lead to progress and results.
To keep yourself motivated, take pride in sticking to your work habits, rather than looking for immediate results.
I have a mental reminder that helps me push past these hurdles.
Having this perspective and faith will help you press forward at the moments when others turn back.
Rather, successful people have realized that getting to the top means that they first have to do the things that they don't want to do related to their goals.
