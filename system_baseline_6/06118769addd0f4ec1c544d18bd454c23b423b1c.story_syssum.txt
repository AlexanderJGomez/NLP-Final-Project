In a record-setting month, it won't be the worst storm that Boston has ever seen, but it will just compound the exasperation caused by three -- now four -- weather systems that have dumped piles of snow on the city.
-- Light snow, relatively speaking: Compared with other storms, this won't be as big a snow event for Boston.
So are parts of eastern Maine, where gusts of 60 mph are possible and up to 26 inches of snow.
-- Storm surge: With high winds the surf along the Massachusetts coast will be harsh.
The snow will be a light snow, so it will fly around easily in the strong winds.
Already, more than 350 flights have been canceled for Sunday.
-- Widespread wind field: If you live in Asheville, North Carolina, you don't have to worry about a blizzard, but the winds will be fierce beginning Saturday evening.
"Wintry precipitation possible early next week," the National Weather Service in Atlanta said.
