(CNN) -- The Obama administration vastly underestimated the tens of thousands of barrels of oil pouring into the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon disaster, despite contrary information from scientists using better methodologies, a report from a national panel investigating the response said Wednesday.
Federal officials have stated that the low flow-rate estimates did not negatively affect their operations to stop the oil spill.
Government officials, reacting to the report, said the response was "in full force and immediate" and that the government adequately warned the public of worst-case spill scenarios.
"The government appears to have taken an overly casual approach to the calculation and release of the 5,000 barrels a day estimate -- which as the only official estimate for most of May, took on great importance," the report said.
Better video and data led to the rise in the daily oil spill estimate, he said.
The federal government later Wednesday said it acted appropriately with regard to spill estimates and the clean-up.
"The facts bear out that the federal response significantly mitigated the impact of the spill," they said.
