Johnson, D-South Dakota, said Thursday he supports strong sanctions against Iran and has legislation adding new sanctions ready to move should Iran fail to meet its obligations under the deal, which is meant to prevent it from acquiring a nuclear weapon.
That deal, if it comes together, would include a new round of sanctions to begin in six months and would bar the enrichment of uranium.

Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Monday the deal is off if new sanctions are imposed.
On Thursday, amid the debate about imposing new sanctions, the administration listed a dozen companies and individuals for helping Iran evade existing sanctions and for providing support for its nuclear program.
"Today's actions should be a stark reminder to businesses, banks and brokers everywhere that we will continue relentlessly to enforce our sanctions, even as we explore the possibility of a long-term, comprehensive resolution of our concerns with Iran's nuclear program," he said.
