Hue is, in many ways, a city of ghosts, of memories and spirits -- and we play on that in Sunday's episode.
In the weeks following the initial North Vietnamese taking of the city of Hue, many hundreds -- if not thousands -- of citizens, deemed dangerous or counterrevolutionary or otherwise undesirable, were summarily executed and buried in unmarked mass graves by the communist forces.
Many, many people were lost, their bodies never identified or recovered.
It's not.
You will see me with some old friends -- and you will, as always in Vietnam, see me eating some amazing food.
