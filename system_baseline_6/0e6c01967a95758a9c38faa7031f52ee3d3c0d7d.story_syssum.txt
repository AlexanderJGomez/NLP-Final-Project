German, 31, was fatally shot on duty Saturday by two teens who had run away from home, police said.
"Debbie and I have been complimented routinely this week by many on what a great job we as parents did in raising Robbie: Someone so loyal, fun, helpful, prankish, caring of others -- a hero," Tim German said, his voice quavering during the memorial Thursday in Longwood, Florida.
He had responded to a scene involving an autistic person, Windermere police Chief Dave Ogden said, standing before German's flag-draped casket.
I know he didn't mean it,'" Ogden recalled German telling him.
Don't take that as me putting the blame on you because that is the furthest thing from the truth.
Using cell phone tracking technology, Kissimmee police officers found the two parked in Goode's car.
When deputies responded to the scene, they found German "lying on the roadway, mortally wounded," the Orange County Sheriff's Office said.
Our deepest sympathy and our heartfelt prayers go out to the friends and family of Officer German.
We have no answers, only questions."
