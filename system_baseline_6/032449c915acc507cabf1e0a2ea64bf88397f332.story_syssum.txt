Okorie Okorocha, the lawyer who initially filed the lawsuit in federal court last week, said his second client called him Thursday morning and said he was fired.
Allred said Tuesday that she and John Doe #1 would discuss if a new lawsuit would be filed against Travolta.
He also said "personality conflicts" with John Doe #1 contributed to the decision.
"Clients come to me," Allred said.
Okorocha, reached by Wednesday afternoon, said he had a text message exchange on Tuesday with his client saying he was called by Allred.
