Since winning his second world F1 title for Renault in 2006, Alonso has endured a frustrating time on the track.
A return to Renault in 2008 saw him slip from third place to fifth in the drivers' championship -- a season that will be forever remembered for the so-called "Crashgate" affair -- and a year later Alonso registered just one podium and finished ninth overall in his worst showing since debuting for Minardi in 2001.
"We are discovering every day new things about the car and new possibilities, so I think the potential is there," he said.
"The car has some good signs and, let's say, the philosophy that the car has been designed is just what we are seeing now on the data.
Alonso will also be forging a new partnership with new teammate Kimi Raikkonen this season.
"I think he's very talented so that is a huge help and a huge motivation for myself first and also for the team, because the team knows it has to deliver a good car because Kimi will deliver a good result," Alonso said.
Alonso's quest for a third drivers' championship title begins in Melbourne on March 16.
