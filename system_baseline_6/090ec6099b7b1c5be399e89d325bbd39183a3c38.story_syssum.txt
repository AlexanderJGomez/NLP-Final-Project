Benghazi, Libya (CNN) -- Hip-hop artists don't often smile, so it was no surprise that Libyan rapper MC Swat scowled suspiciously when I first walked into his cramped, cigarette smoke-filled studio in a former government building in Benghazi.
"Moammar, we're coming with a mass revolution."
"It feels like we're touching freedom," said MC Swat, who often sleeps overnight in his studio.
"You can find men with beards, but they're respectful Muslims," MC Swat said.
