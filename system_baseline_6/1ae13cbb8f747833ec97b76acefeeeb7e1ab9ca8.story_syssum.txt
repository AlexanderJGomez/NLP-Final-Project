The creators, episode director and producer Pam Fryman and cast members Radnor, Neil Patrick Harris (Barney Stinson), Cobie Smulders (Robin Scherbatsky), Alyson Hannigan (Lily Aldrin) and Jason Segel (Marshall Eriksen) teased the upcoming 24-episode season recently at the San Diego Comic-Con.
It ties in with something to come later in the season involving the kids, which Bays said they shot during the second season for whenever the ending arrived.
"How I Met Your Mother" has traditionally used multi-episode narrative arcs and flashbacks to keep the story moving, often jumping in time or extending a season over the course of a year.
"It seems like it's something Marshall wants to tell her in person," Segel said.
I don't know how they've planned time-wise for the season; they could wrap it up in the finale for all we know.
As for the revelation of Milioti in the role of the mother last season, the creators said keeping that secret was the hardest thing they've done on the show.
Everyone else you saw walking around there is the 'How I Met Your Mother' writers (and crew).
The cast members seemed emotional about "How I Met Your Mother" coming to an end, but Harris said they are just trying to enjoy filming this season.
Smulders, who also appears in the season premiere of the new ABC show "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D," said, "It hasn't started to sink in yet.
Literally the words they used to me in season one: 'Well, I just feel like it's really exotic.'
Like Netflix is now giving all these episodes, and they can do really serialized arcs.
