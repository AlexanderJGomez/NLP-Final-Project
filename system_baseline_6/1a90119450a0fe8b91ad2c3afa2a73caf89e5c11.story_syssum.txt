However, with Madiba (as Mandela is often called), I feel like every moment spent with him is a gift, a blessing that I will tell my grandchildren about one day.
However, my stories about my encounters with Nelson Mandela are the stuff of comedy clubs.
I remember thinking, if Nelson Mandela thinks I am gracious -- fantastic.
The one I remember most was around a birthday or Christmas during which there was a photo opportunity at one of his grandson's kindergartens.
Mandela just happened to be an honorary fellow at Magdalene College, where I was studying.
( I didn't.
Or the time, I asked Zelda la Grange, his devoted personal assistant, to take a photo of me and Madiba together before I went up to Cambridge.
That's a complete no-no around Mandela -- his eyes were damaged during his years of imprisonment on Robben Island and flash photography is forbidden.
The ones we sent to friends (and everybody we knew), show us laughing with the world's greatest statesman.
