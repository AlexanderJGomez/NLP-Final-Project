Kofi Annan, joint envoy to Syria for the United Nations and the Arab League, will meet Friday with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Washington to discuss Syria, sources told CNN.
In Syria on Monday, 42 people were killed Monday, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria.
The LCC posted a letter on its Facebook page slamming Russia and China for blocking tougher action against Syria, and criticizing the U.N. observer mission in the country.
"At this time, we are facing a war from abroad," al-Assad said in his first public speech since January.
Thirty-seven people were killed Sunday in Syria, five of them children, the group said.
"The Syrian opposition lacks the means to defend itself, and the regime is getting weapons from everywhere," he said Sunday.
The United Nations for months has said more than 9,000 people have died in Syria.
CNN's Saad Abedine, Holly Yan, Tian Shao, Tracy Doueiry and Richard Roth contributed to this report.
