"Women here were empowered a long time ago, but haven't had a chance to tell our story," said Ghubash.
In searching for a home for the museum, Ghubash turned down a free site in Dubai's official heritage district for an old house in the historic Gold Souk neighborhood she grew up in.
Ghubash, 56, has undertaken the museum project while taking a sabbatical from a career that led to her being listed 36th on Arabian Business magazine's "100 Most Powerful Arab Women" in 2011.
"I came from a family where both parents made sure there were books available in the house," she said.
She is already working on her next project to compile an encyclopaedia of women of the United Arab Emirates.
