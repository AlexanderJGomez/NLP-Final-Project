(CNN) -- The Syrian government is freeing some activists while arresting hundreds of others in its back-and-forth bid to placate protesters and crush dissent, a human rights lawyer said.
This is disputed by activists and eyewitnesses who told CNN that government snipers fired shots at unarmed protesters and government forces beat demonstrators.
There is no judicial system in Syria and the security apparatus arrests people and send them to courts directly," she said.
Omar al-Abdallah, 26, was accused of "taking actions and making threat(ening) statements against the state in Syria," his brother said.
