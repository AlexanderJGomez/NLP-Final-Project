What she couldn't know then is that her son would have autism.
Researchers have found some genetic areas associated with autism, but it could take years before the gene or genes that cause autism or contribute to it will be determined.
"We wouldn't be able to screen a donor for autism because we don't yet know the specific genes that are contributing to autism," Dawson said.
Jackaway says she had to accept that "I don't have that child I thought I was going to have.
