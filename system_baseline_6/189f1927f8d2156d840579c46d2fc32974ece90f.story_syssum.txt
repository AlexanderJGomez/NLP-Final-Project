Now it's seeking public help to keep Hong Kong's neon heritage ablaze.
To drum up interest in its new acquisition, M+ is holding an online exhibition of Hong Kong's neon signs.
"Neon signage is a highly under-researched topic," says Chen.
The neon cow that will enter the M+ collection was deemed unfit as, at 4.5 meters wide, it busts official size limits.
The lights are tricky and expensive to make, requiring a neon tube-bending technician and, for something like the neon cow, a budget of HK$250,000 ($32,225).
"Many cities in China no longer support neon signage and this inevitably affects Hong Kong's businesses," says Tam.
In terms of quantity, neon will recede.
