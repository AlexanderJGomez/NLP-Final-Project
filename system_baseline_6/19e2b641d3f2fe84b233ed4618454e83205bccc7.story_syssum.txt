Santa Barbara, California (CNN) -- As Elliot Rodger was carrying out a deadly rampage Friday night around Santa Barbara, his parents were frantically trying to find him, having just received a chilling manifesto from their son.
Lichin Rodger called 911, and the parents set off for Santa Barbara from Los Angeles, according to Astaire.
His mother came across his YouTube videos in April after she hadn't heard from Rodger in a few days, Astaire said.
In fact, Elliot Rodger himself wrote in the manifesto that he worried that someone had discovered his plan when the police visited.
For a few horrible seconds I thought it was all over.
Rodger had been seeing therapists on and off since he was 8, according to Astaire.
But Astaire said Rodger didn't seem to have violent tendencies.
Astaire told CNN that Rodger never expressed any fascination with guns.
"(His parents) were conscious and concerned about their son's health," Astaire said.
