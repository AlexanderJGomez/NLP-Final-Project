(CNN) -- Police expanded their search Friday for a man who either jumped or fell from a small plane as it flew off the Florida coast near Miami.
A police spokeswoman said it was unclear whether Nales accidentally fell out of the plane or deliberately jumped.
The pilot first told air traffic controllers that a door was open on the plane, then added that a passenger had fallen out.
