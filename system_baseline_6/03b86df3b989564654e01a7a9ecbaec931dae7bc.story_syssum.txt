To transform this positive choice into a global movement, Stein and I created the first World Vasectomy Day in 2013 -- and set out to inspire 100 doctors in 25 countries to do 1,000 vasectomies.
Yes, there are places, like New Zealand, where 20% of men choose vasectomies, but there are countries where the rate is less than 1%.
Sadly, while men waffle on the sidelines, more than 300 million women have had tubal ligations -- six times the number of men having vasectomies, even though tubal ligations are more invasive, costly and risky.
The Swahili language uses the same word for "vasectomy" and "castration" and that sums up what so many men believe.
In my travels, I met men in their 20s who know they don't want children and men in their 70s who do.
The bottom line is that all methods of birth control come with some element of risk.
What we learned in creating World Vasectomy Day bodes well for our future.
