The Greenbrier course in West Virginia is closely associated with Snead, who lived in the area and Woods said he was "excited" about the prospect of claiming a fourth win this season to draw nearer to the legendary golfer.
"Yesterday was a silent day, but I think everyone saved it up for today," said Woods, who had the added pressure of being the tournament host in Maryland.
"I think he's the only guy to win three tournaments on tour this year -- on three different golf courses," Van Pelt said.
