NASA officials this week announced plans for a new mission to monitor air pollution in the Baltimore-Washington traffic corridor that will include a series of low-altitude flights between the two cities.
All flights will be posted on the NASA website the night before takeoff.
Pickering said that these experiments "will help NASA design a next generation of air-quality satellites" leading to analyses for cities across the country, so that "ultimately public health can be better protected."
In fact, NASA is hoping the new study will help everyone breathe easier.
