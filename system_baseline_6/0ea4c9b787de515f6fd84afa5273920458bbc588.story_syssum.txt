The International Energy Agency estimates CCS could reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by more than 85 percent.
Carbon Capture and Storage refers to the process of stripping carbon dioxide from fossil fuels before or after they're burnt to produce energy.
The problem is that while the different processes needed to capture and store carbon dioxide have been around for years, no one has brought them together on a large enough scale to cope with the volume of emissions from a typical power plant.
Professor Haszeldine estimates that if a new power plant costs $1.5 billion to build, it'll cost an extra $700,000 to fit the capture equipment on the first experimental plants.
Energy companies will have to buy all their emissions permits, so from then on any company that stores some or all of its CO2 won't have to pay.
"The problem is that the price of maybe €35 ($54) or €40 ($62) per ton of carbon dioxide will not be enough to fund the gap in the extra estimated cost of these new power plants," explains Professor Haszeldine.
Environmentalists are wary.
Professor Haszeldine says the environmental cost of not doing it could be catastrophic.
