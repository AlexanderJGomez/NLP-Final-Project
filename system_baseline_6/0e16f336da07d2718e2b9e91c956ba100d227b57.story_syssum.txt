International hip-hop artists warm up for their show at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on Tuesday.
The program consists of three weeks of meeting American hip-hop artists and dancers and visiting New York City, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.
"It's like a dream come true for me," Salazar said Tuesday, the day of the team's show, "because I only read their names in the Internet and now, like, I met Afrika Bambaataa, the founder of hip-hop.
I can feel it by watching these [American] hip-hop dancers."
Colombia Barrosse, the vibrant head of the State Department's Cultural Programs Division of the Bureau of Cultural Affairs, says the cultural cross-fertilization is the goal of the program.
With a broad smile, he says, "Hip-hop is such energy.
"Yeah, I see them, all the dancers in the street, the music, all the people that like hip-hop music," he says.
