Myers, a sophomore, told CNN on Friday.
It was just after 12:30 p.m. Friday at Arapahoe High School with its student population of more than 2,200 in Centennial, Colorado, when the shooting began.
"...And that's when I heard the shots."
They soon heard people yelling, and walkie-talkies crackling, and then they heard police asking someone to drop the gun, put the gun down, and hold his arms up, she said.
Initially, the teacher opened the door, he said.
Myers, the sophomore, and his fellow classmates were sitting in the dark when he started to think about his twin brother, Austin.
He knew his brother should be in class.
Then he sent a text message to a friend, who he knew had a class with his brother.
Panicked and in tears, Myers reached out to his father by text message: Dad, Austin is missing.
