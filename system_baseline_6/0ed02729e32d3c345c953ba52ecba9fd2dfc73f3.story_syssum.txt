CNN's Nic Robertson and Nick Paton Walsh, who have reported from inside Syria, analyze the conflict and what the future may hold.
...
It's beginning to nip around the capital, and I don't think any observer at this point thinks that the Assad government really has a chance in terms of retaining long-term power over the country.

What we're going to see in 2013 are large numbers of displaced people, millions internally inside the country.
I mean, two or three months ago, Aleppo was in pieces, really struggling to keep anything going.
Paton Walsh: I think, in many ways, the process of that is under way, with the U.S. trying to influence a government in exile (and) many opposition figures gathering in Doha or Turkey to try and work out how that government would look like.
I don't think we're going to find friends quickly in Syria.
