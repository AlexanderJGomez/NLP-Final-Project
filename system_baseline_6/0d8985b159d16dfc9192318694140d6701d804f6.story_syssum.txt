In recent days, Bitcoins have enjoyed a media buzz as the value of one Bitcoin jumped on several Bitcoin exchanges to more than $200 per Bitcoin.
As a result, Bitcoins seem to present the best of all possible worlds -- the convenience of modern digital payment technology and the stability of a fixed money supply.
So are Bitcoins the currency of the future?
An exchange based on trading kiddy cards does not seem like a sound foundation for a monetary system.
Rather than being a safe place to keep money, the exchange rate of Bitcoins relative to other global currencies has fluctuated wildly.
Bitcoins are not the first attempt to create digital money.
Our banking system is as safe as it is because there are lenders of last resort who can create more money in a crisis to protect the entire system from collapsing in a liquidity crisis.
A financial system based on Bitcoins would have no possibility of there being such a backstop.
