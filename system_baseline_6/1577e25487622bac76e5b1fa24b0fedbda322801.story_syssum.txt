A man stabbed nine people, including the driver of a bus and passengers on Wednesday, in what police are calling a terror attack.
The attacker was a 23-year-old Palestinian from the West Bank city of Tulkarem, authorities said.

Witnesses and police say that when the attacker boarded the bus and stabbed the driver and a few passengers, the driver tried to fight back by spraying the assailant with pepper spray, veering the bus, pumping the brakes and opening the doors.
Five people were either lightly or moderately injured, emergency services said.
