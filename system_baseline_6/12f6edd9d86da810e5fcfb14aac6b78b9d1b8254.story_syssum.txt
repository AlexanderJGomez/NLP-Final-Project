A law enforcement source said investigators were looking into the possibility that the grandson "was trying to take over" the home with his girlfriend and Pagan "wasn't appreciative of the way" his daughter was being treated in the process.
Police said Pagan shot his grandson as the younger man approached the house.
A 4-month-old boy was found unharmed in the home and placed in the care of child welfare authorities, police said.
