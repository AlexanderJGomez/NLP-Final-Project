A video promoted on social media sites tied to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria purports to show Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi leading Friday prayers at the Great Mosque of al-Nuri in Mosul, a move that comes weeks after ISIS seized control of Iraq's second-largest city.
During the sermon, the man said Muslims are sinners if they did not seek this goal of establishing an Islamic state.
CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video, which shows dozens of people, including men who appear to be bodyguards, listening to the sermon and praying.
"The emir of the believers, he will give the sermon," said one of the men who arrived with al-Baghdadi.
Those who accompanied al-Baghdadi took over the first row in the mosque, she said.
Very little is known about al-Baghdadi, but a biography posted on jihadist websites last year said he earned a doctorate in Islamic studies from a university in Baghdad.
