(CNN) -- Calling his drug possession conviction a "wake-up call," U.S. Rep. Trey Radel says he is taking a leave of absence for an unspecified time and will enter an in-patient drug treatment program.
Sometimes in life you need a wake-up call.
Radel said he hopes he can win back the trust of the many people he hurt, including his wife.
Radel said he is aggressively pursuing that help, with the support of friends and loved ones.
Federal agents approached Radel after he left the vehicle, and Radel dropped the cocaine to the street, according to court documents.
He is active on Twitter, where he posts about touring the Capitol, listening to hip-hop, playing guitar and opposing Obamacare.
"Beyond that, this is between Rep. Radel, his family, and his constituents," Boehner's spokesman said.
