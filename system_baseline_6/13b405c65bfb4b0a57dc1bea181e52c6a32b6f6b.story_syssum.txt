(CNN) --     More than 5,000 patients of a South Dakota urology clinic may have been exposed to hepatitis and HIV when the facility reused single-use medical products, state health officials said Friday.
The clinic staff said they routinely reused saline bags and tubing, although both are clearly marked "for single use only," Stahl said.
He said the workers at the clinic told the inspectors they'd been reusing bags and tubing since the clinic opened in 2002.
Fluids from patients can retreat into saline bags and tubing while the equipment is used, and reusing the tubing or saline bags could put patients at risk for contacting diseases from previous patients.
