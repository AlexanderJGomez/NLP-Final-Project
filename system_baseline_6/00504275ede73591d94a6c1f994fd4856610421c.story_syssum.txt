You too, my mother, read my rhymes For love of unforgotten times, And you may chance to hear once more The little feet along the floor.
I know whose love would follow me still, Mother o' mine, O mother o' mine!
If I were damned of body and soul, I know whose prayers would make me whole, Mother o' mine, O mother o' mine!
