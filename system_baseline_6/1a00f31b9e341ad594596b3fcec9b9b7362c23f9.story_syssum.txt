Whether mobile will kill digital advertising is not the most pressing question the industry faces.
If we focus on mobile phones - then it is our expectation that mobile media will take no more than 20% of digital revenues by 2016.
The mobile landscape is fast-paced and will continue to evolve, meaning existing and new challenges will continue to provoke the industry.
So mobile will certainly challenge digital.
To think that mobile could kill off another media format would completely miss the benefit of mobile devices.
So back to the question, will mobile kill digital advertising?
