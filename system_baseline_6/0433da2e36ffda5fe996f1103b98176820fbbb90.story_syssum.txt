A Massachusetts man was arrested Friday on suspicion of obstructing the investigation of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, authorities said.
Matanov is not charged with participating in the bombings, but with trying to hide his connection to the Tsarnaev brothers.
"In addition to deleting information from his computer, Matanov made a number of false statements to federal investigators," the office's statement said.
Attorneys for the men denied the allegations.
