(CNN) -- Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II are to be made into saints this weekend in an unprecedented double papal canonization.
When John XXIII died in June 1963 he was mourned around the world as "Il Papa Buono" ("The Good Pope").
Once he became Pope, John XXIII worked to improve relations between Roman Catholics and other faiths; one of his reforms was to have the phrase "perfidious Jews" removed from the traditional Good Friday prayer.
Today, Pope Gregory XII is considered the only true pontiff from that period: Benedict XIII, John XXIII and his predecessor Alexander V are all regarded as "Antipopes," which is why Roncalli became John XXIII, and not John XXIV when he was elected pope.
