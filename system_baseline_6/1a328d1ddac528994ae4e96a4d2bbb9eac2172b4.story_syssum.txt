And another one.
Why?
Republicans were stunned after the speech.
"Highly effective Clinton speech.
Mitt's speech should have done this."
While speakers at the DNC Tuesday and Wednesday mostly stayed away from the topic, Clinton answered it head-on in his speech, delivering perhaps his biggest moment of the night.
No.
Listen to me," he said, as the crowd roared.
One week after criticizing the platform that Republicans approved at their convention last week, Democrats got a taste of their own medicine on Day Two of their convention.
Fast forward a day: The Wednesday session started with some dissension when delegates approved a change in the party platform to reinstate the 2008 line.
"After a roaring first night that we all proclaimed was successful, they started out Wednesday night with a stumble," said CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen, who has advised Democratic and Republican presidents.
We, not me
But in speech after speech about the slowly recovering economy, Democrats aggressively pushed a common message: We're all in this together.
"It was 'we,' not 'me,' " Hickenlooper said over and over again.
Paul Ryan's RNC speech
Speech after speech dealt several zings at Rep. Paul Ryan's budget plan, a proposal widely backed by the GOP and one that favors tax cuts coupled with large entitlement cuts.
Van Hollen, who's been tapped to play the role of Ryan in debate prep for Vice President Joe Biden, said Romney and Ryan's "obsession with tax breaks for the wealthy is part of a rigid ideology."
Watching the convention this week, it seems those attacks fuel plenty of fire against Romney, one that may not die down anytime soon.
