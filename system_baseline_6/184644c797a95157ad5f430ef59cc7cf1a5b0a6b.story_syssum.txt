(CNN) -- Theresa Borawski sat down heavily on a neighbor's porch, somewhere in between her front door and her good friend's driveway.
At her heaviest in March 2011, Borawski weighed 428 pounds.
"Today, I am 276 pounds lighter, 14 jean sizes smaller, and no longer need a wheelchair, walker or cane to get around.
She was heavy throughout high school and college but says her weight never really affected her life until 2003, when a series of setbacks sent her into a downward spiral.
Over the next four years, Borawski gained weight steadily.
By January 2011, "my life was in complete chaos," Borawski says.
He and Borawski had become friends and chatted often about the future.
"I could barely function," Borawski says.
When the sister hung up, Borawski went to the refrigerator and took out a bottle of peach soda.
I lost 45 pounds between March and Memorial Day."
In October 2011, Borawski walked to her mailbox without a cane for the first time.
Every time she lost 20 pounds, Borawski went to the store and bought a pair of pants in the next size smaller.
Last month, Borawski walked three miles for the first time.
"The key for me was finding a plan that I could live with for the rest of my life," she wrote on iReport.
