"I still use [microblogging website] Weibo for a lot of things but new things like Pengpeng come up all the time -- this one is pretty good actually.
"We have four million users which makes it one of the fastest growing mobile apps in China," Tian told CNN.
Pengpeng uses location-based technology that allows users to meet strangers through playing games.
"We see mobile social apps as something like an amusement park -- you come and you're always playing with other people; you meet them in a 'no pressure' way," he says.
Nevertheless, the progress of Chinese social media is keenly monitored in the West where companies such as Facebook and Google hope to one day re-enter the market.
"Sites such as UMi and Mimi are gaining more and more users -- it won't become mainstream however," Wang says.
As for Pengpeng, users are as anonymous or as open as they want to be.
