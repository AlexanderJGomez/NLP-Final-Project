(CNN) -- The first time an assassin's bullet tried to find her, Maria Santos Gorrostieta escaped, but her husband was killed.
"I will rise up again as many times as God allows me to so that I can keep on seeking, fighting for, and working out plans, projects and actions for the benefit of the people, especially those most in need," Gorrostieta, who was also a medical doctor, said after one of the unsuccessful attacks against her.
Even though a majority of Mexico is safe from drug violence, the newspaper described Gorrostieta's city of Tiquicheo as one where the local drug trade called the shots and, citing unnamed sources, may have factored in its politics.
The former mayor did not reach out to authorities to seek protection or to report threats at any time, Aguilera said.
