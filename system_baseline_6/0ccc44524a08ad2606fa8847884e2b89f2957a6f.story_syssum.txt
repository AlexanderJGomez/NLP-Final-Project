A new Pew Research Center study shows that millennial women are entering the workplace at near wage parity, with the narrowest pay gap on record.
The wage gap has functioned across history to make women dependent on men as providers.
Millennial women can get involved by letting their representatives know they want legislation that addresses wage parity for men and women.
It's much less scary to imagine sexism as something that happens to other women.
Some may take from this new study that millennial women, despite the narrowing wage gap, have a bleak view of their future.
It's that understanding -- that the fight is not over and there is still much more work to be done -- that might make us the generation that crafts workplaces and a world where sexism is truly a thing of the past.
