The family of Cameron Todd Willingham has asked a judge to posthumously clear his name, arguing that he was put to death based on "junk science."
Kuykendall spoke before an Austin judge opened a hearing into the Willingham's family's request for an inquiry into the execution.
In asking Baird to open a "court of inquiry" into the execution, Willingham's family argues that he was put to death for a crime "that modern science reveals may never have been committed."
The Texas Forensic Science Commission is investigating claims that state fire marshals ruled the fatal blaze arson based on outdated or faulty science.
And Corsicana authorities have said that evidence beyond the testimony of state fire marshals supported Willingham's conviction.
