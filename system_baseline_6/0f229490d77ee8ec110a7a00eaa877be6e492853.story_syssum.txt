"The GOP has become an insurgent outlier in American politics.
The piece drew its authority from the authors' identity: Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein, two of Washington's most veteran watchers of Congress.
At the corresponding moment in the Obama administration, Memorial Day 2010, 108 nominees were awaiting action by the Senate.
In the second Clinton administration, facing a Republican Senate, only 74% of nominees were confirmed, taking an average of 110 days.
If those proposals have a faint wistful air to them, blame the inherent difficulty of the problem, not Mann and Ornstein.
In good times, we debate whether government should expand programs or cut taxes -- new benefits in either case.
Which means the solution to the problems so astutely diagnosed by Mann and Ornstein must ultimately be found outside the American political system -- and will not be solved until America's rich and America's elderly become either less fearful or more generous.
