Now plans are under way to go back, even as the future of U.S. human space exploration is under close scrutiny and pressure is growing on NASA to aim for another alien world.
Constellation grew of out the Vision for Space Exploration, outlined by President George Bush in 2004, but its future now lies in the hands of the U.S. Human Space Flight Plans Committee.
"It's like having your sports car that's super safe and your large SUV," said John Olson, director of the NASA office that plans and integrates programs including Constellation.
At this point, NASA is favoring the heavily cratered south pole because of its scientific interest and the possible presence of water ice, Olson said.
A potential manned mission to the Red Planet wouldn't take place until at least 2030, Olson added.
Critics say NASA should skip the moon and set its sights directly on Mars.
But Mars exploration advocates say the country is now much closer to being able to send humans to Mars than it was to sending them to the moon in 1961, when President Kennedy called for a lunar mission by the end of that decade.
Zubrin, who plans to testify before the U.S. Human Space Flight Plans Committee next month, said that if President Obama were to commit the nation to a mission to Mars this year, astronauts could be there by the end of his potential second term in office.
NASA's Olson called the gap a "significant challenge," but said there are no plans to keep the space shuttles flying beyond their current manifest.
