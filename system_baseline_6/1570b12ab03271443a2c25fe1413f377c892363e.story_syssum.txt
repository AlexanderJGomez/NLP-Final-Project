Iranian public opinion is deafeningly silent, a silence that even the media close to the regime has complained about.
Of course, people in taxis -- one of the most political public spheres in Iran -- talk about the elections but there is no discussion.
Less people are seen trying to persuade or convince one another; therefore no political deliberation is taking place.
The supporters of the two Reformist candidates tried to persuade those advocating banning the elections while at the same time engaged in passionate polemics over which one of their candidates was better.
Not only did the reformist and "principalist" candidates [who back the Supreme Leader] attack each other but the principalist ones -- who were supposed to be in a coalition -- also went after one another.
The Facebook pages of the two candidates close to the Reformists are more active and have daily posts.
If the reformist and Green Movement -- which was formed after the disputed 2009 elections -- supporters are present on Facebook the principalist supporters of the regime have tried to "occupy" Google Plus.
The experience of the past election has taught the regime that they must prevent the clash of these publics and their beliefs which could cause the election atmosphere to become antagonistic.
