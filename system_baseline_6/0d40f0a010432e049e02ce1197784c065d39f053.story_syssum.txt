Such has not been the case so far with Evan Ebel, 28, the man suspected of killing Colorado prison chief Tom Clements last week.
Ebel was lost.
He was the son of Jody Mangue and Jack Ebel, an attorney and former oil executive.
One in particular he beat up with a broomstick," said Kurt Frey, who put Ebel's age at the camp somewhere between 15 and 17.
Authorities have said the bullets that killed Clements came from a gun that was found with Ebel, who had handwritten directions to the prison chief's house in his car.
According to Mangue, Ebel's life took a sharp turn after his sister's death.
Mangue and Ebel's father kept in close contact, sending letters, cards and visiting their son when they could.
"So even though, he is depicted as depraved, evil, we know a different person who was loving, kind, thoughtful, generous and sensitive to many in his family and to his friends," Mangue wrote.
Ebel was released from prison in January, after serving seven years -- three for felony menacing, robbery and assault, another four for assaulting a guard.
That time was hard for Ebel, Frey said, and it may have made things worse.
