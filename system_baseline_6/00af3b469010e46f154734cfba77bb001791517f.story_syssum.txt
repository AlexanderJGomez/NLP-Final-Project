(CNN) -- A Florida exterminator and father of four children adopted from Florida's foster care system has told police that a body found in the pest-control truck he was driving is one of them -- his 10-year-old daughter, authorities said Wednesday.
Barahona said he didn't go through with his suicide plan because his son was with him, the document added.
Mary Olsen said.
Scott said the chemicals were so potent that staff caring for the boy at the hospital became ill as well, he said.
The story was corroborated by interviews with the other two children in the home, officials said in court.
Instead, she said, she had left the family's house after speaking with Carmen Barahona, planning to return on Monday.
