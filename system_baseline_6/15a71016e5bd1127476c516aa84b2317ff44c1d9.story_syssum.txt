A year after he pulled back from threatened military attacks on Syria over chemical weapons, Obama told America he now would launch airstrikes against ISIS targets in the country wracked by civil war.
"I have made it clear that we will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country, wherever they are," Obama said.
"It will not involve American combat troops fighting on foreign soil," Obama said.
Also Wednesday, Obama shifted $25 million in military aid to Iraqi forces, including Kurdish fighters in the north combating the ISIS extremists.
That was the case before 9/11, and that remains true today," Obama said in depicting ISIS as a threat to the Middle East, including the people of Iraq and Syria, rather than the U.S. homeland.
"Airstrikes on ISIS strongholds in Syria are a much needed element to degrade the extremist group's capabilities," said Hadi Al Bahra, president of the Syrian National Coalition.
This week, Obama asked Congress for additional authority to arm and train moderate Syrian rebels to fight the ISIS extremists, effectively shifting a covert operation by the CIA to a mission led by the Defense Department.
Most voices in Congress back strong U.S. action against the ISIS fighters.
