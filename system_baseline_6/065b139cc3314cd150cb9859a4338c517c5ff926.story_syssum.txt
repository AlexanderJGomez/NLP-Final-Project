There was little publicity for Seattle's first medical marijuana farmers market held on Sunday.
"Medical marijuana is not legal in the state of Washington," said state Department of Health spokesman Donn Moyer.
"It's a city by city, county by county situation right now," said Philip Dawdy, a spokesman for the Sunday market and medical marijuana advocate who says there is still "an old West" feel to the medical marijuana community in the state.
Still fears persist among medical marijuana users.
Market organizers said they are hopeful that a bill working its way through Washington's legislature will provide medical marijuana users and growers in the state surer legal footing to operate on.
