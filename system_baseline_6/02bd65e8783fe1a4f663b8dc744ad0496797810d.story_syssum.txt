(CNN) -- Still reeling from the January earthquake, Haiti is now in the grip of a deadly cholera outbreak.
Much of the group's health staff is returning to Haiti for this outbreak, and the IRC is trying to help stop the spread of the disease by protecting water sources, educating about proper hygiene, and improving disposal of human waste.
It is a new disease and health professionals in Haiti do not have experience with it," said Margaret Aguirre, director of global communications for International Medical Corps.
For Martone, the outbreak reflects the level of hygiene in Haiti.
"Food, water, housing, jobs and medical -- those are still the same five things that they need," Klein said.
"You have so many camps with tents and tarps that have now rotted and are duct-taped together," Klein said.
While his team tackles housing and the CAN-DO Orphanage Revitalization Project, it is still trying to conduct water and food truck drops.
"Creating self-reliance is the goal," Martone said.
