(CNN) -- Evidence in the case of a Michigan boy who vanished for nearly two weeks before turning up in his father's basement will not be turned over to prosecutors until at least next week, authorities said Wednesday.
There was blood on the pipe, and old scars on the boy's buttocks, the petition said.
The petition quoted the boy's grandmother as saying that he appeared thin and sickly when she last saw him.
Police said the boy had snacks and a sports drink in the basement.
Charlie is staying with relatives, police said.
