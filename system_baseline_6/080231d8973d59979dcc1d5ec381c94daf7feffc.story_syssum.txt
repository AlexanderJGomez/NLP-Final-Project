But Willimon, 35, is willing to talk about plenty of other things: the show's Emmy nominations -- including best drama -- the value of power, the balance between idealism and cynicism and who some of his models are.
Beau Willimon: I always keep my expectations pretty low.
Willimon: Well, beyond the pale ethically for most people, sure.
I really don't think it's a show about politics at all.
CNN: Francis often says that he prefers power over money.
They didn't.
Willimon: I don't consider myself to be a cynic nor the show to be cynical.
He says, I've got people over here who think this, and people over there who think that.
Willimon: Sure.
CNN: I do find the sausage-making ugly.
I don't think that the media actually has the power to determine the course of history.
But I just see that as a function of the media doing what it has always done since the first leaflet was printed -- trying to find its audience and keep them engaged.
Willimon: There are so many.
It's an epic American story that happens to be real.
Willimon: I wish I could tell you, but I'm not going to.
