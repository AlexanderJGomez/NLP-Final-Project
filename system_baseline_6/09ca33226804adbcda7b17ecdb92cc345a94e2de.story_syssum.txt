Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora died in the terror attack, saw al-Megrahi a week ago in Libya, he said Tuesday.
"He can walk a few steps," Swire said of al-Megrahi.
Swire thinks al-Megrahi feels guilty about having withdrawn his appeal, since it leaves him with no way to clear his name or for those -- like Swire -- who think he is innocent to have the case reviewed.
"As we have expressed repeatedly to Scottish authorities, we maintain that al-Megrahi should serve out the entirety of his sentence in prison in Scotland," Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a written statement.
"Al-Megrahi ... is very much free, living in the lap of luxury by all accounts," Menendez said.
