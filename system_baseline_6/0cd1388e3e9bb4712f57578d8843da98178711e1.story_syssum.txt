(CNN) -- For several months now, Filipinos have been treated to the spectacle of yet another impeachment trial aired on national television.
Is the "sturm und drang" of political trials the most effective way of cleansing government?
As president, he vowed to bring Arroyo to trial.
If the chief justice is not impeached, then Aquino will have a sworn enemy in the country's highest court.
In 2009, the World Bank complained about "systemic corruption and bid rigging" in Philippine public works projects.
Political trials can be cathartic.
But they have proven to be a riskier and less effective path for anti-corruption reform.
But there will certainly be a court that's friendlier to the president.
Aquino was elected to office on the hope that he can change all that.
