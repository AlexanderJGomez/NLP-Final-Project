The whole world is not doing anything," Adib Shishakly, a member of the Syrian National Coalition, told CNN on Friday.
In a statement released Friday, the coalition said it also would not accept upcoming invitations to meetings in Washington and Moscow.
The news that the National Coalition was pulling out of the meeting came as a surprise to the United States where at least one senior U.S. official warned the move would be counterproductive.
The coalition did not notify the United States ahead of its decision, said the official, who was not authorized to release the information.
The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said 213 people killed in fighting across the country Friday.
The deaths in Aleppo, according to the opposition, occurred when Scud missiles were fired Friday by government forces at rebel strongholds in predominantly residential neighborhoods.
