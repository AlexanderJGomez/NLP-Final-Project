"(The Palestinians) were throwing stones, and the (Israeli) soldiers throw the tear gas.
The families of the boys, as well as Zayed, blame the Israeli military for the killings.
"This is the first time they're shooting to kill here," Zayed said, speaking to CNN while standing on the exact spot outside his home where the two boys were filmed being shot.
The Israeli forces responded with volleys of tear gas while periodically firing rubber-coated bullets from their rifles.
Though Khadder didn't know it at the time, he was filming two Israeli security troops firing their rifles at the Palestinian protesters at the same exact moment when Nouwarah was shot.
The boy was shot just a few steps from where Nouwarah had been wounded.
"Now, we are 20."
His father showed CNN the bloody backpack his son was wearing when he was shot.
"We were surprised when we took the school backpack back from the hospital to find this bullet inside," said the elder Nouwarah.
Regarding the CNN video of the Israeli security forces firing rifles at the Palestinian demonstrators at the moment when Nouwarah was shot, Lerner said the weapons being used had an attachment at the end of the barrel for firing rubber-coated projectiles.
Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department has joined several human rights groups calling for an investigation into the deadly incident.
