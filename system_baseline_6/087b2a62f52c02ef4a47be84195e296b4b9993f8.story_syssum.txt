"The time in prison has been very hard for me," confessed Breno at a news conference on Monday.
Having served 13 months of his sentence, Breno is being allowed to leave prison on day release and has been given the chance to rejoin Bayern as part of the coaching staff at the club's youth academy.
A playing career back in Brazil might be the only option for Breno, with Hoeness claiming he will face deportation from Germany on his release from prison.
Hoeness assured Breno he will receive Bayern's full backing, despite no long being under contract at the club.
