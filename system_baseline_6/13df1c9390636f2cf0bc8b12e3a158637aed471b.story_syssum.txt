Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro told a CNN reporting team Friday that it could continue reporting in the South American country, a day after the government revoked or denied press credentials for CNN journalists.
There they are.
Do it.
CNN correspondents Rafael Romo and Karl Penhaul, and CNN en Español's Osmary Hernandez were often shown prominently in cutaway shots during the state TV broadcast.
I do not accept war propaganda against Venezuela.
Out!"
CNN teams from outside Venezuela were told to book flights back to their home countries.
While the journalists were asked to leave, CNN International and CNN en Español continue to broadcast in Venezuela.
Venezuela also expelled three U.S. diplomats this week, accusing them of conspiring to bring down the government -- an accusation that the State Department has repeatedly denied.
