Katherine Jackson's 40 percent share would go to Michael Jackson's three children after her death, the source said.
The children -- ages 7, 11 and 12 -- will also share 40 percent of the estate's assets and the remaining 20 percent will benefits charities designated by the executors of the will, the source said.
On Wednesday night, a federal law enforcement official said Wednesday night that the Drug Enforcement Administration had joined Jackson's death investigation, once again fanning speculation that drugs may have been involved in the pop icon's passing.
"However, at this time, we have nothing further to comment about the death of Michael Jackson."
"Based on our agreement with Los Angeles investigators, we are waiting on real information to come from viable sources like the Los Angeles medical examiner's office about the death of Michael Jackson," the statement said.

The will said Jackson "intentionally omitted" his former wife and the mother of his two oldest children, Debbie Rowe.
The men said in their filing in Los Angeles Superior Court that control of the estate would allow them to tend to Jackson's numerous outstanding debts, legal cases and business obligations.
Another hearing has been set for Monday.
