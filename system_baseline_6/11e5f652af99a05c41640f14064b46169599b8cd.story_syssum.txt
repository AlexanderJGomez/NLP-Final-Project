LONDON, England (CNN) -- An online petition demanding a formal apology from the British government for its treatment of World War II code-breaker Alan Turing is gaining momentum.
But Turing is clearly someone of international stature," Graham-Cumming said.
Graham-Cumming has not yet received a response from the British government to his request for an apology, nor has he received a reply from Queen Elizabeth II to whom he wrote last week asking that Turing be considered for a posthumous knighthood.
A portrait of Turing is currently on display at the National Portrait Gallery in London, as part of its "Gay Icons" exhibition.
He was one of the six personal icons selected by contributor Chris Smith, Britain's first openly gay Member of Parliament.
