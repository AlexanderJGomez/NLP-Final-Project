Cain said he came to the decision after assessing the impact that the allegations were having on his wife, his family and his supporters.
"Your support has been unwavering and undying," Cain told his supporters.
"Herman Cain provided an important voice to this process," Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann said in a statement.
Respondents said they were most concerned that Cain does not understand important issues, but said the allegations against him contribute to their concern, the newspaper said.
"Ginger White respects Mr. Cain's decision regarding his campaign and indeed would have respected any decision he made," the statement said.
He said the two were friends.
In the interview, Cain said his wife, knew nothing about White nor his financial support for her until the mother of two came forward last week.
Cain told the newspaper he would drop out of the race if his wife asked him to, but quickly added that she wouldn't.
