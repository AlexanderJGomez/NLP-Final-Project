Madeline Loftus, 24, was killed aboard Flight 3407.
Breaking down in tears, she said the game was filled with sadness because "Maddy wasn't here."
Her teammates said they decided to play the game out, because Loftus would've wanted them to play on.
She will always hold a special place in my heart," said Terry Mannor, St. Mary's women's hockey coach.
About 1,000 people gathered at a church in western New York Monday to remember the crash victims.
â€¢ Beverly Eckert was the widow of Sean Rooney, who died in the World Trade Center in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
On the ice rink in Buffalo Saturday, Loftus' friends played with a heavy heart.
Everybody loved being around her," said rink manager Jim Fowler.
"Her classmates were always eager to work with her on projects," said Thomas Marpe, dean of St. Mary's School of Business.
