"It is a sacred thing to create a face," says Wallace Chan, 58, the Chinese artisan jeweler that produced the piece.
It's not the first time that Chan has "created" a human face in a jewel.
"When you work from the back of the jewel, right is left, top is bottom and deep becomes shallow.
This is a painstaking process, but for Chan it is also a meditative one.
"My mind is one with the work, and my physical self is removed from the gemstone," he explains.
In the Eighties he began to practice, using cheap crystals.
Chan was the first Asian artist to exhibit his work at the prestigious Bienalle des Antiquaires in Paris.
Most of his work is sold directly to collectors, who are loath to sell them on.
"Each piece can take me thousands of hours," he says.
