He doesn't know the students," said Nikko Calle, 21, a graduate of Central Falls High School in 2006.
A firestorm has erupted in this Democratic stronghold in recent weeks after 93 teachers, support staff and administrators at Central Falls High School were fired for the low performance of the school, which graduated just 48 percent of its seniors last year.
About 70 young people, most of them graduates of the school and now in college or working, demonstrated peacefully outside the school in the largely Hispanic, working class neighborhood.
"We stand together for our teachers and for our school," said Katherine Lopera, 20, a graduate in 2007.
On the steps outside the school, George McLaughlin shrugged.
The president "hasn't heard our side of the story," said McLaughlin, a member of the teachers' union.
She said the union supports school reform.
As darkness fell at the school, the graduates who had come back said the problems at the school have been oversimplified and that the rest of the nation can't understand the importance of the teachers in the tough environment they live.
"A lot of these teachers here helped me through hard times," he said.
