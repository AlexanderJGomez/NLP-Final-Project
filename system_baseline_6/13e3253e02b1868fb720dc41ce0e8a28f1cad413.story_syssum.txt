"When a big rain would come, she'd always get out and dance in the rain," the teen's mother, Auliea Hanlon, said.
And she had the most beautiful laugh," Hanlon said.

"She could probably out-cook Subway -- vegetables on everything," her mother said.
A 15-year-old Cherice banged up a car and the backyard fence trying to take the canines for a ride, Hanlon said.
"I don't do horror flicks," Hanlon said.
In school, Cherice often excelled.

Hanlon recalls Cherice's last gift to her.
