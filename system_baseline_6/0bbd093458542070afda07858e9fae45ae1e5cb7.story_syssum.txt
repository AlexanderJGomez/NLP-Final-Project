During his reign before retiring in 2012, as worsening income inequality and official corruption fueled mass discontent nationwide, Zhou oversaw the domestic security budget swell to surpass that of the two million-strong Chinese military -- the world's largest.
Zhou was also expelled from the Communist Party, according to state news agency Xinhua, citing a decision made Friday at a meeting of the party central committee's political bureau.
His political skill shone when he was transferred to the oil ministry in Beijing, which later became a giant state-owned oil company and one of Zhou's power bases.
Zhou also developed strong local ties and planted officials loyal to him -- including secretaries he brought from Beijing -- in key postings throughout the province.
Political activists and observers now note the similarity between the Bo and Zhou cases.
"Zhou challenged Xi's authority and threatened his rule -- that's why he's now being held responsible along with his gangs," offered Hu Jia, one of China's leading political dissidents, who was thrown into prison for more than three years on "subversion" charges when Zhou first took over nationwide law enforcement.
The biggest impact was felt in the domestic security apparatus, state oil industry and Sichuan province -- three places Zhou once ruled.
"I think, unlike Bo Xilai, Zhou Yongkang will cooperate with investigators because his family is involved," said analyst Lam, predicting a suspended death sentence for both Zhou and his older son.
