Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Intense rain and gushing flood waters threatened Wednesday to cause more misery in monsoon-bloated Pakistan, where 3 million people are already suffering.
Thousands of others were people already displaced by violence in Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan, according to the United Nations refugee agency.
"We've been working hard over the past year to build a partnership with the people of Pakistan, and this is an essential element of that partnership -- reaching out and helping each other in times of need," Clinton said.
In a special emergency meeting Wednesday, Gilani said the government was doing all it could to address the crisis.
