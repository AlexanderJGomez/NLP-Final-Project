YouTube may be a hot bed for lip dub videos and life-casting teens, but soon sports fans could find a good reason to flock to the site: YouTube is reportedly in talks with the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League to broadcast games live.
Just the other week, it was rumored that YouTube CEO Salar Kamangar will be building out the site's recently instated talent program (last July, the video-sharing site announced its YouTube Partner Grants Program to ramp up quality content) by offering big-name stars their own YouTube channels.
What do you think of the prospect of watching live games on YouTube?
