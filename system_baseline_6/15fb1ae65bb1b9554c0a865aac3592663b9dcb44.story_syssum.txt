Baghdad (CNN) -- A pair of suicide attacks Wednesday morning in Iraq's Diyala province, north of Baghdad, killed at least 16 people and wounded nearly 100 others, authorities said.
The attack in al-Ghalbiya killed at least three people and wounded 26 others, including al-Husseini.
Diyala was an al Qaeda stronghold until 2008, when Iraqi security forces, backed by U.S. troops, conducted major military operations in the province to push the militants out.
