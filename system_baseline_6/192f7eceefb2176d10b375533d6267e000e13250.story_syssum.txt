Gene Seymour says we want to relive Michael Jackson's youth, not the sad and bizarre aspects of his later life.
And also because most of what we'd been hearing about Jackson's personal life over the last decade and a half had been bizarre, sordid and sad.
Let us see that transfiguring moment 15 years later at the Motown Anniversary TV special when Jackson seized dominion over the pop firmament with his shattering, moon-walking recital of "Billie Jean."
As surely as he was the King of Pop, Jackson was also a high priest of wish fulfillment.
And Michael Jackson, in the early 1980s, was a pop phenomenon powerful enough to pool together previously polarized audiences -- heavy metal, disco, funk -- and get them all on the same bandwagon.
But time (by far, Jackson's worst and most formidable enemy) couldn't stop even his most devoted admirers from wondering what drove him to change his appearance so drastically over the years.
However divided (or worse) we may have felt about Michael Jackson at the end, we cherish how he brought out the best in us at the beginning.
Whatever the days ahead, that will be more than enough for now, forever.
