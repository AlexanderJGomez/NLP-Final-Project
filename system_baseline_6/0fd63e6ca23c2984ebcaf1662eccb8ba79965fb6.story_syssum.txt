But the realities of life for professional athletes, whose job requires them to spend months on the road each year, means they become every bit as travel hardened as the most experienced sales executive.
That means many hotels boasting state-of-the-art gym equipment, to allow athletes to work out on the road.
Mike Jorgensen, general manager of the Westin Copley Place, said about half of the baseball teams that come to town to play the Red Sox stay at his hotel.
Jorgensen said football teams in particular had special demands around food and drink.
"Football teams want to make sure we have on every floor Gatorade, Powerade, fruit," he said.
