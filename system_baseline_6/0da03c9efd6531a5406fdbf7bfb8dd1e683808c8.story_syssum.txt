GAZA CITY, Gaza (CNN) -- Israeli forces fired on a U.N. aid convoy Thursday in Gaza, killing at least one contract worker and prompting the U.N. to halt some of its operations in Gaza, U.N. officials said.
Ging expressed frustration with the Israeli military, which he said cleared the convoy to travel into Gaza.
Ging said an Israeli liaison did not dispute that Israeli forces fired on the vehicle.
Palestinian medical sources said Thursday that 765 Palestinians have died in Gaza -- nearly 40 percent of them women and children -- since the Israeli military operation began.
More than 20 rockets were fired into Israel on Thursday, Israeli police said.
Also, Israeli armored bulldozers demolished a home in Gaza "just as the lull was supposed to go into effect," he said.
A three-hour truce on Wednesday was also marred by fighting which Israeli officials said were in retaliation for Hamas attacks on Israeli forces.
The Israeli military returned fire across the border and suggested that residents of northern Israel stay near their shelters.
