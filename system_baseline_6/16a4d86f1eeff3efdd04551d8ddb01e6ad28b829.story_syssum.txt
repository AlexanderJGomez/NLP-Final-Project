After completing four tours of duty in Iraq with at least 160 confirmed sniper kills, Kyle said he never had regrets about plying his deadly trade.
"It was my duty to shoot and I don't regret it," Kyle wrote in his book.
Kyle, they say, was one of tens of thousands of troops who served heroically in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
But there is a side to Kyle that's overlooked.
Ventura said the incident never happened and sued Kyle for defamation.
And then there's the story Kyle told of how he killed two men who tried to carjack him while he was stopped at a gas station along a rural highway southwest of Dallas.
He was the most celebrated war hero of our time," Mooney said.
At Kyle's funeral, which, befitting the grandeur of his legend, was held in the Dallas Cowboys' massive football stadium, Taya Kyle did not shy away from her husband's darker side.
"War one day; peace the next," Kyle wrote in his book.
"We're trained to go out and kill people," Chris Kyle wrote in his autobiography.
