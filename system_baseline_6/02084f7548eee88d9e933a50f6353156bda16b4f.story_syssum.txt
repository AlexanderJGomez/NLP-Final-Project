BUCKLIN, Kansas (CNN) -- Rob Sellard's young wheat field is a stark reminder that no matter how bad the economy, farmers are always at nature's mercy.
This wheat crop here, when we fertilized last August or September, fertilizer was $1,100," Sellard says.
2008 saw record wheat prices, and the Sellards also raise Black Angus cattle -- the ones that make those tasty steaks that corporate execs once spent so lavishly on.
Grain prices are low compared with last season, when record prices helped some farmers make a good profit in Kansas and across the country.
"You can read all you want, the sensationalism of high prices a year ago," he says.
"I think that farmers for the most part up our way, there is no question that net income has increased the last two years significantly to what it was, due to the commodity prices going up to what they did," he says.
He already has seen sales of used tractors slow.
"There is less consumption going on, so [the grain is] not going to be moving out of here," he says.
