Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was treated with blood thinners on Monday at a New York hospital to help dissolve a blood clot in her head and doctors were confident she would make a full recovery.
Clots can form inside veins or arteries or even the heart, the NIH says.
President Barack Obama has nominated Sen. John Kerry to succeed her.
