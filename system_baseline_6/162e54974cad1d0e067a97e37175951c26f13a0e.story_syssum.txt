CNN's Kyra Phillips asked Fallon about his resignation and about U.S. policy regarding Iraq and Iran.
...
Fallon: What was important was not me.
...
Phillips: So when talk of the third war came out, a war with Iran, the president didn't say to you, "This is what I want to do," and did you stand up and say, "No, sir.
Again, don't believe for a second that the president really wants to go to war with Iran.
Are you?
She would have a few things to say.
The important items were the people, what they're doing, how to get this job done, how to get the war ended and get our people home.
There's a very, very important military role here in providing stability and security in this country, but that's not going to be successful, as we know, without lots of other people playing a hand.
People have to have confidence in their futures.
We want to have the majority of our people back and we want the war ended.
