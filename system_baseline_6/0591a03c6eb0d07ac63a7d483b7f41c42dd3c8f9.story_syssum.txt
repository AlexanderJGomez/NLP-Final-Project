The magic is photography.
In photography, the equivalent is taking an image that evokes strong feelings, regardless of which device captured the picture or its nostalgic hue.
Some professionals feel threatened as they see the playing field leveling; they interpret it as the end of skill and craft in photography.
For me, photography is my memory.
This little act of magic does not divorce me -- as the critic Susan Sontag implied in her book, "On Photography" -- from the here and now.
When we discover an old, faded, cracked and torn image, we handle it with care and respect.
Because I know that time cannot touch my digital images, I add in the passage of time by using filters.
Let's embrace photography, as it exists now.
