Washington (CNN) -- Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan took a pragmatic approach to the issue of late-term abortion when working as a top lawyer in the Clinton White House, documents released Friday show.
The documents reveal another person heavily involved in the abortion issue: Rahm Emanuel, then a senior adviser in the Clinton White House.
Kagan also was heavily involved in negotiations to clamp down on the tobacco industry.
Kagan, then 37, also noted proposals from within the administration might go too far and later be declared unconstitutional by the federal courts.
Until she she stepped down last month, Kagan was the administration's solicitor general, which argues federal government cases before the Supreme Court.
Kagan supported that view, but she and others in the Clinton White House also wanted to clarify that race-based decisions were sometimes justified in the name of diversity -- "to mend (without ending) affirmative action."
