Atlanta (CNN) -- A North Georgia chapter of the Ku Klux Klan has applied to "adopt" a stretch of highway in Union County, Georgia, according to paperwork obtained by CNN on Monday.
"We're not racists," Chambers said Monday.
A federal appeals court ruled the state could not bar the KKK from participating in the program, and the high court declined to review the case, letting that ruling stand.
However, the Missouri Department of Transportation eventually kicked the KKK out of the program because members were not picking up trash as agreed, spokesman Bob Brendel said Monday.
"I don't see why we can't (adopt the stretch of highway)," she said.
We're just white people that want to stick with white people.
Just because I'm white, I can't stick with my own group?"
