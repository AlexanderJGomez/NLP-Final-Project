"We think that (lifting sanctions) is the voice of the Zimbabwean people, and that is also the view of all the parties concerned here in Zimbabwe," Yang said, according to the Chinese state-run Xinhua news agency.
According to Xinhua, Mugabe on Friday said sanctions flew in the face of a 1979 agreement with Great Britain that land would be redistributed to compensate farmers.
Mugabe said last December that he was tired of working with the opposition party, which he said "lacked ideology and policies."
He said the West had contributed to his party's defeat in 2008.
