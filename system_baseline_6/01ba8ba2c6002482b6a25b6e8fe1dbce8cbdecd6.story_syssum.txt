The stakes are high in the first debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney, set for Wednesday night in Denver.
Presidential debates can make a difference.
After the second presidential debate of the cycle, CNN wrote that Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry "appears to be holding the ground he gained against President Bush after the first presidential debate."
Maher and SNL can poke fun at the undecided voters, but these people matter -- especially in a tight race like the one between Obama and Romney -- since they make up a small but solid percentage of the electorate.
In 2008, 72% of voters said they were satisfied with the choices, perhaps because both Barack Obama and Sarah Palin were dynamic.
Like the unsatisfied voters, there is a group of voters who haven't started to pay attention to the race.
In the 2004 election, which at first looked like a big Bush victory before the debates in the last month, 10% of voters said they decided in the final 30 days, and Kerry captured 54% to Bush's 44% of this group.
In a race that involves both rallying the base and attracting independents, especially in the swing states, turning moderate support to strong support as well as registered voters to likely voters can be a key to victory.
Certainly, Romney's victory in the primary was one.
Now we get the season premiere of the general election debates with four highly anticipated episodes before the 2012 series finale.
