But even though I take steps to keep my old electronics out of landfills and environmentally disastrous overseas disposal doesn't mean I'm willing to spend large amounts of time and effort to figure out what to do with them.
That iPhone served me well enough for a long time, and there's nothing really wrong with it.
In less than a minute Gazelle.com agreed to buy my old iPhone for $93.
So yes -- if I want to sell my old iPhone, I definitely could make more money elsewhere.
Frankly, if I had to deal with the hassles and risks of selling this phone myself via Craigslist or eBay, and also reverting it back to an older OS so it's bearably functional again to assuage my conscience, that iPhone would keep sitting on my dresser until the next electronics recycling drive.
For instance, before the iPhone 4 was unveiled June 7, Gazelle.com was getting about 25 used iPhones per day.
The Gazelle.com site did not ask me which operating system is on my iPhone 3G.
