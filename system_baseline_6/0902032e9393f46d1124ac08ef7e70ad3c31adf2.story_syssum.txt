Haifa, Israel (CNN) -- Israeli police said Friday that they suspect arson in the wildfire that has killed at least 41 people and injured 17 in northern Israel over the past two days.
More than 15,000 people have been evacuated from villages and towns in the area, emergency officials said.

"I appreciate this much in a time of a humanitarian and ecological crisis.
