Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN)At least six people have died and more than 60 were injured after the roof of a partially built cement factory collapsed Thursday in southwestern Bangladesh, police and fire officials told CNN.
And a November 2012 apparel factory fire on Dhaka's outskirts killed at least 117 people, some of whom jumped from the building to escape the flames.
Yet this hasn't stopped more deadly incidents, including the January deaths of at least 13 people when a fire broke out inside a Dhaka factory.
