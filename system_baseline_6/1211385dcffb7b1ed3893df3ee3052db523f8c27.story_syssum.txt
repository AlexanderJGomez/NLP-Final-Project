The Volvo Ocean Race is in its first weeks of competition, an adventure that will last nine months.
"Our main concern was survival in the first race," says Alec Honey, who competed in 1973-74, when the event begun.
In the early days of the race's history, 200 miles was considered a very good day.
"We prepared ourselves to cope with it.
"It's easy to say that winning the race is the priority," says Ken Read, skipper of 'Puma Ocean Racing, powered by BERG'.
Organizers say it's one of the most demanding team sporting events in the world, with participants this time around set to face countless challenges in the months ahead like their predecessors.
Multi-million dollar sponsorship deals have been signed on on all six boats as well as the event itself.
You will never destroy the adventure that started this race in 1973."
