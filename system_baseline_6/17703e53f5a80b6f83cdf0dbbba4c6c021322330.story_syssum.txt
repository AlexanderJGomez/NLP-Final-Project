Santa Cruz, California (CNN) -- The arrest of Alix Catherine Tichelman in the death of a Google executive has shed a new light on the so-called sugar daddy websites where women are paid, sometimes thousands of dollars a month, by older suitors for their company.
"The women who are on the site, or as we call them 'sugar babies,' are looking for men who can provide financial assistance for them," said Angela Jacob Bermudo with Seeking Arrangement.
Bella, 28, said she's only been intimate with two men.
Critics say the sugar daddy sites are nothing but fronts for prostitution, one of the crimes Tichelman has been charged with.
"Just like traditional relationships you don't sign up and sex isn't part of the arrangement," Bermudo said.
In the case of Tichelman, authorities say she had an "ongoing prostitution relationship" with Hayes.
Tichelman was there at the time, and she called 911.
Now authorities are taking a new look at that death "to make sure there's nothing (else) to it," he said.
