Pam Biggers disappeared while on a business trip to the Florida Panhandle in January 2008.
"It's completely baffling," said her husband, Don Biggers.
"We think she may have initially wandered off on her own," Don Biggers said.
Police searched for Biggers for weeks.
Police and the Biggers family are asking the public for help.
She is a white female who stands 5'8" tall, weighs 135 pounds and has green eyes and gray hair.
