She was terrified that someone would find her boys acting suspiciously and one of them would end up being killed.
But based on my experience defending young black men in the criminal justice system for 30 years, I know her fears are not without foundation.
Here's what we do know: A police officer and a black man interacted, multiple shots were fired, and Michael Brown was 35 feet away from the police car when struck by the shots that killed him.
What we must acknowledge is that we don't yet know enough to be convinced one way or the other.
Many believe that the criminal justice system, from first police interaction to verdict, is infected with a racial bias that taints the possibility of justice as it should be defined.
Consider the very first interactions: A cop and young black male interact on the street, and both give the other a bit of attitude.
The police must.
To break this cycle, police must recognize there is bias in the system, and they make an effort to treat the people they serve with respect.
For those who say that talking about this now is an insensitive way to blame Michael Brown for his own death, nothing could be further from the truth.
