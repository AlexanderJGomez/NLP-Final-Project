Sarah Outen was rescued by the coast guard in rough seas Friday afternoon, the London2London team wrote on its website.
Coincidentally, a second solo British rower is about 280 miles northeast of Outen's position and is also awaiting rescue, Outen's team said.
Outen began her solo circumnavigation April 1, 2011, in London with plans to cycle, row and kayak more than 20,000 miles.
