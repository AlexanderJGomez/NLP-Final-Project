(CNN) -- The search will continue until at least Friday night for 16 people missing since Thursday morning when a helicopter carrying them to an offshore oil platform ditched in the Atlantic Ocean off Newfoundland, Canadian officials said.
The water is 400 feet deep at the site where the helicopter hit the water, he said.
"We will continue to search until there's absolutely no chance that any survivors will be located," he said.
At that time, based on water temperature and the size of the search area, officials will decide whether to continue the effort, he said.
