David Goldman has been locked in a legal battle over custody of his son, Sean Goldman, with the family of the boy's deceased mother.
However, "Sean must be heard in court," he said.
"My son is suffering, and he's losing the innocence of ... a child," Goldman said.
The family said Sean screamed with joy when he found out Thursday that he would not have to leave with his dad.
Smith said Sean was previously put in front of a video camera as adults asked questions.
If the court does not do so, Smith said, he and Goldman hope Chief Justice Gilmar Mendes will.
The family has said Goldman can visit his son.
