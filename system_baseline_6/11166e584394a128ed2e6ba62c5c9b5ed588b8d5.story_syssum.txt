A new report claiming to be the most comprehensive look at global slavery says 30 million people are living as slaves around the world.
"When we started working in this area we realized that we didn't have a good understanding of what exactly the situation of slavery is in the world," she said.
Dafalia said this was a result of the Global Slavery Index using a broader definition of slavery, which included human trafficking, forced labor, as well as practices such as forced marriage, debt bondage and the exploitation of children.
Kevin Bales, one of the report's authors and co-founder of Free the Slaves, said that the global number of slaves was difficult to quantify.
In contrast, said Bales, countries like Brazil led the world in anti-slavery efforts.
"I spend a lot of time talking to people who have been or are in slavery, and when you talk to them about it, they know what the situation is," he said.
