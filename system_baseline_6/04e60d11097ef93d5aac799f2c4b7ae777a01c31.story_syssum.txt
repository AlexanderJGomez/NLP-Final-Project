Egypt's army chief Gen. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has said he would run for president if the Egyptian people wanted him to, state media reported recently.
The country has seen months of political turmoil since its first democratically elected president, Morsy of the Muslim Brotherhood, was deposed by the military and an interim, military-backed government was installed in his place.
At least 49 people were killed and 247 wounded in violence Saturday marking the third anniversary of the January 25 revolution that brought down longtime dictator Hosni Mubarak, Egyptian state media said.
Mansour also said he appealed to prosecutors to review the cases of detainees held without charges from protests, including university students, to ensure that those held for no reason are released.
