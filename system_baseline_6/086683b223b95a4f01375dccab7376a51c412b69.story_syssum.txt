(CNN)Jeffrey Williams admitted he fired the shots that struck two officers in Ferguson, police said, but claimed he wasn't aiming for them.
He said police served a search warrant on Williams' residence where they seized a .40-caliber handgun, "which has been tied to the shell casings that were recovered" at the scene of the shooting.
The shots rang out from a hill overlooking the city's police station shortly after midnight Wednesday, at the end of a protest against the Ferguson Police Department, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said at the time.
McCulloch said the tipster whose information led to Williams' arrest is eligible to receive the reward.
"These police officers were standing there, and they were shot just because they were police officers," he said.
While many protesters have decried the Ferguson Police Department, neither of the officers shot last week were from the city.
Both men have been treated and released.
