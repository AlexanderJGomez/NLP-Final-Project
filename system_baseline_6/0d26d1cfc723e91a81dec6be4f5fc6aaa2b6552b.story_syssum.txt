In that moment, Anderson vowed to stay off drugs, something she'd been unable to do in more than a decade addicted to crack cocaine, even when she was pregnant with her first two children.
Anderson was both.
"I can say with everything in me, with every bit of my breath, that program helped me turn my life around," said Anderson, who now runs a program to help the developmentally disabled in DeKalb County, Georgia.
"It's important in my opinion to have a connection with your spiritual world, your higher power," Anderson said.
She said the crack numbed her pain.
The crack was my job.
Anderson said she even smoked crack as she went into labor with her second child.
Like many addicts, Anderson hit rock bottom before seeking treatment.
Anderson now has everything she had lost for a big part of her adult life: a stable home life, a job.
