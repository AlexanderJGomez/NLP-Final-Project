But the news came too late for Jevon Thomas, a worker who died of a rare cancer in April, penniless and distraught.
It's not known how many of those who worked at ground zero have died of cancer, according to Dr. Michael Crane, director of the World Trade Center Health Program Clinical Center at New York's Mount Sinai School of Medicine.
Thomas was working for a company that installs portable toilets when the planes hit the World Trade Center.
"Instead of everyone uniting, coming together, and figuring out a way to help you, they're figuring out a way of not helping you to save a dollar," Thomas said in 2010.
All he cared about was me and my brother," Monet Thomas says through tears.
When CNN interviewed Thomas two years ago, he said he was "100% sure" his cancer came from his work at ground zero.
"People were very concerned that they were going to pull the trigger on the (federal) coverage too soon and they would end up covering people who didn't have a World Trade Center cancer," Crane says.
Monet Thomas says her father would be "grateful" for the decision to compensate cancer victims who worked at ground zero, even though it took more than a decade.
