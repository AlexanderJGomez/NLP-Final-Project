Long before he joined Robert Kirkman, "Walking Dead" comic book creator, and Frank Darabont, show creator, Nicotero launched his career as a student of zombie icons George A. Romero and Tom Savini.
Greg Nicotero: I appreciate you saying that because every season when I watch the show, I'm constantly looking at what I feel people responded to and what people like, and what I thought was successful or could be refined.
Every year we're able to do that and it's exciting.
I am really proud of Season Four and where the show is going.
The show has been able to attract quite a significant fan base, and what interested me in this collaboration was giving fans a little more of an interactive experience.
What Universal Orlando has been able to do is put fans directly in the middle of the experience.
NIcotero: I am a movie fan.
They're going to connect themselves to the experience, and they now know what it's like to be on the set of "The Walking Dead."
There was a 30th anniversary screening of "Day of the Dead," and I went and hadn't seen George in about two years.
... Robert Kirkman's comic book is really a love letter to George Romero.
The thing I love the most is I've been doing this 30 years, and every day I come to work and still learn more.
