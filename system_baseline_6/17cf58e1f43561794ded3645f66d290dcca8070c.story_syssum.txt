HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN)  -- Deaths in Zimbabwe related to the cholera epidemic are approaching 2,000, the World Health Organization said Tuesday, and close to 40,000 people have been affected by the preventable water-borne disease.
Last month, Mugabe's government declared the cholera epidemic a national emergency.
Zimbabwean Health Minister David Parirenyatwa warned this month that the epidemic could get worse as the rainy season develops.
