Did you slip into a slim-fitting pair of tailored trousers, like Drew Barrymore?
Grade-schoolers started the fad, but now stars like Sarah Jessica Parker, Mary-Kate Olsen, and Kelly Ripa sport 'em.
Better put a sock in it now, or rather you may wind up putting one on with your stacked heel like Leighton Meester.
There's no equivocating about this option.
They offer more variety while providing the same impact.
