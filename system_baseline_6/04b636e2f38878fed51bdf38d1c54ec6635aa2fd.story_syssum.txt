CNN's Saima Mohsin, reporting from Legazpi on Sunday, said shelters were full as high winds and driving rain battered the city.
CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam said that the storm is actually breaking up over the land mass of the Philippines, but will continue to pour heavy rain.
If or when it gets worse, we'll go to the evacuation center," one man said.
"We've been here 25 years and seen many typhoons," said a woman at the coast.
CNN's Asia-Pacific editor Andrew Stephens, reporting from Tacloban, said there was no storm surge.
"I think that the lessons learned were very hard ones in Tacloban ... because there were so many lives lost, and I think they've really taken cognizance this time and really made an all-out effort everywhere to bring people to safety."
