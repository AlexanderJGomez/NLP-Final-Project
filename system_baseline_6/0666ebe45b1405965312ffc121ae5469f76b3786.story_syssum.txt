Relief is in sight for the Midwest this weekend, however, as higher temperatures make their way eastward, according to CNN meteorologist Chad Meyers.
An Arctic air mass over the Plains will cause severe wind chills through Saturday morning, the National Weather Service reported.
The citrus growing regions in Florida and Texas will have to keep an eye on their crops as the cold air remains in the area, Meyers said.
Flakes are expected Saturday and may fall in the coming days on a swath of land ranging from British Columbia to the northern Sierras of California, Meyers said.
