Washington (CNN) -- The National Transportation Safety Board has concluded a deadly accident involving a bus driver who fell asleep while driving on a Virginia interstate last year was caused in part by "acute sleep loss" as well as inadequate oversight by the bus company and the government.
An examination of the driver's work schedule, sleep times and cell phone use revealed that his opportunity for sleep in the 72 hours prior to the crash was limited, the safety board said in a release.
"FMCSA closed the loophole that allowed 10-day extensions for passenger bus companies undergoing safety compliance reviews.
Motorcoaches transport 750 million passengers each year, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.
