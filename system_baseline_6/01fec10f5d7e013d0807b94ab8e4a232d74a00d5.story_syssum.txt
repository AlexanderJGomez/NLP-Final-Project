COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Sri Lankan soldiers seized a key rebel stronghold over the weekend, as humanitarian agencies feared for the safety of civilians.
The rebels gained control over Mullaittivu in 1996 and established a military garrison there, according to the government.
The recapture enabled the government to use a highway linking the mainland to the peninsula to move troops and supplies.
"Some Sri Lankan U.N. staff are trapped there," he said in a Sunday interview.
The Sri Lankan authorities "are also directly responsible for subjecting journalists to harassment and interrogation," she said.
