Democrat Harry Reid, majority leader of the Senate?
No recent majority leader of either party has been saved the headache of trying to lead a Senate in which minorities can exploit the rules and stymie the chamber.
Twice this week, the Senate has opened debate with its party leaders engaged in a caustic battle over Reid's plans to seek changes to Senate rules in January.
Reform of the Senate is overdue.
The change might also rein in senators' secret "holds" because the majority leader would no longer need broad support to advance a bill to the floor.
The first cloture vote would require 60 votes, as is required under Senate rules.
The Senate should consider new "fast-track" confirmation rules.
That is the unfortunate history of Senate reform: Senators rarely want to give up their parliamentary advantages.
Because changes to Senate rules can be filibustered, efforts to reform the Senate typically crash and burn.
