Welcome to the online world of the women of ISIS.
It's not the first time for women in a jihadist conflict.
"The abayas are skin tight and their niqaab starts from their forehead and ends at their nostrils."
"We have plenty brothers (sic) who don't even get selected on operations.
The battalion has two roles: Manning checkpoints and inspecting all women that pass, and enforcing ISIS' strict morality code for women in the caliphate.
Despites the seemingly trivial exchange of recipes and designs, there is little doubt that these women are staunch advocates of the values and beliefs of ISIS and regularly call on other "sisters" from around the world to make the "hijrah," or journey, to Syria.
