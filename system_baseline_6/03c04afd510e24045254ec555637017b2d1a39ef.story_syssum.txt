(CNN) -- Hundreds of people were injured in Bahrain Friday, when rival groups clashed over an attempted march in the town of Riffa, a residential area where the ruling Al-Khalifa family lives.
The conflict began when small groups from opposing sides met at the security fence, she said.
The attempted march in Riffa was organized by some of the more hard-line Shia groups among the government opposition.
More than 500 people have been injured in Bahrain since the protest began, which human rights activists say is part of a wave of popular unrest crashing through the Arab world
