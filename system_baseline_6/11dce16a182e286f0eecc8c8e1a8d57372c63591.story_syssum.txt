Organizers of the Volvo Ocean Race -- the prestigious round-the-world sailing competition -- seem to think so, and are gearing up for the first all-female team in over a decade.

"I don't think I'll ever forget that moment," Lush told CNN.
A female team in this race should be the norm, not something unusual."
