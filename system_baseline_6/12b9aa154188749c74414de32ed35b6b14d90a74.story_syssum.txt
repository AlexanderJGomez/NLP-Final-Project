Opponents of President Barack Obama's plan, which makes sweeping changes to the nation's immigration system by use of executive order, focused their criticism on the legal case, saying Obama has overstepped the boundaries of his authority and is ignoring the will of the people.
"President Obama is not above the law and has no right to issue executive amnesty.
Other Texas Republicans said that the President's actions were not only lawless but also ineffectual.
"It is time for the president and Congress to secure our border, followed by meaningful reforms.
But the right way to do it is to first bring illegal immigration under control by securing the borders and enforcing the laws, then modernizing our legal immigration system," Rubio said in a statement.
Arizona Sen. John McCain said Obama's "executive fiat" hurts chances of working with a Republican-dominated Congress on an immigration reform bill.
"The last time the President issued a politically motivated executive order to change our immigration laws, he precipitated a crisis at our border, leaving thousands of children at risk and ripping apart the families he claims to want to protect," Priebus said.
