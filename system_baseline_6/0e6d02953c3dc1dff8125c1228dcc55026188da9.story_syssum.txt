Refugee Agency accompanied South Sudanese supermodel Alek Wek to her native country during the one-year anniversary of its independence.
UNHCR is the lead agency managing seven camps on the contentious border between the north and the south.
"I am so impressed by UNHCR staff who live and work side by side with the refugees," Wek said.
UNHCR is assisting more than 330,000 South Sudanese who returned home from Khartoum, Sudan, and neighboring countries.
Similarly, $55 can buy five mosquito nets to protect children from the deadly threat of malaria.
Wek plans to work with UNHCR not only on generating awareness for the emergency but also by helping the agency generate funds to support the returnees and their access to education.
