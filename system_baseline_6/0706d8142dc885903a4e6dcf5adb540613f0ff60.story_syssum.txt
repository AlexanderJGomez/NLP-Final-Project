(CNN) -- An apparent tornado touched down Saturday afternoon in a small town east of Kansas City, Missouri, blowing roofs off houses and toppling trees and power poles, the National Weather Service said.
"It's bad.
It's a mess," Jerry McNary told CNN Kansas CIty affiliate KSHB.
Stosberg said 80% of the town was affected.
