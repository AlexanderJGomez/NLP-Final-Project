Shaheen woke Elle up and gave her orange juice to keep her from slipping into unconsciousness.
Elle was selected to try out an experimental device called an artificial or "bionic" pancreas.
Medical device companies are racing to be the first to market an artificial pancreas, which takes over the work of the diabetic's malfunctioning organ.
It was Elle who urged her mother to enroll her in an artificial pancreas study.
I don't know what's wrong,'" Shaheen says.
For three days, the device did the work Elle's pancreas can no longer do.
Then, after the experiment, Elle had to leave the artificial pancreas behind, and it was back to counting carbs and poking herself every couple of hours.
"We're extraordinarily impatient for access to the device," Shaheen says.
But "if not properly designed, use of an artificial pancreas device in an outpatient setting can place patients at significant risk."
"We're extraordinarily impatient for access to the device," she says.
