But for the parents of the hundreds of thousands of children who go missing each year, that pain is much deeper; for some, there is never relief.
The boy said he never went to their rendezvous point, a park, and as of Thursday, the young girl still had not come home.
It was frustrating because the family did not think she intended to be gone long.
The conversations that unfolded were surreal.
People who had never met the family joined the search.
Three days after the girl went missing, I was helping plan a prayer vigil.
For the media, that's where the story ends.
After this experience, I'll never look at news of a missing child the same.
Each missing child poster represents a family in heartache and a community at a loss.
