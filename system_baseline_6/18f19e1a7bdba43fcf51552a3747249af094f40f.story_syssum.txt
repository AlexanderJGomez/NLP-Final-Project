But, speaking to Open Court's Pat Cash, a fellow Wimbledon champion, Sampras quickly qualified his remarks.
"I loved Wimbledon and what it meant, but the surface felt uncomfortable.
Only a quarterfinal defeat to eventual winner Richard Kracijek in 1996 interrupted an incredible run which saw Sampras claim seven of the next eight Wimbledon crowns.
Federer began his era of domination in 2003, but the 16-time grand slam champion is still one short of the Wimbledon record held by Sampras -- whose tally is matched only by the seven won by Britain's William Renshaw in the tournament's formative years of the 1880s.
Sampras accepts that his style of big serving and volleying at Wimbledon is from a bygone era, and he regrets its passing.
