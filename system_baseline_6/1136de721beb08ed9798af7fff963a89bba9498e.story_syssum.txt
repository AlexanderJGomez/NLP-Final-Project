The ship captain accused of causing the deaths of 32 people in last year's Costa Concordia cruise disaster asked for a plea bargain Wednesday as his trial got under way in Italy.
Four crew members and an officer for Costa Cruises who were originally co-defendants with Schettino have already asked for a plea bargain trial.
Schettino was in court with his lawyers for Wednesday's hearing, the start of a process that will be closely watched in Italy and elsewhere.
Among the civil plaintiffs is Gianluca Gabrielli, who came to Grosseto for the opening hearing of the trial.
"It was all going well, it was the nicest holiday we ever had with the family," he said, remembering the hours before the 114,000-ton ship hit the rocks just before 10 p.m. on a winter's night.
The civil plaintiffs also include the Costa cruise line, which is suing Schettino for causing the accident and destroying its ship.
I'm very disappointed that Schettino is the only defendant," Domnica Cemortan, a Moldavian dancer who was on the bridge the night of the shipwreck and is a civil plaintiff in the case, told CNN outside the court.
Titan and Costa Cruises said last week they hope to be able to rotate the vessel to a vertical position in September.
