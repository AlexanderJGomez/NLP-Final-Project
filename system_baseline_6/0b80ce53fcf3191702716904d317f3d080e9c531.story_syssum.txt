The Pakistani Taliban will not accept any offer from the government for a peace dialogue, Ehsan said.
Rehman -- now buried in a secret North Waziristan location, Ehsan said -- was wanted by the United States on suspicion of being involved in the December 2009 suicide bomb attack that killed seven CIA employees at Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khost, Afghanistan, according to a publication by the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center.
Before this week, the last reported drone strike in Pakistan was in mid-April.
Drone strikes have become controversial and unpopular because they have killed civilians, and Pakistan has said it has "serious concerns" over the latest attack.
