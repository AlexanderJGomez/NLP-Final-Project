"It is one of the greatest voyages of mankind and if anyone could have done it [before Columbus], it was the Phoenicians," said Beale.
Beale sailed the replica boat -- aptly named The Phoenician -- around Africa in 2010, in a bid to demonstrate the ancient civilization had the capability to circumnavigate the continent 2,000 years before the first recorded European; Bartolomeu Dias, in 1488.
Using locally-sourced materials, shipbuilders stayed true to the original down to the exact thickness of the planks and position of the mast.
"Archeologists have found Egyptian mummies with traces of tobacco and cocaine which could only have come from the New World," Beale said.
He said copper coins with Phoenician iconography have also also been discovered in North America.
Setting off from Tunisia, the modern-day Phoenician vessel is expected to take two to three months to reach America -- granted Beale can raise Â£100,000 ($156,000) for the expedition.
I put forward the theory that the Phoenicians could have been first and I hope to prove that was the case."
