Washington (CNN) -- A typo kept President Barack Obama from signing legislation designed to end budget-related FAA air traffic controller furloughs blamed for widespread flight delays, a congressional source told CNN.
The FAA "is not impacted," the source said.
The furloughs affected some 15,000 FAA air traffic controllers.
