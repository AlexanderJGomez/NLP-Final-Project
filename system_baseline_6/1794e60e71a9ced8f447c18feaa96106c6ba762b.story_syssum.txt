Unfortunately for Democrats, the importance of organized labor has diminished dramatically since the 1970s.
Many Democrats since the 1960s, including some environmentalists and civil rights advocates, concluded that unions were too often in opposition to their goals.
While FDR's policies benefited workers, including the new Congress of Industrial Organizations, or CIO, labor came out in droves for the Democrats.
Without unions and the kinds of policies they helped Democrats find support for, leaders like Reuther realized, there would be very little to prevent the middle class from gradually withering away.
Owners moved factories and their jobs to Southern states, which had tough right-to-work laws that made it illegal to force workers in an organized workplace to join the union and pay dues, or transported business overseas.
As labor became less important, a large number of Democrats became cool to unions.
Only then will Democrats once again start to celebrate and appreciate the importance of Labor Day to their party.
