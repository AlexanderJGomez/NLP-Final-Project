David Goldman is fighting for custody of his son after Bruna Bianchi Goldman died during another childbirth.
For nearly five years, Goldman has fought to regain custody of his son.
Goldman continues to press his case through the U.S. government.
"I would tell him that he's been very brave, as he has fought to have his son returned to him," Clinton said in the NBC interview.
"And Mr. Goldman, while Bruna was still alive, failed to do so," Ribeiro said.
The next step in this case is uncertain.
