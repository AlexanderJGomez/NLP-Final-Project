It's Delta Air Lines' new "Basic Economy" fare, part of the airline's new five-fare class of pricing starting March 1.
Note the options on the other end of the seating spectrum: The first-class cabin will be split into "First Class" for domestic routes and "Delta One" for long-haul international and certain cross-country domestic flights.
In the main cabin, customers will have choice of the "Basic Economy" fare and two other fare classes.
"Or will you get less for the same fare?"
"The lowest fare class doesn't allow advanced seat selection?"
That pricing structure seems Spirit-esque."
