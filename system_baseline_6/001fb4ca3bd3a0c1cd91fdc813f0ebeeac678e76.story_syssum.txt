(CNN) -- Sergio Garcia, a 36-year-old undocumented immigrant in California, has held two lifelong dreams: to become a U.S. citizen and to practice law.
If anyone feels frustrated the the situation, they should address it with the federal government, Garcia said.
Eight years later, at age 17, Garcia again returned to California with his parents and without documentation, though his father had obtained permanent resident status in the United States.
Now that he has a law license, however, one thing that Garcia will not specialize in is immigration law.
