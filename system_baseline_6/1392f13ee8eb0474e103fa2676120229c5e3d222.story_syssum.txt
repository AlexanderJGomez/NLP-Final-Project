Apparently not, because so many people feel compelled to show us how clever they are by attempting to point out factual errors depicted in film after film.
But that's nothing compared to the recent barrage of Twitter attacks launched at the film by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson.
Here's a spoiler alert (and by "spoiler alert," I mean a spoiler to people who have never googled or read anything about the film): It was fiction -- that means it was made up.
The film does not even purport to be a bio pic.
But for all other movies, filmmakers should be afforded creative license to make the movie that fulfills their vision of the story they want to tell, even ones based on real events.
