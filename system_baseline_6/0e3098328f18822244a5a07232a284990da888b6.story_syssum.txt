(CNN) -- Two days after an embarrassingly early European Champions League exit, Manchester United have been dealt a further blow with the news that club captain Nemanja Vidic will miss the rest of this season.
Vidic's injury limits United's options in central defense, with experienced England international Rio Ferdinand to partner Northern Ireland's Jonny Evans or one of versatile young duo Phil Jones and Chris Smalling.
Vidic is part of a growing injury list at Old Trafford, with Mexico striker Javier Hernandez also sidelined after damaging an ankle during last week's 1-0 win over Aston Villa.
