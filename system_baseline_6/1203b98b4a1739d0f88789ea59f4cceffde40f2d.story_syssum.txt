Moscow (CNN)Joy Womack is taking part in her first ballet class of the day at the Kremlin Ballet Theatre, kicking her legs up to her head, jumping and spinning across the room.
Womack says a friend helps her with accommodation and she says she has to make the money stretch in order to buy food.
As an American, Womack says she is paid the same as her contemporaries and is treated just like the Russians.
Although relations between the U.S. and Russia have taken a nosedive since Russia's annexation of Crimea last March, Womack says she is "very loyal" to the Kremlin Ballet Theatre.
