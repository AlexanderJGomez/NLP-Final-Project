Biochar's high carbon content and porous nature can help soil retain water, nutrients, protect soil microbes.
Its high carbon content and porous nature can help soil retain water, nutrients, protect soil microbes and ultimately increase crop yields while acting as natural carbon sink - sequestering CO2 and locking it into the ground.
"Soil acts as an enormous carbon pool, increasing this carbon pool could significantly contribute to the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere," said Christoph Steiner, one of the leading research scientist studying biochar.
The process of making biochar can also lead to other valuable products.
But still more large-scale tests need to be conducted before biochar technology can be rolled out on a global scale.
Industries can now begin to look at farmers around the world and pay them for their agricultural wastes, said Day.
