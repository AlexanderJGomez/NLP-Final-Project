But a study conducted in California found that autism rates increased even after thimerosal was removed from most vaccines.
Do these findings suggest that autism isn't linked to mercury in vaccines?
They reasoned that if mercury exposure in vaccines was a major cause of autism, the number of affected kids should have dropped after thimerosal was removed.
The National Vaccine Information Center says the study doesn't include children under the age of 3, which they say is the only group that was never exposed to mercury in vaccines.
Doctors are now looking for signs of autism in children as young as 18 to 24 months.
Several things pushed companies in this direction.
In 1997, Congress passed a bill that mandated review of products containing mercury, which led manufacturers to begin removing thimerosal from vaccines two years later.
