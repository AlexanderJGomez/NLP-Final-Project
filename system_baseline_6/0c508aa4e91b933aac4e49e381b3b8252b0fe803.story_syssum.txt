The state-run Antara News Agency had said that two people were reportedly killed when a 12-bus convoy carrying employees of PT Freeport was attacked by unidentified gunmen in the country's eastern-most province.
PT Freeport is the largest copper and gold mining company in the province.
No one died in the attacks, Antara said.
But authorities still do not know their identities.
