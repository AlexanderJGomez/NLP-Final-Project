(CNN) -- On Thursday, Scotland goes to the polls to consider leaving the United Kingdom.
And while the English are known for introversion and a terror of being noticed, the heat generated by the independence referendum has been a testament to the Scots' uncompromising desire to say what they're really thinking.
And, as such, Scotland's presence in the Union has been sustained hitherto largely by good will.
Many Scots turned toward independence as an alternative way of ordering their affairs (while many Englishmen drifted toward the conservative United Kingdom Independence Party).
That brings us back to the benefits of sticking together.
But it is still one of the most powerful in the world, boasts a nuclear deterrent (moored in Scotland) and is a lynchpin of the Atlantic alliance.
The army is perhaps at the heart of the emotional case for the Union.
To the Union and the world, the Scots have brought poetry both sublime and hilariously bad.
If Scotland votes this week for independence, we will divorce with dignity (excepting a few rows about debt and nuclear weapons).
If I'm honest, the prospect of a Union dominated too heavily by the English worries me.
