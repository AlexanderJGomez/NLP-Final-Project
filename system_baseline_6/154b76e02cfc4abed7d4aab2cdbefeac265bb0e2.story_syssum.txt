The brother of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri is proposing to mediate a peace deal between the West and Islamists.
He wants peace, he says, between Muslims and non-Muslims and has written a proposal that outlines the terms.
Al-Zawahiri says his offer puts him at risk from radical Islamists, but says he is not acting from weakness or for personal gain.
Through his steely determination to get his voice heard and his message out it is hard to gauge how much hope al-Zawahiri is really investing in his initiative.
He says he told his interrogators he could work a truce with Islamists but he says his jailers didn't want to know.
He says his brother will listen to him, but admits he hasn't talked to him in long over a decade.
It wouldn't be the first time the terms are unacceptably high.
