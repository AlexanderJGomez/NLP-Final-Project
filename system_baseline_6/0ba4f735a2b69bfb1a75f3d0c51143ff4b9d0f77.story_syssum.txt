Introduced on Wednesday, the Kindle Touch will be the first Amazon e-reader with a touch screen.
"The current technology for touch screens -- it's called capacitive touch -- is a layer that goes on top of that display.
For that reason, the Kindle Touch relies on infrared sensors, which are stationed along the edges around the screen to detect when the user's finger touches a particular spot on the device's face, an Amazon spokeswoman said.
Amazon will continue to sell two versions of the Kindle without touch screens.
"We have many customers who tell us they don't want touch," Bezos reportedly said at the news conference in New York on Wednesday.
