(CNN) -- Tetiana Chornovol, a prominent Ukrainian civic activist and journalist beaten on Christmas, said she has a long list of enemies, and that she was sure she would die during the attack.
"And I was very scared when they were beating me; I thought they were going to kill me," she said.
The Interior Ministry said it had identified three suspects in the beating.
The attack was the second on a Ukrainian opposition activist in as many days, according to RIA Novosti.
The latest assault could increase tensions between the state and demonstrators who have braved sub-zero temperatures and set up tents and barricades in the city center to voice their opposition to closer ties with Russia.
