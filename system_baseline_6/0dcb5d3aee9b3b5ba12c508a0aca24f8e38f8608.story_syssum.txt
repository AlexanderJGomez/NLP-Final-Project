So, it sparks a little incredulity when -- on the heels of five players' arrests, the indefinite suspension of a premier running back and the deactivation of two of the NFL's biggest stars -- yet another NFL player is alleged to have exacted violence against loved ones.
It was the latest public relations debacle for the NFL, as Dwyer brought the total number of players facing domestic violence or child abuse charges to six, after July incidents in which police say he broke his wife's nose with a head butt and punched her in the face.
Peterson then took a leave of absence and Goodell placed him on the exempt list, which gives the team the opportunity to continue to pay him while he deals with his legal issues.
Hardy played one game then was deactivated as the outrage against the NFL grew over how it was dealing with domestic violence issues.
The most serious of six charges were three counts of assault, one of which caused a fracture.
The running back without a team is appealing his indefinite suspension by the league.
On August 31, three days after Goodell created an NFL policy against domestic violence, San Francisco 49ers defensive tackle Ray McDonald was arrested on an accusation of felony domestic violence.
He pleaded not guilty, ESPN said, adding that the player was still practicing with the team.
