At issue is whether someone previously barred from a military base may be convicted under federal law for "peacefully protesting" on a public road easement along the enclosed high-security facility.
"You've got a public school and a public highway" on the base, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said.
The federal government owns and operates the base, but the state and county have held a "use easement" for more than a half-century, and they maintain the roads.
Vandenberg's commanding officer in 2003 issued a "barment order" against Dennis Apel after he was arrested for trespassing and vandalism, including throwing blood on a base sign.
"When an easement goes towards a public road, that easement includes the right to use the public road for speech activities," he said.
It's their base.
...
And that's for the convenience of military personnel and for other people who live around the base.
"They're denying my right to dissent on their base," he said.
