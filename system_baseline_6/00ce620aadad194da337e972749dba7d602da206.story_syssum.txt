(CNN) -- So we thought Asian kids did great in school.
... A lot of people think of Asians as a model minority group.
Whether due to bias or mere lack of interest, the professors in the study treated Asian and Indian students differently despite their reputation for academic achievement.
Some people definitely think so.
And at one of my very first legal job interviews, one judge put it succinctly: "I've always thought your people were very bright."
Why?
Maybe then Asians in America can be recognized for bringing more to the table than just being good at school.
