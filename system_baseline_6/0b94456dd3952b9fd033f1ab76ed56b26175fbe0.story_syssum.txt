He's broken every record in the book and won a glut of Olympic and world titles, but even at the age of 40, Haile Gebrselassie has no intention of resting on his laurels.
Throughout his glittering career stretching over two decades, Gebrselassie has proved an impeccable ambassador for track and field.
Disappointments have proved few and far between since his first competitive race at the age of 14 and while still in his teens he captured a 5,000/10,000 meters double at the world junior championships in Seoul.
Metronomically lapping the 400m track at just over four-minute mile pace for over three miles, he says that as he ran the beat of the 1995 hit song "Scatman (Ski-Ba-Bop-Ba-Dop-Bop)" kept ringing around his head.
Gebrselassie won his first Olympic gold at Atlanta '96 over his favored 10,000m distance, just edging out his arch-rival Paul Tergat.
Successive wins in the Berlin marathon in 2007 and 2008 each came with world bests, the second of two hours three minutes and 59 seconds -- the first man under the two hours four minute mark.

Judging by his recent performances -- winner of April's Vienna half-marathon, third in a world-class Manchester 10 km last month and smashing the best for a 40-year-old at the distance -- Gebrselassie will be delighting his fans for a few more years to come as he sticks to his endearing philosophy for life.
