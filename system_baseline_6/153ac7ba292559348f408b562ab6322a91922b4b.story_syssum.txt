As evacuees from last year's Fukushima nuclear disaster, Mikio and Hamako lost everything: their home, their jobs, and any hope for the future.
In a landmark case, Watanabe filed a lawsuit last month against TEPCO, blaming the utility company for his wife's suicide.
Watanabe says his wife's depression happened gradually, after they evacuated out of their home into a cramped temporary housing unit.
"She cried so much and repeatedly asked me to take her to our home," he says.
Watanabe went to bed with his wife, feeling happier and more comfortable than he had in many weeks.
Watanabe continued to weed around his house and went inside to take a shower.
Watanabe says it's strange what you remember in trauma.
"We lost everything," he says.
I lost my wife in such a terrible way.
"I feel an unspeakable rage," says Watanabe.
