United Nations (CNN) -- The United Nations formally condemned Friday the sinking of a South Korean warship in March but did not specifically name North Korea, which a multinational probe found culpable in the incident.
"I think it's crystal clear that [the] Security Council made it clear that North Korea [is] to be blamed and to be condemned," said Ambassador Park In-kook.
A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of North Korea, officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, called the presidential statement "devoid of any proper judgment," according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency.
