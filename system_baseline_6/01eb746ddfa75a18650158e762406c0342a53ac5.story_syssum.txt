Dolphins coach Joe Philbin suspended Incognito on Sunday night.
Incognito said he didn't want to comment on media reports that he sent line-mate Jonathan Martin voice mails containing racial slurs and threats of physical violence.
I'll (expletive) in your (expletive) mouth.
Martin doesn't appear in the video and TMZ only said the video was recorded earlier this year.
The Dolphins spent Sunday gathering information, after which he suspended Incognito, Philbin said.
Several media outlets said Martin had left the Dolphins because of bullying, something Incognito denied on Twitter.
The Miami Herald reported that a Dolphins source said Incognito is "done" with the team.
The Sporting News takes a yearly poll of NFL players, and in 2009 they dubbed Incognito the dirtiest player in the league.
Dolphins rookie Will Davis said he hasn't experienced any acts of bullying or hazing.
He said everyone on the team loves Incognito.
He said when Incognito joined the team, he would test people to see where he stood with them.
Still, former Dolphins running back Ricky Williams said it occurs less frequently in the NFL than most people think.
I don't think the media, I don't think fans, I don't think anyone outside is really in a position to really fully understand what occurs inside of a locker room and inside of a football team."
