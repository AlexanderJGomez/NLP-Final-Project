(CNN) -- Gai Waterhouse made history on Tuesday by becoming the first female Australian trainer to win the Melbourne Cup, the country's most prestigious horse race.
Retired English football star Michael Owen saw Brown Panther, a horse he bred and co-owns, finish the race in eighth position.
Brown Panther was hampered by a gash it sustained during the race after a coming together with another horse, but Owen confirmed the animal had suffered no serious injuries.
