The 43-year-old former Russian agent turned Kremlin critic pointed his finger directly at Vladimir Putin, then as now, Russia's strongman president.
The poison used to kill Litvinenko is a rare radioactive isotope, polonium-210.
He was a former agent of the Russian Federal Security Service, the FSB, the post-Soviet successor of the feared KGB.
Why, for instance was polonium-210 chosen to kill Litvinenko?
Perhaps only President Putin, himself a former KGB agent, has the answer to that.
