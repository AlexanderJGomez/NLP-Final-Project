A show featuring a lawman who makes jailed inmates wear pink underwear and uses actors to trick suspects, however, is a new twist.
Dubbed "America's Toughest Sheriff," Arpaio makes many of his county's 10,000 or so inmates live in tents.
"They were stealing the white underwear, smuggling the underwear out of the jail," Arpaio told CNN.
Critics say the patrols use racial profiling to unfairly target Hispanic drivers and pedestrians, while Arpaio says they have resulted in the deportation of hundreds of illegal immigrants, including some with criminal records.
Fabian said America's Voice is considering putting pressure on companies that advertise during Arpaio's show.
