The Puerto Rico Police Department, the second-largest police department in the United States, was the object of a scathing report by the ACLU that concluded things have not changed since the government issued its own report.
Puerto Rico's secretary of state called the ACLU report a "rehash" of what the federal government had already found, and said that changes are already under way.
The Puerto Rican government has raised more than $50 million to spend on its police force, much of that going to police raises and training.
According to the ACLU, the Puerto Rico Police Department has used unreasonable force in at least some of the 28 deaths of civilians that it said came at the hands of the police.
