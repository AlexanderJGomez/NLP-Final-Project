Washington (CNN) -- Taj Magruder has never voted for Hillary Clinton.
Magruder is an unsalaried Clinton warrior.
"I am very, very passionate obviously about Hillary," Magruder said, if that wasn't already clear.
And while he only has 780 followers, many of those include reporters following Clinton and representatives from the groups looking to help her if she runs again.
Some, like Still 4 Hill, have devoted years to blogging about her every move.
Still 4 Hill started her blog after Clinton ended her presidential campaign in 2008.
And when Still 4 Hill met Clinton at a New Jersey book singing this year, she was sure to mention her blog.
According to blogger, Clinton responded, "Still 4 Hill!
"I am reading her book now and when I read the first chapter it was like tearing a scab off a wound of something," Still 4 Hill said, capturing how she is still hurt over that campaign.

If there is one, I would love it," Magruder said.
