Contrary to Israel's rhetoric, the fear of Iran getting a nuclear weapon has not been the driving factor of Israel policy on Iran since the early 1990s.
Israel will be "abandoned" to face Iran alone, Israelis fear.
If your interest dictates that the U.S. and Iran must remain firmly at odds with each other, a nuclear deal -- any deal -- would eliminate the most explosive point of contention between Washington and Tehran and lessen America's inclination to confront Iran on other matters, Israel believes.
That was stopped, to his credit, by Netanyahu," Israeli journalist Ehud Yaari told me in an interview for my book Treacherous Alliance - the Secret Dealings of Israel, Iran and the US.
But over the course of the past 18 months, the Netanyahu government has made Iran all about Israel.
For instance, when U.S. President Bill Clinton started sending strong signals to Iran's newly elected reformist president Mohammad Khatami in the late 1990s, then-Prime Minister Ehud Barak softened Israel's tone towards Iran in order to minimize any negative side-effects of a U.S.-Iran deal for Israel.
The more Netanyahu has sought to undermine the talks, the more Israel has lost its ability to impact the negotiations.
Rather than depriving the other side of options and maneuverability, Netanyahu has painted Israel in a corner.
