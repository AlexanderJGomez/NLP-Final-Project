Shaaban said the government would like "to talk to peaceful demonstrators" and is not opposed to peaceful protests.
Shaaban said that while demonstrators have "legitimate grievances," there are extremists who are using protests "as a cover to incite sectarian violence in Syria" and are badly hurting the economy.
The Turkish government said Tuesday that 10,757 Syrian refugees have crossed the border.
When asked whether the crisis would have been different had security forces not acted violently during the uprising's start in Daraa, Shaaban said she thinks "there are lots of fabrications about the security forces" and that many security forces were ordered not to carry weapons in Daraa.
But some of those who have been risking arrest or bodily harm as al-Assad tries to suppress a wave of anti-government protests said the people in the hotel don't necessarily speak for them.
"We are trying our best to reach the leaders of people on the street because we want to solve this problem in our country and move forward."
"No government in the world would kill its own people," she said.
