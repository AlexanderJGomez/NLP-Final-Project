Autopsies were performed Monday on the couple, found stabbed to death in their St. Maarten home, the solicitor general said.
Identifying him only by his initials M.K.J., the St. Maarten Public Prosecutor's office described the suspect as a 28-year-old, Jamaican-born man.
The suspect's attorney, Brenda Brooks, said she met with her client Monday at a police station in St. Maarten's capital Philipsburg, where he is being held.
"They were beautiful people," he said, adding he is "still in shock."
