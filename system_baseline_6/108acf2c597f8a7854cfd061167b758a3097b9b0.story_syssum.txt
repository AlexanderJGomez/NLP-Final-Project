The referendum was on a law about repaying the Netherlands and UK, which helped savers in their own countries who lost money in a failed Icelandic Internet bank.
The Icelandic government has said it will honor its international obligations.
The Icelandic public widely disapproved of the deal, the government said in a fact sheet on the deal.
The International Monetary Fund loaned Iceland $2.1 billion in November, and said repaying the money to the British and Dutch governments was a requirement of the loan.
