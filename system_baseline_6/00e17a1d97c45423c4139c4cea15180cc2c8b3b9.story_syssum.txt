The sublime scenery of the Shimanami Kaido (Island-Wave-Sea Route) runs from Onomichi in Hiroshima Prefecture down to Imabari in Ehime Prefecture.
As of March, Onomichi is home to Japan's first hotel designed exclusively for cyclists: Hotel Cycle in the Onomichi U2 building, just five minutes' walk from the JR station.
As for Onomichi itself, the town was built on a hillside overlooking the sea, so the best way to see it before you head onto the Shimanami Kaido is to catch the ropeway to the top of Senkoji Hill and enjoy the panorama.
Tsutafuji is one of the most popular ramen shops in town.
The town of Setoda is Japan's number one producer of lemons, while Ehime Prefecture is known as the Orchard of Japan.
As for those bridges, their exquisite state of the art forms make them an attraction in their own right.
For the perfect ending to a trip (should you choose to loop back the way you came) you can't go wrong with the Bella Vista Hotel in the hills outside Onomichi.
A free shuttle bus to the Bella Vista Hotel runs from Onomichi JR station.
