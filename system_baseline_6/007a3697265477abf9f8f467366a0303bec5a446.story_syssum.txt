Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- Blood and body parts littered the ground outside Turkey's embassy in Somalia on Saturday afternoon, the grisly result of a blast that police said left six dead and nine wounded.
Al-Shabaab -- a militant Islamist group with connections to al Qaeda -- claimed responsibility for the attack.
"I condemn this criminal act of terrorism and my government and security forces will do everything it can to catch those who planned and directed it," Hassan said.
In addition to its volatile security situation, Somalia has been plagued by famine.
