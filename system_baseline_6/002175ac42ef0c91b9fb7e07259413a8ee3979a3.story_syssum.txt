"At my school, we'll learn," she says, brushing her hands longingly over the slide.
And as the government struggles to wade through the country's protracted political problems, Egypt's festering education system is orphaned -- even though, with a growing youth population, it's key to the country's future.
Meanwhile, a report by London think tank Chatham House says just $129 a year is spent on each Egyptian student; the United States, for example, spends 40 times as much.
To make up for the gaps in education, millions of middle-class Egyptian families spend a large part of their income -- sometimes as much as 25% -- on private tutoring.
"There are too many issues to deal with," said one 32-year-old teacher in Asmaa's village.
Egypt's final secondary school exams are a rite of passage for students.
Also, 70% of young women in Upper Egypt are jobless.
However, as Egypt's public education system founders, a few innovative ideas have emerged.
Another innovative initiative is Teach for Egypt, a start-up created by Nada Ramadan, a 24-year-old Egyptian who's a graduate student at Georgetown University in Washington.
Ramadan says she's running into problems, however, while trying to implement her idea.
But until those solutions are offered, Asmaa -- and a whole generation in waiting -- will continue to linger near broken slides, daydreaming about the future.
