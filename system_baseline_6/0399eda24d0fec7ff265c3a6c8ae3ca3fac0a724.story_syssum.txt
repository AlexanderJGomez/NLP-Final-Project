An Egypt-backed cease-fire between Israel and Hamas fell apart Tuesday as rocket attacks from Gaza were again answered by Israeli airstrikes.
Hamas said no to the cease-fire, both in word and in deed," Regev said.
Israeli leaders had agreed to the cease-fire, but from the outset warned it would be short-lived if the attacks from Gaza didn't stop.
"Hamas have decided to continue, and will pay the price for that decision," Netanyahu said Tuesday.
Its military wing rejected any possibility of a cease-fire, while its political wing had said it was considering it.
Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan later stressed that Hamas never received the proposal through political channels.
The toll is now greater than the number of people killed in Gaza during the 2012 conflict between Israel and Hamas.
"I urgently call on the Israeli Security Forces to put an end to attacks against, or endangering, civilians and civilian infrastructure which are contrary to international humanitarian law," said Pierre Krahenbuhl, commissioner general of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, or UNRWA.
Hamas on Tuesday closed a crossing between Gaza and Israel but allowed 25 Palestinians -- some of them needing medical attention -- to cross into Israel at Erez.
"The Egyptian proposal for a cease-fire and negotiations provides an opportunity to end the violence and restore calm," Kerry said from Vienna, Austria.
Kerry strongly condemned the rocket launches by Hamas in the face of the cease-fire plan, and said he is prepared to fly to the Middle East as early as Wednesday, if needed.
"It's important that the United States demand a cease-fire," he said.
