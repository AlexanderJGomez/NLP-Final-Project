A court in eastern China sentenced Bo Xilai -- the former rising star of the ruling Communist Party who fell from power amid a scandal involving murder, betrayal and financial skullduggery -- to life in prison Sunday.
Days before the court announced the date for delivering the verdict, Bo reiterated his innocence but said he anticipated a lengthy imprisonment in a letter written to his family.
"Meanwhile I will be waiting quietly in prison," Bo continued.
A source with close ties to the Bo family confirmed to CNN the authenticity of the letter, which has been circulating on the Internet.
The son of a revolutionary veteran, Bo rose to power as a city mayor, provincial governor, minister of commerce and member of the Politburo, the powerful policy-making body of the Communist Party.
Soon after news of the events began to emerge, Bo was removed from his party posts.
Wang and Gu both appeared as witnesses at Bo's trial last month.
