Modi has fashioned a role for himself not only as CEO of India Inc. but also as its global ambassador, with blockbuster speeches promoting India in New York, Tokyo and Sydney.
He is also India's brand manager, launching catchy campaigns such as "Make in India," "#MyCleanIndia" and "Digital India."
That suggests 2015 will be a defining year for India.
India's government will look to use that money well.
And Modi will need another important currency: cooperation from his lawmakers.
These are all questions that Modi will need to answer in 2015.
Obama will be the first sitting American president to visit India more than once.
Will Modi develop a values-based vision of India's place in the world?
In 2015, Modi will need not only to be a voice of reason, but he will also have to rein in radical fringe elements of his Hindu support base.
The sad reality is that Modi will probably make the same comment at this year's speech.
So, expect India to start leapfrogging many of the problems the West has spent decades dealing with: India has never had a real database of its citizens, but soon it will be the first country to have an entirely digital biometric ID system.
This will be India's real revolution, and it is already underway.
