Zuckerberg said there were no plans to harvest data from WhatsApp messages, in answer to a question from the audience.
"But they are only now starting to get to the range of where they should have been.
Asked if Facebook would consider bidding again for Snapchat, Zuckerberg said: "After buying a company for $16 billion you're probably done for a while."
"Most people in the world don't have access to the internet at all ... it's about 2.7 billion people today.
"It gives him the opportunity to engage with key mobile operator partners, which will be important in the wake of Facebook's acquisition of WhatsApp," she said.
