It was close to this spot in 1960 that the Jane Goodall, the British primatologist widely regarded as the world's foremost expert on chimpanzees, began her near 55-year study of one specially selected chimp family.
"The magic of Gombe is two factors," said Emily Boehm, a PhD candidate at the Jane Goodall Institute Research Center, here to study the chimps.
Before the program began, chimpanzees were thought to be herbivores but Goodall saw them hunting monkeys and eating meat.
According to senior researcher at the Jane Goodall Foundation, Dr Anthony Collins, activities like these display a high level of intelligence.
In the dense forest and woodlands of Gombe, chimpanzees and other species are protected from the most destructive aspects of human behavior.
"In my opinion, chimps are important for the country's economic growth," said Aristides Aloice Kashula, a Gombe-Masito Program forest officer.
That's a sentiment that Jane Goodall herself would be sure to endorse.
