But Louis Schlamowitz, for one, is grateful to postmen, who over the years have dropped thousands of envelopes into the mailbox of his cramped apartment in the Canarsie neighborhood of Brooklyn, where he has spent all his life.
Schlamowitz's collection -- he says he has more than 6,000 letters and autographed photos -- had been written about before, but after Gadhafi died, everyone became curious about why an 81-year-old American corresponded with the despot.
"He won't reply to me," Schlamowitz thought.
Schlamowitz was inspired.
Schlamowitz, a devout Jew, even received a Christmas card from the Muslim Gadhafi.
Gadhafi wrote several times more; one letter attacked America for practicing terrorism with its support of Israel -- not what a Jewish man who also had letters from Israel's Golda Meir, Yitzhak Rabin and Moshe Dayan would want to read.
"He should have stepped down like the president of Egypt," Schlamowitz says.
They wanted to know what his connection was to some of these men, considered enemies of America.
"It's a hell of a hobby you have, Schlamowitz."
Schlamowitz wasn't going to take that chance.
"You must be sick," Schlamowitz told him.
"I'm nobody special," he says.
