"All of a sudden, the captain came on and said brace for a landing, and that's when we knew we were going down," he said.
As the plane headed down toward the river, the cabin was mostly silent, he said.
At first, it felt like the plane was gliding, Berretta said, as if no engines were working.
"The plane was jockeying about, spinning a bit," Berretta said.
When the plane began to sink, some passengers began to panic, Panero said.
When they were safely out of the plane, Berretta said, there was one more moment of fear.
As Berretta exited the plane, he said that besides a few passengers remaining, the crew and pilot stayed behind to make sure everyone was out.
