Mayflower, Arkansas (CNN) -- Janet Copeland and her husband, Richard, both say they agree almost all the time, with one exception: The Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's health care legislation.

According to Families USA, a liberal-leaning health insurance advocacy group, Janet Copeland's situation is common.
But Janet, who is quickly using up her life savings to pay her monthly health premium, is fully supportive of Obamacare, and supports Democratic President Barack Obama in his re-election bid.
"I held one job during my marriage, working as an art instructor," Janet says.
While she was single, Janet Copeland paid just over $200 per month.
What's important about Janet Copeland's story, says Anthony Wright, is that it illustrates how routine life changes can dramatically change individual health care costs.

Wright says Janet Copeland could benefit from some of the provisions of the Affordable Health Care act, like the expansion of Medicaid.
Perry, like Richard Copeland, also disagrees with the health care law on philosophical grounds.
From a health care perspective, Wright says this election is "the most important" in U.S. history.
