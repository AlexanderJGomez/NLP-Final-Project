The national controversy over a surge of Central American immigrants illegally crossing the U.S. border established a new battleground this week in a Southern California small town where angry crowds thwarted detained migrants from entering their community.
Tuesday's busloads of detained Central American immigrants didn't include any unaccompanied minors, said Murrieta Police Chief Sean Hadden, who put the number of protesters at 125.
The children on the buses were apparently in the company of relatives or other adults, said an official with the National Border Patrol Council.
"It's not against the immigrants," he said.
The U.S. government is scheduled to send another group of undocumented immigrants to Murrieta for processing on Friday, the union official for Border Patrol agents said.
Mothers and their children on these buses have suffered through enough trauma."
The U.S. government earlier flew the 140 Central American immigrants from south Texas to San Diego.
The U.S. government is struggling to detain and accommodate an influx of undocumented immigrants, particularly a wave of unaccompanied children from the Central American countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.
The furor in Murrieta illustrated the conflict between protecting the borders and ensuring the safety of detained immigrants and children.
Other protesters told CNN affiliate KGTV said they wanted immigrants to follow the legal process to enter the United States.
"If these children were from Canada, we would not be having this interview," Morones said.
