Lohan, 26, "wants to settle in" for a few days while arrangements can be made to transfer her to the Lukens Institute in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, which bills itself as a "luxury rehab center," Michael Lohan said.
Michael Lohan said he was not happy with it either because of the revelation that the facility -- Morningside Recovery in Newport Beach -- can't provide alcohol and drug rehab treatments because California officials revoked its license.
None of Morningside's several locations in California are licensed, Tidwell said.
"Lindsay had no idea that Morningside wasn't approved," Michael Lohan said.
The police report said Lohan denied being behind the wheel, but the prosecutor was expected to call witnesses who say she was driving.
