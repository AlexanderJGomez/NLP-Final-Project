Stephen Colbert's trip to Iraq, facilitated by the USO, was six months in the planning.
Petraeus liked the idea, said Tischler, and the principals were put in touch with the USO.
He also put in a plug for USO donations: "The USO does more than bring my show to Baghdad," Colbert said on the show.
"We're primarily a volunteer organization," he said, noting the USO has fewer than 400 paid employees and 25,000 volunteers.
Toby Keith has gone on at least seven USO tours; "He insists on going to the smallest, most remote places," said Phillips.
At its core, Phillips said, the USO remains dedicated to the needs of U.S. service members.
"Service members in Iraq and Afghanistan are frequently at small, remote bases," said Phillips.
