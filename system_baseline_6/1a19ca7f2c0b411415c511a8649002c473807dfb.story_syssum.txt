Cuban-Americans have had an outsized influence in keeping the U.S. embargo since Fidel Castro seized power.
According to analysts, as more Cuban-American millennials begin to question the embargo, more will begin to abandon their Republican roots for the Democratic Party, like Sopo did.
At a debate sponsored by CNN in Florida earlier this week, Crist said he wouldn't be willing to go so far as meeting with Raul Castro, but he defended his opposition to the embargo.
"The message that worked well in the past -- Cuban Embargo -- and moved older Cubans to vote Republican, is not as impactful for younger U.S. born Cubans," said Luis Miranda Jr., a managing partner at MirRam Group, a political consulting firm.
"For the first time in more than 50 years, shifting politics in the United States and changing policies in Cuba make it politically feasible to re-establish formal diplomatic relations and dismantle the senseless embargo", wrote the Times' editorial board.
A June poll by Florida International University found that more than half of Cuban-Americans surveyed in Miami support an end to the embargo and a solid majority of them also favor restoring diplomatic relations with Havana.
In 2011, President Barack Obama eased travel restrictions to the island for American citizens and last week, Cuba said it would be willing to cooperate with Washington to help fight the Ebola epidemic in West Africa.
