(CNN) -- Another State of the Union address, another road trip for President Barack Obama to push now-familiar policies that he said he would pursue on his own if Congress won't cooperate.
He said what?
"A speech by Barack Obama is a lot like sex," said GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos.
"Let's make this a year of action," Obama said.
While the action is relatively narrow and affects less than half a million people, Obama urged Congress to follow suit for all low-wage workers in America.
"We hope the President will join us in a year of real action -- by empowering people -- not by making their lives harder with unprecedented spending, higher taxes, and fewer jobs," she said.
"The American people aren't interested in refighting old battles," Obama said.
Obama said he will order the U.S. Treasury to create a new federal retirement savings account called MyRA, a savings bond that would guarantee "a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in."
Even as he cited a growing economy and increasing corporate profits, Obama said average wages have been flat.
