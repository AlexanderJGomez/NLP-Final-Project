Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration is leaving the door open to a possible expansion of the U.S. military mission in Syria, with the possibility of targeting not just ISIS but also al Qaeda-affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra.
The Pentagon has repeatedly said it sees the U.S. military priority as striking ISIS in both Syria and Iraq with the goal of ensuring Iraq does not fall to ISIS control.
"There's progress in setting up curriculum, there's progress in getting the sites ready, there's progress in getting trainers contributed to the effort -- not just from the United States but from other nations," Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said Tuesday.
Kirby also told reporters that the U.S. military is making significant progress in its overall efforts to degrade and destroy ISIS.
