SB 1070 will be subject to multiple legal challenges, and the state will devote precious resources to defend a law that has so many serious constitutional flaws that it will likely never be implemented.
Moreover, even though Proposition 187 was never implemented, California suffered other repercussions besides the waste of limited state financial resources.
Coincidentally, Arizona's SB 1070 suffers from many of the same constitutional flaws as California's Proposition 187.
SB 1070 is an even more direct attempt to establish the state's own immigration law and enforcement scheme.
They and other proponents have at various times maintained, in more or less blatant contradiction of their rhetorical defense of the law's constitutional propriety, that SB 1070 is a much-needed change in current law that will strengthen Arizona.
