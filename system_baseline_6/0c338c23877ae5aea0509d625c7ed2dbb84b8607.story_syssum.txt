A recent poll conducted by Lake Research found that 66% of a random sample of 500 small-business owners believe the Citizens United decision was "mostly bad" or "somewhat bad" for small business.
In addition to taking a dim view of Citizens United, 88% of the small-business owners in the poll had a negative view of the role money plays in politics.
First, allowing unlimited money into politics allows the past to hold the future hostage.
Second, allowing unlimited money in politics allows the big to achieve an unfair advantage over the small.
Third, allowing unlimited money in politics allows companies to collect IOUs for special favors from presidential candidates -- particularly as a result of contributions made early in the election season, when a few million dollars can swing the result in a small state like New Hampshire.
Citizens United is an assault on our economy, which is supposed to be based on vigorous, free and open competition.
