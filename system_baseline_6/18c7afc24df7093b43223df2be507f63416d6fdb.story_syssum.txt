A nationwide shortage of a commonly used imported drug used in capital punishment has prompted 15 states on Monday to urge the U.S. Justice Department to intervene.
As state attorneys general, we are tasked with enforcing those laws, including in instances where capital punishment is authorized for the most heinous of crimes," according to attorneys general from the 15 states.
Some states use a single execution drug, others rely on a three-drug mixture or cocktail.
In 2009, Ohio became the first state to perform an execution with a single drug, using a higher  concentration of sodium thiopental.
The European manufacturers of both pentobarbital and sodium  thiopental have opposed using their products for executions in the  United  States.
Eighteen have been executed so far in 2012.
