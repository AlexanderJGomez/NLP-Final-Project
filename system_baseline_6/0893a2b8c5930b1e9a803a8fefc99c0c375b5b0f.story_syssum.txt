"We are glad that the Louisiana court has recognized that the investigatory file into the deaths that occurred at Memorial Medical Center in the days following Hurricane Katrina can no longer be withheld from disclosure under the public records laws," CNN said in a statement on the decision.
A doctor and two nurses were arrested in connection with the deaths, but a grand jury declined to bring charges against them in 2007.
Then-Louisiana Attorney General Charles Foti Jr. ordered the arrest of Dr. Anna Pou and two nurses on preliminary charges of second-degree murder in the deaths of four of the patients.
But the grand jury never heard testimony from five specialists who advised Foti that the patients were deliberately killed with overdoses of drugs.
