Here's a typical example from early April: "The pope is not coming to get mixed up in the local political process," said Italian Archbishop Pietro Sambi, the pope's ambassador to America, in an interview with the National Catholic Reporter.
They don't all agree with official church positions, and although Catholics were once reliable Democrats, today they're not clearly aligned with either party.
With her back to the wall not long ago in Ohio and Texas, Clinton decisively outpolled Sen. Barack Obama among Catholic Democrats.
Clinton does better than Obama among Latinos, who are disproportionately Catholic.
Either Clinton or Obama could make a strong appeal to Catholics on peace-and-justice issues, yet both are out of sync with Catholic teaching on issues such as abortion, stem-cell research and gay rights.
Clinton likewise has top-drawer Catholic advisers.
All this makes the political implications of the pope's presence difficult to anticipate.
