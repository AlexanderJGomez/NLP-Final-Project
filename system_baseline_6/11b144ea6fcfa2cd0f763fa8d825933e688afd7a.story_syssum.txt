The hit was just "a light tap on the head" intended to demonstrate "a piece of physical humor" Cherry wanted Sheridan to perform, the defense said in opening statements Wednesday.
Sheridan testified that while she explained her concerns to Cherry, the producer asked "What is it that you want?"
Cherry apologized to her soon after the hitting incident, telling her "I am on bended knee begging for your forgiveness," Sheridan testified.
"He felt the incident had been resolved," Sheridan said he told her.
Britt is "a very colorful character, sassy, overt, audacious," Sheridan said.
Cherry assured her that her character would "be saved" in the next episode at the start of season four, she said.
The character was not initially intended to be on the show beyond the pilot episode, but Cherry decided to make her the "blond bombshell who would sleep with the husbands of all of the wives," he said.
The human resources investigator never interviewed Cherry or Sheridan about the incident, only three people who worked for Cherry, Baute said.
