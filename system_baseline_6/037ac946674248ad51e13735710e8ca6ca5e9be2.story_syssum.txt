As is often the case with best-laid plans, however, I soon discovered an unexpected goal within my temporary career: the pursuit of excellence as a way of life.
"People treat temps like dirt," they scoffed.
"They aren't being excellent to each other!"
"Be excellent to each other!"
Some people ignored the sign (and the intention).
As a longtime Zen student, I had been taught to appreciate small, mundane moments -- moments opportune for practicing excellence in the workplace.
During mundane moments, I came to understand that excellence wasn't about being perfect or about being nice so people would like me.
My tasks included FedExing socks and underwear to a corporate spy whose business trip was unexpectedly extended and feeding warm milk from eyedroppers to newborn squirrels.
Now, instead of a sign, I carry excellence within me as a mantra, as a presence.
Excellence has the most impact when I first focus on my own peace and happiness, and then send it out into the world.
