"I was found guilty of adultery [in 2006] and was acquitted of murder, but the man who actually killed my husband was identified and imprisoned but he is not sentenced to death," Ashtiani said.
"Based on Islamic Penal Code, the punishments for murder and adultery should have been combined in one case and sentence and handled by Branch 12 of the Tabriz Province Court.
Last month, Malek Ajdar Sharifi, who is the head of the judiciary of East Azerbaijan province, said Ashtiani's crimes were "numerous" and said she was "convicted of adultery and murder and was sentenced to death," according to the official news agency IRNA.
"Now that Iran is under this international pressure, they have brought the case up that convicts her of the murder of her husband," Ahadi said Saturday.
