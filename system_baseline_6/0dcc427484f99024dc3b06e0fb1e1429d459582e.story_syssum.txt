Babylon, Iraq (CNN)ISIS has smashed priceless ancient statues in Mosul, bulldozed the ruins of Nineveh and Hatra, and dynamited centuries-old churches, mosques and shrines.
One of Hussein's former palaces still peers down over the city.
Why?"
The artifacts, some of the oldest in ancient civilization, are from the "age of ignorance," ISIS says, before the advent of Islam.
Iraq will defend its heritage against ISIS, said Mohamed Hattab from Iraq's Antiquities Department.
It's a soul under assault by latter day barbarians, who have destroyed much of it in the North, which has been out of the defensive reach of Iraqi soldiers.
It was a piece of history they were glad to part with.
