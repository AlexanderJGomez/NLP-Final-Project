Saturday brought another reminder of the powers that be in Egypt as America's top military officer was in Cairo to meet with his Egyptian counterparts.
But the demonstrations were scattered and light.
Meanwhile Saturday, an American student was arrested with an Australian journalist and their female translator in the city of Mahalla, north of Cairo, for inciting people to join the general strike and handing them money for doing so, a spokesman for the Egyptian Ministry of Interior told CNN.
Spokesman Alaa Mahmoud said they were transferred to a general prosecutor for an investigation.
"Actions like these were hallmarks of Mubarak's 30-year rule, but they also have been used repeatedly in the year since the (Supreme Armed Forces Council) assumed control," Human Rights Watch said.
The Egyptians said the pro-democracy organizations had received illegal foreign financing and were operating without a proper license.
They look now to a Syria in flames and flickers of discontent elsewhere and can take heart that they played a role in inspiring people to stand up for freedom.
They are optimistic that momentum will build as long as a military regime rules Egypt.
