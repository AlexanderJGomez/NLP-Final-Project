Osh, Kyrgyzstan (CNN) -- The flow of refugees fleeing southern Kyrgyzstan has gone from a flood to a trickle, the Uzbekistan Foreign Ministry said.
But gunfire was heard Thursday from the center of Osh, Kyrgyzstan, a sign that the violent ethnic clashes may be intensifying again.
The International Committee of the Red Cross said along with refugees there was an estimated 60,000 internally displaced people in Kyrgyzstan.
