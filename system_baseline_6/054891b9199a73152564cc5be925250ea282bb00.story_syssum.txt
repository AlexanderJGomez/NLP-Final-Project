(CNN) -- One of the telephone numbers used to report claims of abuse at a polygamist sect's Texas ranch was previously associated with a Colorado woman whom authorities have named a "person of interest," a court document says.
Authorities have not clearly said that they think Swinton made the March phone calls that prompted the raid.
Although Texas officials said they have not found the woman who made the calls, they said they have found evidence that girls as young at 13 are forced into marriages with older men at the ranch.
The phone number used in the Washington call was traced to the Colorado Springs apartment where Swinton lives, the affidavit says.
On Wednesday, workers in Eldorado continued to take voluntary DNA samples from adults who live on the YFZ Ranch, Rolfe said.
Rolfe said that at least 54 samples from adults have been taken there.
He said the court ignored motions asking that the children be placed with their relatives.
