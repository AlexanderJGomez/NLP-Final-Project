The 43-year-old Selanne scored two goals in what was expected to be his farewell match at the Games and Tuukka Rask made 27 saves for the shutout as Finland collected yet another hockey medal at an Olympics.
"We didn't show up," U.S. forward Max Pacioretty told NHL.com.
There was also disappointment for the U.S. in arguably Saturday's biggest event, the men's slalom, on the penultimate day of the Olympics as Ted Ligety couldn't complete the second run.
"Not all the best guys had the chance to make it down, unfortunately, but it is what it is," Ligety told the U.S. ski team's website.
Bjoergen led a Norwegian sweep in Nordic skiing's 30-kilometer race to pick up her third gold of the Games and 10th Olympic medal overall -- no woman has gotten more at the Winter Games.
Vic Wild, born in the U.S. before switching nationalities to Russia when he married a Russian snowboarder, became the first athlete to win two snowboarding gold medals at the same Olympics when he triumphed in the men's parallel slalom ahead of Slovenia's Zan Kosir.
Russia has 29 medals, leading the U.S. by two, and is tied with Norway for 11 golds.
Probably not.
