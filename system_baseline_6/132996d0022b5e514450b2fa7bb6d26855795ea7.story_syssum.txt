Under the Lyon Library contract, Google will scan its books and manuscripts for free.
In exchange, the library gives Google the right to use the scanned documents commercially for the next 25 years.
However, in January, an independent review for the French culture ministry criticized the lack of progress made by Gallica, and recommended a public-private partnership with Google.
Currently Google has seven library partners in Europe, including Lyon.
