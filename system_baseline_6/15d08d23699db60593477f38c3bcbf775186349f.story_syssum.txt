More than 7 in 10 Americans think Obama should ask Congress for the ability to strike ISIS militarily.
While the CNN poll indicates Americans think ISIS has the ability to attack the United States, Obama said in the NBC interview there has been no "immediate intelligence" that signifies the terrorist group is a threat.
The CNN/ORC poll shows that only 30% of Americans think that he has a clear plan for dealing with ISIS.
In September 2010, only 3% of Americans named terrorism as the most important problem facing the country.
