(CNN)A leader of pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region said Friday he is not interested in a truce with the Ukrainian government in Kiev because his troops are on the offensive.
"There will be no attempts from our side to talk about the ceasefire," he said, reported Russian state news agency RIA.
The news agency said that "Russian-terrorist troops" faced off with Ukrainian soldiers Thursday along Bakhumtka Highway, even posting a picture that showed a man with stripes on his clothing, suggesting that he was part of the Russian military.
On Wednesday, for instance, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said that "more than 9,000 Russian troops (crossed) our Russian-Ukrainian border, bring with them hundreds and hundreds of tanks, armed personnel carriers, and killing Ukrainian civilians and attacking Ukrainian troops."
At least 262 people were killed in the fighting from January 13 through Wednesday alone, the report said.
Then in April, violence broke out in two Ukrainian regions that border Russia -- Donetsk and Luhansk -- as separatist leaders declared independence from the government in Kiev.
