Novato, California (CNN) -- When health care reform passed Congress more than two years ago, Julie Walters yelled for her husband to come into the living room where she was watching the vote live on television.
But now Violet's parents are worried they won't be able to breathe easily again.
This week, the Supreme Court is hearing a debate on health care reform.
Before health care reform, there was a $5 million lifetime limit on Violet's insurance policy.
Health care reform made lifetime limits illegal -- which is why Violet's family breathed easier when it passed -- but now her parents are worried the Supreme Court could restore the limits and Violet would lose her insurance.
After health care reform passed, Walters and McManus felt more secure about Violet's future and decided to have another child.
Violet's parents know not everyone shares their enthusiasm about health care reform.
