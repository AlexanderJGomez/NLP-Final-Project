Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- A South Korean court has issued an arrest warrant for the brother of President Lee Myung-bak on bribery charges, a court official said Wednesday, dealing a blow to the governing party ahead of elections later this year.
Lee Sang-deuk is not the first relative of a South Korean president to face criminal charges.
Lee Sang-deuk's arrest came after the announcement by Park Geun-hye, the daughter of former President Park Chung-hee, that she would be running for president this year.
Her mother was shot and killed in 1974 by a Japanese-born Korean who had close ties to North Korea.
