James Gandolfini was a master of the small things.
You're like Mozart,' " David Chase, who created "The Sopranos," said in a statement.
And, in fact, it was all these things, held together on screen by Gandolfini as woebegone Mafia chief (or was that "waste management professional"?)
Gandolfini was one of three finalists for the role, Alan Sepinwall observed in his terrific TV history, "The Revolution Was Televised."
"
And with Gandolfini, Edie Falco, Michael Imperioli, Lorraine Bracco and so many more, "The Sopranos" gave life to the scripts.
It's easy to confuse actors with their most famous roles; with this one episode, Gandolfini showed that he was no more Tony Soprano than he was Kevin Finnerty, but that he was playing them.
"If anything, Gandolfini often took things further than Chase had planned," Sepinwall wrote.
In it, Gandolfini plays another New Jersey sad sack, this one a 1960s grocer failing to connect with his rock 'n' roll-besotted son.
Gandolfini will almost certainly be best remembered for Tony Soprano, his role of a lifetime.
