Jerusalem (CNN) -- The corruption trial of former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert ended Tuesday with a mixed verdict.
Olmert became prime minister in 2006 after succeeding Sharon, who suffered a massive stroke.
Earlier this year, Olmert told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that millions of dollars from the "extreme right wing" in the United States helped oust him from government and derailed a peace plan with the Palestinians.
There is no question about it," Olmert told CNN.
