Washington (CNN) -- A former employee of the National Archives was sentenced Thursday to 18 months in prison for stealing rare recordings from the government to sell on the Internet.
The government said 4,806 of those items were taken from the National Archives.
That former radio engineer, J. David Goldin, told the Washington Post he saw the listing for the Babe Ruth hunting recording when he was searching the Internet in September 2010.
