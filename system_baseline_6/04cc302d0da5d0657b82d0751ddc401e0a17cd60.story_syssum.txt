(CNN) -- Sitting in the first lady's box listening to the President Barack Obama push for movement on immigration reform, Cristian Avila no longer had to keep his head down and live in fear of being deported.
Avila caught the attention of the Obama administration during his 22-day fast on the National Mall in support of immigration reform last November.
We revived the conversation," Avila said.
So let's get immigration reform done this year," he said.
Still, Avila remains optimistic that immigration reform will happen in 2014.
It shouldn't take any longer," Avila said.
