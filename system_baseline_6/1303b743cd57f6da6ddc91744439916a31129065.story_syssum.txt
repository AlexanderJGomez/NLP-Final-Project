The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland at the base of the neck.
"Our thyroid, even though it's a small gland in your neck, controls everything," says endocrinologist Karen Smith.
This is called hypothyroidism, and the symptoms are somewhat elusive.
And while these symptoms might be signals that something other than your thyroid is the issue, it's worth getting it tested.
"Hyperthyroidism is when the thyroid is actually making too much thyroid hormone.
It took almost a year for her to figure it out since she had no family history to worry about, and most thyroid problems are usually genetic, even though she displayed all the classic symptoms.
"The treatment is very different from hypothyroidism; we are actually trying to slow the function of the thyroid down.
"It's a substance that when you give it, it will actually damage the thyroid to help put out the fire, so to speak, to put out the flame of the overactive gland."
Because there are certain risks with even mild changes in thyroid levels, those considered at high risk, including pregnant women and those with a family history of thyroid problems, need to get tested earlier and more frequently, Smith said.
