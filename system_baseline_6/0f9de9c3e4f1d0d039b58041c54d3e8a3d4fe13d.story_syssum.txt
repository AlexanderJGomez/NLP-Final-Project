The reason for this, wrote Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a former economist for the George W. Bush administration, is that unemployment is "intricately linked to the length of unemployment benefits."
One, it provides an economic rationale for resisting benefit extension: Jobless insurance discourages people from taking available work.
Jobless insurance isn't a cause of unemployment.
Why?
But a low participation rate is bad for the economy and for everyone.
The Republicans no doubt fear that if they agree to an extension of unemployment benefits, or compromise on any safety net program, that they won't get the credit.
But if the economy on its own is incapable of creating the 7.4 million jobs needed to return to "normal," what does such a formulation mean?
