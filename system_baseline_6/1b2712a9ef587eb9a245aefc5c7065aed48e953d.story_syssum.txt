(Rolling Stone) -- This has been the first rock & roll decade without revolution, or true revolutionaries, to call its own.
The first 10 entries here span the Clash's polyglot punk, Prince's crossover funkadelica, Afro-bop from Talking Heads and Paul Simon and hymns of innocence and experience by U2 and Tracy Chapman.
Looking at the best rock has had to offer in the Eighties, it's clear that there's plenty of life left in the old beast yet.
Released stateside in January 1980, with the decade but a pup and the new year in gear, "London Calling" was an emergency broadcast from rock's Last Angry Band, serving notice that Armageddon was nigh, Western society was rotten at the core, and rock & roll needed a good boot in the rear.
Released in tandem with the film of the same name, "Purple Rain" was more than simply a soundtrack, and it stands as Prince's most cohesive and accessible album.
"It got great critical acclaim, and we felt that it kind of took popular music to the next phase," says Frantz, "which is what we always wanted to do."
"Born in the U.S.A." -- the album, the song and the sixteen-month tour -- turned out to be the breakthrough that Springsteen fans had been expecting for a decade.
Michael Jackson, "Thriller"
"Even in the best days of our marriage, Richard and I didn't communicate with each other fabulously well," says Linda Thompson.
Perhaps that explains why "Shoot Out the Lights" is both the best and last album Richard and Linda Thompson made together.
