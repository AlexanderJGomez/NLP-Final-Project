O'Bannon argued athletes in the top tier of college basketball and football should be allowed to profit from their schools' use of their likenesses.
"Before the court in this case is only whether the NCAA violates antitrust law by agreeing with its member schools to restrain their ability to compensate Division I men's basketball and FBS football players any more than the current association rules allow," Wilken wrote.
"The ruling says the NCAA was operating illegally and college athletes do have rights," said Huma, who helped find players to join the case.
Vacarro called the decision his most important career accomplishment.
The judge wrote that the injunction will not affect student-athletes who enroll in college before July 1, 2016.
The NCAA's argument in both the ongoing O'Bannon suit and another one filed by former quarterback Sam Keller, also in federal court in Oakland, is that it is trying to protect the amateur model of college sports.
