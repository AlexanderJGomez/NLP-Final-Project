On the surface, Rwandan radio soap opera "Musekeweya," or "New Dawn," feels familiar.
"We were intrigued by this radio soap, its background and its popularity in Rwanda," Steketee said.
Steketee asked.
Steketee and Blankevoort's documentary, "Love Radio," combines the story from "Musekeweya" with behind-the-scenes insights from everyday Rwandans and people involved in the making of the radio drama.
They serve, rather, as "a tool for the imagination," Steketee said.
"Enough is enough with your divisive thoughts."
"Rwanda is doing remarkably well," Steketee said.
