NEW YORK (CNN) -- Two George Washington Bridge security guards photographed sleeping on the job have been fired, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
"The first time I shrugged it off and said, 'I can't believe he's sleeping,'" said Lepore.
Three weeks later, it did happen again, but this time with a different guard, according to Lepore.
The sleeping guards were employees of FJC Security, a security contractor used by the Port Authority, which operates the George Washington Bridge along with all other bridges leading into Manhattan.
"It is unacceptable, particularly given the experience the Port Authority had with 9/11," she said, referring to the Port Authority's role as the operator of the World Trade Center.
