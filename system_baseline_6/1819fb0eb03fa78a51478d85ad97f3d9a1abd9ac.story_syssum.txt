Postal Service has outraged some stamp enthusiasts.
At this point, I'd be all for a stamp bearing the image of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford smoking crack if that could generate revenue.
Look, I understand that one of the mandates of the Postal Service is, "portraying the American experience to a world audience through the issuance of postage stamps."
Why?
Rather, it's because stamp purists are dismayed by the increasing commercialization of U.S. postage stamps.
So I say it's time for the Postal Service to roll out stamps that will make money.
