KEY WEST, Florida (CNN)  -- The USNS General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, a retired U.S. Navy warship, embarked on a sedentary new career Wednesday on the floor of the Gulf of Mexico.
Newman, who was circling in a helicopter above the 522-foot-long ship, said the Vandenberg appeared to rest in a level position on the Gulf floor.
To sink the Vandenberg, holes were made above the waterline in the side of the ship and throughout various decks, Newman said.
After Japan surrendered, the Vandenberg was the first Navy ship to return to New York Harbor.
In the 1960s the Air Force used the Vandenberg to track missiles.
The largest ship ever scuttled to create an artificial reef was the decommissioned aircraft carrier USS Oriskany, which sank to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico off the Florida coast in 2006, according to the U.S. Navy.
It sank in water about 212 feet deep.
