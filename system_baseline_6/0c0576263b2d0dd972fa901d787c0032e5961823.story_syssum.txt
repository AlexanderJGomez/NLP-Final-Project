Amid rumors that pop star Justin Bieber was considering a move to Atlanta, the Regular Guys, a morning show on Atlanta radio station Rock 100.5, put together a fake neighborhood group and pulled the wool over the eyes of the world's news organizations.
"The Buckhead Neighborhood Coalition is an organization put together by 'the Regular Guys Show,' " host Larry Wachs admitted Monday after the show's cast completed its "protest" in front of an on-the-market mansion.
It warned that "Justin Bieber's relocation to Atlanta can be nothing but bad for our children, as well as the community.
"That's a big win," Wachs said of the prank.
There had been numerous Bieber sightings across the Atlanta area: skating rinks, a fast-food restaurant and a nightclub.
