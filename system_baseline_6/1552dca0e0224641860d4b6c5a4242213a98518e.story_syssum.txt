The compromise amendment by Republicans John Hoeven of North Dakota and Bob Corker of Tennessee would increase border security, a demand by conservative opponents of the immigration bill.
If enacted, the bill would create a path to citizenship for roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants while enhancing security along the border with Mexico.
They argued the promises of increased border security before giving undocumented immigrants permanent residency would end up proving empty.
Grassley conceded he voted for the 1986 measure, which also called for increased border security, and called his support then a mistake he regrets.
