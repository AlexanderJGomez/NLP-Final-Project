Phillip Garrido, who with his wife is charged in the 1991 kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard, had been convicted of kidnapping before.
In her testimony, Hall said Garrido asked for a ride in her car, then bound and handcuffed her before taking her to a small warehouse in Reno, Nevada, where he repeatedly raped her for 5Â½ hours.
The trial transcript reveals that Garrido told authorities that one hour before Hall's kidnapping, he tried to kidnap another woman, who wrestled away and escaped.
In the case involving Hall, CNN reviewed the 1977 trial documents, which include Garrido's psychiatric evaluation and the testimony of Hall and Garrido.
Hall, too, was taken directly to a carefully prepped small warehouse after her kidnapping.
"You might as well get that our of your mind; you are going with me, you have got no choice," Hall testified Garrido told her, according to court transcripts.
In the back, Garrido created a space set up like a stage.
From the moment she got to the mini-warehouse, Hall said it was clear to her Garrido was a man on a mission.
One hour before Hall was kidnapped in her own vehicle, Garrido asked a different woman in South Lake Tahoe, California, for a ride.
Like Hall, she obliged.
The court documents also discussed Garrido's use of marijuana, cocaine and LSD, which Garrido said was so heavy it fueled his sexual desires and sometimes pushed him to a point he could no longer control them.
"I had this fantasy that was driving me to do this inside of me," Garrido testified.
Hall was curious, too, even during her kidnapping, what would make Garrido do this to her.
