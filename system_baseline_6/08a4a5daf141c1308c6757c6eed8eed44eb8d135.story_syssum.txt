Jansen, the first black dean of education at the University of the Free State, is one of South Africa's leading academics and intellectuals.
Passionate about the transformative power of knowledge, Jansen holds strong opinions about the state of education in South Africa.
A firm believer of the society's responsibility to insist on a qualitative education system, Jansen,  a Fulbright scholar, assumed his current role at the University of the Free State in 2009 after the institution faced controversy over racism and racial integration.
Citing reconciliation "on a deeply divided campus," Jansen decided to invite the students to return to the university and resume their studies, regardless of their legal consequences.
