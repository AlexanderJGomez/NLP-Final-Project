"The first time people meet you, they want to hear the sensational part" of the crash, says Ben, 39.
A buyer for Belk department stores, Laura was in New York for the fashion market.
Waiting to board, she fired off e-mails and thought little of the flight home or those around her.
He was in 20A, a window seat on the left side of the plane.
Laura, who didn't notice Ben, thumbed through a Glamour magazine.
"The whole back of the engine was pretty much engulfed in flames, just shooting out of the back," he says.
Some thought they were going back to LaGuardia.
Three rows in front of him, Laura thought about calling her family.
She'd jumped at the chance to take on a bigger role with Belk in Charlotte.
Her bird phobia was rooted in days on the farm, where her grandmother kept chickens.
As the plane glided silently through the air, Ben peeked out the window every once in a while.
Water lapped at Laura's leather boots.
I've been in a plane crash."
A flight attendant in first class waved passengers to the front.
In the media blitz that followed, Laura noticed Ben for the first time on television.
Six months after the crash, when about 20 survivors and their families gathered at a home near Charlotte, Ben and Laura met in person for the first time.
"We were family," Ben says, "and we didn't want to ruin that aspect of it."
Ben never sits at a window seat.
"It put me back in that seat," she says, tears in her eyes.
Her relationship with Ben, she says, is another "positive outcome" from that day.
"Think about how you want to write today's page," Ben says.
