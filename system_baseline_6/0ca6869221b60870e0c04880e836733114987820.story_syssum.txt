So when I learned CNN's Talk Asia had booked the Beach Boys for an interview in Hong Kong, I jumped at the chance to interview Al Jardine, Mike Love and Brian Wilson.
Although their new song is about a technology the band is nostalgic about, the Beach Boys are not stuck in the past.

Wilson tells me the production took little more than a month.
Like a roller coaster, "Good Vibrations" twists and turns like a joyride of sound.
Half a century on, the Beach Boys are still creating new music that captures the emotional thrills of youth.
But where was Wilson?
