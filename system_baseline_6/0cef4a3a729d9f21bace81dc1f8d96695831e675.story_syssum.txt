"I think it was my best match of the whole week," Nadal said, ATPWorldTour.com reported.
The No.4 seed had a similarly straightforward semifinal match against Philipp Kohlschreiber, downing the German 6-2 6-1.
But once again Sharapova was pegged back in the second, as the German rallied to take the set comfortably.
Sharapova will play Li Na in Sunday's final.
But Sharapova holds an 8-5 head-to-head record overall.
