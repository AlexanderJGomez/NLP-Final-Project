Sextantio (Via Principe Umberto, Santo Stefano di Sessanio; +39 0862 899112) in Santo Stefano is one of several so-called "diffuse hotels" that eschew the usual hotel model of grouping rooms and facilities under one roof.
Instead, Sextantio's 29 rooms, spa, wine bar, restaurant and reception lie scattered in separate buildings formerly used as barns, stables, pigsties, wine cellars and farmers' or shepherds' lodgings.
A path leads to my room -- La Bianca -- one of the closest cottages to the reception (the farthest one lies 200 meters away).
Lying back on my wrought iron king size bed, I spot an old bird's nest among the wood ceiling beams.
"This is what I call 'authentic' Italy," says Kihlgren.
"It's one thing coming here as a visitor, and another living here" says Dina Rusciolelli, owner of La Bettola di Geppetto, the village tavern.
Sitting at the scarred wooden tables of the Cantinone, a large dining room 50 meters from reception, Franco Cannioli serves me pan bagnato -- a dish of bread and vegetables -- with cured meats, lentil soup, pecorino cheese, pears and nuts.
There's a crystal bottle of Genziana and a crackling fire waiting for me when I get back to my room in evening.
The spa area at Aquaesinis, a traditional farm in Sardinia, used to be a wine cellar.
The Degustation Room, an old mill, serves Tuscany's top cured meats and cheese.
