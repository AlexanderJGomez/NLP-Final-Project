(CNN) -- It's been sort of a rough week for Google+.
"Google+ is a knee-jerk reaction, a study in short-term thinking, predicated on the incorrect notion that Facebook is successful because they built a great product," Yegge wrote in what was supposed to be an internal memo.
"Some people spend all their time on Mafia Wars," he wrote.
The memo comes on the heels of a report from Chitika Insights, a Web analytics firm, saying traffic on Google+ has plummeted 60% since it opened to the public on September 20.
"If Google's management truly believed in Google+ as the future of the company, they would be more engaged."
