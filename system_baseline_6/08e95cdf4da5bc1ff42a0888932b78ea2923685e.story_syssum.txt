This understated entrance marked an extraordinary moment for the kingdom and for the Olympics itself, as the first occasion in the history of the Games when all countries participating have had women athletes in their teams.
Women boxers made history by being included in the games for the first time, and the U.S.'s gymnastics team won a brace of medals for their remarkable performance.
Controversy over the disparate treatment of male and female athletes arose when it was revealed that both Japan and Australia had made their women's football teams fly coach while their male colleagues enjoyed the luxury -- and extra leg room -- of business class.
As for those Saudi Arabian women athletes, they failed, as expected, to win an Olympic medal, but perhaps winning just wasn't the point.
"It was the opportunity of a lifetime."
