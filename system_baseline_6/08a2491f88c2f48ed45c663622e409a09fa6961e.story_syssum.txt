It means England, who invented the game of cricket but has never won the World Cup, still hasn't been past the last eight stage of the one-day tournament since 1992.
"Pretty poor to be knocked out of a World Cup so early, it is very disappointing," Morgan said at the post-match presentation.
"It's a hollow feeling at the moment," Moores said after England's defeat.
Despite committing a year to prepare for the World Cup, England dismissed Alastair Cook as skipper less than two months before the tournament in Australia and New Zealand began.
