(CNN)Peter Schipper presses a key on the enormous Wurlitzer organ console in front of him and a police siren wails across the cinema stage.
"When we first took her apart, she was in a very bad condition," said Dick Cuiper, a 55-year-old computer programmer who worked on a project to restore the organ with Schipper, a 67-year-old piano tuner, bookkeeper Pieter Kroon, 76, and other volunteers and technicians.
The organ is in immaculate order but, says Kroon, some of the machinery has been cobbled together from odds and ends.
"You cannot go to any store to buy the things the organ needs, they're not made any more," he says.
The volunteers still spend hours every week maintaining the organ, but time is limited because the cinema hosts a full program of movie screenings.
It's a great privilege for all of us to play," says Kroon.
