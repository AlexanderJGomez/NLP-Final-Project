(CNN)  -- Darren Tuck, the man who gave police a tape depicting the rape of a 3-year-old girl, turned himself in Sunday to Nye County, Nevada, authorities.
Tuck's attorney Harry Kuehn said last week on CNN's "Nancy Grace" that Tuck had been "wracked by indecision" as to what to do with the tape once he realized what it was.
"The mother has cooperated with us," De Meo said.
Stiles was a distant friend of the girl's family, De Meo said.
"She's what you'd expect a little girl in elementary school to be like," he said.
De Meo addressed Stiles directly on Saturday: "Turn yourself in to your local law enforcement agency," he said.
The FBI is also seeking Stiles on state charges of sexual assault and lewdness with a minor under the age of 14 in a separate matter, De Meo said.
