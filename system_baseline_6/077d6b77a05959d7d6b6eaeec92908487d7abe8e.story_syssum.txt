While many young adults are now covered by the Affordable Care Act, able to remain on their parents' insurance until age 26, the rules are different for those like Cox-Reed, who grew up in the foster care system.
Medicaid coverage will be extended for former foster youth until they reach 26, as long as the individual was in foster care and enrolled in Medicaid until the age of 18.
States will only be required to keep former foster children on Medicaid if they continue to reside in the state where they were in foster care originally.
"You can't be on a film set if you are uninsured," Cox-Reed said.
Even if this part of the ACA is reinterpreted, former foster children like Cox-Reed may face other challenges with the existing system -- namely, not all doctors and dentists accept Medicaid.
"People think, 'Oh yeah, the foster kids have everything covered for them, they can get everything done with their medical card,' but it's not true," she said.
"States are still trying to figure out how these former foster youth can be identified, how they can let young adults know that this benefit is open to them and how they can enroll," Lehmann said.
