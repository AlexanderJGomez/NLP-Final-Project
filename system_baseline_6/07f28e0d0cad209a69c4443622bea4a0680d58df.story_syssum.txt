Wayne LaPierre says the Mexican drug war isn't a reason to restrict gun ownership in the U.S.
So let's learn the lies that led to their gun ban.
But that's precisely how the 1994 gun ban came about.
But the guns aren't designed or used by the military.
As the study mandated by that Congress found, "The banned weapons and magazines were never used in more than a modest fraction of all gun murders" in the first place.
That's how gun abolitionists claim Mexican gun laws are so strict that our "weak laws" (read: freedoms) are to blame for "fueling the violence" in Mexico.
â€¢ You have to believe that Mexico's drug cartels, which possess the wealth and armies of nations, prefer American semiauto target and hunting rifles over fully automatic machine guns and any other military arms they want to crush opposition.
Those that make possible Mexico's colossal corruption wear the garb of not only drug lords and gun runners, but also of too many city mayors and police chiefs, state bureaucrats and military officers.
And use existing gun and drug laws against violent drug syndicates here and in Mexico.
