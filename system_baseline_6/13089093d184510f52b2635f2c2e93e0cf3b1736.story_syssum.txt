Comanche, arguably the world's most hotly-anticipated yacht, has finally taken to the seas and for its billionaire owner Jim Clark, it's a chunk of money that could land him a place in the record books.
Clark likes to talk about how the team behind his creation "is pushing the envelope" with Comanche, which lends its origins in part to the yacht Speedboat, which was launched in 2008.
"It was in the late 1980s that I bought my first sail boat and, from there, you always want to get something bigger," he says.
The last Comanche tribe chief Quanah Parker surrendered about 60 miles from where Clark grew up in an area where "the plains are very flat like the ocean".
Clark tells the story of going out on the first Wild Oats, Bob Oatley's boat that has dominated the Sydney to Hobart race, and being blown away by the technology of a keel boat.
"This is so cutting edge that we'll got into that race with lingering doubts it might go wrong," admits Read.
