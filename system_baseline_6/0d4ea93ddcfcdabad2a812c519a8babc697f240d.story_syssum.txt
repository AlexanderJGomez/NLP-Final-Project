Students at the University of South Florida will be soaring to new academic heights, with drones.
Now, USF's library is taking it a step further by giving students the opportunity to operate the drones, which are valued at $1,500 apiece.
"We have a global sustainability program, and they are mapping out the campus to see energy usage, so they can use the drones to help map out the campus," he explained.
As of now, the program aims to keep the drones on USF's campus unless a professor makes the case for an exception, and students will be liable for any damages to the equipment.
