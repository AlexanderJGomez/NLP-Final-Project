"It was a time when China had very few friends, so we decided to step in and help with what we could put together; funding and expertise," says Wong, founder of the China Exploration & Research Society.
In 1985, when Wong led an expedition to find the source of the Yangtze River, he says he and his team traveled for nine days on horseback.
Now we could probably drive all the way to the source," says Wong, who began leading expeditions for National Geographic before setting up CERS.
Today Wong has to look harder to find truly out of the way places he deems worthy of exploration.
What wasn't possible suddenly may become possible," says Wong.
During a visit two years ago to China's border with Vietnam, Wong said political unrest made exploration problematic.
Wong says the border between China's southwestern Yunnan province and Myanmar is also ripe for exploration, as it is free from the political complications of more sensitive areas close to Tibet or Vietnam.
If you're like a sprint runner, 'Oh, I got there first and I'm home already and on the computer sharing it on Facebook,' then I don't call it exploration," says Wong.
