(CNN) -- William Fox-Pitt sounds rather like a character straight out of the pages of a novel and, at times, his life has played out like one.
But if you're doing something you love, it's worth the risk.
For all the bravado required for such a dangerous sport, Fox-Pitt talks of that moment as though the emotional wounds are still raw.
This is not the rider nor family man brushing off the obvious repercussions of a fall, but rather the elite athlete in him knowing that he cannot spend too much time dwelling on the what ifs of his sport.
But while Fox-Pitt wants to be safe, he does not want to entirely eradicate the inherent dangers of horse and man riding over gargantuan fences, often at breakneck speeds.
It's the excitement, the anticipation and the nerves.
"Horses are great releases for people and I think the riding was just that for her.
"I can see people like to make a lot of the rivalry and that's good for the sport.
"It's someone that the media and people supporting make quite a hoodoo about and that can be quite tiring.
"I really had to do London -- if I hadn't that would have been devastating -- and in many ways everything else is a bonus," Fox-Pitt adds.
I'm still having fun."
