Crowds flock to Rynek Starego Miasta, Warsaw's Old Town Market Place.
To get a feel for the city that was known as the Paris of Eastern Europe before World War II, stroll down Nowy Świat Street, lined with restaurants, cafes, bookstores and small shops.
The street is also home to a sweet Warsaw tradition.
They're best when they're still warm, when it's especially hard to eat just one.
It's here that you'll find the entrances to Warsaw's Łazienki Park, once the summer residence of Poland's royalty.
But any stroll through Warsaw is also a walk through the city's tragic history.
"Fall in love with Warsaw," the capital invites visitors in a slogan printed on posters all over town.
