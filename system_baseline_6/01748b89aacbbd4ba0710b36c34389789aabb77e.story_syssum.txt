The Chelyabinsk region, the hardest-hit area, asked federal authorities Monday for $16.6 million in aid, RIA Novosti said.
About 200,000 square meters (almost 240,000 square yards) of glass were broken in total, authorities said.
The national space agency, Roscosmos, said scientists believe one meteoroid entered the atmosphere, where it burned and disintegrated into fragments.
"This is no exaggeration."
"For some seconds I simply stood," he said, amid the sound of breaking glass.
"This was perhaps the single greatest contributor to the blast damage."
