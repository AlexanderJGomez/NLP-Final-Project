"I think it will change the whole industry," says Sengeh, who is from Sierra Leone.
But the horrors of war didn't prevent Sengeh from thinking big.
He had realized early on that many amputees in Sierra Leone opted not to use any prostheses because of the discomfort they were causing them.
But Sengeh is not only coming up with new creations that can impact lives and change industry.
"We do have the talent and young people within Sierra Leone, within Africa as a whole, to invent the future," he says.
Those are what's needed to develop products that will change the world.
