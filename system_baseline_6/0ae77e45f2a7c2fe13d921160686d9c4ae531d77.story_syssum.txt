(CNN) -- All 77 NATO service members wounded in a Saturday attack against a coalition base in Afghanistan are U.S. troops, a spokeswoman for the International Security Assistance Force said Sunday.
Allen said the attack indicates "much more what the Taliban are unable to do" than what they are able to do.
NATO also said 77 of its personnel were injured, while the provincial government said only 10 people were injured.
Coalition and Afghan troops have been fighting the tenacious Taliban militants in the Afghan-Pakistani region.
August was the deadliest month for U.S. forces in Afghanistan since the conflict began.
