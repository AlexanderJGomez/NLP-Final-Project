The arrest was made by police from Lakeland, Florida, the Polk County Sheriff's Office and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, who were accompanied by FBI agents, he said.
The FBI said Holt worked for Wiles at the time he disappeared.
The FBI said it traveled to six countries and three states tracing Wiles' trips and interviewing business associates.
Without disclosing details, agents said the investigation led them back to Holt and his whereabouts the day Wiles disappeared.
The FBI will not reveal what makes agents believe Wiles is dead.
