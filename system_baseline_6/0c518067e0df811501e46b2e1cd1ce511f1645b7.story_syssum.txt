"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" premiered on television December 6, 1964, and is now one of the holiday season's perennial favorites.
The pair were thought to be the last of the surviving production puppets.
One fan posted on social media, "I love watching Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer...and remember our tv that was like this growing up.
