According to Aruban prosecutors, the missing woman and the suspect arrived on the island July 31 from the United States.
Lopez denied statements by prosecutors that his client is no longer cooperating with authorities in the investigation.
Articles of clothing were found Friday in one mine, but authorities had not determined whether they are related to the disappearance of Gardner, Aruban Solicitor General Taco Stein told CNN.
"In anticipation of any possible reason of prolongation of the client's detention, we can state that no felony has been committed by him," Lopez said in his Sunday statement.
