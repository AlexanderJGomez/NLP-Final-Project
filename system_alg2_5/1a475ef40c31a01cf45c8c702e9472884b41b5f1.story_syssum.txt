North Korea has arrested a U.S. citizen for committing an unspecified crime against the country, state media reported Friday, 10 days after U.S. officials said an American had been detained by the reclusive nation.
His detention was first reported by South Korean newspapers, which said that Bae, a tour operator, entered North Korea at the port city of Rajin accompanied by five other tourists.
The Embassy of Sweden acts as our protecting power for issues involving U.S. citizens in North Korea," Nuland said then.
The United States and North Korea do not have diplomatic relations.
