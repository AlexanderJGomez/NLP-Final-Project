"Oklahoma has one of the highest climatological likelihoods for tornadoes of any place in the nation," according to Bob Henson of the National Center for Atmospheric Research.
Moreover, it partly followed the path of an EF5 tornado that walloped metro Oklahoma City in 1999, killing three dozen people.
Monday's storm caused enormous property destruction and killed at least two dozen people.
Such twisters are defined as those that have winds of at least 200 mph, are a half-a-mile or more wide, and produce the most fatalities.
"In the last three years we have set records for the most tornadoes in 12 consecutive months and the least number of tornadoes in 12 consecutive months," Brooks said.
