Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's decision to seek congressional authorization of a military attack against the Syrian government is in part his way of trying to fix a legal problem.
To help bolster the president's legal case, the Obama administration over the weekend asked Congress to authorize the use of military force.
A senior administration official acknowledged the international legal constraints but said the president is authorized to take action with or without Congress, in part for U.S. national security reasons.
A second senior administration official said the United States is acting on humanitarian as well as security grounds.
The administration official said the military authorization was written narrowly to address Syria but asserted it also has to take contingencies into account.
John Bellinger, former legal adviser to the State Department and the National Security Council under President George W. Bush, said Obama's international law problem is of his own making.
Chesney said the problem is that international law doesn't necessarily take into account events like those in Syria or Kosovo.
Obama has long grappled with the issue of how to deal with civil war atrocities when international law doesn't offer a way to stop them.
Obama added: "I believe that force can be justified on humanitarian grounds, as it was in the Balkans, or in other places that have been scarred by war.
