About 1.55 million students will be affected, 850,000 of them in elementary school, Notimex said.
The first cases of H1N1, also called swine flu, were confirmed in Mexico in April.
In the United States, federal officials released new guidelines this month for containing the spread of the virus across the nation's school system.
The revised federal guidelines advise parents to keep children infected with the H1N1 virus out of school for 24 hours after the fever has gone away.
The virus has spread around the world with unprecedented speed, according to the WHO.
