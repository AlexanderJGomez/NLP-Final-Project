CIA contract security officers who responded to the terrorist attacks on the U.S. ambassador in Benghazi, Libya, last year were told by the CIA to sign nondisclosure agreements just before a memorial ceremony at the CIA's headquarters in Langley, Virginia, this past May, a congressional source told CNN.
CIA contract operatives testifying before a classified House Intelligence subcommittee on Wednesday and Thursday directly contradicted Brennan's answer, a congressional source told CNN.
Mark Zaid, an attorney representing three of the CIA contractors, told the Weekly Standard, "There is no doubt that the NDAs (nondisclosure agreements) would not have been presented to them had it not been for Benghazi.
The CIA contractors told to sign the nondisclosure agreements were attending a memorial service for Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, two CIA operatives who died in the Benghazi attacks.
The allegation was first raised last year, after which the CIA told Congress there was no order to stand down.
The agents eventually did respond to the attack, pulling off a heroic attempt to save U.S. State Department officials who were under siege.
