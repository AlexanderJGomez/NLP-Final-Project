Jordan is now home to more than 1.3 million Syrian refugees, half absorbed during the last 24 months.
"The extraordinary burden of the Syrian crisis, as well as any potential regional crisis including the Iraqi situation, should also be met by the international community," Toukan told me.

But Iraq is now very much part of the equation.
"We feel we are not getting enough to continue to play our moderating role in the region and meeting the needs of all those refugees is not only a humanitarian issues, it also neutralizes any extremist tendencies," said Toukan.
