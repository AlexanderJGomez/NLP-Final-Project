Just two defeats from its first nine games had fans dreaming of the old days when their side was a force in European football.
In 1959, Eintracht won its one and only Bundesliga title and went on to reach the European Cup final the following year.
The club has struggled to compete with the giants of Bayern Munich, Dortmund and Schalke, instead spending its time moving between the top two divisions.
FÃ¼rth, who was promoted from the second division alongside Frankfurt last year, has struggled so far this term.
Well, that would be the small question of a trip to the Allianz Arena to face Bayern Munich side which reached last season's Champions League Final and has won eight of its nine league games this season.
