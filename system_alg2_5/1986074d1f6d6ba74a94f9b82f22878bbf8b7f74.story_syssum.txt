(CNN) -- More than 1,300 Palestinians died and about 5,400 others were wounded during Israel's three-week offensive in Gaza, the Web site of the Palestinian Authority's Central Bureau of Statistics said Monday.
Israel said its offensive was aimed at stopping Hamas militants from firing rockets into southern Israel.
About 80 percent of crops in Gaza were destroyed, according to the agency.
"This was not a war against the Palestinians," he said.
Israel began the offensive in response to rocket fire by Hamas militants after showing eight years of restraint, the officer said.
"We want to give this cease-fire a chance, but if Hamas chooses not to, we will utilize all of our means," he said.
