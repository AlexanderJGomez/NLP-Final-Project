New York (CNN) -- A man who spent nearly 25 years behind bars for a 1989 Brooklyn murder he didn't commit has filed a notice of claim to sue New York City for $162 million, according to his lawyer Wednesday.
After years of reviewing documents and re-interviewing witnesses as part of a joint investigation between his attorneys and the Brooklyn district attorney's Conviction Review Unit, it was determined that the only evidence tying him to the crime was an alleged witness who later recanted her statement.
A New York City Law Department spokesman said the claim will be reviewed.
In the course of the investigation, the Conviction Review Unit found the receipt in police records, time stamped and dated -- solidifying Fleming's claim that he was in Florida at the time of the crime, according to the district attorney's office.
The review unit also interviewed Fleming's former girlfriend, who said she called Fleming the night of the killing while he was still at his hotel in Florida.
She said police persuaded her to give a statement against Fleming to avoid going back to jail.
