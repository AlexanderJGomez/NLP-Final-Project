"Due to a misunderstanding on our part, earlier (Friday) we inadvertently issued a video link that had been sent for our perusal," according to a statement from Israel's Government Press Office, which distributed the link to media outlets.
A number of other people were wounded.
Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev dismissed the the video link, saying, "The GPO sends out lots of articles.
Regev said he first noticed the video on the New York Times website.
It was not the first time the Israeli GPO stirred controversy with its public communications on the Gaza flotilla.
