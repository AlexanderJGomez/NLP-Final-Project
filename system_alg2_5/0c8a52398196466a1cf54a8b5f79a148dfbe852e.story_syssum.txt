There are a few thousand Egyptians left in Tunisia awaiting evacuation after more than 40,000 were taken home, said Firas Kayal, a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency, on Saturday.
Kayal said Saturday more than 10,000 Bangladeshis are awaiting transport in Tunisia.
Three commercial charter planes will take the Bangladeshis home from Djerba airport later Sunday, the British government said.
Almost 200,000 people, a majority of them foreign workers, have fled Libya -- nearly 100,000 to Tunisia and a similar number to Egypt -- according to the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
"We fear the regime might be blocking refugees from the border."
