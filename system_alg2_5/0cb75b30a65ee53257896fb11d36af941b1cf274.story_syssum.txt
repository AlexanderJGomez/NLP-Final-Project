"And I think that understanding the history of the Confederacy and understanding the history of the Civil War is something that every American and every young American should be part of."
One constant has been the importance of the Civil War.
If the fascination with soldiers continues from the 1960s to today, what has changed?
Today, the study of Confederate history is much more "inclusive" -- to use the word of choice for many state's 150th anniversary commissions -- as we look more deeply into the past.
Why did many take advantage of the first opportunity to escape to freedom while others remained "loyal" to the South?
At the opposite end of the spectrum, what about the Native Americans who had been here long before any Europeans, yet allied with the Confederacy?
We Americans -- from native Americans to those who have ancestors who wore the blue or gray to those who are descended from slaves to those who have recently come to our shores -- want to know ourselves.
And to know the Civil War, we must know and understand the Confederacy -- in all of its diversity.
