Cody Reeves works out with his fellow Old Guard soldiers.
Before,"it was all about catching the bad guy," Reeves said.
When an American soldier dies overseas, the Old Guard is called into action.
The six men receive the flag-draped casket, which can weigh 500 pounds, and carry the soldier's body to a waiting vehicle.
"You say, 'This guy might have a wife or kids or mother or father who's never going to see him again.'
But you can't show that on the outside," Steinborn said.
Some of the Old Guard choose to learn about the lives of the soldiers they've carried.
After drilling for countless hours on the base's grounds, they can feel if another man is even minutely out of step in the ceremony.
"When I was walking through the aircraft and saw the transfer case with the American flag draped over it, it was -- it was very emotional," Steinborn said.
