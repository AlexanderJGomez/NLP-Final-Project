Isabella dethroned Emma as the top name for girls born last year, according to the Social Security Administration's annual list of most popular baby names, released Saturday.
The boy's name that rocketed up the list the fastest is Cullen -- the name of the lead character in the popular "Twilight" book series.
As always, religious names retained their popularity -- even if some were somewhat unconventional.
The 10 most popular girls' names, in order, are: Isabella, Emma, Olivia, Sophia, Ava, Emily, Madison, Abigail, Chloe and Mia.
