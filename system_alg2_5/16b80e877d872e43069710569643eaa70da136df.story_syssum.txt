WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Bucking tradition, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will bypass Europe and travel to Asia on her maiden voyage overseas, diplomats familiar with the planning said Tuesday.
Traditionally U.S. secretaries of state make Europe or the Middle East their first official trip overseas.
Clinton was sworn in as America's 67th secretary of state on Monday -- for a second time.
"We have a lot of work to do [to ensure that] America's future can be even brighter than our storied past."
