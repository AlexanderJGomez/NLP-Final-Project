Shouldn't you find out if you have cancer and then decide whether to treat it?
In one of Ray Bradbury's most famous short stories, "The Skeleton," the lead character goes insane after becoming obsessed with the fact that he has something foreign and frightening inside himself.
Much has been written recently about why people are so upset over the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation to abandon the current practice of routinely screening healthy men for prostate cancer.
To understand the mental health implications of this idea we have to take a step back and ask why abandoning the PSA test would improve our society's health.
This means that many people with a positive test will turn out not to have prostate cancer.
In this situation it poses no health risk.
But the real cost would come from the fact that not following up on a positive PSA test would almost certainly promote the development of mood and anxiety disorders.
Why?
So from a mental health perspective, it seems to me the guidelines around PSA testing are clear: To continue PSA testing in low-risk individuals will significantly increase mental health morbidity if treatment guidelines change such that prostate cancers are not routinely removed.
