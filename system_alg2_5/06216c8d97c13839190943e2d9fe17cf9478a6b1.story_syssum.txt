(CNET) -- Verizon Wireless smartphone customers use 25 percent more data than AT&T iPhone customers, thanks in large part to new Verizon's new Android smartphones, a recent study indicates.
The fact that Verizon is seeing a major uptick in data usage in the past six months, largely due to new Android smartphones, could be a key predictor of wireless data usage patterns going forward.
Smartphone data usage started exploding for Verizon when the company launched its first Android phones in the fourth quarter last year, Finegold said.
For example, 71.2 percent of all AT&T cell phone subscribers, which includes users of smartphones like the iPhone as well as feature phones, use data services, while only 43 percent of all Verizon cell phone users subscribe to data services.
And about 47 percent of their iPhone subscribers use between 200MB and 2GB of data with about 90 percent of those customers using less than 1GB of data per month.
Verizon Wireless smartphone subscribers have similar usage patterns to those on AT&T's network.
For $15 a month, new smartphone subscribers can get up to 200MB of data per month.
And for $25 a month they can get 2GB of data.
According to the Validas report, a little more than 4 percent of Verizon's smartphone users consume more than 2GB of data per month compared with only about 2.5 percent of AT&T's iPhone customers.
T-Mobile only has about 22.3 percent of its cell phone subscriber base subscribing to data, and those consumers are only using about 120MB of data per month.
So it will be interesting to note whether the launch of this device will significantly move the needle on data usage on Sprint's network.
"People who travel tend to be more mobile, and they also tend to be power users when it comes to mobile data," Finegold said.
