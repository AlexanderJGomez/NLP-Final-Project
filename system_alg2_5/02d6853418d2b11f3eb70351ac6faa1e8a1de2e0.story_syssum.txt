Sollecito and Knox were convicted of Kercher's murder in 2009 but set free on appeal in 2011.
While maintaining his innocence, he says he does not clearly remember even if Knox spent the night with him.
He and Knox made mistakes the morning of the discovery, including trusting police investigators, he writes.
Neither he nor Knox had solid alibis for the night of Kercher's murder, Sollecito writes.
At one time after the first conviction, Sollecito's father sought the help of a private lawyer not connected to the case, who spoke to Perugia prosecutor Giuliano Mignini about striking a plea deal to cut Sollecito's sentence in exchange for evidence against Knox.
Mignini declined to comment about the book or the case until the high court appeal is completed.
Sollecito condemns his treatment by Perugia police who, he says, would not give him food or access to a lawyer during the questioning, even though it was clear to him that they were treating him as a suspect and not just a person informed of the facts of the case.
Sollecito wrote that he believed that Guede acted alone in killing Kercher.
Knox's book is due to be released in the spring.
