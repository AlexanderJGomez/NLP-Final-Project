After the president's speech, Elizabeth Alexander will read a poem she is writing for the occasion.
Alexander is a 46-year-old Yale University professor and a friend and former faculty colleague of Obama's.
Alexander: I think that the fact that President-elect Obama has decided to have a poem in this ceremony is a wonderful affirmation to the power of language, the way in which poetry gives us distilled and mindful and careful language that can both give us a moment of pause, a moment of contemplation and that can also ... look at the world from a slightly different angle.
...
Alexander: By writing and teaching.
Alexander: It's amazing, isn't it?
The fact that this country has -- with a multiracial coalition -- elected an extraordinary president who is African-American really does feel like just an exquisite moment for us to savor even as we recognize there's still a tremendous amount of work ahead of us.
...
Also the felicity of art ... the way in which it makes you draw a breath and look at the world in a different way is very useful to the process of thinking through new solutions.
Alexander: I think what I was trying to say is that at the end of the day, demographics doesn't really tell you about how your work is going to be received.
... On the one hand, I have devoted much of my work to African-American culture.
Alexander: Jazz is the music that I know deepest and love the most, and I mean jazz across the board because that's an incredibly diverse art, and also I must say, R&B, funk and soul speak very powerfully to me.
Alexander: Can you imagine?
