Gun debate?
Americans remain pleased for the general population -- even 15-year-old kids -- to have nearly unfettered access to all manner of firearms, including assault rifles.
I guess that's not surprising: We accept collateral damage for other privileges we enjoy.
After all, I've been told by some gun-rights advocates that reasonable restrictions on gun ownership will undoubtedly send us down a slippery slope to the abolition of all guns in America.
I'm confident that in the next few weeks there will be another school shooting.
Reasonable restrictions on guns will not lead to totalitarianism and anarchy.
