Nine other countries, together accounting for more than half the euro area's GDP, were downgraded at least one notch.
Italy -- hit with a two-notch downgrade -- is actually expected to structurally balance its 2012 budget.
The motivation for the downgrades given by Standard & Poor's actually cites the excessive attention given to fiscal austerity as one principal reason for the downgrading of a whole swath of euroland.
There are enough savings within the monetary union area to finance all public deficits of the eurozone's members.
The collection of savings within national pools means the capital markets have ceased to function in the euro area.
The ECB has thus become the "central counterparty" to most north-south lending in Europe.
This should be the main priority of Europe's leaders.
