"I see an artist pictured with her best friend.
These words from well-known music artists' rights advocate, educator and industry commentator, Moses Avalon, illustrate the degree to which the music industry is in rapid change.
Almost symbolic of this change is the significant deal between social networking web site MySpace and three major record labels -- Sony BMG, Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group -- to form MySpace Music.
While most experts believe record labels and the wider music industry have a strong future, there are mixed feelings about MySpace Music as a panacea for album sales.
"This is just one of these cases where big businesses are getting together... it's just mutually beneficial.
Working against the record labels is a plethora of other online music promoters.
However, will these sites be enough to topple the recording label giants?
"While you may not need a record label to get yourself out there, you still need a lot of the things that a record label has.
Lefsetz told CNN that record labels had too many valuable catalogs to disappear, but he felt they would decline if they did not find a new business model.
Avalon also forecasts more deals where 'sales' can be regained as music gets bundled in with products.
Lefsetz instead sees the future in a new business model for selling music, which offers the sale of bundled music at cheaper prices.
Dubber, meanwhile, is not convinced that the music industry will find a new model.
And Avalon's answer: surely not.
