Hoh Indian Reservation, Washington (CNN) -- For the Hoh, life centers on the silver waters just off their reservation.
At first the waters took out the garage and the small building Benally's grandfather used to smoke fish.
Although the lowlands where her family lived were always prone to flooding, Benally said the water rises more often now.
There is little room for new buildings and even where there is it's unlikely they could be put up -- more than 90 percent of the reservation is in the flood plain, according to tribal leadership.
According to a department study, the coast where the Hoh live could see an additional rise from climate change in sea levels of as much as 3 feet over the next century.
Last year, Penn decided to move away from the reservation.
For Tribal Chairperson Maria Lopez, the move away from the water won't come soon enough.
Tribal lore talks of an earthquake and giant wave that devastated the Pacific Northwest coastline 400 years ago.
