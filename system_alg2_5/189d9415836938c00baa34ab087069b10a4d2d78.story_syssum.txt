The U.S. military races to the moon to build a base -- to beat the Russians to the punch.
Hold that mindset.
Neither side wanted to get behind, and in 1959, the Soviet Union was already ahead in the space race -- putting the first unmanned spacecraft on the moon, the Luna 2.
The space around the Earth and moon would be considered a military theater.
Project Horizon would start out with 10 to 20 crew members on a mission to build a somewhat self-sustaining colony capable of producing its own oxygen and water.
The nuclear arms race was omnipresent in the '60s, and Project Horizon made room for its possible expansion to the moon.
Technological advances accelerated the Cold War and the space race through the 1960s, and U.S. military and intelligence agencies expounded in further papers on how the moon could be used for military purposes or intelligence gathering.
In 1967, the U.N. adopted the Outer Space Treaty banning the use of nuclear weapons from space -- including from the moon.
