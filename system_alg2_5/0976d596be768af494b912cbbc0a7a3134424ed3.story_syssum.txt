A U.S. general who oversaw nuclear weapons was relieved of his duties after he boozed, fraternized with "hot women" and disrespected his hosts during an official visit to Russia, Air Force officials said.
In addition, Carey announced he'd "met two hot women the night before," and continually interrupted a monastery guide during a tour, his speech slurred the entire time, the report said.
Days before Carey was relieved of his duties, another military officer with high-level responsibility for the country's nuclear arsenal lost his job.
The same missile unit at Malmstrom linked to the test cheating scandal failed a safety and security inspection "after making tactical-level errors -- not related to command and control of nuclear weapons," the Air Force Global Strike Command said.
In an unprecedented move, an Air Force commander stripped 17 of his officers of their authority to control and launch nuclear missiles.
