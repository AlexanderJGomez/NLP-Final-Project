Many pregnant women had been evacuated to give birth after Typhoon Haiyan left Tacloban's medical centers in shambles, but the mother didn't have time.
"It was a perfect delivery in a very imperfect environment."
Haiyan so brutally hammered Tacloban that the national Department of Health has sent medical teams to take over hospitals so local staff can rest and the medical centers -- many of them struggling to fulfill basic needs without electricity -- can be operational again, the Philippines Daily Inquirer reported.
During the storm, survivor Jenelyn Manocsoc held her 11-month-old boy on her head to keep him out of the water as she clung to roof rafters.
" she said.
Another survivor, Jovelyn Dy, had twin boys just three weeks ago, and she desperately wants to find a safe haven for them.
They could harm my children and us as well," she said.
