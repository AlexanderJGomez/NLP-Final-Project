Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- Christine O'Donnell shocked the political establishment last week with her victory in the Republican Senate primary in Delaware against Rep. Mike Castle.
Ever since Vietnam and Watergate shook public confidence in our government institutions, many Democrats and Republicans have defined themselves in opposition to the very job that they hope to win.
When pushing for signature legislation such as health care and financial regulation, the administration and Congress cut deals with the interest groups he once derided.
The political process is more than a backdrop to decision-making.
Unless Congress passes government reforms such as publicly financed elections to change that process, Tea Party politicians will either have to deal with it or languish.
Although Tea Party candidates castigate earmarks, government spending and pork barrel politics, all of those who are victorious will represent constituencies profoundly affected by the money that Congress allocates every year.
Voters should be extremely skeptical about the kinds of promises that candidates such as O'Donnell are making.
