(CNN)Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said his office has received death threats since his controversial comments accusing President Barack Obama of not loving America.
I believe it," Giuliani said.
The former mayor said he's received calls congratulating him for his remarks, including one from Louisiana Gov.
While the spokesman said Jindal did not endorse everything the former mayor said about Obama, he added the governor also has deep concerns about the president's leadership on Islamist radicalism.
"I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the President loves America.
In his latest comments to CNN, Giuliani noted he is not running for president in 2016.
By contrast, Giuliani pointed out, the President did make comments to the press after the racial unrest in Ferguson, Missouri.
Giuliani said the White House owes him an apology after stating that he had made similar remarks about Obama during the 2008 campaign.
I think, really, the only thing that I feel is I feel sorry for Rudy Giuliani today," Earnest added.
