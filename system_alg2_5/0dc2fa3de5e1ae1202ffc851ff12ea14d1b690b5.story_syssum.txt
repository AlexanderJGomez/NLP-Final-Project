MRI research has found very large differences in brain structure between men who have a sexual preference for children and those who have a sexual preference for adults.
The white matter that is affected in pedophilia and hebephilia is the white matter that connects the parts of the brain that respond to sexual images.
In fact, there is some evidence that gay men have areas of more white matter than straight men, in at least some parts of the brain (called the corpus callosum).
The misconception that gay men pose a disproportionate risk to children comes from a misunderstanding of men's sexual preferences: Pedophilia is the genuine sexual preference for children.
Nor is there any known route by which someone with a genuine sexual preference for adults can develop a genuine sexual preference for children, either girls or boys.
