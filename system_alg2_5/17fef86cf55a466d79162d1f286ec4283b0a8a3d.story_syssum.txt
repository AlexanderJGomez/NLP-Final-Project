Exiles -- who face never returning to Tibet as long as it is under Chinese rule -- stood on Tibetan soil this week, fulfilling a desire that has burned within since they fled westward across the Himalayas.
The display was the work of New York artist Tenzing Rigdol, 29, who clandestinely trucked in sacks containing 22 tons of dirt from Tibet to Dharamsala to construct his installation.
The only wish his father had was to see Tibet one more time.
"There are so many like my father who wanted to return," Rigdol said.
Beijing claims its sovereignty over Tibet goes back centuries and views the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, as a separatist.
The Dalai Lama summoned Rigdol to his residence after the opening of the installation Wednesday, Rigdol said.
Tenzing Tfuengue, 17, has never been to Tibet -- he was born and raised in India.
"Today, (Rigdol) made it a little bit possible," Tfuengue said.
But when it closes, Tibetan exiles will be allowed to take some of the dirt with them, a reminder always of the land they long to see.
