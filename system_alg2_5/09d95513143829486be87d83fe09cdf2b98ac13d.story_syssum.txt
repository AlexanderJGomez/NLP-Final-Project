LONDON, England (CNN) -- A yellow smiley-face badge, smeared with blood, has become the trademark for "Watchmen," the most critically revered of all comic books -- but it could also represent its troubled journey from page to big screen.
"Watchmen," created by the UK comic-book team of writer Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons, surfaced in 1986 as a monthly 12-issue series published by DC Comics (part of Time Warner, which owns CNN parent company Turner Broadcasting).
But what lifts "Watchmen" above its superhero peers is a complex, multi-layered narrative and depth of characterization that ensured it was the only comic book to make Time's 100 best novels since 1923.

Whoever made "Watchmen" would also do so without Moore's blessing.
Two other Moore adaptations also failed to translate.
Stephen Norrington's "The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen" (2003) was widely derided and the subject of a court case into which Moore was dragged; by the time of James McTeigue's better judged "V For Vendetta" (2005), Moore had asked his name be taken off any movie adaptations and refused to take royalties.
Snyder has retained "Watchmen's" 1980s setting and also recruited original artist Gibbons -- who still retains friendship with Moore -- to advise on production design.
So was it Moore who saw "Watchmen" end up in the courts for a case that risked scuppering its release?
But key will be whether Snyder can match "Watchmen's" dramatic beats against its green-screen chicanery for more than two hours (the Internet Movie Database lists the running time at 163 minutes).
What Alan Moore might think is another issue.
