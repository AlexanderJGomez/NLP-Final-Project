After killing a man at an Ohio Walmart, police interrogated his girlfriend, accusing her of lying, threatening her with jail time and suggesting she could be on drugs, according to a video obtained by CNN.
In the interrogation video, which was first posted on The Guardian's website on Sunday, a police detective repeatedly presses Crawford's tearful girlfriend, asking her where Crawford got the gun he had in the store.
"Why would he have a gun in the store?"
"Not that I.
"Don't tell me, 'not that you know,' because that's the first thing that I realize that somebody's not telling me the truth, when they say that kind of stuff," Curd says.
"I don't know any other way to tell you," Curd says.
In a statement officials released in September, Curd describes his questioning of Thomas at the police department.
Wright on Tuesday said his legal team filed a federal civil lawsuit against two police officers; Beavercreek's police chief; the city of Beavercreek and its police department; and Walmart.
Wright said police knew Crawford didn't have a firearm when he walked into the Walmart.
But Wright said that because Crawford was black, police made assumptions.
The interrogation video, he said, shows how police handled the case from day one.
