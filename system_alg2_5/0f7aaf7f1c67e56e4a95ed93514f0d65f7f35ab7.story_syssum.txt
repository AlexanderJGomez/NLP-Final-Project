The North American Aerospace Defense Command weather department says the streak of light that caused consternation from many most likely was part of a meteor shower.
"I saw this big, greenish flash like, light up the sky.
I thought, 'Man, it must have been a meteor,'" Isaacs told KCBS.
These meteors are generally the most visible in the first half of November, the American Meteor Society says.
