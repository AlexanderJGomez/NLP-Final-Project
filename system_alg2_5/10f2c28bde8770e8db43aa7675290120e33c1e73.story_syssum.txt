The theory behind space planes is they would be able to take off from a runway, rocket into low orbit, and then fly to a landing on a runway.
"As far as coolness factor -- Skylon wins over Dream Chaser hands down," gregory writes.
Why not?
Dream Chaser -- which aims to reach the space station -- is expected to have its first autonomous flight test in August or September.
But the sweeping, sleek design of a winged spacecraft like the Dream Chaser does catch the fancy of a lot of aerospace aficionados who still hold a place in their hearts for NASA's retired shuttle program.
Landing on a runway costs a lot less, Dem suggests.
A longer view may be to develop a spacecraft that can travel to low orbit and travel to the moon -- or beyond.
