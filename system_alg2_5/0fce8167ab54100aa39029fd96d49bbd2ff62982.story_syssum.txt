Thomas Murray says doctors have responsibility for welfare of children conceived through IVF procedure.
For now, we can put aside the lifeboat problem: A human uterus is not built for eight passengers; the odds for each child to be born alive and healthy go down as the number in the lifeboat goes up.
Whether that relationship is forged through infertility medicine, adoption or the old-fashioned way matters not at all: What counts is that adults who want to love and raise a child are matched with a child who needs just that love and care.
The point of infertility treatment, after all, is to create a child.
How Nadya Suleman ended up with eight is a mystery.
Carrying more than a couple of fetuses is dangerous to the pregnant woman and to the health and survival of the fetuses in her womb.
But the ideology of American infertility medicine allows physicians to escape from making any judgments about the suitability of prospective parents.
Providers can abdicate almost all responsibility to anticipate the welfare of the children they help create by claiming "an obligation to treat all patients who would benefit from medical treatment."
