Sony cut $50 from each, which is nearly the price of a new game.
Microsoft has not reduced the Xbox 360's price since 2009, and analysts are split on whether it will do so this year as a response to Sony.
Last month, Nintendo cut the price of the 3DS, its handheld game console that displays 3-D graphics without needing special glasses.
Sales of the 3DS tumbled quickly after a promising launch, and analysts have attributed the proliferation of inexpensive, quick-hit games for Facebook and smartphones as a hindrance to growth in the market for hand-held game systems.
Sony, which has sold more than 50 million PlayStation 3 systems, compensated customers with free game downloads.
