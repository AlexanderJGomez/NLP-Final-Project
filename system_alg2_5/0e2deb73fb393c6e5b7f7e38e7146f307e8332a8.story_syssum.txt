Scientists at the Smithsonian in Washington announced Thursday the discovery of a new species of mammal called the olinguito (pronounced oh-lin-GHEE-toe).
Researchers argue that the olinguito should be considered the smallest living member of the raccoon family, which includes other animals that make us go "awww" such as coatis and kinkajous.
Previously, scientists had assumed that olinguitos were members of their sister species, the olingos, Helgen said.
Cloud forests are "cloaked in fog," Helgen said.
Even people who live in the Andes had the same confusion about olinguitos being olingos, because humans don't hunt them and the creatures stay in the trees, Helgen said.
The olinguito's misty high-elevation habitats in Colombia and Ecuador, and the tendency for the animal to stay in the trees, have helped keep the species relatively obscure to scientists until now, Helgen said.
"It shows us that there's a long way to go to exploring the whole world, but especially maybe these cloud forests," Helgen said.
The creature came from the mountains of Colombia to the Louisville Zoo in 1967, courtesy of a German couple with a love of raccoon family members, Helgen said.
DNA from this olinguito shows that it is clearly not an olingo, Helgen said.
