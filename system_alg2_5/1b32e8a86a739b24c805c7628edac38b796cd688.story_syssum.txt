Gulfport, Mississippi (CNN) -- Gulf Coast states have seen drops in tourism linked to the BP oil spill in the Gulf, though it has not caused any beaches to close, tourism officials told CNN Wednesday.
They're canceling, not coming to Florida.
Florida has $2.5 million in its coffers for use in advertising and is making plans to use the $25 million promised this week by BP, Torian said.
The oil is here.
The annual Seafood Festival in the town of Jean Lafitte the last weekend in July has been canceled so resources can be concentrated on the oil, CNN affiliate WWLTV reported.
"I think we are getting word out with the tourism campaign," she said.
The tourism commission has spent $600,000 of its own money for an advertising campaign set to begin Monday "to let people know we are open," he said.
"The perception is that everybody has oil on the beach and we are all closed up," he said.
"The truth of the matter is it hasn't affected me yet," he said.
