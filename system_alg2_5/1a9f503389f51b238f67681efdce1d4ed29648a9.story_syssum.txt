"It's good enough, I really appreciate it," Gamboa said about the reward.
Before the gambler forgot his paper bag of cash in the cab's backseat, the poker player tipped the cabbie $5 on a $9.90 fare, Gamboa said.
He doesn't want any publicity," Gamboa said.
Meanwhile, Gamboa's native country of the Philippines is going to honor him.
Yellow Checker Star gave Gamboa a $1,000 reward, made him driver of the year, and gave him a steak dinner for two.
On New Year's Eve -- one of the busiest days in the cabbie business -- Gamboa will be back at work on the Las Vegas Strip.
