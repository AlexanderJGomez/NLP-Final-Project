(CNN) -- Diego Costa and Arda Turan took part in training with Atletico Madrid teammates at the Estadio da Luz Friday ahead the Champions League final clash with city rivals Real Madrid.
"Costa and Arda are important players but they are just names, it will either be them playing or two others who know who they are," Simeone told reporters.
"We don't know how Madrid will play, we've worked with different possibilities and we will try to block them and find a way to control the match the way we need," Simeone said.
Speaking to reporters Friday, Real boss Carlo Ancelotti said: "we will assess the injuries at training.
But reports have suggested the Italian's position could come under scrutiny should Real fail to win Saturday.
"Since Carlo Ancelotti arrived he has emphasized hard work and intensity and now that is what Real Madrid are associated with," Ramos said.
