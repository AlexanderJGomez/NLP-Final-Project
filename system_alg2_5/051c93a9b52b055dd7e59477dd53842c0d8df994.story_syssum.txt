Xiang first garnered attention for her sculptures of women.
A seated, slouching and vacant-eyed nude woman with a scar on her abdomen, sagging breasts and fat rolls, critic Gao Shiming, a dean at the China Academy of Art, has described the work as an expression of "fatigue ... emptiness and helplessness."
But, she says, "after a while, if you work on a deeper level, you will discover that whether male or female, you're ultimately dealing with human nature.
More than gender politics, she is interested in human relationships.
It was the first time she had seen sculpture that wasn't a politically-freighted monument or memorial, she says.
"I don't think art is like design, when one can have an inspiration here or an inspiration there."
"Every time when I work on something, I would eat very little and sleep very little and become very, very thin."
"I want my art to awaken the sensibility of each onlooker, to awaken his body, so that his body can experience the sculpture.
And contemporary Chinese art has been born and developed within these last 30 years."
The ways for us to get to know the world have become more and more diverse.
However, I think there should be another part that should look inward ... into an inner world ... a world that exists within us.
