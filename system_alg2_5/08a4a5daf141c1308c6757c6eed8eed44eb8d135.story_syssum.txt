Jansen, the first black dean of education at the University of the Free State, is one of South Africa's leading academics and intellectuals.
Throughout his long and esteemed educational career, which has taken him from teaching biology in high school classrooms to leading one of South Africa's premier learning institutions, Jansen has been doing everything he can to keep education uppermost in the minds of his students.
"It's odd for me because it's like we don't get it that in a modern interconnected economy you better be up there playing with the best," he says.
A firm believer of the society's responsibility to insist on a qualitative education system, Jansen,  a Fulbright scholar, assumed his current role at the University of the Free State in 2009 after the institution faced controversy over racism and racial integration.
"If in the process of forgiving and reconciling, we enable other transformations to take place, which is exactly what happened, then that is a better way to go than the thirst -- the understandable thirst let me say -- for vengeance," he says.
