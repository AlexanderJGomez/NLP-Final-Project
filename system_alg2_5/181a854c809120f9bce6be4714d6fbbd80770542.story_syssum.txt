(CNN) -- Sri Lankan officials rejected a proposed cease-fire from the Tamil Tiger rebels Sunday, warning instead that government troops intended to continue a new offensive until the group surrenders, a senior government official said.
Government troops made significant advances into rebel-held territory on Friday and Saturday, according to Sri Lankan Army sources.
... We are in full agreement that the humanitarian crisis can only be overcome by declaration of an immediate cease-fire."
As many as 70,000 people have been killed since the civil war began, and the group has been declared a terrorist organization by 32 countries, including the United States and the European Union.
