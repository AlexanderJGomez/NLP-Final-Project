Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Yemeni Vice President Abdurabu Mansur Hadi kicked off his presidential campaign Tuesday, announcing he will run in the February 21 election.
The power transfer deal, signed in November, states that Saleh's deputy would succeed him in power for a term of two years.
"Hadi made it clear that the Saleh regime is over and he is seeking to be looked at as a president for a nation and not for a political party," said Abdul Salam Mohammed, director of the Sanaa-based Abaad Strategic Center.
"Our main goal during our revolution is to oust Ali Saleh from power.
This will be accomplished in two weeks, but his family is still in control of the country's military," said Sanaa youth activist Mohammed Hashem.
