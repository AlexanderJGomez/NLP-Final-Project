Barry added that scandal can make a politician resilient and better suited for the rough and tumble of public life.
Mark Plotkin, a veteran political analyst, said some still look at Barry's professional longevity as an example of what is wrong with American politics more than 20 years after Barry, while serving as mayor, went to jail for drug possession.

It surfaced this year that Gray knew in January that members of his staff had not properly reported funds raised for his 2010 campaign, according to a source close to a federal investigation of his campaign funding.

"Million of Americans don't file their taxes," Barry said.
