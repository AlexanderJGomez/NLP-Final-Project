(CNN) -- Rwanda held solemn commemorations Monday to mark the 20th anniversary of the genocide in Rwanda, with many survivors overcome with emotion as they relived the trauma of the killings that left 800,000 people dead.
France said Monday that its ambassador to Rwanda had been barred from attending the events marking the anniversary.
France said over the weekend that it had canceled plans to attend the ceremony after Kagame's accusations of French involvement in the massacre.
"When I came out, I found the people we had committed crimes against, be it the mother of this boy (Rafiki) or this boy himself," Musa said.
Musa has promised to help Rafiki find his father's body.
In 1994, Hutu extremists in Rwanda targeted minority ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus in a three-month killing spree that left an estimated 800,000 people dead.
France, an ally of the Hutu nationalist government before the 1994 killings, has repeatedly denied any complicity in the genocide.
