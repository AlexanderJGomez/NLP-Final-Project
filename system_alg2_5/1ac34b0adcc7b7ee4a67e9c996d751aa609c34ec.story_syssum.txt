Washington (CNN) -- The District of Columbia public school system announced Friday that it is letting 226 employees go for poor performance under the education assessment system IMPACT.
"We want to get along with the union.
The teachers union has no say in which evaluation system that the D.C. public school system chooses to use, and by contract, teachers can be let go for low evaluations.
" ... All we're saying is that if an evaluation system is thorough, competent, comprehensive, measures how we're doing as teachers and how students are learning, then it's fine," she said.
Rhee told King that she had heard the teacher's union say teachers with poor evaluations should have been given more time to improve.
Also Friday, the district announced that it has notified 737 employees that if their performance doesn't improve, they will be terminated after the upcoming school year.
