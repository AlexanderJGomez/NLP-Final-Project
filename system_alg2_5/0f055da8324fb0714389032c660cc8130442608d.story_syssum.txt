A new story about some New Jersey hospitals seeing a spike in births nine months after Superstorm Sandy has sparked talk that there just might be a post-Sandy baby boom.
A study suggests some natural disasters lead to an increase in pregnancies -- not where the destruction is most severe, but in areas that are affected and remain livable.
But some hospitals in the area struck by Sandy are not reporting any increase in birth rates nine months after the storm.
The idea that people have more babies after natural disasters is "just not documented," he says.
Nine months after the New York City blackout in November 1965, The New York Times reported on a sharp increase in births.
But for the couples CNN spoke with, what matters is the baby boom at home.
