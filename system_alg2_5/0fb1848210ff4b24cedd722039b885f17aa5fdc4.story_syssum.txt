Davern offered a new account in November about how Wood's death was reported, saying that Wagner waited hours to call the Coast Guard after Wood went missing off Catalina Island, near the California coast, following an argument the couple had.
It's possible we could yield new information that changes this case," the sheriff's spokesman said.
"This new information is substantial enough to make us want to take a new look at the case," Lt. John Corina said at the time.
Authorities haven't gone into specifics about who they've interviewed, but did say when they reopened the case that Wagner wasn't a suspect.
In 2010, Lana Wood told CNN she believes a highly charged argument between her sister and Wagner on the yacht's back deck preceded Wood's drowning.
In a lengthy interview with CNN in 2010, Davern said he now believes the investigation of Wood's death was incompetent and suggested there was a cover-up.
Wagner admitted his jealousy in his book "Pieces of My Heart," also published in September 2009.
After Wagner argued with Walken and broke the wine bottle, Wood left in disgust and went to her stateroom, Davern told CNN.
A short time later, Wagner, appearing to be distraught, told Davern he couldn't find Wood.
Wagner shrugged and poured them both drinks, Davern said.
He maintains that he and Davern searched the boat and noticed the dinghy was missing.
Wagner's striking good looks landed him roles in dozens of films in the 1950s and '60s before he hit it big in television.
