After hearing his verdict Nicolaides said: "I wish my family the best."
CNN has chosen not to repeat the allegations made by Nicolaides because it could result in CNN staff being prosecuted in Thailand.
"There are cases in the past where this law has been abused for political purposes, and I agree this has to stop," he said.
Other cases are pending against both foreigners and Thais.
