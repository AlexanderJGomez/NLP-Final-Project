"There was a rumor that there were archives in the Cond√© Nast offices in New York that nobody had known about," says Todd Brandow, a photography curator.
None of the pictures had seen the light of day for eight decades, and all had been taken by the pre-eminent photographer Edward Steichen (1879-1973) for Vanity Fair and Vogue.
"Many of them were fashion pictures, but the women looked like they'd been born wearing those clothes, that they wore them every day.
"He was the Picasso of photography," she says.
Now, says William A Ewing, the third of the exhibition's co-curators, the time has come to reintroduce Steichen's work to the world.
"He turned fashion photography into portraiture.
In the early 1920s he had gone through an acrimonious divorce, and had large alimony bills that placed him in financial jeopardy.
He contacted the magazine and was offered a job.
But Nast persuaded him that "it's not about fashion, it's about photography".
Steichen lived the high life for several years, photographing the world's most famous faces.
"He really was one of the greats," says Brandow.
