(CNN) -- An Alabama man who says he was fired for exposing public corruption received broad support from the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday in a free-speech dispute testing workplace protections for government employees.
Lane says he tried to work with Schmitz to perform her job duties.
Nevertheless, Lane fired her.
Lane was later terminated from his government job, prompting him to sue the college president.
And some justices wondered whether a public official should enjoy broad job security when testifying in court.
Why do we put people at risk for telling the truth?"
"But you are suggesting he can be fired if he does it."
But oral arguments revealed the court was likely to carve exceptions for employees compelled to testify under oath about matters of public concern.
