For most of my career in the Navy, I lived two lives and went to work each day wondering if that would be my last.
In spite of the stress of living under "don't ask, don't tell" and the constant fear of losing my job, somehow my partner, Lynne Kennedy, an openly gay reference librarian at the Library of Congress, and I had learned to deal with the policy and make the requisite sacrifices.
At 9:30 a.m.
As the numbness began to wear off, it hit me how incredibly alone Lynne would have been had I been killed.
During that process, we realized that the "don't ask, don't tell" policy was causing us to make a much bigger sacrifice than either of us had ever admitted.
Eight months later, in June 2002, I retired after more than 29 years in the U.S. Navy, an organization I will always love and respect.
I have great love and respect for our country, but I know we can do better than "don't ask, don't tell."
