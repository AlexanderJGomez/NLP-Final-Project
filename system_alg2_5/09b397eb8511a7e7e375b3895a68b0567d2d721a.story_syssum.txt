Hollande allies claimed 314 seats in the 577-member National Assembly -- the lower house of the French parliament -- according to early confirmed results by the French Interior Ministry.
Hollande has already introduced some of his programs, which are centered on growth and spending, not austerity, reversing Sarkozy's policies.
Discussion is already under way on education reforms, including a review of the French school year and increasing the stipend paid to help parents with school-age children.
Last month, Hollande said he wanted to balance the need to reduce the debts of European governments with efforts to stimulate growth.
