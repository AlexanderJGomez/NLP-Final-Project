New York (CNN) -- Pedro Hernandez was arraigned early Friday evening on a second-degree murder charge tied to the case of Etan Patz, the New York boy whose disappearance 33 years to the day spurred nationwide attention about missing children.
"When Hernandez arrived at the hospital, he began making statements that he wanted to die, and a psychiatric evaluation was ordered, " added the law enforcement source.
"Detectives believe in the credibility of the statement," Kelly said, although investigators had not uncovered any forensic evidence linking Hernandez to the boy's disappearance.
But Lisa Cohen, whose 2009 book, "After Etan," is widely considered the definitive account of the case, said she's not convinced that Hernandez killed the boy.
Etan, 6, went missing on May 25, 1979, a block from his home in Manhattan.
In the years after Etan's disappearance, Hernandez told a family member and others that he had "done a bad thing" and killed a child in New York, police said.
The police investigation continues, as does the FBI's, the agency said in a statement Thursday night.
"At the same time, Mr. Miller is very pleased that those responsible for this heinous crime may be brought to justice, and the Patz family may finally have the closure they deserve."
A judge found Ramos responsible for the boy's death and ordered him to pay the family $2 million, money the Patz family has never received.
President Ronald Reagan named May 25, the day Etan went missing, as National Missing Children's Day.
