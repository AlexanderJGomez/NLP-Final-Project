At the time, he had been the rising star of Swiss skiing with four World Cup wins to his name and a solitary world title -- the 2007 Super Combined.
His first memory was of a hospital ceiling and it was three weeks after regaining consciousness that he once again remembered his name and the fact he had been a top skier.
The feeling was great because the slope was in good shape and I was fast in first training and I was skiing easily.
"If I watch myself in Kitzbühel then I feel like it wasn't me because I don't have any memory of him.
Today, he gets tired quicker and his temper frays more readily than prior to the accident.
"The first time I was on skis, I thought 'okay, shit, this is a nice feeling, I wanna go back in the World Cup'," he recalls.
Then it was so good, the feeling was so great and I was also fast."
But if you are a skier, if you are a pro, if you're the downhill, it's not so dangerous because you know what you can do, you know how it works and, for us, Kitzbühel, when you ski it's easy."
"My body told me that 'no, it's over now.
But he's just happy to have had a second chance at life.
