(CNN) -- Cirque du Soleil and a Las Vegas casino are facing thousands of dollars in citations after a performer fell nearly 100 feet to her death during a show in June.
The agency said Cirque du Soleil hadn't trained Guillot-Guyard properly and had failed to adequately protect employees working for the show.
"Cirque du Soleil completed an exhaustive review of its safety policies and procedures in the wake of the tragic accident involving Sarah," Cirque du Soleil said in a statement.
It resumed performances more than two weeks later.
Nicknamed "Sassoon," she was part of the original cast of "Ka," Cirque du Soleil said in a statement issued shortly after her death.
