He knew his father was behind him on the Khumbu Icefall and ran down the mountain, only to find the devastation of ice, snow and baggage scattered everywhere.
Ang Tshiring, 57, was a high altitude cook.
His son Pemba, 37, lives with the family in Thamo, a small village of 50 souls located in the Thame Valley in the Khumbu, where the country's greatest ethnic Sherpa climbers live, well off the beaten track of Nepal's Everest Base Camp trail.
Few tourists pass by and yak herding is an insufficient way to make a living.
"All that matters now are the puja," says Ang Riku, his widow, referring to a series of prayers and rituals.
Ang Riku is concerned.
Ang Riku and Ang Tshiring's private quarters have been transformed into a prayer room, and we all sleep together on the floor of the main hall.
Ang Riku climbs the yak trails with determination, stopping every few minutes to catch her breath.
We politely decline, but the lama insists and we accept.
Then Ang Riku offers money for the lama to perform the puja.
Before leaving, the lama puts the ceremonial scarf around Ang Riku's neck.
Ang Riku also sends bags with salt, butter, rice and money to 500 families in the valley, so they'll recite prayers for Ang Tshiring.
Although the world regards them as high altitude guides and porters, most Sherpas don't want to be mountain climbers on Everest.
"Every time I go on a climbing expedition, I wonder if I will come back alive," says Pemba.
I offer a puja in the monastery for Ang Tshiring in the afternoon and ask Lopsang, a young monk who says he escaped from Tibet, the reason behind the bad luck.
