A family member found John Chakalos, 87, in his home in Windsor, Connecticut, according a Windsor police department press release.
Washburn, who has known the Chakalos family for 30 years and worked for them for 25, said she begins working on the display in the second week of August.
"Not only do they warm the heart of thousands of people who come through, they warm the hearts of hundreds of people in the community who benefit from food and cash donations," said Val Starbuck, a Joan's Food Pantry volunteer.
The Christmas display will continue this season, Washburn said, but she did not know if the Chakalos family would continue to light up the neighborhood in the future.
