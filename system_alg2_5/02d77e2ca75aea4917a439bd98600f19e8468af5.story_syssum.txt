What would it mean for North Korea's young leader as he is about to mark the first anniversary of the death of his father, Kim Jong Il?
"The question is what does Kim Jong Un intend?
In that sense, the satellite launch was proof of progress and power, said Bill Richardson, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who traveled to North Korea in 2010.
"He wants to show his people after one year in leadership, North Korea is a strong military, technological, space, nuclear power (with) nuclear weapons," Richardson said.
"Then, it was a major embarrassment," said Han Park, director of the University of Georgia's Center for the Study of Global Issues who was in North Korea at the time of the failed launch.
The sentiment was echoed at a snow-dusted celebratory rally Friday.
The rocket launch allows Kim to establish military security for North Korea, said Park, and allows him to move forward with another priority: economic progress.
"In the big scheme of things, Kim Jong Un must have thought that North Korea would be taken more seriously (after a rocket launch)."
Sigal agreed that Kim Jong Un has shown signs that he wants to stimulate economic growth but the problem is that means he has to make a change from his father's military-first policy that devoted billions of dollars into weapons development.
Sigal said.
"He's saying to the world, 'Look, I'm back,'" Richardson said about Kim Jong Un.
Sigal said the only way to get what Washington wants on the nuclear front is to come to the table.
Sigal likes to say that there is only one thing tougher than negotiating.
