(CNN) -- Outside of the four grand slams, it's the most coveted title in men's tennis.
World No.1 Novak Djokovic will seek to top off an amazing season already bulging with three grand slam titles, while defending champion Federer is seeking a record sixth victory in the tournament.
Rafael Nadal: The 10-time grand slam champion has never won this title, losing to Roger Federer in last year's final.
Andy Murray: Home favorite Murray has again missed out in the grand slams in 2011, losing in the final of the Australian Open to the all-conquering Djokovic and losing to Nadal in the semis at the French Open, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open.
5's best showing in the finals is a runner-up spot to Federer in the 2007 event in Shanghai.
Best known for reaching the 2010 Wimbledon final, this year Berdych has won the China Open title and beat Murray in November's Paris Masters quarterfinals before losing to Federer.
Players gain points from playing in the four grand slams, ATP World Tour events including eight Masters Series tournaments, and World Group singles matches in the Davis Cup teams competition.
Players receive $120,000 for just qualifying, with $120,000 for each round-robin win.
The players are divided into two groups of four and play each other once in a round-robin format, before the top two in each pool advance to the semifinals.
"Roger's been playing well, especially the last couple of weeks, so I think he has a terrific chance," Annacone, who also worked with 14-time grand slam winner Sampras, told CNN.
The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) took over the running of the men's tour from 1990 and the event evolved into the ATP Tour Championship, but the ITF promoted a rival Grand Slam Cup for the top-16 players with the best records in the four majors until 1999.
The doubles event, which used to take place at a different venue, has been staged in tandem with the singles since Houston in 2003.
