(CNN) -- Cancer has surpassed heart disease to become the leading cause of death among Hispanics in the United States, according to an American Cancer Society report released Monday.
While cancer is the most common cause of death for all three populations under the age of 85, there are fewer Hispanics in the United States over the age of 85, where heart disease is predominant.
Overall cancer incidence and mortality rates are lower in Hispanics than in the non-Hispanic U.S. population, meaning Hispanics have a lower risk of cancer diagnosis and death.
For example, it is known that Mexicans in the United States tend to have lower cancer rates than Puerto Ricans.
Since 2000, the cancer incidence rate (risk of cancer diagnosis) declined by 1.75% per year among men and 0.3% per year among women.
This compares with declines of 1.5% and 1.3% among non-Hispanic men and women, respectively.
This compares with 33% of all women in the United States and 32% of all men.
