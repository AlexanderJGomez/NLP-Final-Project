The coal ash poured out of a broken pipe into the Dan River, turning water into dark muck.
They fear the consequences for wildlife and say that the situation shows state regulators haven't done enough to crack down on Duke Energy.
Tests of the river last week revealed levels of copper, aluminum, iron and arsenic above state standards for surface water, state environmental officials said.
"It's certainly cause for concern for the long-term impacts of this coal ash spill on the health of the Dan River," he said.
State environmental officials said Sunday that arsenic levels appeared to be decreasing, but recommended avoiding prolonged direct contact with the river in the area of the spill until further notice.
"We're not downplaying risks.
"I stood on the bank a day or two after the spill, and I can say that I openly cried," she said.
In North Carolina, authorities will investigate the coal ash spill to determine what violations occurred, Kritzer said.
We've been testing water quality since the leak occurred and will continue to do so," she said.
Even before last week's spill, coal ash contamination was a concern for North Carolina officials.
"Ash basin closure planning is already well under way for the ash basins located in North Carolina, including the one at Dan River," Parrish said.
In statements announcing the North Carolina spill last week, Duke Energy said up to 82,000 tons of ash had been released and up to 27 million gallons of basin water had flooded into the river.
That amount of ash, the company said, would fill up to 32 Olympic-size swimming pools.
