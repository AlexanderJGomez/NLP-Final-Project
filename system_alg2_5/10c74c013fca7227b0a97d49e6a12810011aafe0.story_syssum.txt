His story in the apparel business began with the word "wardrobe" itself.
"  Watch Taylor discuss how his business started Â»
"Nine times out of 10 we visit clients in their home or offices, we take their measurements right there inside their office, have them select the fabric they prefer, take their measurements right then and there, and [in] a couple weeks have a tailor-made garment to wear," he said.
Taylor told CNN's Ted Rowlands that one of his first clients was the late comedian Bernie Mac.
But his reputation did not change his business style.
He recently opened a second DROBE office in Pasadena, California, and wants to add 200 clients before the end of the year.
