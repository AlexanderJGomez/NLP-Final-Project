(CNN) -- A widespread outbreak of severe weather across the Deep South may be one for the record books, as the National Weather Service received reports of more than 150 tornadoes.
"It was certainly a rare day that there were so many tornadoes that caused so much damage in populated areas," CNN Meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said.
A tornado can form when a mesocyclone -- a rotating column of air -- is created within a super cell storm and is stretched to create a funnel-like structure that can reach speeds of up to several hundred miles per hour.
That month saw a total of 267 tornadoes -- the largest number recorded since 1950, according to the weather agency.
With the latest outbreak, April may turn out to be a historic month for tornadoes, he said.
