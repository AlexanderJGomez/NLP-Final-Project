(CNN) -- For several months now, Filipinos have been treated to the spectacle of yet another impeachment trial aired on national television.
Cheered on by Manila's rambunctious media and chattering classes, coalitions of both reform-minded and opportunistic politicians have since then attempted to restage the triumph by launching impeachment suits against a succession of high officials.
As president, he vowed to bring Arroyo to trial.
He has also supported the impeachment of the anti-corruption ombudsman.
If the chief justice is not impeached, then Aquino will have a sworn enemy in the country's highest court.
In 2009, the World Bank complained about "systemic corruption and bid rigging" in Philippine public works projects.
Political trials can be cathartic.
But they have proven to be a riskier and less effective path for anti-corruption reform.
But there will certainly be a court that's friendlier to the president.
Aquino was elected to office on the hope that he can change all that.
In the end, this path will be the more enduring.
