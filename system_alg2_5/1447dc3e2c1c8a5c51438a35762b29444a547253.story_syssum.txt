Iran and the United States rang in the Persian new year Tuesday with distinctly different messages for the Iranian people.
Khamenei said the main reason for the West's enmity toward Iran has to do with its desire to control Iran's vast oil reserves.
"You must seek Iran-made products," he said.
"To the people of Iran, this holiday comes at a time of continued tension between our two countries," he said.
It censors the Internet to control what the Iranian people can see and say.
The United States and the European Union have targeted Iranian banks in an effort to persuade Iran to abandon any nuclear weapon ambitions.
Khamenei urged unity among Iranians at this time.
"God almighty, defeat the enemies of this great nation."
