A Massachusetts man was arrested Friday on suspicion of obstructing the investigation of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, authorities said.
Matanov is not charged with participating in the bombings, but with trying to hide his connection to the Tsarnaev brothers.
In the hours and days following the bombings, Matanov contacted and attempted to contact the suspects by phone and saw Tamerlan Tsarnaev at least twice, according to the indictment.
A third friend, Robel Phillipos, pleaded not guilty to making false statements to FBI agents during the bombings investigation.
Attorneys for the men denied the allegations.
