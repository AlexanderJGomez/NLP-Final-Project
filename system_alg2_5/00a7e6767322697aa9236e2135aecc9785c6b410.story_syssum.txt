Hartmann's genetic code showed two mutations that are linked to limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, he says the site told him.
Genetic testing can be a powerful tool.
The FDA warned that customers who received inaccurate results could suffer from undue mental anguish or undergo unnecessary medical procedures.
It's one of the issues opponents to home genetic testing kits raise most often.
Scientists have identified more than 2,000 single gene disorders, says Rebecca Nagy, president of the National Society of Genetic Counselors.
"It's not that the science behind (this kind of genetic testing) isn't good.
"I don't think that anyone thinks that this kit replaces formal testing by a doctor," Heather Armstrong posted on 23andMe's Facebook page.
Nagy recommends anyone who wants to do genetic testing first talk to a genetic counselor.
"Know what you're doing so that when you get the results back you can really use them to your best benefit."
Hartmann says he now believes he will not get limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, although he says there is a risk he could pass the genetic mutations onto his kids.
"For quite some time, I hope."
