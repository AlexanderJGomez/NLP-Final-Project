Mayflower, Arkansas (CNN) -- Janet Copeland and her husband, Richard, both say they agree almost all the time, with one exception: The Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's health care legislation.
"What about the people that can't afford health insurance?
"
The group believes the ACA will help families from being priced out of health insurance coverage.
But before they started a life together, Janet Copeland was married for almost 50 years.
"I held one job during my marriage, working as an art instructor," Janet says.
"Then I got married, and the whole thing changed," Janet says.
What's important about Janet Copeland's story, says Anthony Wright, is that it illustrates how routine life changes can dramatically change individual health care costs.
In the most general terms, Wright says, Obama's signature health care law makes it harder to increase rates for routine life changes, while GOP candidate Mitt Romney wants to repeal that law entirely.
Wright says Janet Copeland could benefit from some of the provisions of the Affordable Health Care act, like the expansion of Medicaid.
Those are the provisions most likely to help Janet Copeland lower her Medicare premiums.
Perry, like Richard Copeland, also disagrees with the health care law on philosophical grounds.
Now that the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled Obamacare is constitutional, Anthony Wright of Health Access says the outcome of this presidential election will determine whether the law is ultimately fully enforced.
