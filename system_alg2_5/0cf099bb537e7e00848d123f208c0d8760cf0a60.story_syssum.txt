By 2050, 54 percent of the population will be minorities.
"Part of it is a higher fertility rate for some of the minority groups, Hispanics in particular," said Dave Waddington, chief of the Census Bureau's population projection branch, which issued the report.
It is projected to nearly triple, from 46.7 million to 132.8 million, from 2008 through 2050, the bureau said.
The Asian-American population is expected to increase from 15.5 million to 40.6 million, or from 5.1 percent to 9.2 percent of the population.
Whites will comprise 46 percent of the U.S. population by 2050, down from the current level of 66 percent, the bureau said, as the group is projected to lose population in the 2030s and 2040s.
Meanwhile, the number of those age 85 and older is expected to more than triple, from 5.4 million in 2008 to 19 million by 2050.
Of those, 235.7 million are expected to be minorities.
Of those, 39 percent are projected to be Hispanic, up from 22 percent in 2008, and 38 percent are projected to be white, down from 56 percent in 2008
â€¢ The working-age population will become more than 50 percent minority in 2039, and by 2050 will constitute 55 percent of the population.
And things like the baby boom generation couldn't be predicted."
