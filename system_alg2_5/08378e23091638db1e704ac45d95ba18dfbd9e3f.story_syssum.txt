Facebook and Google have added new translation tools, but they take different approaches.
Facebook Inc. and Google Inc. are two Web companies trying particularly hard to make this happen, and they've released a number of updates to their translation services in recent weeks.
But for now, here's a look at the latest language features from both companies, and some background on how their translation services work.
How it works: Real people are at the heart of Facebook translation plan.
These crowd-sourced edits -- which work kind of like Wikipedia -- make Facebook's translation service smarter over time.
The update allows sites to install a translation gadget on their sites through Facebook Connect, a service that lets Facebook users sign in on other Web pages.
People who use Facebook Connect to translate their sites can choose which text they want users to help translate, according to Facebook spokeswoman Malorie Lucich.
Size: Google claims to be the largest free language translation service online.
Google also recently unveiled a translation service for Google Docs, which lets anyone upload a document to the Web and have it translated into a number of languages for free.
And there's a new Firefox add-on from Google to help people translate the Web more quickly.
Also, Google lets people spot translation errors, suggest new wordings and translate its interface into languages Google's computers don't speak just yet.
