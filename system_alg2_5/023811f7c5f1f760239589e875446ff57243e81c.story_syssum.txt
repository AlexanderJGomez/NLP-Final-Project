Many people in his family -- aunts, uncles and grandparents --suffered from diabetes, high cholesterol, heart disease and high blood pressure.
Schmitt jump-started the first six months of his weight loss journey back in July  2009 by reducing his food portions.
During the first six months of his weight loss plan, he made the daily choice of moving his body more than he had in the past.
Once he hit the six-month mark of his lifestyle change, he added more rigorous activity to his daily routine, like using the treadmill.
It took Schmitt about six and a half months to lose his first 100 pounds and then he shed the last 77 pounds over the next eight and a half months.
Schmitt's family doctor, Dr. Michael Allen, said he was comfortable with the pace of the weight loss, since he was a young male and didn't have  major health issues, beyond his high blood pressure.
"I have to constantly reinforce the fact that it was a lifestyle change for me, and not a fad diet or surgery that caused me to lose so much weight," he added.
Schmitt said his family members, with their various health issues, have closely watched his transformation, and he hopes his new healthy life will inspire them to make their own changes one day.
