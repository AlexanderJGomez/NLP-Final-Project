(CNN) -- Finally, after days of listing on a disabled Carnival cruise ship without electricity and working toilets, thousands of passengers finished disembarking early Friday morning at the Port of Mobile.
The Carnival Triumph, became a major media story, when it caught fire off the coast of Mexico.
Family members cheered as the ship pulled in and in the crowd also was Carnival CEO Gerry Cahill.
"The hallways were toxic," said Reyes, who said she would never go on a Carnival cruise again.
"No power, no toilets, nothing.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials, Coast Guard members and a Carnival team boarded the ship before it arrived in port to help speed efforts to get passengers off as quickly as possible, he said.
At some point during the ordeal urine and feces streamed in the halls and down walls after toilet facilities failed, soaking the mattress of a friend of his who was sleeping in a hallway, said Larry Poret.
Poret said toilets on the ship worked on and off, but were too inconsistent to trust.
The incident aboard the ship scared Poret's daughter and a friend taking the cruise with her, Poret said.
Aboard the cruise ship?
The cruise line said it would give each passenger $500, a free flight home, a full refund for their trip and for most expenses on board, as well as a credit for another cruise.
"The passengers on the ship aren't going to have a great deal of recourse when they get home," he said.
In 2010, the Carnival cruise ship Splendor lost power after an engine room fire, leaving it drifting off the Pacific coast of Mexico.
After this ill-fated cruise, the Carnival Triumph won't host vacationing passengers until at least mid-April.
