"So?"
"I'm still not eating it."
It's no wonder each person in the Western world (where we have so much choice about what to eat) probably defines "edible" in a slightly different way.
She can eat omelets and scrambled eggs.
Indeed, according to Paul Rozin, Ph.D., professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania and an expert in disgust and food choice, there are only a handful of flavors our brains are hardwired to reject, and all are typical of foods that historically had a high likelihood of making us sick -- spoiled things like moldy bread and sour milk, and bitter things like caffeine.
That's it.
He admits that we generally grow to dislike foods that remind us of our bodily functions, guts, or mortality -- which might explain why liver (and other mealy, pasty foods) and oysters (and other squishy, slimy foods) put off so many people.
As Capaldi says, "The disgust mechanism is a very, very powerful thing.
After four weeks of therapy and nutritional counseling, he managed to add salad to his diet; hot food still made him gag.
History is full of stories of ordinary people who refused to eat unfamiliar food.
Why?
We constantly add new things -- goji berries, lemongrass, Splenda -- and reject others -- chicken nuggets, say, after seeing Food, Inc. "You can think yourself into an aversion," says Capaldi.
"In China, the sensation of a thing in your mouth is part of the pleasure of eating it," says Fuchsia.
Take "thousand-year-old eggs," made by submerging raw duck eggs for three months in a brew of ash, lime, tea, and salt.
At first Fuchsia found them revolting, but now she eats them with abandon, having decided to "think of them as the egg equivalent of blue cheese."
Much as I'd like to coerce my husband into eating delicious, slow-cooked beef tongue, I have to accept that only he can decide what to him is delicious, and what remains banished forever to the land of utter yuck.
