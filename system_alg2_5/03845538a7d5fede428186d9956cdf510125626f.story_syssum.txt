MADRID, Spain (CNN)  -- A bomb inside a van exploded in northeastern Madrid Monday, after a warning call by the Basque separatist group ETA.
The Red Cross immediately contacted police, who cordoned off the area, a Red Cross spokeswoman told CNN.
The bomb, it added, was placed in a van stolen last night in the Madrid area.
That attack caused dozens of injuries, and damaged a different glass-fa√ßade office building.
