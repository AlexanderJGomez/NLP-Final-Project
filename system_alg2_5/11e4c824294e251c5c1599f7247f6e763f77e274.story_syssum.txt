On a day in which the girlfriend of victim Odin Lloyd took the stand and Lloyd's mother again left the courtroom in tears, Bristol County Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh on Friday had a warning for the jury.
Hernandez, 25, pleaded not guilty in the 2013 killing of Lloyd, 27, who dated the sister of Hernandez's fianc√©e.
As she did one day earlier, Lloyd's mother, Ursula Ward, walked out of the courtroom sobbing as prosecutors showed the jury graphic photos of her son's body.
In opening statements Thursday, defense lawyer Michael Fee said the two men were close friends and that Hernandez had no reason to kill Lloyd.
"Aaron Hernandez is not the murderer of his friend," Fee said.
On Thursday, prosecutor Patrick Bomberg said Hernandez not only orchestrated, but also participated in and covered up the killing.
A marijuana blunt found near Lloyd's body had traces of both his DNA and that of Hernandez, Bomberg said.
"As soon as they found out Aaron Hernandez -- a celebrity football player for the New England Patriots -- was a friend of Odin Lloyd's, it was over," he said.
The prosecutors will argue that Lloyd's killing was a "joint venture."
Close friend Daryl Hodge was with Lloyd when he said Lloyd got a text from Hernandez, asking to hang out later that night.
