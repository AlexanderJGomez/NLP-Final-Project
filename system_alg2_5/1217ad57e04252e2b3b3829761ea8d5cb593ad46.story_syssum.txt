And what I think yesterday's ruling signifies is one more step towards ensuring that those basic principles apply to everybody," Obama said in response to a question from CNN's Jessica Yellin.

He called the trip a "powerful" reminder that "we have to remain vigilant when it comes to the defense of human rights.
