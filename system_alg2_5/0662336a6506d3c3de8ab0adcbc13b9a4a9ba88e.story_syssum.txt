LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Natalie Cole's search for a new kidney ended this week when someone with a compatible organ died and their family asked that it be given to the singer, according to the organ procurement group that handled the donation.
"Having heard of Ms. Cole's need for a kidney, the family asked that one of their loved one's kidneys be transplanted to Ms. Cole if they were a match," Mone said.
Cole said she underwent chemotherapy in an aggressive way to fight the virus.
Since then Cole has been on dialysis three days a week and has been searching for a kidney, she told King in one of the first public interviews about the issue.
It's -- it's amazing," Cole said.
That's all I can say," Cole said.
Cole is expected to return to the tour after three to four months of recovery.
