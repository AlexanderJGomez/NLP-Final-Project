French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner has a reputation for challenging convention and authority.
His and President Sarkozy's concern for human rights lies behind their eagerness to join Gordon Brown's Britain in a new push for action in Darfur.
Bernard Kouchner did not come to his position with any of former President Chirac's instinctive distrust of the United States.
Certainly Mr Kouchner is making clear that France no longer takes the view once expressed by President Chirac that a nuclear-armed Iran might be inevitable
Neither is saying that military intervention against Iran is imminent or inevitable.
