At least 398 people have been killed, and 1,801 injured by the quake that struck on Sunday afternoon, state-run media has reported.
The epicenter of the quake was recorded in Longtoushan Township, 23 kilometers (14 miles) southwest of Zhaotong, and tremors were felt almost 200 miles away.
He said local authorities had dispatched 6,000 troops to join the disaster relief operation, according to state media.
"They told me nearly all houses at the village have been destroyed in the earthquake.
Some 12,000 homes were destroyed and 30,000 others damaged in Sunday's quake, according to CCTV.
Premier Li Keqiang, who visited stricken areas on Monday morning, also called for a swift response, urging local authorities to focus attention on search and rescue and also on providing adequate supplies and medical attention for residents affected by the disaster.
Walking for several miles on foot to reach the worst-hit areas, he called on eight government ministries, including civil affairs, health, transport and housing, to send teams to take part in rescue and rehabilitation work.
Power and telephone outages were complicating assessment of the damage, rescuers said.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake had a magnitude of 6.1, while the China Earthquake Networks Center reported it as a 6.5-magnitude event.
