The corrections department's Board of Parole Hearings granted parole for the 71-year-old Davis following his 28th parole suitability hearing on Wednesday.
There's a 120-day internal review period.
If this time proves different, Davis would become the first Manson "family" member to be freed solely for good behavior.
Manson is serving a life sentence for his role in nine murders.
