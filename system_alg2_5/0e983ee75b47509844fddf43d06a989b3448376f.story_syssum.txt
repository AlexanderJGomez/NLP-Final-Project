Los Angeles (CNN) -- Cast members of the hit television show "Happy Days," who are suing CBS, accused the company of "despicable conduct" for not paying them for merchandising revenues.
"This is one of the most heavily merchandised shows ever," Most said.
The latest court filing follows a response by CBS to the suit last month.
In 2002 and 2003, Moran contacted CBS about merchandising revenues but was told nothing was owed, the filing states.
Since the lawsuit was filed, CBS has sent checks totaling $43,403 in merchandising proceeds to the four actors and Bosley's widow, Patricia.
But in revenue statements sent to Pfeiffer after the lawsuit was filed, CBS did not include any revenue from four of those companies.
I'm hoping this case gives visibility to not only help us, but to help thousands of other individuals in the entertainment business."
