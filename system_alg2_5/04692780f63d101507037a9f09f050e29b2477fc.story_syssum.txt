(CNN) -- NASA plans to capture an asteroid and start sending astronauts aloft again by 2017, even with a tighter budget, the U.S. space agency announced Wednesday.
The Obama administration has said before that it wants to send astronauts to explore an asteroid by 2025 and to Mars by 2030.
NASA's budget request includes $822 million for the agency's Commercial Crew Program, its push to resume U.S. space flights through private companies by 2017.
Bolden said NASA's Mars research is the biggest part of the planetary science budget.
