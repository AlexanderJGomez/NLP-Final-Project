The musicians are now exchanging bitter words in public while fighting in court over who owns the right to use the New Order name.
New Order was formed in 1980 by Sumner, Hook and drummer Steven Morris, who had previously been in melancholy post-punk band Joy Division until the death of singer Ian Curtis.
However, Sumner, Morris and Gilbert reformed four years later without him and are now touring and planning to release new material under the New Order name.
"Will we get back together?
How would you feel?"
It obviously has to do with the fact that I resurrected the Joy Division music.
"'Movement' is a very Joy Division record with New Order vocals, whereas by the time "Power, Corruption & Lies" came along, it was a proper New Order record.
On previous tours Hook's group played the two Joy Division albums, material New Order rarely performed.
Hook acknowledges the name of his old band is far better known to fans than that of his new one, so the legal battle over who owns the trademark is not just a matter of pride.
