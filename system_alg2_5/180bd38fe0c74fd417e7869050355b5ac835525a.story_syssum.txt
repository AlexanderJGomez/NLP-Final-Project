Then earlier this year there was the remix to Rihanna's song "Birthday Cake," in which Brown was the featured guest vocalist offering such coy nuggets as:
In any case, the couple's allusions to their reunion --a Twitter picture showed her embracing a man who appears to be Brown; another showed a man presumed to be Brown face down and shirtless on a bed -- culminated with Brown posting a photo of himself and Rihanna, who appears to be in her underwear.
Maybe so, but 77% of women her age who report domestic violence have been victimized previously by the same man, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.
The way she is flaunting their relationship now, I don't anticipate the same amount of sympathy for her if another incident occurs.
She's right.
Since completing a 52-week domestic violence program, Brown has shown about as much control over his temper as Bruce Banner.
Oh, I can hear Brown fans now -- leave him alone.
Stop hating.
And if there's a repeat of 2009, a lot of us won't be interested enough to care.
