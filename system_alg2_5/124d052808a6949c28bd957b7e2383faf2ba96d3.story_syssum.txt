In 2008, after a bruising primary battle with Hillary Clinton, then-Sen. Barack Obama was on the outs with former President Bill Clinton.
"Clinton just wants to help," a source close to the former president said.
I think it really -- I think a president ought to have done something for other people and for his country when you pick a president," Clinton said.
"I'm here, not my husband," Hillary Clinton said to Obama.
You wouldn't call the two men best of friends, but the lines of communication between the White House and the Clinton circle are open, sources in both camps say.
"I think he had a good business career," Clinton said of Romney last week on CNN's "Piers Morgan Tonight."
