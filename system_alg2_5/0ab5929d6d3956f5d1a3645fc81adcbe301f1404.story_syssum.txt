Washington (CNN) -- Narrow passage of a sweeping health care bill by the House of Representatives portends a continuing difficult fight for President Obama and fellow Democrats to get a bill through the Senate and into law.
On Sunday, Obama praised the "historic" House vote to pass the bill and called on the Senate to "take the baton" and complete its work.
"Now it falls on the United States Senate to take the baton and bring this effort to the finish line on behalf of the American people," Obama said.
Speaking on "Fox News Sunday," Lieberman called the controversial public option, which is in the House bill and the Senate version being prepared by Reid, an unnecessary provision intended to bring government-run health insurance in the future.
The lone House Republican who supported the bill, Rep. Anh "Joseph" Cao, told CNN on Sunday he put the needs of his district over the desire of his party.
Also Sunday, Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana, the chamber's third-ranking Republican, said on the Fox program that Democrats were ignoring the wishes of the American public by pushing through the huge health care bill.
Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland responded on the same show that the Congressional Budget Office reported that the House bill would reduce the deficit.
"This is a message to the American people; we're trying to bring down your costs to help more Americans afford health insurance."
"Nancy Pelosi and her liberal lieutenants made a lot of promises today to get the votes they desperately needed," he said.
In the run-up to the vote, Republicans and conservative Democrats joined forces to pass an amendment to the bill to prohibit federal funds for abortion services.
