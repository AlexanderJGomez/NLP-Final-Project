Already almost half-a-billion people love using WhatsApp for messaging and it's the most engaging app we've ever seen exist on mobile so far.
Zuckerberg said there were no plans to harvest data from WhatsApp messages, in answer to a question from the audience.
Asked if Facebook would consider bidding again for Snapchat, Zuckerberg said: "After buying a company for $16 billion you're probably done for a while."
Zuckerberg said the goal of Internet.org is to ensure everyone in the world has access to the internet in some form, either for a small cost or for free.
"Most people in the world don't have access to the internet at all ... it's about 2.7 billion people today.
Clark-Dickson said the announcement in Barcelona by WhatsApp CEO Jan Koum that the messaging service will add voice calls to its product in the second quarter of 2014 will also be something that mobile operators will want to talk to Zuckerberg about.
