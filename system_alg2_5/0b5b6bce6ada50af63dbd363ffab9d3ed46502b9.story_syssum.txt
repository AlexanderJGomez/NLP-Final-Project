New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- My dad died when I was 2, so my mother raised us [Smith and his sister] and exposed us to different things.
On holidays, we would go to work with her.
We'd always sit in the kitchen.
I started baking.
We went to Mass once a week, while in school, as well as on Sundays.
I've certainly called on God when I'm in the kitchen, when things are going wrong, when I'm irritated or very upset about something.
I didn't wake up one morning and just sit up in bed and stretch and say, "Well, I think I'll try the priesthood."
I have a spiritual director I work with, and I started out with that at first.
I will miss the people.
The cooking aspects, I definitely will miss.
I want to give all of myself, and I don't think you can do that when you have a lot of baggage.
I want to donate it to a school.
The prayer life, the rules that a priest is supposed to live by, that really excites me.
