Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Supporters and members of the gay and lesbian community in Kenya blasted the country's prime minister Monday after he said anyone engaging in homosexual activity should be arrested.
The group insisted they were trying to "flush out the gays," according to a Human Rights Watch report.
Kuria said the comments triggered state-sponsored homophobia.
