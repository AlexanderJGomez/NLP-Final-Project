U.S. officials later took the two negotiating pirates into custody -- a move that goes against standard negotiation practices, the maritime source said.
U.S. Central Command declined to comment on whether officials detained the pirates and said the FBI and the Justice Department have the lead in the case.
"It would be unfathomable to have put them back on the boat where they might have done harm to the hostages," the official said, disagreeing with a published report that the detention of two fellow pirates might have upset those still aboard the captured yacht -- named the Quest -- who were holding four Americans.
The American side continued trying to negotiate via radio with those still aboard the yacht and made an offer, and were told by the suspects aboard the Quest they would sleep on the matter before providing a reply, the U.S. official said.
When Fox spoke last week, he said two pirates boarded a U.S. Navy ship Monday for talks.
Two pirates were found dead on board the Quest, said Fox.
As of February 15 -- the most recent statistic posted on the International Maritime Bureau's website, pirates were holding 33 vessels and 712 hostages.
