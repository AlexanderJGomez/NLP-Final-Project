The candid video might have caught Obama off guard, but likely not unaware, former White House videographer Arun Chaudhary said.
"I think it's unusual for us to see the President working out in a gym, but as a security level it's not different than him getting pancakes at a diner in Iowa," he said.
"For me, this gym tape is almost ... no different than (White House photographer) Pete Souza's photo of the first lady and the President touching heads in the freight elevator on Inauguration Day," Chaudhary said.
