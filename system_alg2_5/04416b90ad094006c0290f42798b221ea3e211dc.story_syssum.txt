The Thai army declared martial law throughout the country Tuesday in a surprise move that an aide to the embattled Prime Minister said the government didn't know about beforehand.
Martial law went into effect at 3 a.m. on Tuesday, the ticker said.
It's too soon to tell whether the military's declaration of martial law will ease tensions or heighten them, analysts said.
"They have to be even-handed."
"The military is taking a step by step, gentle approach to see if they can get things to improve," Quaglia said.
"That being said, martial law will not solve the political problems that continue to haunt this country," he said.
"The differences are stark, and I don't think the military can step in and by force fix the political issues."
