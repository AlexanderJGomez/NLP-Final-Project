(CNN) -- A Florida grand jury this week found that two deputies in Pensacola should not be criminally charged in the wounding of an unarmed man, who was shot at 15 times while he was in his own driveway.
Middleton's attorney, Lorenzo Williams, told CNN on Wednesday that his client was distraught over the grand jury decision.
"He came out of the car with more of a lunging motion coming out of the car, and the deputies were standing behind him and he had what appeared to be a metallic object in his hand," said Sheriff David Morgan.
"The tragedy of this is the noncompliance to the directions of law enforcement officers," Morgan said in August.
It provided a report to the Escambia County State Attorney, which took the case to the grand jury.
"I don't think it had any effect whatsoever.
Middleton was among those testifying before the grand jury.
The grand jury recommended more intensive training for the first four years of an officer's career, and that this case be re-created for training purposes.
But Williams believes the grand jury's message to the sheriff bolsters his client's case.
