Don't get me wrong: the English, the Scots, the Welsh and the Northern Irish are all very different people.
And while the English are known for introversion and a terror of being noticed, the heat generated by the independence referendum has been a testament to the Scots' uncompromising desire to say what they're really thinking.
But it's precisely these differences that have made the Union between our countries so remarkable -- and so important.
As the empire vanished and industry declined, so the economic outlook of Scotland and England began to diverge.
Many Scots turned toward independence as an alternative way of ordering their affairs (while many Englishmen drifted toward the conservative United Kingdom Independence Party).
That brings us back to the benefits of sticking together.
We are predicted to overtake the perfidious French in the size of our economy by 2020 -- making us the fifth biggest in the world.
The army is perhaps at the heart of the emotional case for the Union.
Every New Year, we Britons sing "Auld Lang Syne" -- written by the Scottish poet Robert Burns.
It's nonsense, of course, but a reminder -- again -- of how much mystery and wonder the Scottish countryside brings to the UK.
But the United Kingdom will miss her dearly.
We're simply not as loquacious or romantic as our Scottish cousins.
