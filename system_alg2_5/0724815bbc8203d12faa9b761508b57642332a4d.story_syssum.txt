BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- An Iraqi soldier fatally shot two American soldiers and wounded three others on Saturday, the U.S. military said.
There have been similar incidents of men in Iraqi security force uniforms in the Mosul area opening fire on U.S. troops.
This is probably the main area we are looking at that could possibly result in U.S. forces being there," he said of Mosul.
U.S. troop fatalities in Iraq last month reached 18, the highest of the year.
Also on Saturday, Iranian forces targeting Kurdish rebels shelled a village in Iraq, an official from Iraq's Kurdish region said.
Meanwhile in Kirkuk, in northern Iraq, three civilians were killed and three others were wounded when a roadside bomb struck their vehicle on Saturday, police said.
