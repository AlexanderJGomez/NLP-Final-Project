About one-third of Latino voters say they have given this election "a lot of thought," while half of U.S. registered voters say they have, Pew said.
"Even in 2004, a year when Republicans won a greater share of the Latino vote in the presidential election than at any time since the 1980s, nearly six in 10 (58 percent) Latino voters supported Democrats John Kerry and John Edwards," the report said.
Nearly two-thirds of Latino registered voters said they approve of his job performance, well above the 47 percent of all U.S. registered voters who say they approve.
Fifty-nine percent of Latino registered voters said they are dissatisfied with the country's direction, while 73 percent of all U.S. registered voters say the same, Pew said.
According to a Pew Hispanic Center analysis of Census Bureau data, Latino voters constituted 7.4 percent of all voters nationwide in 2008, up from 6 percent in 2004.
