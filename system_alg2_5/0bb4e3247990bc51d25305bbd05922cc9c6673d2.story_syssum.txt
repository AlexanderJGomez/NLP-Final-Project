"We are like a little beam of sunlight, coming through and reminding people, 'Don't worry!
It will be happier,'" says Rami Borai, a comedian in one of Egypt's first home-grown comedy troupes, Hezb El Comedy.
In Qatar, a few young comics have come together to form SUCQ (an acronym for Stand Up Comedy Qatar).
Mohamed Kamal, who also performs stand-up with SUCQ, notes that given Qatar's political climate, there are limits to what he can joke about.
"If I ever read a newspaper that said, 'Ramy was indicted,' I would say, 'Yo, mom, this is it!'
I'll fly out of here, but I would be like, 'I got kicked out of my country for being too damn funny!'"
