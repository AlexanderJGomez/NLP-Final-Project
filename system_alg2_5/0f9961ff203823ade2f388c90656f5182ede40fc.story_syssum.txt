But Kagan displayed in her confirmation hearing Tuesday what those two men share -- a ready public wit and disarming sense of humor.
"It means I'd have to get my hair done more often, Sen. Specter," Kagan replied.
... We are looking for somebody who could moderate the court, and a little humor would do a lot of good."
On another occasion, Kagan was left giggling by an exchange between Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and committee chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont.
"All I can say about that paper is that it is dangerous to write papers about the law before you've spent a day in law school," Kagan said.
"You know if I accept your answer, it is going to spoil a whole five minutes I had here," Grassley responded.
Late in the day, conservative Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, said he would ask Kagan a "softball" question.
Graham asked.
Justice Stephen Breyer is equally smart and he too shares a sense of humor, but that tends to fall on the quirky, self-deprecating side.
Schumer paid Kagan a high compliment Tuesday, noting Scalia gets the most laughs during high court oral arguments.
