With extreme eating habits like these, it may be some surprise to learn that within the Olympic Village there lurks a culinary trap that can potentially tip athletes over the fine line between success and failure at London 2012.
"For the younger athletes it's an exciting new experience," says sports scientist Jess Corones, who works with the Australian Olympic swim team.
There's thousands of athletes and there's pretty much every kind of cuisine that you could possibly want.
"I've tried to get people to try it, but they won't.
However, it's rare for athletes to eat quite that much, says Corones, who first worked with Australia's track and field team at the 2004 Athens Games.
"We had our camp in Italy and all he used to eat every dinner was a bowl of raw mince.
Good nutrition from a young age can be vital if you want to be an elite athlete.
"You can get vitamin D in food sources (such as eggs, dairy and fish) but it's not as effective as sunshine production," Stevenson said.
But, with drug-testing standards improving year by year and the list of banned substances also increasing, there is a strong onus for athletes to be acutely aware of everything they put in their mouth.
"You might trust your coach 100% but if he gives you a bottle of tablets and tells you it's iron, it's still your responsibility to get that checked.
We have hotlines where the athletes can call up and check anything, so it's pretty easy to find out if it's okay to take."
A big part of Corones' job is making sure athletes learn the right food habits -- and this generally means breaking eating patterns formed at a young age.
It's about trying to break those cycles and get them eating as well as they can."
