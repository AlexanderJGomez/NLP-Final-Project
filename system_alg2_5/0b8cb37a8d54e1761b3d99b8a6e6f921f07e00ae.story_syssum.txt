(CNN) -- Suspected cop killer Eric Matthew Frein appears to have left handwritten notes in the Pennsylvania woods in which he chillingly describes his ambush of two state troopers last month, State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Wednesday.
Another cop approached the one I just shot.
Authorities said a search of Frein's bedroom turned up a variety of black and synthetic powders -- material consistent with what was used to make the two pipe bombs.
Bivens said the handwritten notes were discovered among items left behind at a campsite located by law enforcement agents on September 29.
Made half attempt to stash AK and ran."
Authorities have said that a review of a computer hard drive used by Frein shows that he had planned the attack for years.
