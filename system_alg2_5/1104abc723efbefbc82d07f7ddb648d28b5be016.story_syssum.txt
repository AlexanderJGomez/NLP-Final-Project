Oh, good.
Anthem, which is the second largest health insurer in the United States, said on Thursday that as many as 80 million customer records were stolen.
But when it's your inbox, your data, something about it feels different.
But it was enough of a motivator for me to call up a couple data security experts to dig into this a little bit.
The hackers "don't need to be bigger-better-faster because we're not doing the basics" to protect customer data, he said.
Henry told me the U.S. Federal Trade Commission could find that Anthem failed to institute industry "best practices" -- as defined by the industry, he said -- and force them to pay a fine.
I called someone with that point of view and Avivah Litan, a cyber security analyst at Gartner, said she doesn't think it's fair to blame Anthem for the stolen data.
I'm the one who got the email ...) If your credit card data is stolen, she said, there are easy ways to rectify the situation.
If she were an Anthem customer, the hackers have "my name, social, date of birth, address," she explained.
They could call the call center and take money out of my 401(k).
There's more.
Both security experts did share one answer: the Social Security number itself.
And Litan explained to me that there may be a way for health care companies, and other industries, to use a hard-to-crack proxy for a Social Security number in place of the real thing.
And unlike email and social media accounts, where stronger passwords and two-step verification systems help, there's no way consumers can rework the IT infrastructure of a major company like Anthem.
Litan told me.
And then we hung up.
