Hu Jintao, the incumbent president and party general secretary, will step down and be replaced by Xi Jinping, the current vice president.
Speculation is rife.
Analysts say Ling, 55, may still be chosen for the Politburo, but he is out of the running for the all-important Standing Committee -- the very highest decision-making body made up of a handful of key leaders.
Much was made of the incident in the media internationally, but much of this was rumor and speculation that CNN can not substantiate.
Ling has been replaced by Li Zhanshu, 62, a provincial party chief who is known to be an ally of Hu and has previous ties with the vice president.
China's leaders are widely seen as divided into two camps: that of retired president Jiang Zemin and that of President Hu.
The 86 year old has a network of allies in the party -- sometimes known as the "Shanghai faction" after the former president's time as Party leader in the city -- which he uses to influence policy and personnel decisions.
Others say Hu's camp, known as the Communist Youth League (CYL) faction, referring to the youth organization that Hu headed for years, will dominate the new leadership.
