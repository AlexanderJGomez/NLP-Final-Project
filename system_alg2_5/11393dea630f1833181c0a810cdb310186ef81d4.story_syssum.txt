David Jimenez Almazan, a combat medic from Van Nuys, California.
"Every mile is a memory," Jimenez said.
As she prepared for the race, Jimenez wanted people to remember her husband for the man that he was.
Like many of her teammates, Jimenez ran with a photo of her husband pinned to the lapel of her jersey, one that she carries for every race.
In the final leg of the race, Jimenez said she thought about the day she found out her husband was killed.
Like most runners, she admitted to she doubts as she approached the last few miles: "I said, 'I don't know if I can do this, David.
I love you.'"
