"The whole bridge from one side of the Mississippi to the other just completely gave way, fell all the way down," survivor Gary Babineau told CNN.
"I realized there was a school bus right next to me, and me and a couple of other guys went over and started lifting the kids off the bridge.
Ambulances were also having a hard time driving down to the river to get closer to the scene.
"I could see the whole bridge as it was going down, as it was falling," Babineau said.
I saw a couple cars fall," he said.
"So I stayed in my car until the cars quit falling for a second, then I got out real quick, ran in front of my truck -- because behind my truck was just a hole -- and I helped a woman off of the bridge with me.
Melissa Hughes, 32, of Minneapolis, told The Associated Press that she was driving home when the western edge of the bridge collapsed under her.
"You know that free-fall feeling?
Babineau told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune: "On the way down, I thought I was dead.
After the bridge settled and his car remained upright, "I just put in park, turned the key off and said, 'Oh, I'm alive,' " he said.
