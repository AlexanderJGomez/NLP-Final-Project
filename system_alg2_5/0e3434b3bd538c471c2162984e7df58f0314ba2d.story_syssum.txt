Mariupol, Ukraine (CNN) -- A U.S. lawmaker is calling for the arming of Ukrainian forces engaged in fighting Russian troops along the nation's eastern border with Russia.
"I think we are very close to the point of no return," Poroshenko said following an EU summit in Brussels, Belgium.
Poroshenko said thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukrainian territory.
"I want to remind you that Russia is one of the most powerful nuclear nations," Putin said.
A CNN team saw Ukrainian forces strengthening defensive positions on the eastern outskirts of the city, reinforcing checkpoints and digging trenches along roads leading toward the Russian border.
Since mid-April, the conflict between the pro-Russia rebels and the Ukrainian military has cost more than 2,500 lives, according to the United Nations.
