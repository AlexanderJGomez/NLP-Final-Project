In the United States, surgical supplies aren't the only useful medical items tossed away.
"We want to distribute the more than 75,000 wheelchairs we estimate get thrown away in the U.S. every year," he said.

"If we can do this with the help of just two U.S. hospitals, imagine how many more could be served if others got involved," Weaver said.
