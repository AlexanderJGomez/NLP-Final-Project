Google launched a tool called Helpouts on Tuesday in which people can pay to get help from experts over a live video chat similar to Google Hangouts.
To start, Google has more than 1,000 providers signed up to offer things such as music lessons, cooking demonstrations and basic home repair tips.
But some problems and lessons need more than a one-sided demonstration.
Manber said Helpouts remove space and time barriers to make getting professional services more efficient and convenient.
Osi Imeokparia, director of product management, had a cooking teacher show her how to properly zest a lemon, and a home repair expert talked her through patching a hole in drywall.
For now, Google is screening people and companies that want to offer their services through Helpouts.
People can have a counseling session, consult with a dietitian or get advice from a registered lactation support consultant over the video chats.
There is no framework for getting a Helpout session covered by insurance, but Google thinks the category has potential to become a regular part of modern health care.
People who want to share their expertise for free could also flock to Helpouts, according to Manber, who said it could open up a whole new new way to volunteer.
It could also benefit people in remote areas who either want to make money for their skills or learn things not offered near their homes.
