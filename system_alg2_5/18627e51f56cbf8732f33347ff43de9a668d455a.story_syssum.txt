(CNN) -- A California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) employee who allegedly wrote a letter to a transgender woman and condemned her to hell has resigned, officials said Thursday.
According to Yust and her attorney, the DMV employee used her confidential personal information to send the letter.
Other DMV employees also received training on transgender situations, he said.
"Why didn't they fire him the first time?"
Dolan said of the DMV field representative.
