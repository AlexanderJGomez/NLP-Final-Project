Paipote, Chile (CNN) -- In short order, freed miner Victor Antonio Segovia dispatches with some of the myths swirling around the 33 men rescued from the depths of the earth this week: He has no plans to write a book about what he endured in the San Jose mine, he isn't going to sue anyone for the collapse, and he intends to go back to working in the area's mines.
"Welcome home Victor Segovia," one neighbor said as she carried a handwritten sign greeting the miner into his home.
"We missed him a lot," Pedro Segovia said.
"He'll tell me at some point," Pedro Segovia said.
Two Chilean flags decorate a wall in a courtyard behind the Segovia's home.
But for the guest of honor just getting to the party will be almost as difficult as the previous legs of his journey.
It has all the makings of an ugly media scene.
As reporters ask him questions, he looks down.
Segovia said he missed his family terribly while in the mine.
"We were a team," he said of the 33 men.
"Down there you were always tired and didn't have any nightmares," he said.
