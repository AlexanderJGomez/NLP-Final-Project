(EW.com) -- To promote her Fox comedy "Raising Hope" (which begins its third season October 2), Martha Plimpton pitched a funny idea.
"Raising Hope" creator Greg Garcia will select the winner from the top 10 finalists in mid-October, and Plimpton and Dillahunt will get their hands dirty later that month or in early November.
But I think this show is a lot smarter than people realize.
And I think it's really smart, and it makes me laugh.
[Laughs] Because I don't laugh at a lot of things.
Clearly.
For example, as a laundry expert, I never use fabric softener on towels because it makes them less absorbent.
I don't know if I'll be doing this in the home of our winner, but I like to iron my sheets.
