Washington (CNN) -- Mitt Romney on Tuesday didn't back away from remarks he made in a secretly recorded video casting supporters of President Barack Obama as dependent on welfare, and instead said the comments that generated more problems for him in a tight race were an honest reflection of his campaign's message.
"The president's view is one of larger government," Romney said.
"There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what," Romney says in one clip first posted on Monday afternoon.
"There are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent on government, who believe that, that they are victims, who believe that government has the responsibility to care for them.
Obama was caught in a secret camera moment in 2008, when he was recorded at a private fund-raiser saying that some voters "cling to their guns and religion."
Too many people today who want to work are being forced into public assistance for lack of jobs," Brown said.
A CNN-ORC poll conducted after the Democratic convention showed Obama with a 52%-46% lead over Romney after the two were tied at 48% in the same poll the previous week.
Another clip from the event, posted later Monday, shows Romney questioning the prospect of ever reaching peace between Israelis and Palestinians.
