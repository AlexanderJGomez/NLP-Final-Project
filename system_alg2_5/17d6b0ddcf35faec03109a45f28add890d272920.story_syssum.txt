(CNN) -- Sal Dimiceli has spent decades helping people get back on their feet.
I want to cry thinking that CNN and people recognize the poverty that is out there so we can help even more people.
Yes, together we can make a difference."
...
CNN is my hero for taking all of us to the forefront, recognizing that we are making a big difference in the world around us.
People who are homeless, we'll help them get shelter; people who are hungry, we're going to feed them; people who have utilities off, we're going to turn them on; people that need transportation, we'll help fix their cars.
Dimiceli: Everything that I did to help others would not be possible if it wasn't for my mother.
I'm 60 now, and I'm going to keep that promise for as long as I can breathe.
