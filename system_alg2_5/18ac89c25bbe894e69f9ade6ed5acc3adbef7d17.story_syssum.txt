But fans of the sci-fi/horror franchise, which sputtered out with 1997's "Alien: Resurrection," are still eager to see what filmmaker Neill Blomkamp can do with the material.
But why would you?
Chatter about a Blomkamp "Alien" movie began almost two months ago when the South African filmmaker started posting "Alien"-themed concept art to Instagram -- including images of Weaver as her Ripley character.
Make them more cunning and even scarier looking.
Thankfully, Blomkamp seems to have done just that with his early concept art.
Ridley Scott's 2012 film "Prometheus" was a prequel of sorts to the first "Alien."
Just kidding.
