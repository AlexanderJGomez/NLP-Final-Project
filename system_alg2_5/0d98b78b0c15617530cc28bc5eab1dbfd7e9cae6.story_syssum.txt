Andrew Wyeth received the National Medal of Arts from President Bush in November 2007.
"Mr. Wyeth captured America in his paintings of his native Pennsylvania and Maine," Bush said.
Wyeth, who lived in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, and Maine, "has been enormously popular and critically acclaimed since his first one-man show in 1937," according to a biography in InfoPlease.
Those were painted in Pennsylvania.
