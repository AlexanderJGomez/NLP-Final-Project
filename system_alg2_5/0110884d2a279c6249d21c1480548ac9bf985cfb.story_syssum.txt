That's the challenge facing two sailors -- Charlie Enright and Mark Towill -- who met on the set of a Disney movie.
To add a further twist in the marathon journey ahead, the American pair's crew is the youngest in the race -- skipper Enright is 30 while Towill is just 25.
"I just put my application in at the last minute as my flatmates did it," says Enright.
Coached by Volvo Ocean Race sailors, they took on board every nugget of information they could about offshore racing before signing up in 2011 to the race's development program, learning the business side of getting together a team and the finances required.
"Alvimedica is a young company growing rapidly and we are a young team, so it was the perfect fit with American sailors -- and America's a big market for them."
Towill admits to having gone into hibernation in the buildup to the race, knowing that there will only be snippets of sleep in the next nine months, and he expects their friendship will be tested.
The two young sailors and their crew will also be hoping for a Disney ending.
