The three injured students have been released from hospitals, the sheriff's office said.
Garcia said an encounter between students turned into a physical confrontation involving "cutting instruments of some sort."
After the stabbings, students were kept in classrooms for safety and to allow authorities to interview witnesses, said the superintendent of Spring Independent School District, Ralph Draper.
The district gave automated phone and e-mail messages to parents about three hours after the stabbings, she said.
