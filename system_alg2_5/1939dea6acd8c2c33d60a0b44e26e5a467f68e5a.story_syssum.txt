The 49-year-old leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party is a former journalist and talk show host, son of a prominent politician, and a one-time amateur boxer with a rep as one of Israel's sexiest men.
Members of Yesh Atid range across the spectrum, Lapid said after the election in Tel Aviv.
Shas, a religious party, gained 11 seats.
But in interviews, Lapid has proposed Israel should give up much of the West Bank -- while retaining control of Jersualem.
Yair Lapid is the son of the late politician Tommy Lapid, whose one-time anti-religious party Shinui battled the power and influence of the ultra-Orthodox.
One of the leaders is Rabbi Dov Lipman, a confidant of Lapid and an American immigrant to Israel.
With leadership there are two steps, the first is to give people the belief that something can happen, and then to execute it," Lipman said.
"I think Part 1 he's really done.
Today's Likud appears more hospitable to the far rightist Moshe Feiglin than to centrists like Dan Meridor, denied a safe seat in the Likud primaries," Halevi wrote.
He emerged as the voice of middle class disaffection, yet included in his list two Ethopians, representatives of one of the country's poorest constituencies."
Yair conveys the impression of a man comfortable in all parts of Israel," Halevi wrote.
