(CNN) -- Tens of thousands of anti-government protesters are expected to join a march on Pakistan's capital as the country celebrates its independence.
Qadri has previously called for the military to be involved in the electoral process, causing alarm in a country with a history of coups.
Pakistan's Dawn News reported that an agreement has been struck between authorities and protest organizers to permit the rally on the condition participants remain in Islamabad for one day only.
On Wednesday, in a rare address to the country, Prime Minister Sharif refuted accusations of electoral rigging and stressed that Pakistan has moved forward over the past 14 months in terms of "currency value, foreign investment and economic growth."
But the air and ground offensive has displaced an estimated 500,000 people -- including 180,000 children according to the United Nations -- from their homes in North Waziristan.
