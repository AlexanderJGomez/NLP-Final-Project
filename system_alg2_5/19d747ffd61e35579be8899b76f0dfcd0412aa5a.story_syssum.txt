Some adults may still think bullying is just a youthful rite of passage, but it seems worse than in previous generations for many parents, educators and kids.
I first started reporting on the problem of bullying a few years ago when a rash of suicides of children propelled the issue into the national spotlight.
We've tried to understand how bullying can be a form of what researchers call "social combat," and we've looked at what programs work to prevent it, and why some schools fail to adequately address the problem.
Sometimes I tried to stop it, often times, I remained silent.
And why I hope you will watch "The Bully Effect" on CNN tonight at 8 p.m.
