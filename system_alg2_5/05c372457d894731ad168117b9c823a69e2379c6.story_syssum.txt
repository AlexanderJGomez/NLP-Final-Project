They are the members of AIG's Board of Directors Compensation Committee.
Why haven't we learned that it is the boards who are responsible for the massive failures of strategy and risk management at these companies?
The Corporate Library released a report in February about the boards of the bailout companies, many of which were outliers in their governance and compensation practices.
In several cases, we found individuals who not only sat on more than four corporate boards but also sat on more than one of these particularly troubled boards during this period.
In all, 11 of the 27 companies we identified as "troubled" had at least one overboarded director.
At least 13 individual directors, all of whom sat on at least three corporate boards during this period, had received a 13 percent or higher negative vote.
Badly designed compensation is an indicator of poor corporate governance, and poor corporate governance is an indicator of investment risk.
In this case, insanity is allowing the same people to continue to serve on the board after massive failure and expecting them to produce a different result.
