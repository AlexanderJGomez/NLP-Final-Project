(CNN) -- When I won the reality show competition "Survivor: Africa" in 2001, I never dreamed that an obscure African flower would provide the drug that later helped me survive cancer.
We drank from the same watering hole as elephants and giraffes, learning the best times to drink and how to stay out of their way.
But as they worked I found some comfort when I learned that one of them was derived from an African flower, the rosy periwinkle.
My cancer is now in remission and once again I owe my survival to working with nature.
This promise extends to other diseases as well, with half the new drugs created in the past 25 years derived from nature.
According to the World Conservation Union, more than 16,000 species, plant and animal alike, are in danger of extinction, largely because of human activities.
I won "Survivor: Africa," and I've won my battle against cancer.
The rosy periwinkle saved my life.
