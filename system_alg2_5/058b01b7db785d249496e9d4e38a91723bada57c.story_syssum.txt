(CNN) -- Authorities investigating the case of a boy who disappeared in Kansas almost a decade ago plan to search an undisclosed residence Wednesday, the Butler County sheriff said.
Wichita attorney Warner Eisenbise, who is representing Adam's adoptive parents, said the couple believed Adam had run away and didn't report him missing.
The couple never reported Adam missing, Valerie Herrman told the paper, because they feared authorities would take Adam and his siblings away because of the spanking.
The couple said they searched the mobile home park and other areas for two days after Adam left.
Adam had been placed in the Herrmans' care when he was about 2, Murphy said Monday.
"He had the cutest little round face, little-bitty freckles right up here on the tip of his cheek," she told the station.
