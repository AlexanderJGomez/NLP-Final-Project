She is thinking about the wildfire that reduced her house near Colorado Springs to ashes this week and about the water that Hurricane Katrina pushed into her childhood home eight years ago.
The fire.
Dawson got to her house in time to see the plumes of smoke and to receive the reverse-911 call to evacuate.
Then the physical documents in her possession.
The horses survived, but every day Dawson remembers another special item that disappeared in the fire.
Thinking back to Katrina, Dawson recalls the look in her parents' eyes when they returned to their flooded home to see their losses.
The doll still holds water that seeped in during the time it was submerged.
She will rebuild.
