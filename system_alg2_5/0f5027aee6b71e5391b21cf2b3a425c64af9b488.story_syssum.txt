There are differences between Australia and New Zealand, however.
So it is unsurprising that Australia developed a nationalist republican tradition, expressed by the "Bulletin" magazine from the 1880s -- with the motto "Australia for the Australians" -- that opposed the monarchy.

The Order of New Zealand was introduced by a reformist Labour government in 1987.
Both Australia and New Zealand founded republican movements in the 1990s to act as lobby groups advocating constitutional change, the New Zealand one based on the Australian model.
Australia differed from New Zealand in holding a referendum on becoming a republic in 1999, despite the prime minister's monarchism and a divided Liberal Party.
As for baby Prince George, support for his position as future heir to the thrones of Australia and New Zealand may be dictated in part by the sustainability of his -- and his parents' -- celebrity status.
