"They had no plan to keep the oil out, even though they said it wouldn't come ashore.
It's like it's being run with a bunch of seventh-graders," the outspoken freshman parish president said last week.
Nungesser hopes berms can be built to protect the area from the oil, and the Coast Guard was part of a discussion on the idea Tuesday.
I'm concerned about him dropping dead on me because he never stops," said friend Leo Polazzo, who has known Nungesser since his days as a local businessman.
He was the second of four children and was known as the class clown who could never stay still and often brought home stray animals much to his parents' chagrin, his sister, Heidi Nungesser Landry, said.
Inspired by his father, William Nungesser Sr., a local businessman and chairman of the state Republican Party, she said the younger Nungesser made an unsuccessful run for state representative and served on the state levee board in the 1980s.
General Marine Leasing proved to be a great success, mostly due to Nungesser's finesse with clients, said Rene Cross, a contractor who became a friend of Nungesser's after working with him.
By the time a Canadian company offered to buy General Marine Leasing from him for a reported $18 million, Nungesser had moved to Plaquemines Parish, bought property on a low level of land and turned his sights to raising elk.
Nungesser lost most of his herd when Hurricane Katrina roared through Plaquemines in 2005, carrying some of the elk up to 30 miles from his property, Cross said.
Nungesser says he ran for parish president in part because he didn't see the incumbent in the community during the Katrina clean-up.

"Things still need to be done to keep the oil out.
... At the end of this thing, I have to know I did everything possible to save the parish and the coast land," Nungesser said.
