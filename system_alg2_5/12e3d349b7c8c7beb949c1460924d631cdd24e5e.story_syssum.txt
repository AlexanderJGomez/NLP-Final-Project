But if the state of Texas has its way, Reed will be executed without those tests ever being conducted.
Fennell was a police officer who was accused of committing acts of sexual violence and was ultimately sentenced to 10 years in prison for sexually assaulting a woman he took into police custody.
Why on earth, one wonders, would Texas battle fiercely against conducting the testing?
The prospect of finding that Reed is innocent would deliver a resounding condemnation of the state's criminal justice process -- its detectives, prosecutors, defense attorneys, judges, jurors and appellate courts.
Texas also boasts a statewide Criminal Justice Integrity Unit that recommends lessons learned from wrongful convictions and oversees policy reform.
In response to Morton's exoneration, the state enacted a sweeping law that mandates broad discovery of evidence to the defense.
If the new evidence undermines Reed's guilt, he should be allowed to walk out of prison as a free man for the first time in 18 years, and the Georgetown police should reopen the investigation of the barbarous murder of Stacey Stites.
