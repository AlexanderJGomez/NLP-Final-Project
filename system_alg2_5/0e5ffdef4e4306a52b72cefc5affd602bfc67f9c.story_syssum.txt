Silverstone, England (CNN) -- It has taken over 20 years, but a woman was back on the track in the male-dominated world of Formula One .
Claire Williams -- deputy team principal of her father's eponymous race team and another strong female role model in the sport -- explained the team did not need to judge Wolff's driving abilities during her practice debut.
"She knows the car, she's done a lot of preparation in the simulator, she's spent a lot of time with the engineers and she's perfectly competent in the car without causing any hindrance to the team.
He would have loved it if I'd have done the session and done a good job."
Williams' deputy team principal has also had to deny employing Wolff as the team's development driver was just a publicity stunt.
"It's really cool to see her in a Formula One car.
It'll be good to see her on track."
Asked why it had taken more than 20 years for a female racer to be given another opportunity in a competitive F1 session, Wolff told CNN: "Firstly, if there is no role model out there doing it, for all the little girls who come to the tracks and watch on TV, if they don't see a girl on track then they're not inspired to want to do that themselves.
Giovanna Amati was the last woman to drive in the sport when she attempted to qualify for a race in 1992.
The late Maria de Villota, who died in October last year, also began her F1 career along with Wolff when she was signed as a development driver by the Marussia team in 2012.
