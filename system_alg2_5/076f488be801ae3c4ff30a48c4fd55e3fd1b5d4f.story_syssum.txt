Austin, Texas (CNN) -- The man who flew an airplane into a building housing an Internal Revenue Service office may have replaced some of its seats with a drum of fuel to cause maximum damage, a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation said Friday.
Two people were killed and two others were hospitalized, federal officials said.
"We found only two persons," he said.
Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo credited fast thinking by some people who were inside the building as the plane approached for the fact that few people were hurt.
Police said Sheryl Stack spent Wednesday night in an Austin-area hotel but did not say why.
"I saw it written once that the definition of insanity is repeating the same process over and over and expecting the outcome to suddenly be different," the online message says.
IRS investigator James L. Neff said that Ross is not under investigation; officials just wanted to make sure he was OK. "We didn't know if he was alive or dead," Neff said.
Friends and former colleagues said Friday they had no inkling of the rage apparently building inside Stack.
"We liked him," said Furley.
