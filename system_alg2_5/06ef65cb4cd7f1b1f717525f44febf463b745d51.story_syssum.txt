Robb Reiner and Steve "Lips" Kudlow have never given up on playing rock 'n' roll.
Watch Kudlow and Reiner talk about their passion Â»
Watch "American Morning" host -- and former music reporter -- John Roberts talk to Anvil
The enthusiastic Kudlow and laconic Reiner came by CNN Center to talk about the film, their inspirations and why they've always been successful.
My internal optimism told me this is going to be the most successful thing that's ever happened to me, and perhaps one of the greatest things that's happened to rock music -- the greatest rock documentary that's ever happened.
Reiner: It's fair.
[The director] is the other Rob Reiner, and Spinal Tap is the fake Anvil.
CNN: A lot of times when a director sets out to make a documentary, the people who are in the documentary say, "You cut this out, you changed this."
The whole movie is a one-take movie.
CNN: There's that funny bit in the movie in which you [Lips] talk about meeting Reiner by observing, "I heard this guy playing Cactus."
You don't.
CNN: It's easy to make fun of a band -- or make a tragedy out of a band -- that doesn't quite make it.
Even if it had ended then, you say in the movie that you've had the kind of success you were always hoping for.
...
Kudlow: You wouldn't get testimonials from some of these people if the music didn't mean something.
Reiner: It's called the Anvil Experience.
We were going to keep rocking whether this movie came along or not.
