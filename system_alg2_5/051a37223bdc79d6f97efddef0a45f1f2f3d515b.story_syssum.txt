The company described the "sophisticated attack" in a blog post on Friday, saying it took place in January when a small number of employees visited a compromised website that installed malware on their machines.
Unlike Twitter, Facebook said it has found no evidence that any user information was compromised.
Facebook said the site responsible for its attack took advantage of a previously unknown Java vulnerability, which Oracle patched on February 1.
Apple turned off Java by default for its OS X users as a precaution.
