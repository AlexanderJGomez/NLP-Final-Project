Earlier this week, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said the United States' criticisms of Gadhafi had a clear aim: military invasion.
"Let's not get carried away by the drums of war, because the United States, I am sure that they are exaggerating and distorting things to justify an invasion," Chavez said Monday, according to Venezuelan state media.
That same year, a new football stadium in Benghazi was named after the Venezuelan leader.
On Monday, Chavez said Gadhafi "has been my friend and our friend for a long time" in remarks broadcast on Venezuelan state television.
