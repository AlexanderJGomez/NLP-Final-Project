Liz Cheney, whose upstart bid to unseat Wyoming Sen. Mike Enzi sparked warfare in the Republican Party and within her own family, is dropping out of the primary race, she said on Monday.
Cheney called Enzi, 69, about her decision to bow out.
Enzi is a low-key presence in Washington in the Senate.
In a statement after her announcement to drop out, the Wyoming Republican Party praised Liz Cheney for being a "stalwart supporter" and fundraiser for Wyoming candidates and county parties in the past.
Mary Cheney, who is a lesbian, took to Facebook in November to object to Liz Cheney's opposition to same-sex marriage, claiming that her sister has previously supported her relationship while saying something very different on the campaign trail.
