Utah will reopen its five national parks by Saturday, as well as three other nationally run locations.
The other three locations that will be opened are Natural Bridges and Cedar Breaks national monuments, as well as Glen Canyon National Recreation Area.
In the event that the federal government shutdown drags on longer than the 10 days that have been accounted for, the state of Utah insists it would be able to make additional payments to keep the parks operational.
However, as with other funds spent during the shutdown, Congress is under no obligation to refund the bill.
