Until now, she's never read a book.
"It's something that they wanted for so many years, and they just had no idea how to start," said Matt Cusimano, a Peace Corps volunteer and a teacher at the primary school in Sandvoort, a village of nearly 200 people.
There's nothing analytical about it.
That's why I was comfortable taking on a library project," Cusimano said.
Some villagers contributed by cooking for hungry workers, while others shelved donated books or painted.
Better World Books and the nonprofit Margaret Clemons Foundation donated more than 3,600 books to the library.
"The (people of the) village never had an opportunity to learn about a computer.
In addition to learning about computers, many villagers are discovering new interests.
If you want to donate books for the people of Sandvoort, go to their Facebook page for information or to Better World Books.
