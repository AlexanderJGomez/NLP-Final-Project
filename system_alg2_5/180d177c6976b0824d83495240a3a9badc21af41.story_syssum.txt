"We have a lot of support from sponsors, from different international and multinational companies that see it as an opportunity to offer their brands and their experiences as well and it makes it way more profitable," said owner of The Garden, Ismael Kassem.
The Garden is booked out every night and Kassem and his partners are bullish about the future.
The election of an Islamist President, Mohamed Morsi, in 2012 had the industry fearful for its survival.
Building on their initial success, Rizk and his partners plan to open a new club soon.
Kassem is also eying three new venues over the next three years, equaling millions of dollars in investment.
Both Kassem and Rizk hope it will pay out in dividends.
