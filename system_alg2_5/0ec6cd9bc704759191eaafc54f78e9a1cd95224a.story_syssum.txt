(CNN) -- Nationalists held a narrow lead in Kyrgyzstan's parliamentary elections, the country's election commission said Monday.
International monitors did not report any major complaints on election day, though local observers from the political parties were more vocal with their concerns, Sooromkulova said.
Two months later, at least 356 people were killed and about 400,000 fled their homes in a wave of violence between ethnic Kyrgyz and Uzbeks.
Nearly 2.9 million people were eligible to vote for 120 lawmakers in a parliament called the Jogorku Kenesh, the Central Election Commission said.
