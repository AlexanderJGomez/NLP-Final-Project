He has pleaded not guilty.

Less than a year after signing the deal, however, the Patriots dropped him on the day he was charged with Lloyd's murder.
Lloyd didn't own a car.
Lloyd said Hernandez spent about $10,000 that night.
Daryl Hodge was with Lloyd when he said Lloyd got a text from Hernandez, asking to hang out later that night.
Three people got out of the car, and Lloyd was not one of them.
He pleaded not guilty.
Jurors also didn't hear anything about what happened in Boston on July 16, 2012 -- the night two men were murdered outside a club where Hernandez had been.
After leaving the second nightclub, Hernandez and the friend returned to their SUV and pulled over on a nearby street where Hernandez removed a revolver from the engine block, Haggan said.
Hernandez was charged in the double homicide in May, and he pleaded not guilty.
Investigators found evidence they believe links him to the 2012 slayings while investigating the death of Lloyd.
