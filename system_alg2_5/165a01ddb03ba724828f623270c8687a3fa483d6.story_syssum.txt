"Why are they doing this?"
says Frank Bales, 86, a co-pilot on a B-24 during World War II.
These World War II veterans have traveled here to visit the National World War II Memorial, which honors the 16 million U.S. armed forces who served and the more than 400,000 who died in battle.
He took his cause to a local air club.
Six planes flew 12 veterans.
So far, more than 30,000 veterans have experienced a visit to the memorial, courtesy of Honor Flight.
Shortly after Bales and his group arrived in Washington this day, they were taken by bus to the memorial.
Morse says the trip often provides closure for the vets who visit.
The same "Honor Flight" that transported the veterans to Washington returns them back home, landing just 12 hours after it took off.
An estimated 1,200 WWII veterans die every day.
