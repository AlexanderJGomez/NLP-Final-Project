One woman in her 50s, who works at a hospice, said she cannot go weeks without an income.
The judge in the case, Belvin Perry, previously ruled that the jury would be sequestered throughout the trial.
Simpson double murder trial in Los Angeles and the trial of Mary Winkler, found guilty of voluntary manslaughter in the death of her husband, a minister in Selmer, Tennessee.
A male juror said Tuesday he is one of four nurses on a 24-hour rotation for treating heart attack patients.
A man in his 30s said he runs a family-owned Ace Hardware store.
Cheney Mason, Anthony's lead defense attorney, said if the man can go to Panama, he has someone to take care of the store.
Perry is holding jury selection in this Tampa Bay Area city of more than 100,000 to avoid assembling a panel that is likely to be more familiar with the case.
Belvin dismissed a panel of candidates on Tuesday, saying they were contaminated by a prospective juror overheard discussing the case.
After screening for hardship, the court will ask remaining prospective jurors about their knowledge of the case, whether they could set that aside and if they were to find her guilty could they impose the death penalty.
