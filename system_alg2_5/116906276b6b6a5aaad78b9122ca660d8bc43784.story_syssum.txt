The United States has contacted authorities in Hong Kong to seek the extradition of Edward Snowden, the man who admitted leaking top-secret details about U.S. surveillance programs, a senior U.S. administration official said Saturday.
Those leaks were the basis of reports in Britain's Guardian newspaper and The Washington Post this month.
The company has since fired him.
Snowden said that he had to get out of the United States before the leaks were published by the Guardian and The Washington Post to avoid being targeted by the government.
This new treaty established an agreement under Hong Kong's "one country, two systems" that allows Hong Kong autonomy from Beijing in all matters apart from defense and foreign policy.
