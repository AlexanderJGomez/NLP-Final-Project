From bragging "mommyjackers" and smug "sanctimommies" to pictures of poop-smeared kids and placenta art, blogger Blair Koenig has seen it all.
I had no idea back then just how much parents truly overshare about their kids.
But a couple of years ago, I started getting a lot of submissions from parents, many of whom have parent friends that they find annoying.
Koenig: The aforementioned poop pictures are probably the most common type of submission I receive.
Koenig: I get e-mails from parents who say they're "reformed" and submit old examples of their oversharing ways.
If you're just posting a cute picture of your kid eating ice cream, it won't get featured on STFU, Parents.
Give people a Facebook or Twitter account and tell them to post whatever they want, and soon you will see a total devolution of acceptability.
Koenig: That answer depends on the person, because some people don't find poop disgusting but are completely repulsed by vomit or long strands of green snot.
It's all pretty gross.
Koenig: There are two kinds of people on social media: those who post too much information and those who don't.
I see it as a way to connect and share relevant information, and I don't think a child's poop texture is of any relevance to people other than a child's parents.
Some people even take pictures of their pet's poop.
