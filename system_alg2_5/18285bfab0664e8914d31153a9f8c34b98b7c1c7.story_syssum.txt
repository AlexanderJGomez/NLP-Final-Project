Rami and Kamal, both gay Iraqis, say they rarely show affection for men in public.
"They told me to take off my clothes to rape me or they would kill me immediately.
"  Watch the tormented life of gays in Iraq Â»
CNN spoke with Kamal, now 18, and his 21-year-old friend Rami about what it's like to be gay in Iraq.
Lesbians are also victims of harassment and violence, but not nearly as often as gay men.
It's unknown how many homosexuals have been killed by militias in the lawless streets of Iraq's cities, but some Web sites post pictures of Iraqis they say were killed for being gay.
"Gay men and lesbians in Iraq face a lot of risks right now, because homosexuality is sometimes interpreted by people in Iraq as being a Western import," said Scott Portman with the Heartland Alliance, a group that promotes human rights worldwide.
Kamal and Rami say the dangers are all too real in Baghdad -- and they live in secrecy not to shame their families.
Rami added, "I do not know why people hate gays even though so many have this tendency.
One man said he considers gays no different from "criminals and terrorists."
"One day he told me he would come over to my house and kill me in front of my family," Rami said.
"During my sleep, I only see nightmares, and I start crying.
"Only my close friend Rami knows about this secret."
