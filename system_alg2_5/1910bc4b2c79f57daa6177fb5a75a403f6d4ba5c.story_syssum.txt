The Internet has been pondering these questions since National Review correspondent Kevin Williamson accused Dunham of sexually abusing her sister as a child.
What matters more than what Williamson and others make of their childhood relationship is how Dunham's sister, Grace, responded to the events as a child, how their parents addressed them in the moment, and how they continue to affect the younger sibling, now 22.
At the very least, it's not the kind of behavior that warrants branding a pre-pubescent Lena Dunham a child abuser.
"It can be difficult to tell the difference between age appropriate sexual exploration and warning signs of harmful behavior," Brateman said.

"When children don't have answers to questions on their minds, that's when they'll take matters into their own hands," he said.
Many critics cited the age difference between the sisters as evidence of Lena Dunham's inherently abusive behavior, a valid argument because research shows that the age differential matters.
"Right now, we're teaching children to tell someone, but basically putting the responsibility on the child to make it stop and that can be damaging if (we're) not teaching adults the importance of taking decisive action," he said.
