Coots was a third-generation "serpent handler" and aspired to one day pass the practice and his church, Full Gospel Tabernacle in Jesus Name, on to his adult son, Little Cody.
The National Geographic show featured Coots and cast handling all kinds of poisonous snakes -- copperheads, rattlers, cottonmouths.
Tennessee banned snake handling in 1947 after five people were bitten in churches over two years' time, the channel says on the show site.
"He'll give up, just sooner or later," one of the members says.
"Catching two snakes the first day, 'course we'd hoped for more," Coots says in the video.
