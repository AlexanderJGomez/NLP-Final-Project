Oklahoma will seek the death penalty for Alton Alexander Nolen, 30, who is charged with first-degree murder in the beheading of a 54-year-old woman at his former workplace, District Attorney Greg Mashburn said in a court document Thursday.
The FBI is also investigating the attack because Nolen "was saying Arabic terms in the attack," Mashburn said.
Police said Nolen walked into the Vaughan Foods front office September 25 and attacked one of the first people he encountered, Colleen Hufford, 54.
Vaughan arrived at the plant with a rifle and shot Nolen as he was charging with knife in hand, Mashburn said.
