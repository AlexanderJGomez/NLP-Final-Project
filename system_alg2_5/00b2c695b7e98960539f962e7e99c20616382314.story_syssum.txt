Hosted by Yasser Sami and Walid Monam, and produced by their friend Ghazwan Al-Shawi, the show is called "Akou Fad Wahad" -- "There is this guy" -- the typical setup for one of their anecdotes.
Sami said a gang even turned up at his house, threatening him.
She asks, 'Son, why is it that only one of them that is tweeting?'
"We changed things in the show," he said.
But as frustrating as it might be, he and his friends are content to tone down their act, if it means bringing a smile to people's faces.
