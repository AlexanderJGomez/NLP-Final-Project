(CNN) -- Tom Wagner woke up Friday night and the plane cabin was dark.
I'm locked in the plane."
The plane had a layover in Houston, Wagner said, so he took his hat off and took a nap.
Wagner said he walked around the plane in the dark trying to figure out the best thing to do.
The flight was operated by ExpressJet, a United partner.
ExpressJet told CNN affiliate KTRK there was a post-flight cabin inspection, but the company couldn't explain how Wagner was overlooked.
