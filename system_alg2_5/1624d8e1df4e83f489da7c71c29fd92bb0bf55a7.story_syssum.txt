Washington (CNN) -- Health care reform backers won a key victory Saturday night as the Senate voted to move ahead with a floor debate on a sweeping $848 billion bill.
Republicans, in turn, slammed Democrats for pushing a bill that conservatives insist will force millions of Americans to drop insurance plans they like while boosting premiums, raising taxes and leading to government rationing of care.
The Republicans "are frightening people," said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa.
The bill "does worse than nothing," said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected that Reid's 2,074-page bill would extend health insurance coverage to 31 million additional Americans.
The outcome of the Senate vote was unclear before Saturday afternoon, when Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Arkansas, announced her intention to back a floor debate on the measure.
"There's no doubt that this vote will be a critical issue for Sen. Lincoln as she embarks on her uphill re-election bid," said Amber Wilkerson Marchand, a GOP spokeswoman.
Reid's bill, projected to ensure coverage for 94 percent of Americans, includes a range of tax increases and new fees.
Unlike the plan recently passed by the House, the Senate bill does not mandate that all employers offer health care.
The House bill has more restrictive abortion language and includes a 5.4 percent income tax surcharge on individuals making more than $500,000 and couples earning more than $1 million.
Insurers under both plans would be barred from charging higher premiums based on a person's gender or medical history.
