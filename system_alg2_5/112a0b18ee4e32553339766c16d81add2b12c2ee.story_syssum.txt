Saturday brought another reminder of the powers that be in Egypt as America's top military officer was in Cairo to meet with his Egyptian counterparts.
The United States viewed the legal proceedings against the foreigners as a crackdown, another sign that autocracy has hardly departed Egypt.
"Many people ... don't know what actually toppled Mubarak was the last three days of those 17 days when large numbers of workers in different sectors went on strike," she said from Cairo.
Meanwhile Saturday, an American student was arrested with an Australian journalist and their female translator in the city of Mahalla, north of Cairo, for inciting people to join the general strike and handing them money for doing so, a spokesman for the Egyptian Ministry of Interior told CNN.
"Actions like these were hallmarks of Mubarak's 30-year rule, but they also have been used repeatedly in the year since the (Supreme Armed Forces Council) assumed control," Human Rights Watch said.
Dempsey's spokesman, Col. Dave Lapan, said they discussed a wide range of issues, including the investigation of nongovernmental organizations in the country and an announcement that 43 foreigners working for such groups, including 16 Americans, would face prosecution.
The Egyptians said the pro-democracy organizations had received illegal foreign financing and were operating without a proper license.
In doing so, the United States escalated the crisis that is now testing its alliance with its Arab ally.
They are optimistic that momentum will build as long as a military regime rules Egypt.
