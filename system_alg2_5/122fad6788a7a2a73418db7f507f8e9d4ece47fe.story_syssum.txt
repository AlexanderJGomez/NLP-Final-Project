The 114-page report released by the Connecticut Office of the Child Advocate profiled the developmental and educational history of Lanza, the young man who carried out the mass killings at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012.
The report was dedicated to the 20 first-graders who died at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012.
Adam enrolled in Sandy Hook Elementary School in the first grade after his family moved to Newtown, the report said.
It was during this late elementary school period that major mental health red flags were raised, the report said.
In a September 2005 visit to the Danbury Hospital Emergency Room for a crisis evaluation, Nancy Lanza described her son to the health care providers as "having had 'borderline autism' in the past, but having since outgrown it," the report said.
The report singled out a period of homebound education during which Lanza was taken out of school during his eighth-grade year as an especially dangerous health care decision that contributed to his isolation and deterioration.
The report also noted that it appeared Nancy Lanza made no effort to curtail her son's access to guns in the house in the months leading up to the shooting, despite Adam's severe mental deterioration.
