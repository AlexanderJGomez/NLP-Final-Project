The 34 year old striker left Tottenham Hotspur at the end of last season, and has agreed a one year deal with Martin O'Neill's side.
Sunderland's local rivals Newcastle United also added to their side on Thursday, finally completing the transfer of Ajax midfielder Vurnon Anita.
Now I think we can also win trophies with Newcastle and it's time to do that.," Anita told the club's website.
"I talked to the manager and the coach and they know that I want to play in a defensive midfield place and that's why they brought me here," he added.
