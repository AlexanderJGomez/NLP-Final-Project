"The estate of Robert Read made its first distributions to Brattleboro Memorial Hospital and the Brooks Library in the amounts of $4.8 million and $1.2 million," Read's attorney said in a press release.
"To find out that he had left this money to the hospital was a great surprise," Pattison said.
Though his jobs never yielded large salaries, Read enjoyed investing in the stock market, always putting his money into "dividend producing stocks," Rowell said.
When her client died last June and she went to retrieve the appropriate estate documents from Read's safety deposit box, she realized just how frugal he was.
In addition to his charitable donations, Read also gave a portion of his fortune to a couple of stepchildren and friends.
