It was The Station nightclub in West Warwick, Rhode Island, where 100 were killed during a show by '80s heavy metal band Great White.
"I can't help but watch because I'm one of them," Gina Russo told CNN affiliate WPRI-TV.
Nobody has learned anything," he told CNN affiliate WJAR-TV.
The Station fire brought changes to Rhode Island law, requiring sprinklers at buildings that can house more than 150 people and limiting pyrotechnics.
Michael and Jeffrey Derderian, the two brothers who owned the club, pleaded no contest to 100 counts each of involuntary manslaughter.
"It just takes time and patience and to know you're not alone."
"If only they had learned from our tragedy."
