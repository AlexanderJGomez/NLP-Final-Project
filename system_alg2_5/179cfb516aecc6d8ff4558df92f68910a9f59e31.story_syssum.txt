(CNN) -- Football's world governing body, FIFA, has officially sanctioned the wearing of religious headscarves.
"Players must not reveal undergarments showing slogans or advertising.
A player removing his jersey or shirt to reveal slogans or advertising will be sanctioned by the competition organiser," FIFA states.
The simplest rule for the image of the game is to start from the basis that slogans will not be allowed," said Alex Horne, general secretary of the English Football Association.
