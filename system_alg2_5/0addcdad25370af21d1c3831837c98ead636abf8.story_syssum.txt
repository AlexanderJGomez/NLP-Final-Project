He also said that China and the United States were in "close communication" on the issues of Syria and Iran.
"The Iran nuclear issue should be resolved through dialogue, not confrontation, through cooperation, not sanctions," Yang said.
China this week made new diplomatic efforts to help mediate in the Syria conflict, where President Bashar al-Assad's regime has been pursuing a nationwide campaign to crush the nearly year-old protests against his rule.
Yang reiterated China's opposition to unilateral outside intervention.
"China and the U.S. have more converging interests in the Asia-Pacific region than anywhere else in the world," he said.
If China were to use military force, the United States -- which does not support Taiwan independence -- could intervene under the Taiwan Relations Act, a 1979 law declaring that peace and stability in the area are in U.S. interests.
The United States, which recognizes Tibet as an autonomous region of China, has expressed concern about the situation.
All these issues will exert major impact on the global situation and on China's diplomacy in the years to come.'
