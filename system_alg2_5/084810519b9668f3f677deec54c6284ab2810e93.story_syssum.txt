(CNN) -- A 19-year-old gunman who killed eight people and then himself Wednesday at the Westroads Mall in Omaha, Nebraska, left a suicide note, police said.
Police identified the gunman as Robert A. Hawkins of Nebraska.
Seven people were found dead at the scene by officers arriving six minutes later; two others, a male and a female, died after being transported to Creighton University Medical Center, said Fire Chief Robert Dahlquist.
"He just said he wanted to thank me for everything I'd done for him ... and he was sorry," Maruca Kovac said.
"He said, 'It's too late.'
"I was scared to death he'd be walking around looking for someone else."
Warren, the police chief, said the victims included five females and three males, not including Hawkins.
Maruca Kovac said she was unaware Hawkins had any guns, although she said he knew a lot about them, as did his stepfather.
Witnesses described chaos and frantic shoppers running away from the Von Maur store, where the shooting began just before 2 p.m.
"You're in such shock, it's hard to think.

The shopping center will be closed until at least Thursday, police said.
