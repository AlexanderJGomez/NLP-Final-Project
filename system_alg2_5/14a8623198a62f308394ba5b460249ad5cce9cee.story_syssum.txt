The question is whether the country's lawmakers will do what they must to persuade the world that there won't be a repeat of Yanukovych's gaudy lifestyle.
Sadly, lawmakers balked, and the legislation failed by eight votes as too many members of parliament abstained.
The problem for Ukraine is that Yanukovych's lifestyle -- allegedly funded through sweetheart deals and shady companies -- has left the international community wary of handing money over to the government without some guarantee that the rule of law will apply to those handling the funds.
One sticking point likely scaring politicians is that from the new parliament onward there would be mandatory public registries of lawmakers' assets, so-called asset declarations, and a public list of any potential conflicts of interests.
Poroshenko must therefore clearly tie the future economic success of a pro-Western Ukraine to the electoral fortunes of the candidates.
The question is whether lawmakers will seize this opportunity to pass a strong set of anti-corruption laws that will show parliament is committed to ruling the country for the people, not for themselves.
