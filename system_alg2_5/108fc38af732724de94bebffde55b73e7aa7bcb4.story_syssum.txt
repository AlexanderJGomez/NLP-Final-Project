(CNN) -- Mike Nichols, the award-winning director and pioneering comedian who was one of the few people to win an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony award, died Wednesday evening, according to a note from ABC News' president to its staff.
At one point in 1967, he had four plays running on Broadway -- including two by Neil Simon, "Barefoot in the Park" and "The Odd Couple" -- and he was a go-to guy for stage works until the end of his life, helming Tom Stoppard's "The Real Thing" (1984), "Monty Python's Spamalot" (2005) and a 2012 revival of "Death of a Salesman" starring Philip Seymour Hoffman.
"And so I thank you for casting this short, 29-year-old, unknown actor with a prominent nose to play Benjamin Braddock," Hoffman said.
You're more than a great director.
He returned to Chicago, where he started up a comedy troupe and met Elaine May.
Nichols said he took to the stage.

He was also the director of the musical "Annie" (1977), which was one of Broadway's longest-running musicals when it closed almost six years later.
Nichols won best director for his work.
"No one was more passionate about his craft than Mike," James Goldston, president of ABC News, said in a note to the staff.
He met Sawyer later in life (he was 54 at the time) and she became his fourth wife.
In addition to Sawyer, Nichols is survived by his three children -- Daisy, Max and Jenny -- and four grandchildren.
