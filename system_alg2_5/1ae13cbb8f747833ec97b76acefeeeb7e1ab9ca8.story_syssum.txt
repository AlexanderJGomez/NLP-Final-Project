The creators, episode director and producer Pam Fryman and cast members Radnor, Neil Patrick Harris (Barney Stinson), Cobie Smulders (Robin Scherbatsky), Alyson Hannigan (Lily Aldrin) and Jason Segel (Marshall Eriksen) teased the upcoming 24-episode season recently at the San Diego Comic-Con.
It ties in with something to come later in the season involving the kids, which Bays said they shot during the second season for whenever the ending arrived.
Knowing what we have left to tell, this little story we've been meaning to tell for eight years now, it would have felt really abrupt to end it after eight seasons."
"We last left our gang when Lily and Ted were driving out together, Barney and Robin were driving out together and Marshall was planning to come back from Minnesota for the wedding.
"It seems like it's something Marshall wants to tell her in person," Segel said.
I'm a terrible liar, so I really don't know, but he obviously doesn't want her to find out, and it's going to be one of those 'Is she going to find out?'
Fryman confirmed fans will see Ted meet the character very quickly into the ninth season and said viewers are "going to get to know her."
Everyone else you saw walking around there is the 'How I Met Your Mother' writers (and crew).
The cast members seemed emotional about "How I Met Your Mother" coming to an end, but Harris said they are just trying to enjoy filming this season.
Smulders, who also appears in the season premiere of the new ABC show "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D," said, "It hasn't started to sink in yet.
Literally the words they used to me in season one: 'Well, I just feel like it's really exotic.'
"I was actually talking with Carter and Craig last night about how there's this new fashion of dumping 12 episodes out.
Like Netflix is now giving all these episodes, and they can do really serialized arcs.
"
