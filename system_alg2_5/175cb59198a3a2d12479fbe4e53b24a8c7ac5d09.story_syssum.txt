Arielle Spiridigliozzi is one of 350 students who have contracted H1N1 at the University of Kansas.
But it was.
University officials have asked the girls to stay in their dorm suite to limit exposure to other students.
It wasn't like I was licking the handlebars of the bus or anything," she said.
Perry's flu hasn't been confirmed as an H1N1 strain, but a third roommate, the first to get sick, they said, was diagnosed with H1N1.
The university estimates about 340 students, or 1 percent of the student body, have flu they suspect is H1N1, said Patricia Denning, medical chief of staff at Watkins Health Center.
So, to make life easier for the sick, the school's medical center has distributed what it calls a "flu kit," which includes a mask and a home-care instruction sheet, Denning said.
"I got all my homework done," Perry said.
"Yeah, I've gotten all my homework done for the next two weeks, probably," added Spiridigliozzi.
