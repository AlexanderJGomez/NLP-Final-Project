None of these, in the long run, might be as important as his efforts to help the economy, which, ironically, has felt stronger just as Americans' faith in Obama to steer it has dwindled.
"If the economy moves in a positive direction and in the next two years we are really out of the sluggish economy that he started his presidency with, people will value that."
He'd also have more power to sway budget negotiations that could affect future spending on social programs such as Medicare and Social Security.
"I think if the health care law is in place and works, he'll be remembered really favorably," said Weatherford, comparing the law to the Great Society social programs enacted by President Lyndon Johnson.
But that's the lowest unemployment rate since Obama was first elected president, when the rate sat at 6.8%.
The U.S. government took an activist approach to saving the economy.
Obama took this activist approach and ran with it.
"If the last two years of the Obama presidency are filled with a possibility economy, it's going to change the way we view the stimulus and his other economic programs," he said.
What we do know is that the national debt skyrocketed as the federal government spent furiously to save the economy.
Potentially rising interest rates and less help for the unemployed and the hungry as those stimulus programs run out could exacerbate the problem, which Obama has made clear will be a focus of his remaining time in office.
It's why I ran for President.
More than health care or the Iraq war, the economy dominated the 2008 election â€” 55% of voters said it was the most important problem facing the country.
That means it's perhaps not fair to give presidents credit when the economy improves or blame them when it goes bad.
"It's never fair," Zelizer said.
