Jameel Jaffer says the courts have ruled that refusal to disclose the abuse photos was unlawful.
In October 2003, we filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act for records -- including photographs -- relating to the abuse of prisoners in U.S. detention facilities overseas.
In explaining his change of heart, President Obama said that the release of the photos "would not add any additional benefit" to the ongoing public debate about the abuse of prisoners.
President Obama's statement was meant to explain why the photos would not inform the public debate, but it only underscored why the release of the photographs is so important.
President Obama's other rationale for suppressing the photographs is that they would "inflame anti-American opinion and put our troops in greater danger," an argument that was repeatedly rejected by the courts when made by the Bush administration.
