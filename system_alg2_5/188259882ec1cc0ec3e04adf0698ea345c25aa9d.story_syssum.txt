The dog brought the skull back home in September and its owner contacted authorities, who have worked since then to determine if the remains were that of fugitive Kevin Patrick Stoeser.
In August 2013, Stoeser was transferred to the Austin Transitional Center, a halfway house in Texas.
Stoeser was on the U.S.
No other remains have been found, they said.
He died in a shootout in New York City as police closed in on him.
