Supporters hope Zahra Rahnavard will become Iran's future first lady.
"We look at her and we say, 'we want to be like her in the future, ' " said Shakiba Shakerhosseie, one of 12,000 people who packed into Tehran's indoor Azadi (Freedom) sports stadium to hear Rahnavard speak.
The crowd, which was clad in Mousavi's trademark color green, cheered wildly.
"I am really angry here in Iran with the position of women," said Saghar Kouhestani, adding that she supports Mousavi because of his wife.
"If Ahmadinejad does well in the debates, I don't think anyone will be able to defeat him," Marandi said.
"This is the first time after the Revolution we see a lady behind the president," said Farhad Mahmoudi.
