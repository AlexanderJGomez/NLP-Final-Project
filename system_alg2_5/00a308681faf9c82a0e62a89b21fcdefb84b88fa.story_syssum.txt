Officers sent to check on Paul Ciancia's welfare arrived at his apartment less than an hour after the shooting started, police said Monday.
According to someone who knew Ciancia and his three roommates well, Ciancia began asking for a ride to the airport days before the shooting.
Around the same time, Ciancia was sending text messages to family members in Pennsville, New Jersey.
It sounded as if Paul Ciancia in California was thinking about harming himself, so obviously I knew I needed to make a phone call to the LAPD," Pennsville Police Chief Allen Cummings told CNN's Jake Tapper on Monday.
He said police had arrived at Ciancia's apartment about 45 minutes after the suspect had left for the airport.
According to the LAPD account, they arrived 52 minutes after the shooting, which began about 9:20 a.m., according to police.
"And he kept going."
Two other TSA officers -- James Speer, 54, and Tony Grigsby, 36 -- were wounded but were released from the hospital.
Airport Police Chief Patrick Gannon said the FBI told him that his officers were 60 seconds behind Ciancia.
Holder said Monday that the investigation will include a review of security measures at LAX and other airports.
More than 167,050 airline passengers were affected by the incident Friday as a result of cancellations, delays or diversions to other airports, according to LAX.
"It is most important for us as a family to express our deep and sincere sympathy to the Hernandez family," the Ciancia family said.
The Ciancia family said they would "continue to love and care for" Paul.
While we do not mean to minimize the grief and distress experienced by many other families, we hope that the public will understand that this is a very difficult time for our family, too," the family said.
"It's almost like an open shopping mall," he said.
