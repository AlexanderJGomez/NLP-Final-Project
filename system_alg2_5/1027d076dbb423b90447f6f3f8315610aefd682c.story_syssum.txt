For this we should all feel shame: shame that we live in a world where the lives of young girls can be shattered with impunity by fanatical thugs.
Caught in the blinding glare of global attention, and facing a tide of questions about their bungled response to the kidnappings, the Nigerian government felt the weight of accountability and was spurred to take greater action; offers of assistance from the likes of the US, UK, France, and China were accepted.
Poor and socially marginalized, all many of them have is their hope that their girls will one day return.
But it can be done.
Our common humanity compels us to do our part, to right this shameful wrong.
