(CNN)Here in London, you can tell that the U.S. presidential election is only about 600 days away because every restaurant here seems to contain a senator or a governor.
Why?
Scott dodged, and because the audience laughed gently at him in English accents, it made him look all the more like a country bumpkin.
In contrast, England is somewhere that American political careers go to end.
For all of this, London Mayor Boris Johnson taunted Mitt in front of a large British crowd -- and Boris is the closest you get to a politician we actually like.
Chris Christie's remarks about vaccinations were probably a little too parochial to cause a stir in in the UK media, but Louisiana Gov.
But while there certainly are no-go areas here, it's because they're just horrible and no one (Muslim, Jewish, Christian or anyone else) would want to go there.
Why, otherwise, would someone ask Scott Walker whether or not he believes in evolution when he's in the UK on a trade mission?
But that, I would argue, is one more reason for Republicans to cross Britain off their places to visit.
Meanwhile, the decline of religion in this country is fast, but while we like to imagine it has brought enlightenment, the reality is probably that it has brought social dislocation and despair.
So my advice for any other presidential candidates considering a visit to London is to take a second look at the map.
