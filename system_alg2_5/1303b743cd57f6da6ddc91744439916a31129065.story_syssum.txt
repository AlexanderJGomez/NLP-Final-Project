The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland at the base of the neck.
She just might have been right pointing her finger at her thyroid, because, according to the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, as many as 27 million Americans suffer from some type of thyroid gland misfiring.
"Our thyroid, even though it's a small gland in your neck, controls everything," says endocrinologist Karen Smith.
"There is actually an acronym that we use for hypothyroidism," she said.
And while these symptoms might be signals that something other than your thyroid is the issue, it's worth getting it tested.
"Hyperthyroidism is when the thyroid is actually making too much thyroid hormone.
My memory was poor and I had a hard time concentrating.
But just like hypothyroidism, this conditions is very treatable.
"The treatment is very different from hypothyroidism; we are actually trying to slow the function of the thyroid down.
Because there are certain risks with even mild changes in thyroid levels, those considered at high risk, including pregnant women and those with a family history of thyroid problems, need to get tested earlier and more frequently, Smith said.
If she was right and it was not just an overactive hand-to-mouth cake thing, then I better call my doctor pronto to schedule my own test.
