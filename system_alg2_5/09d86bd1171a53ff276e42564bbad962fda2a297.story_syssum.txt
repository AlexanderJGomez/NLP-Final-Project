The attacks reminded the world once again how brazen the group can be.
The group has been blamed for attacks in Somalia that have killed international aid workers, journalists, civilian leaders and African Union peacekeepers.
In February 2012, the group's leader, Ahmed Abdi Godane, and al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri released a video announcing the alliance of the two organizations.
It was, in part, funded by former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.
That strife led the younger members to ally with a group of Sharia courts -- the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) -- that were seeking to impose order over a landscape marked by feuding warlords in the capital city.
And that move inflamed Al-Shabaab, which attacked Ethiopian forces and gained control of parts of central and southern Somalia, according to a 2011 case study by Rob Wise, who was then with the Counterterrorism Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
"Mortar by mortar, shell by shell, only going to stop when I send them to hell," an unidentified voice raps in English.
The once-ragtag al Qaeda affiliate has grown into an economic powerhouse, raising tens of millions of dollars in cash from schemes that have involved extortion, illegal taxation and other "fees," according to the 2011 United Nations report.
The United States believed then that the group was coordinating with al Qaeda groups in Yemen and might have been plotting attacks in the region and abroad.
The United States has supported U.N.-backed African forces fighting Al-Shabaab and strengthened its counterterrorism efforts against the group.
In January 2013, for the first time in more than two decades, the United States granted official recognition to the Somali government.
