So, do the average users of online e-mail and Web services simply have to assume that hacking will expose their personal messages and photos?
Some Web-based e-mail services like Google's Gmail offer tools to add an extra layer of protection.
Two-step verification drastically reduces the chances of someone stealing the personal information from your e-mail account because hackers would have to not only get a password and your user name, they would also have to have access to the mobile phone to which the code is sent.
For an extra level of security, check to see if other websites you use offer HTTPS for transmission.
So instead of throwing up your hands that Web-based e-mail and online data transfers can never be secure, seek out and use the security tools that already exist.
