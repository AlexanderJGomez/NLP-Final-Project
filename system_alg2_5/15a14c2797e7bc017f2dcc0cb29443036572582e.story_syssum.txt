But this intense training regime isn't designed to support a weightlifting crusade or an endurance run, it is built around thrashing a golf ball further than anyone else in the world.
The 29-year-old is homing in on his main target for 2014, the long driving world championship in Las Vegas, a title he won back in 2010.
This is the World Championships -- the big one.
Miller's longest drive in competition is a mammoth 474 yards.
The speed at which Miller swings the club regularly clocks in at 155 miles per hour and the ball consistently flies off the face at a freakish 225mph.
He's right.
That is going to give us the right launch conditions.
Miller's obsession with distance is one reflected at all levels of golf, he says.
"Technology as it has progressed -- with shafts and the heads -- it plays a huge part," Miller explains.
"There are clubs out there that can't do that and would blow up with one hit.
When I came back to the UK after winning the world championships in 2010 nobody, apart from the real fans of it, knew about it.
Cox says there are up to 50 points of Miller's swing that have been tweaked from a regular tour pro's to maximize the length he hits the ball.
Miller's jet-propelled swing is backed up by numbers.
It all boils down to this; Miller needs to execute the perfect technical swing, and connect with the ball, not only right in the middle of the club, but also at the right angle, for it to fly.
There's only a limited crowd on show at Brocket Hall but we are still in awe of Miller's hitting prowess.
I play golf with some people who would struggle to hit it 397 yards in two shots.
