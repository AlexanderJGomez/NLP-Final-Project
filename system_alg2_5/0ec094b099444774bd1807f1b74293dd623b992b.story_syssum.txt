When more than 200 girls were in April 2014 kidnapped by Boko Haram terrorists from their school in Chibok, the international community rallied around Nigeria.
At about the same time that the Baga bloodbath was making headlines around the world, the international community was rallying around France in support against the terrorist attacks on the Charlie Hebdo newspaper offices in Paris, giving rise to the #JeSuisCharlie social media campaign.
However, President Jonathan has issued a statement condemning the Paris attacks.
Perhaps it is not that the Nigerian government does not care about its own people.
More women and girls have been kidnapped.
Last year, President Jonathan's wife, Patience, openly queried the veracity of the missing girls report.
They believe that, similar to the World Bank's assertion that more than 67% of Nigerians are living in poverty, the Baga reports are all part of the international community's grand conspiracy to taint Nigeria, to make our country look bad.
Baga and other such will clearly have to take a back seat until after the elections.
I suspect that those Nigerians who believe the relatively popular theory in certain ethnic circles that the rise in Boko Haram attacks are being orchestrated by unknown forces who want President Jonathan out by all means, will vote to keep him in -- just to prove a point to his enemies that their vicious efforts did not work.
