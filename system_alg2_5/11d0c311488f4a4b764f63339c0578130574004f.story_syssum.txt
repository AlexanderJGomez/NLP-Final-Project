(CNN)A runway at New York's LaGuardia Airport reopened Friday morning, a day after a Delta Air Lines plane skidded off it before halting near the icy waters of Flushing Bay.
Delta Flight 1086 briefly circled New York due to issues with snow and ice before touching down shortly after 11 a.m. Thursday, passenger Jared Faellaci told CNN.
Still, with help from first responders, everyone was able to get off and onto buses that took them to LaGuardia's Delta terminal.
Faellaci said he was thankful for the plane's crew, first responders and God that it wasn't much worse.
Before touching down, the plane's pilot said weather problems could cause a delay.
"There were people that were calm, there were people that were praying, there were people that obviously were frantic, there were people that were crying," Faellaci said.
The Port Authority chief said plows had cleared the runway minutes before Flight 1086 touched down and that two other landing pilots had reported "good braking" action on Runway 13.
Passengers spent a few minutes standing in the snow -- carrying little more than their wallets and phones -- before buses took them into the warmth and comfort of the terminal.
