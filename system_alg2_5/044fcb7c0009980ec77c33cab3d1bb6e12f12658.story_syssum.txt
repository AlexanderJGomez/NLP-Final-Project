(CNN) -- Three years ago, I was just another American working mom when a famous Chinese publisher, CITIC Press, contacted me to write a book for China's single ladies.
Many Chinese women now are well-educated -- in fact, Businessweek reported that U.S. business school enrollment is driven by women from China.
They don't want a traditional Chinese marriage based on responsibility.
In short, Chinese women today want what all women want -- great careers, true love, and maybe, a child who's happy and successful (most Chinese women are still restricted to having one child under government policy).
Concubine culture lives on, whereby mistresses are an acceptable and even expected accoutrement for men in power.
But in a culture where women always have been second-class, laws will change only when enough women recognize their own selves and say "I'm not gonna take it anymore!"
We're all making culture now.
