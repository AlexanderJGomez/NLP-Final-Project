Lula, 66, will be treated at Sao Paulo's Syrian-Lebanese Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman Mirtes Bogea.
He noted that former first lady Marisa Leticia has been with Lula ever since he came to the hospital for a check-up on Friday.
Raul Cutait, one of the doctors treating the former president told Rede Record TV that Lula appears well.
"I am sure the same thing will happen to President Lula."
Presidents, however, are barred from running for a third consecutive term.
