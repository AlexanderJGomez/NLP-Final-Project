A plea deal so generous that the abuser's arrest record will be expunged -- totally clean, as if the whole thing had never happened -- if he receives some counseling in the next few months.
The woman identified as Kelli Fuller said her drunk husband was assaulting her.
About a minute into the call, as dispatchers summon help, Kelli Fuller is heard saying "I hate you, I hate you."
Then, Fuller will have to undergo a once-a-week family and domestic violence program for 24 weeks.
As Fuller put it, "I also look forward to ... returning to full, active status in the Middle District of Alabama."
The parallels between the Rice and Fuller cases extend further.
"This incident has been very embarrassing to me, my family, friends and the court," he said in his statement, "I deeply regret this incident and look forward to working to resolve these difficulties with my family, where they should be resolved."
When husbands beat up their wives, that is not a matter that should be resolved within the family.
Whether the Rices and Fullers stay married is their business; but whether Ray Rice and Judge Mark Fuller committed crimes should be a question for prosecutors, and ultimately, juries to decide.
All the rest of us can do is hope that the next prominent man who beats up his wife doesn't get off as easy.
