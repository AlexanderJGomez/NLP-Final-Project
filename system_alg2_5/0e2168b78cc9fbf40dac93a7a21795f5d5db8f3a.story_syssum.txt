That's how Utah County Sheriff Jim Tracy described a high-speed, bullet-riddled rampage that went on for 50 miles across two counties, until officers were able to corner a suspect.
Cory Wride, a deputy who had been on the force for 19 years.
Wride called in a "motorist assist" when he decided to pull off the road to aid what he thought was a disabled vehicle, Tracy said.
The suspect shot Wride, while he was still in his squad car, with what "appears to be a high-powered rifle," Tracy said.
Seconds later, the officer was shot in his vehicle, wounded in the head, Tracy said.
When deputies caught up with him, the man fired at them, critically wounding yet another deputy, the sheriff's office said.
Wride's killing to his family.
