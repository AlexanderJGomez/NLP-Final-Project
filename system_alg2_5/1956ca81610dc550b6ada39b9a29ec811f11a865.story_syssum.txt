Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- A dozen more people have died during ongoing sectarian violence in Myanmar's western state of Rakhine, bringing the death toll from the unrest to 62, a local official said Wednesday.
Violence between Buddhists and Muslims then spread across the northern part of the state, resulting in the destruction of thousands of homes and the deaths of about 50 people, according to the government.
The challenge for the authorities and international aid groups is supporting the thousands of people driven from their homes by the violence.
