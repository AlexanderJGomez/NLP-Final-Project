So says a new report, which estimates that the richest 1% will have as much wealth as the other 99% combined by next year.
"Do we really want to live in a world where the 1% own more than the rest of us combined?"
"Of the remaining 52% of global wealth,  46%  is owned by the rest of the richest fifth of the world's population," the report says.
Meanwhile, the "global elite" members had an average wealth of $2.7 million each last year, it says.
