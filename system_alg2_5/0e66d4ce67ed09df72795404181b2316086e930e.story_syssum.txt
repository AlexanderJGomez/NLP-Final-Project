(CNN) -- Hours after being released from jail, a man walked through an emergency door at San Diego International Airport, onto the tarmac and sat down on a United Express plane Tuesday, according to San Diego authorities.
"They said, 'What is your count?'
The passengers got off the plane and their luggage was searched.
"The guy did breach security, but he was caught," Bolduc said.
