(CNN) -- The family of Marlise Munoz has long said the pregnant Texas woman was brain dead, but now it has the medical records to confirm it, lawyers said Friday.
Erick Munoz filed an emergency motion as well as a complaint against John Peter Smith Hospital, both with the same goal: to have the hospital disconnect the machines so that her family can take her body and give her a proper burial.
The hospital referred requests for comment to the Tarrant County District Attorney's Office, which said it will defend the medical facility against the lawsuit.
Lynne Machado, Marlise Munoz's mother, said Tuesday the family is not talking about the case but said she and her husband, Ernest, agree with Erick Munoz that their daughter would want to be removed from the machines.
Soon after that, she was taken to John Peter Smith Hospital, where Erick Munoz says he was told that his wife "was for all purposes brain dead."
But just seeing that things look well isn't the same as saying that things will be well," he told CNN.
"And so I don't see how we can use a provision of the law that talks about treating or not treating a patient in a case where we really don't have a patient."
