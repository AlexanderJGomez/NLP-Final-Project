(CNN) -- Ukraine's imprisoned opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko accuses the country's president of running a "mafia" government in a video smuggled out of her prison by her lawyer, the lawyer told CNN Sunday.
She goes on to attack President Viktor Yanukovych ahead of parliamentary elections due on October 28.
The last video of the opposition leader showed her bed-ridden in Kharkiv prison during a hunger strike in December 2011.
After the video surfaced on Friday, the Ukrainian Prison Service quickly posted their own video of the country's former leader.
At the United Nations General Assemby in New York last week, President Viktor Yanukovych did not make any mention of Tymoshenko's imprisonment.
