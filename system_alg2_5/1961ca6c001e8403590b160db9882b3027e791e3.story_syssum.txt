WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A lawsuit filed in California against Kellogg, Brown and Root on Wednesday alleges the company and its subcontractor were involved in a human trafficking plan that forced Nepali men to work against their will in Iraq.
"KBR has not yet seen the lawsuit so it is premature for us to comment at this time.
Twelve of the Nepali men were taken by the insurgents and later killed.
Gurung and the families of the 12 men who were killed have brought the lawsuit.
"The primary finding concluded that the U.S. Government had no jurisdiction over the persons, offenses, or circumstances that resulted in the Nepalese deaths," according to the final report.
