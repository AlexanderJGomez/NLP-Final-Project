Some analysts say the developments make Obama's "doctrine" more clear than ever.
"Barack Obama has been a lethal president," says Fawaz Gerges of the London School of Economics and Political Science.
"The Obama Doctrine, when it comes to al Qaeda and its extremist allies, is really a kill strategy," Gerges says.
He and Brannen say they believe Obama was relieved when a Russian offer took hold.
"In the sense that the word has typically been used to describe a president's vision for managing national security challenges around the world, I don't think Obama has a doctrine," says Pletka, who identifies herself as conservative.
No doctrine?
"Every American foreign policy 'doctrine' but one was formulated during the Cold War, for a bipolar world, when American policy toward one country -- the Soviet Union -- dominated all U.S. strategy and was the defining aspect of global affairs.
"Beyond al Qaeda, there is no Obama Doctrine," he says.
During a recent speech to the U.N. General Assembly, Obama did not mention East Asia except for a single reference to China in regard to Iran, Bremmer says.
