"The board will conduct its meeting in an atmosphere of prayer, contemplation and dialogue and will develop a plan to involve LCWR membership in similar processes," the group said in a statement.
The Vatican report, made public by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the doctrinal assessment began in part because of the group's dissent on the Holy See's teaching on the ordination of women and human sexuality.
The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops is providing support to Sartain, and the LCWR isn't expected to publicly address the Vatican report until after this week's meeting, said Mary Ann Walsh, spokeswoman for the bishops' conference.
"They're saying we're silent on some issues.
The American nuns' group could do one of three options this week: it could go along with everything the Vatican is saying; it could offer to work and negotiate with the Vatican but say "let's talk"; or it could say "we're not going to play ball and we're going to walk away," Allen said.
"Some of them don't want to spend the last 10 years of their life engaged in negotiations with the Vatican," Allen said.
For Campbell, the Vatican report doesn't pose a crisis of conscience.
It's not an issue of conscience.
"We're open to the Holy Spirit and to let the group wisdom lead us, so I have no idea" on whether on a position will be taken by the order, Campbell said.
