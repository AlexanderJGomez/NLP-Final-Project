Fink told a congressional hearing that new federal regulations would prevent such a video and conference from occurring today.
"That is her money, the one who makes $35,000, that's her," he told Fink.
Despite the public displays of outrage by legislators, Issa and Cummings conceded that such wasteful IRS spending on conferences and travel no longer occurred due to government reforms.
In his report on the conference spending made public on Tuesday, Treasury Inspector General J. Russell George said the IRS spent taxpayer dollars on everything from event planners' commissions to speakers' fees to guest prizes to parody videos.
Fink said the conference provided valuable training for new managers at the time, despite what he called inappropriate spending.
He wondered out loud how many IRS workers involved in the improper targeting could have benefited from better training and more staff paid for by the money spent instead on the Anaheim conference.
On the targeting issue, Werfel said the agency and the inspector general would soon be providing additional information on groups seeking tax-exempt status that came under extra scrutiny.
Republicans contend the targeting was political discrimination, but the report blamed poor management in dealing with unclear regulations and an increased workload rather than a political motivation.
