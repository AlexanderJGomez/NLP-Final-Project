(CNN) -- American actor David Carradine has been found dead, hanging by a nylon rope in a hotel room closet in Bangkok, Thailand, according to a Thai police official.
Carradine's friends and personal managers said they were in "complete shock" and brushed aside suggestions that Carradine might have taken his own life.
Carradine was in Bangkok for filming of the movie "Stretch," being produced by a United Kingdom-based company, Smith said.
"I'm in shock," he said.
"He was clearly an actor who followed his own path," said Leah Rozen, movie critic for People magazine.
He was the son of actor John Carradine, a character actor who appeared in hundreds of films, plays and television episodes.
The site also includes an "Art Bio" in which the actor opens up about his life.
