The family behind  A&E's "Duck Dynasty" rallied around its patriarch Thursday, one day after the network suspended Phil Robertson over controversial remarks he made about gays and blacks in a magazine interview.
In the January issue of GQ, Robertson said homosexuality is a sin and puts it in the same category as bestiality and promiscuity.
That's just me.
It's just not logical," he's quoted as saying.
"We are extremely disappointed to have read Phil Robertson's comments in GQ, which are based on his own personal beliefs and are not reflected in the series Duck Dynasty," the network said in a statement Wednesday.
The network has placed Phil under hiatus from filming indefinitely."

"Mr. Robertson claims that, from what he saw, African Americans were happier under Jim Crow.
But by early Thursday night, more than 70,000 people had signed a change.org petition calling for A&E to bring Robertson back.
Just because homosexuals do not agree, does not mean Mr. Robertson needs to be suspended."
"Duck Dynasty" follows a Louisiana bayou family that has "made a fortune on duck calls," as A&E puts it.
