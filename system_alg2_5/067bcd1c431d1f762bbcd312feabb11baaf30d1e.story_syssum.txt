Sean Penn plays San Francisco City Supervisor Harvey Milk in "Milk," directed by Gus Van Sant.
Civic elections might seem like small beer, but the persecution that compelled Milk to run for office is no trivial matter.
Ironically, the devoutly "normal" White is the one who is truly messed up.
(She may not know it, but Anita Bryant has a co-starring role in this movie.)
"Milk" may be a little too homogenized for some tastes.
But it's not just a single-issue movie.
