From the time I married my husband when my stepdaughter was only 4 years old, I always felt she viewed me as his wife rather than as a stepmother.
Also, I hate pretense, and I felt that he was pressuring me to accept his view of our happy family unit.
Thankfully, my feelings have changed and, now I am in a better place where I accept and understand why my stepdaughter will not reach out to me on Mother's Day.
No matter how hard I tried to get close to her, I felt like a distant relative.
I wondered if my experience was unique or similar to other stepmothers so I started a website (stepsforstepmothers.com) which featured an online chat room and a questionnaire for stepmothers to fill out.
More important, I received the necessary support from women sharing similar experiences.
These women also helped me understand that my desire to be acknowledged by my stepdaughter on Mother's Day was not unreasonable, but it might be too much for her to give me.
After doing some research, I also learned that only 20% of stepchildren feel close to their stepmothers.
While my husband used to encourage my stepdaughter to wish me a Happy Mother's Day, she is an adult, and he can't control her actions.
What a relief to know that I can be happy even if every aspect of my life isn't perfect.
I hope my experiences can help other stepmothers have a more enjoyable Mother's Day.
