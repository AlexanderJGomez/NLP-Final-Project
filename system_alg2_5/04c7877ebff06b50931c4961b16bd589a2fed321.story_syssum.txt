April Orsoco with the Reeves County Sheriff's Office said the office was notified by the prison about 4 p.m. Sunday that "they got it under control."
With one of three buildings at the detention center damaged extensively in the rioting, "the warden is trying to figure out where [the prison] can house the inmates," Orsoco said.
As many as 2,000 inmates from two of the center's three buildings began fighting in the prison yard about 4:30 p.m. Saturday, according to the sheriff's office.
