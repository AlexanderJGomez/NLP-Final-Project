New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- In September of 2005, no one could have anticipated what we saw in New Orleans last week.

One of the brightest spots in post-Katrina New Orleans has been in education.

And in 2018, New Orleans' tricentenary will focus not only on the founding of New Orleans but also its successful rebirth 300 years later.
And as of late, it looks like it will be preserved.
New Orleans is not just coming back and not just on its way back.
New Orleans is storming back.
