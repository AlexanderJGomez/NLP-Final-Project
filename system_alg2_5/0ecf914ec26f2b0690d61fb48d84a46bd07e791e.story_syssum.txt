In May, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Coast Guard directed BP to use a less toxic dispersant than the one it was putting into the Gulf, Corexit 9500.
Scientists say questions remain about the effects of dispersants, in particular the more subtle consequences.
"But what's much more relevant in predicting the full effects of the use of dispersants and dispersed oil are the more subtle effects -- that are sublethal, that may affect growth and reproduction."
In fact, there are conflicting data," said Denison.
Another unknown is whether the chemical constituents of oil are more or less likely to persist in the food chain.
I don't think we have enough data to answer those questions very well, and I'm hoping that this tragedy will spur us to answer those questions so we'll have enough information next time."
