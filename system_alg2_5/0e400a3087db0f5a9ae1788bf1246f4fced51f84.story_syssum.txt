That's right -- last week, for the second known time, surgeons Twittered a surgery by using social-networking site Twitter to give short real-time updates about the procedure.

Dr. Craig Rogers, the lead surgeon in the Henry Ford surgery, said the impetus for his Twittering was to let people know that a tumor can be removed without taking the entire kidney.
"It brings us closer together and makes us more engaged."
As time goes by and the younger generation moves into medicine, expect even more sharing online of private medical procedures, Parks says.
Twitter users -- those "tweeple" -- who kept up with the Henry Ford procedure online got to share some medical drama in real time.
Then came another challenge: In a surgery like this one, doctors have to restrict blood flow to the kidney with clamps while they remove the tumor.
Approximately 25 minutes later, Laungani shared his relief with all of Twitterville: "Tumor is excised, bleeding is controlled, we are about to come off clamp," he wrote.
"Thank you for joining us today."
