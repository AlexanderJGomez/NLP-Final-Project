Istanbul (CNN) -- Thousands of mourners gathered Thursday for the second mass funeral in two days after a 22-year-old Turkish man died from a gunshot wound.
After burying his son, Berkin's father took to the airwaves to denounce Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
He went on to criticize Erdogan for refusing to discuss the death of his son or of six Turkish men who have died since anti-government protests erupted in May 2013.
Turkey's Prime Minister has not discussed Berkin's death in lengthy television interviews and at daily political rallies.
