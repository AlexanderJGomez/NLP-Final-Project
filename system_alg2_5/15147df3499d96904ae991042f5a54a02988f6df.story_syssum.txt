Chelsea is in the middle of a heroin epidemic.
The demand for heroin is reaching unprecedented proportions -- fueled in part by a growing number of people who get hooked on prescription painkillers and soon need a cheaper way to get high.
They search the informant to make sure there is no pocketed  heroin or cash, and have the person hand over the drugs.
Betz and his team will use the information to build a case against the dealers and secure search warrants and arrest warrants.
But Betz says Chelsea is not so different from any other town when it comes to drugs.
Betz says small cities often have a tougher battle against drugs than bigger cities because of lower income and resources.
What's more, much of the drug problem in Chelsea doesn't come from inside Chelsea, Betz says.
They come here, and we'll ask them how did you end up here from a suburb of million-dollar homes, and they'll say they got hooked on opiates, they ran out of money, they're not available there like they are here," says Betz, "The easiest way to look at it is, drugs have no borders."
Betz and team have had a relatively successful night making a controlled buy with their informant and gaining information to build a case against suspected heroin dealers.
