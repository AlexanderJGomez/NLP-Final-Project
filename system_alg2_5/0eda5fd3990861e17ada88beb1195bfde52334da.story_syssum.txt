Lt. John Gourley ordered the road reopened when conditions improved on Interstate 75 because he considered it dangerous not to, he told investigators, according to a state report released Thursday.
"I'm concerned that another cloud might roll through and then we got to go through all this again," said Simmons, according to the report.
After Gourley reopened the highway, there were not adequate resources dedicated to monitor subsequent road conditions, the report found.
Lidiane Carmo, 15, was injured and lost most of her family in the I-75 pileup.
