Alain Tremblay of the New Brunswick Royal Canadian Mounted Police said Wednesday.
The apartment was the home of Jean-Claude Savoie, a family friend whose Campbellton, New Brunswick pet store was downstairs.
The snake was found in the same room as the boys, Tremblay said.
It was euthanized.
The Humane Society documents 17 people who have died in incidents in the United States related to the snakes since 1978, 12 of them since 1990.
