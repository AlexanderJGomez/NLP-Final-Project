But across the channel there is one Briton at the forefront of his sport who, through a series of peerless performances, is in line to become the UK's first Tour de France winner.
"It is Bradley Wiggins' Tour de France to lose," according to former British cyclist and now commentator Paul Sherwen, who made his debut in the race in 1978.
"There's a long way to go," Sherwen told CNN ahead of Thursday's 10th stage.
And the team that Wiggins cycles for -- The Sky Procycling team -- is now the dominant force at the Tour, having been established in the wake of Team GB's success at the 2008 Olympics.
British Cycling performance director Dave Brailsford formed the country's first professional team in 2009 and Sky Procycling made its Tour de France debut in 2010.
"Now kids riding their bikes in England can dream of getting into a professional team and getting into the Tour de France.
A historic win in France could provide Wiggins, British cycling and the nation's sports fans with a timely boost ahead of London's third Olympic Games.
"If Bradley could win the Tour de France this year it would be absolutely huge," said Sherwen.
