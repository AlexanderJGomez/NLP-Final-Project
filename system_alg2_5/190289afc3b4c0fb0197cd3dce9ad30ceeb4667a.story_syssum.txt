Kellen Winslow recently had a second staph infection and has accused his team of covering it up.
The Browns said in a statement Saturday that the team and Winslow had worked through their differences, and that the team looked forward to his return.
Hospitals have long been known to be hot spots for transmitting staph, but recently cases have cropped up in other community settings.
Most MRSA infections acquired in community settings present themselves as sores or boils and often appear red, swollen, painful or with drainage such as pus, the CDC says.
Athletes often get cuts and abrasions; MRSA can enter uncovered skin breaks and cause infection.
MRSA has been around in hospital settings since the 1970s, but community-associated MRSA was born in the late 1990s, and is now widespread in the community, said CDC spokesperson Nicole Coffin.
Larson said she is not directly familiar with Winslow's situation but understands the dilemma that a team would face if a player contracted a staph infection.
On Thursday, the Brown's General Manager Phil Savage said the team did not alert players to Winslow's staph infection partly because of the health privacy laws and partly because the team was in "game mode" when Winslow had a confirmed diagnosis.
Winslow said in a statement released through his publicist, Denise White of EAG Sports Management, that he had been discouraged from making the issue public.
An NFL representative said the league has no statement on the issue.
