Ahead, a 20-strong scrambling chain of fellow volcano boarders heading to the summit is a shock of orange against the dark basalt -- we're all donned in convict-style luminous jump suits.
Jessie reminds us that The Black Hill doesn't just appear menacing, it really is.
"To our knowledge, volcano boarding is only possible on Cerro Negro," says Timothy Brauning of the Bigfoot tour company, which leads volcano boarding trips.

Tours run most days, year round, weather permitting.
