Organizers of the Volvo Ocean Race -- the prestigious round-the-world sailing competition -- seem to think so, and are gearing up for the first all-female team in over a decade.
The all-women team will be allowed three more sailors than their male counterparts, in their bid to win one of the toughest sporting competitions in the world.

"I don't think I'll ever forget that moment," Lush told CNN.
A female team in this race should be the norm, not something unusual."
