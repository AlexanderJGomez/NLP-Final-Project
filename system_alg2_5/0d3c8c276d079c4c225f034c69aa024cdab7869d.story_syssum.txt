(CNN)Andrew Getty, one of the heirs to billions of oil money, appears to have died of natural causes, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman said.
Gordon Getty is one of three living sons of J. Paul Getty, the oil baron who was thought to be the richest man in the world at the time of his death in 1976.
Gordon Getty spearheaded the controversial sale of Getty to Texaco for $10 billion in 1984.
"A rise in my blood pressure places me in grave risk of substantial and irreparable injury or death," he wrote in the petition.
