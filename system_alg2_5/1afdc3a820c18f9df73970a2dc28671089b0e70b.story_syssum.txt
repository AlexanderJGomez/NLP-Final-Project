(CNN) -- The Department of Homeland Security has ordered U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents to verify, "effective immediately," that every foreign student who wants to enter the United States has a valid student visa, a U.S. government official told CNN on Friday.
They were already in federal custody on suspicion of violating the terms of their student visas when they were charged in the bombings case.
The court also heard that Tazhayakov went to Kazakhstan in December 2012 and was allowed to return to the United States on January 20, despite the apparent lapse in his visa status, the same government official said.
"It's surprising that the administration isn't already verifying that any student coming into the country has a valid student visa," Grassley said.
