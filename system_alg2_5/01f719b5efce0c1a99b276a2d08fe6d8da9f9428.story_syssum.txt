The symptoms were slow to develop, so Lidsky came to terms early with the idea of losing his vision.
" he said.
Becoming a Supreme Court law clerk, he said, was a lifelong dream.
"You could tell things were getting worse," Ambro said.
After his clerkship came a stint in the Justice Department's Civil Division, where he argued about a dozen cases in federal courts.
With the recommendations of Ambro and others, Lidsky applied four times to be a Supreme Court law clerk but was rejected.
"I have no doubt Justice O'Connor will keep me very busy," Lidsky said.
Lidsky will have to scale back involvement in his foundation, Hope for Vision, which he created with his wife, Dorothy, and some friends to raise awareness of blinding diseases.
"In 10 or 15 years, I would bet he will be a man still on your radar screen," Ambro predicts.
