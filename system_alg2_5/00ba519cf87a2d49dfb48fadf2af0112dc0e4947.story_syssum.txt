Even as Google's new Nexus 7 challenges the Kindle Fire for dominance in the small-tablet category, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos on Thursday introduced a new, 8.9-inch Kindle Fire HD.
The 16GB version of the Fire comes in at $299, or $200 less than the comparable iPad.
(There's speculation the iPhone 5 will have a larger screen).
Until now, the Kindle Fire has been a WiFi-only device, and some of its new models remain that way.
But that price gets you 250 MB of data per month -- not a lot for a device designed in large part to stream movies and other media.
When the first iPad launched, AT&T offered data plans starting at $15 per month, or $180 per year, for 250 megabytes of data.
There are more than 225,000 apps designed specifically for the iPad.
But while the Kindle Fire runs a modified version of Google's Android operating system, it only runs apps available from Amazon.
