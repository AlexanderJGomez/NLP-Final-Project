(CNN) -- Maurice Sendak, author of the classic children's book "Where the Wild Things Are," has died, a spokeswoman for HarperCollins Publishers said Tuesday.
The book stirred controversy when it was first published in 1963.
"Where the Wild Things Are" won the Caldecott Medal in 1964, considered the most prestigious award for illustrated children's books.
"I don't know how to do a children's book.
I don't even know what a children's book is.
In 1980, Sendak began designing sets and costumes for opera and ballet.
