Casablanca, Morocco (CNN) -- Morocco's Facebook youth movement Fevrier 20 has called on civil society groups the length of the country to participate in a nationwide demonstration Sunday.
"We call to demonstrate peacefully in all the towns to put an end to corruption, to injustice and for a real democracy in our country," explained one youth on a video posted on the movement's Facebook page.
Yet few Moroccans are so upbeat about the new constitution, as there seems to be little in it to give hope to many who want concrete initiatives to reduce corruption.
Judges in Morocco are appointed by the justice minister and the king in theory but in reality are installed by their own political parties, which in turn advise them on how to conclude cases.
The court's report focused on graft in the Health Ministry, the National Investment and Development Fund and several local mayors.
"We want a new constitution, which will define exactly what the new rules and regulations are in place to stop corruption," explained Said Benjebli, one of the movement's architects who edits the main Facebook page.
