Santa Cruz, California (CNN) -- The arrest of Alix Catherine Tichelman in the death of a Google executive has shed a new light on the so-called sugar daddy websites where women are paid, sometimes thousands of dollars a month, by older suitors for their company.
"The women who are on the site, or as we call them 'sugar babies,' are looking for men who can provide financial assistance for them," said Angela Jacob Bermudo with Seeking Arrangement.
"The way I see the allowance isn't anything more than enriching and empowering my life with something they have a lot of, their wealth," she said.
Critics say the sugar daddy sites are nothing but fronts for prostitution, one of the crimes Tichelman has been charged with.
"Seeking Arrangement is in no way or form a prostitution or escorting service," Bermudo said, instead calling it a dating website.
"Just like traditional relationships you don't sign up and sex isn't part of the arrangement," Bermudo said.
In the case of Tichelman, authorities say she had an "ongoing prostitution relationship" with Hayes.
"Rather than provide first aid or call 911, Ms. Tichelman proceeds to gather her belongings including the heroin and needles," the police statement reads, adding that Tichelman stepped over Hayes' body several times.
Now authorities are taking a new look at that death "to make sure there's nothing (else) to it," he said.
