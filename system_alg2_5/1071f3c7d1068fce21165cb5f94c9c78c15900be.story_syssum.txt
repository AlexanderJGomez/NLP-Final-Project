(CNN) -- The Justice Department charged Toyota with wire fraud on Wednesday as part of a settlement with prosecutors that will require the auto giant to pay $1.2 billion for admittedly misleading consumers and the government over unintended acceleration.
Under the agreement, the Justice Department will defer the criminal charge for three years, during which Toyota will submit to government monitoring.
"The disregard Toyota had for the safety of the public is outrageous.
"In the more than four years since these recalls, we have gone back to basics at Toyota to put our customers first," he said.
The Transportation Department previously leveled stiff fines against Toyota for not promptly addressing safety problems related to unintended acceleration.
