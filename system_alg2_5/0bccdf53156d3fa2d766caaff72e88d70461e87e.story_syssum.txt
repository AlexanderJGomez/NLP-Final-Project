But these wrist gadgets are nothing new.
Microsoft created a software platform called SPOT that delivered news updates to watches via FM radio waves for $59 a year.
No way.
It seems like the public is finally ready to accept smartwatches the way they accepted Apple's iPad.
It can connect to your Android phone or iPhone via Bluetooth and display incoming text messages and other notifications.
We weren't ready for smartwatches before, but now that smartphones are so ingrained in our lives, Apple and others appear smart to give wearable tech another chance.
