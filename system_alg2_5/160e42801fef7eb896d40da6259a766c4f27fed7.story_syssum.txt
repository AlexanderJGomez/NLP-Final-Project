(CNN) -- With her glamorous looks and exceptional talent, Nigerian movie star Genevieve Nnaji is one of Africa's most successful actresses.
GN: Nigeria is a unique and a peculiar country, and as the people, we are too.
Nigerians on the whole are very confident people.
We do have that bond and I think it has to do with our background and how we are raised....I would never live anywhere else to be honest, no.
GN: I don't think I ever realized that, for a long time I kept thinking, OK, this is just temporary, definitely I'm going to go back to school and read law, English or something that I wanted to do.
CNN: You have been referred to as the African Julia Roberts.
So it's an honor to be honest but I think it's probably the vein we have on the forehead, I think that's what we have in common.
