In a 55-minute video released less than two weeks ago, the current leader of al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, promised to "raise the flag of Jihad" and to spread Islamic rule across the South Asia by operating in India, Bangladesh and Myanmar, under the new rubric "Qaeda al-Jihad."
As to why the Indian subcontinent has been declared as the new home for al Qaeda, Zawahiri cites the aim of rescuing Muslims from oppression and injustice in the region as the group's main driving force.
For one, being primarily focused on fighting a distant enemy -- the West -- al Qaeda has been unable to evolve beyond being a terrorist organization, whilst ISIS has moved from being an al Qaeda offshoot to progressing into a fully-fledged state -- or at least that is how they and their fellow jihadists view things.
More worryingly, from al Qaeda's perspective, is the fact ISIS seems to be attracting smaller splinter groups previously viewed as being in al Qaeda's domain of influence.
In all likelihood, al Qaeda's attempts to branch into India and Bangladesh will fail.
In fact, al-Zawahiri is illustrating his cultural naivety by making this announcement and assuming that these countries are just like Pakistan.
