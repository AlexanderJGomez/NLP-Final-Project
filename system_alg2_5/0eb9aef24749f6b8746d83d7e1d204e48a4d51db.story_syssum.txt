On Monday, security forces killed six people during an ongoing crackdown in the province of Homs, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition group.
The government has maintained it is targeting armed terrorists.
The foreign minister "stressed that the public hospitals in Syria are constantly ready and provide the required medical services for all the citizens," the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported Monday.
On Sunday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said four people were killed in Idlib province and three others were killed in the village of Tahtaiya by security forces pursuing wanted activists.
CNN cannot independently confirm either the opposition or government claims.
The United Nations has reported more than 2,200 people killed in Syria since February, including more than 350 people since security forces stepped up operations against demonstrators during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
