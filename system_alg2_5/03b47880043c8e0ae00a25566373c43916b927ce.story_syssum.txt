Watch the writers strike in 1988 Â»
"Once another medium, particularly cable, gets a chance to draw viewers away, they don't come back, and that wasn't the case in 1988," TV historian Tim Brooks told the trade publication Multichannel News.
"Traditional media needs the exposure on the talk shows, but what they really need is to go where the audience is migrating to, and that is the Internet," Jerry Del Colliano, a University of Southern California music-industry professor, told The Associated Press.)
If the writers get a cut of Web revenues -- an unknown value since nobody knows what Web syndication is worth -- the value of broadcast and cable syndication could decline.
But the earlier strike -- which began March 7 of that year, lasted 22 weeks, postponed the beginning of the 1988-89 TV season and cost an estimated $500 million -- gave rise to a group of low-budgeted shows, including "America's Most Wanted," "Cops" and "America's Favorite Home Videos," which became the forerunners of the reality show trend.
So there's a lot at stake.
