Opinions expressed in the rapid-fire Twitter echo chamber, particularly in response to political news, are often at odds with the general public's.
"Overall, the reaction to political events on Twitter reflects a combination of the unique profile of active Twitter users and the extent to which events engage different communities and draw the comments of active users," the report reads.
On Twitter, a full 77% of tweets about his win were positive and only 23% negative.
In a 2012 survey, half of adults who said they posted news on Twitter were younger than 30, compared with 23% of all adults.
But only 13% of the tweets about it echoed that opinion.
There were more negative than positive comments about Obama and Romney on Twitter.
The negative comments about Obama bounced back and forth between 40% to 50% throughout the campaign, while positives went up to about 30% and down into the teens.
In the Pew's 2012 news consumption survey, just 13% of adults said they ever use Twitter or read Twitter messages.
