The Late-1980s pop culture relic "21 Jump Street" was a primo specimen of a TV police procedural with a catchy hook: A team of fresh-faced cops work undercover as high school kids, reporting back to their tough/earnest boss at the address listed above.
It jokes about high school but is also a sensitive sociological study of those crucial years.
On the surface, "21 Jump Street" follows the crime-fighting antics of odd-couple cop partners Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum).
And by the way they get to bust a drug ring fronted by a smart and popular guy played with oddball charisma by Dave Franco.
Underneath, "21 Jump Street" is a riot of risks that pay off, the biggest of which might be handing Tatum funny business.
Explaining why he's assigning Schmidt and Jenko to shutting down the school drug ring after the death of one student, the captain tells it true: ''This kid is white, so people actually give a s---.''
