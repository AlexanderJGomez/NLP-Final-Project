New Orleans (CNN) -- When Kenneth Purcell emerged from his New Orleans home after Hurricane Isaac churned through the city in August, he couldn't believe what he saw.
The move back to New Orleans caused him to lose almost all of his employees in New York and forced him to establish a new staff.
"The new people that I hired were here because they wanted to be," Purcell said.
"I've practiced in New Orleans for almost 40 years and I'm more excited about the future of the city today, than I ever have been," said Marcel Wisznia, owner of Wisznia Architecture and Development and a veteran entrepreneur.
He said he's observed a progression of new startups in the city in recent years -- and the catalyst for this entrepreneurial spark was Hurricane Katrina.
Boyd, a Louisiana native, asked city business insiders whether New Orleans could be a viable home for his company.
Boyd said.
"As companies start to scale, they need high-level management to help grow," said Tim Williamson, co-founder of the Idea Village, a nonprofit that nurtures New Orleans entrepreneurs.
On the surface, Williamson said, New Orleans would seem to be at a competitive disadvantage compared to other cities.
Entrepreneurs here say that community engagement is what makes New Orleans different.
And so as a community, business leaders here are very committed to each other's success, because it's all part of New Orleans redefining itself."
