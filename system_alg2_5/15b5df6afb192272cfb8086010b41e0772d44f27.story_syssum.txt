Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott promptly announced the state will appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.
The panel of judges for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia also said it was ruling only on the Texas law, and not issuing a statement about other state voting laws.
Abbott, meanwhile, said Texas will immediately take the case to the nation's highest court, where "we are confident we will prevail."
"Chalk up another victory for fraud," said Gov.
Earlier this month, a state court in Pennsylvania approved a voter ID law requiring photo identification at the polls.
