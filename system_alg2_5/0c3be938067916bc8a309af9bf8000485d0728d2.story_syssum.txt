Images from the Jewish Museum of Belgium show the gunman behind Saturday's deadly attack approaching the building, opening fire, and walking away.
Two of those killed in Saturday's attack are Israeli and the third is French, Van Wymersch said.
A person who was detained Saturday soon after the shooting is considered a witness and not a suspect, Van Wymersch added.
Van Wymersch said it was too early to determine whether the attack was an act of terrorism or motivated by anti-Semitism.
But there is concern that the killer could strike again, the official said, and that authorities could be dealing with a "Mohammed Merah" type of killer.
The official said the killer shot the Israeli couple first in the museum entryway with one of his weapons.
The official stressed Belgian authorities are investigating all possible angles, including Islamist terrorism, neo-Nazi attack, and other categories.
She met with the police, Belgian Jewish community leaders and the president of the European Jewish Congress, Moshe Kantor, on Sunday to discuss the security arrangements, an Interior Ministry statement said.
"Attacks on Jewish targets in Europe do not exist in a vacuum, but are part and parcel of an overall climate of hate and incitement against Jewish communities," he said, according to the statement.
In neighboring France, two Jewish men were assaulted late Saturday as they were leaving a synagogue in Creteil, outside Paris, the French Interior Ministry said Sunday.
