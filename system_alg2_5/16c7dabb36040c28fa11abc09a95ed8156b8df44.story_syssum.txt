Vanuatu, Samoa and Tonga are this year's new entries to the list.
"After identifying about two dozen 'short list' performers, we turn to detailed case research, focusing on actions these governments have taken over the year to improve (or in some cases, weaken) practices and circumstances in the countries," says the report.
"One issue that plagues nearly every country on our list is a high level of gender-based violence," says Ethical Traveler.
"We encourage these countries -- Cabo Verde, Lithuania, Mauritius, Palau, Tonga and Uruguay -- to do whatever is necessary to improve conditions," says the report.
