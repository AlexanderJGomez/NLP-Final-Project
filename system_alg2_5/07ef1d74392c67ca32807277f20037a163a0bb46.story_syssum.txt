YANGON, Myanmar (CNN) -- Courts in Myanmar have sentenced a blogger, a poet and several dissidents to several years in jail for anti-regime activities, a court official told CNN Tuesday.
Irrawaddy said the members were each sentenced to 65 years in jail, but CNN could not independently confirm the figure.
Until then, demonstrations led by the monks -- who are highly respected in the predominantly Buddhist country -- had gone largely unchallenged by the military, which has ruled the country since the 1960s.
The action was informally dubbed the "Saffron Revolution" because of the maroon robes with saffron sashes that the monks wore.
