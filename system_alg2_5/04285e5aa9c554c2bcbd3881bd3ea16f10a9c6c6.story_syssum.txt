Wayne Nelson Corliss was arrested at his New Jersey apartment.
It was among items found in his apartment, along with five hard drives containing more than 1,000 images of child pornography, according to prosecutors.
Interpol posted six pictures of the suspect on its Web site.
Corliss is charged with producing child pornography, according to prosecutors.
The complaint alleges that the suspect's face is clearly shown and the background suggests the images were taken in Thailand.
In October, it disseminated pictures of another man whose face -- altered to disguise his identity -- appeared in more than 200 images of sex acts with children, thought to have been taken in Vietnam and Cambodia.
