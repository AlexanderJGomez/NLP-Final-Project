The mystery of who threw sulfuric acid into Filin's face in January has captivated Russians and kept Moscow detectives busy probing rivalries within Russia's renowned 240-year-old ballet company.
Two alleged co-conspirators have been detained: Alleged hit man Yuri Zarutsky -- a burly, bearded Russian who was previously convicted of beating someone to death -- and Andrey Lipatov, who allegedly drove the getaway car after Zarutksy's battery acid attack on Filin.
Tsiskaridze, incidentally, was also a contender for the artistic director job that Filin got.
RIA Novosti reported that before the attack, Filin suffered months of intimidation, including threatening phone calls.
Dmitrichenko, who studied Filin's schedule, called Lipatov and Zarutsky when he saw Filin leave the theater on the cold night of January 17, police said.
"I didn't see what happened there," Lipatov told them in a video released by police.
It may take at least six months for Filin to recover from the burns.
His colleagues are now working to ensure his artistic vision isn't lost.
