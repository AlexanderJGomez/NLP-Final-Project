He said the problems were arising as airlines set aside more desirable window and aisle seats for passengers who pay a premium, leaving those who do not pay with center-row seats, separated from other members of their party unless they have paid the surcharge.
"Offering preferred seats for sale to all Delta passengers means that we are offering different seat selection options to enable more passengers to travel in their seat of choice," she said.
Two U.S. airlines, Spirit and Allegiant, also charge passengers for carry-on baggage.
While gate staff would typically try to seat families together, removing aisle and window seats as options was making this impossible, said Hanni.
"If passengers were willing to pay higher fares at the beginning," he said, the problems could be avoided.
Many of those who traveled in groups were leisure travelers who tended to book their fares in advance, and should encounter few difficulties being seated together, she said.
