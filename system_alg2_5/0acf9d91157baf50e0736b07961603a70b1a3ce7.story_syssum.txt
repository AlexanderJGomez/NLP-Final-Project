Although a judge has found two Steubenville teenagers guilty of raping a 16-year-old girl in a case that showcased jaw-dropping examples of teenage alcohol use and tawdry text messaging -- all wrapped in allegations of a cover-up -- Ohio's attorney general said Monday it's now time for a grand jury to look at whether anyone else should be charged.
"We hope that from this something good can arise," she said.
The girls -- one 15, one 16, both from Steubenville -- were in a juvenile lockup Monday night, awaiting an appearance before a judge Tuesday morning, Jefferson County Sheriff Fred Abdalla said.
The grand jury will begin meeting around April 15 and could take "a number of days" to complete its work, DeWine said.
Lipps sentenced Mays to a minimum of two years in a juvenile correctional facility.
Both Mays and Richmond must undergo treatment and will have to register as sex offenders, Lipps ruled.
"She continues to be a victim and be victimized ... over and over," he said.
"But the attorney general had just left the building -- the judge was still in the building -- when I received messages that there's death threats already against the victim."
The case received widespread attention after a blogger who once lived in Steubenville uncovered some of the materials posted to social media sites.
Acknowledging the town's frustration, DeWine said Monday that it would be a mistake to focus on one small Ohio community, to think something unique in its culture is behind the incident.
"It's not.
DeWine said.
