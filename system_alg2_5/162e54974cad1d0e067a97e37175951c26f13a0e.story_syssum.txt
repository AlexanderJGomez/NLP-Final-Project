CNN's Kyra Phillips asked Fallon about his resignation and about U.S. policy regarding Iraq and Iran.
...
Fallon: What was important was not me.
Fallon: I don't believe for a second President Bush wants a war with Iran.
...
Phillips: So when talk of the third war came out, a war with Iran, the president didn't say to you, "This is what I want to do," and did you stand up and say, "No, sir.
Again, don't believe for a second that the president really wants to go to war with Iran.
Fallon: No, I don't believe so at all.
Are you?
A lot of the issues that became points of discussion to me were not really important items.
The important items were the people, what they're doing, how to get this job done, how to get the war ended and get our people home.
There's a very, very important military role here in providing stability and security in this country, but that's not going to be successful, as we know, without lots of other people playing a hand.
They want to have stability.
We want to have the majority of our people back and we want the war ended.
The right course of action is to continue to work with the Iraqis and let them take over the majority of the tasks for ensuring security for the country and have our people come out on a timetable that's appropriate to conditions on the ground.
