After dating for more than two years, Ferguson and his boyfriend, Justin Mikita, decided to take the next step.
Ferguson and Mitka started the Tie the Knot foundation.
Jesse Tyler Fergusson: I feel like when you tackle any subject with comedy, humor and wits, you're going to get a lot further than if you just give the dry facts of the cause.
But, in the context of our foundation, it felt like (it was) the right time to tell people.
So I just say "boyfriend."
CNN: A lot of boyfriends, and girlfriends in Maine, Maryland and Washington got some good news on Election Day when same-sex marriage was legalized in those states by popular vote.
I just feel like it shouldn't be up to the majority to vote on a minority's civil rights.
I feel like there's a fear that the definition of marriage will be changed.
They weren't going to change the meaning of going to the polls and putting the card in the ballot; they just wanted the right to vote.
Ferguson: I selfishly wanted to get involved in the fashion world anyway, but in a way that didn't feel like a huge undertaking.
Then Justin came up with the idea of Tie the Knot, which just perfectly marries those two ideas.
Ferguson: I mean it really is.
I've gotten engaged since meeting these people.
Ferguson: There's obviously some sense of protection because we know being (in) the media's eye how vulnerable that can be when you're going through something.
CNN: I can only imagine what a "Modern Family" gay wedding will be like.
I'm also really excited to be married.
Ferguson: Well, we're not going to be redefining the marriage ceremony.
I haven't been to the Catholic Church in years so I would feel really weird to try and bring in those traditions -- it's just not us.
And we both do.
But, yeah, we both really want kids very much.
