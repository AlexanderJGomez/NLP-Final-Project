The Lower Ninth Ward Health Clinic was clinic director Patricia Berryhill's home before Hurricane Katrina.
The clinic asks for a $25 "co-payment" but no one is turned away if they cannot afford it.
"So they come by, browse, and take whatever books they want free of charge."
A sign in the window making clear there are no narcotic drugs inside is a sign of the clinic's rough surroundings.
Overall, Tulane University geographer Richard Campanella says, the population of New Orleans stands at about 330,000 -- roughly 75 percent of its pre-Katrina level.
"My sense is the post-Katrina city we all wondered about 3½ years ago what would it look like -- that we are there now," Campanella said in an interview on the Tulane campus.
"Much of it has been the lack of political will on the part of our government entities," she said.
But Craft-Kerney says the clinic would not be in operation had it not been for the help of Mike Leavitt, the Bush secretary of health and human services.
After Katrina, she decided to move elsewhere in the city, but agreed to donate her former home as a clinic.
While she speaks highly of President Obama, she says she worries New Orleans and the Lower Ninth will be forgotten in the long list of major challenges facing his administration.
