Now, eight months later, her family is mourning again because they can't keep two SpongeBob Squarepants memorials at her gravesite.
So the family decided to spend $26,000 on two massive SpongeBob monuments at Walker's gravesite -- one in an Army uniform for Walker, and another in a Navy uniform to honor Kara, an IT specialist for the Navy.
Before the family ordered the SpongeBob memorials, it got the go-ahead from a cemetery representative, Deborah Walker said.
"It was just heartbreaking," Deborah Walker said.
Spring Grove said it is working with the Walkers to design a solution at the cemetery's expense "that will properly memorialize Kimberly."
