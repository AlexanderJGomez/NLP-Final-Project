The Jabra BT3030 can be purchased for around $39.99.
Of course like any stereo Bluetooth headset, the Jabra BT3030 requires a cell phone with the A2DP or stereo Bluetooth profile.
Also on the top is a tiny microphone.
The Jabra BT3030 comes with nice pair of ear buds that sit comfortably in the ear, but since it has a 3.5mm headset jack, you can use any headphones of your choosing.
When there's an incoming call during music playback, the music will pause and you will hear a ringing tone.
Call quality was mixed.
The Jabra BT3030 also comes with an optional clothing clip accessory, plus an AC adapter.
