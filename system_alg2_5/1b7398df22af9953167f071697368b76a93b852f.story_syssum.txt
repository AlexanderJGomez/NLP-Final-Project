Atlanta (CNN) -- Top officials from the Federal Aviation Administration and the air traffic controllers' union kicked off a cross-country tour of air traffic control facilities on Monday, two days after a seventh reported case this year of a controller falling asleep on the job.
This "will not be tolerated," he insisted.
Federal officials announced a series of new regulations Saturday aimed at preventing air traffic controllers from falling asleep while on duty.
On Saturday, the FAA suspended an air traffic controller for sleeping on the job at the Miami Air Route Traffic Control Center.
There were 12 controllers and two managers on duty at the time.
All of the incidents occurred during controllers' midnight shifts.
