Dixon got the tattoos, he said, to send a message to his enemies and the police to leave him alone.
They staged an intervention and convinced him to make a fresh start.
He also wasn't in contact with his two sons, which troubled him since his own father hadn't been involved in his life.
Most men, like Dixon, walk through the center's doors because they need help finding a job.
Jones says many of the men he tries to help grew up without fathers themselves.
"The one thing that is consistent with all these men is that they want to be involved with the lives of their children, but they just don't know how," Jones said.
When Dixon first came to the Center for Urban Families, he owed $47,000 in child support.
"You have a group of men speaking about issues they are having about their children," Dixon said.
"The first day I took him to school, I got the sense of fatherhood," Dixon said.
Jones grew up in Baltimore and remembers the day his own father left, when he was 9 years old.
"I didn't want to go to jail anymore," Jones said.
Jones earned his associate's degree at Baltimore City Community College, and he says he hasn't looked back.
Jones' turnaround is an inspiration to Dixon and the other men in his program.
Now Dixon feels confident that he can follow Jones' example.
