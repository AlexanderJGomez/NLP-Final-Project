And the recent questions about Hillary Clinton's age and health is anything but.
"There is a whole swath of voters out there who obviously know of Hillary Clinton and understand who the Clintons are, but they don't know of her as the politician, they don't know the specifics about her time in the White House," Kirsten Kukowski, spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, said.
Details about the Clinton White House years is not old news for people who were in "grade school" at the time, she said.
Clinton is also one of the most recognizable people in America.
"I think that is going to be a big issue in framing the debate and framing who Hillary is to those voters," Kukowski said.
Top Republican strategists, like Karl Rove, have shown how Republican might try to bring up Clinton's age and health in a campaign.
Although Democrats have called Rove "sleazy," the stepped up attacks have already had an impact on the early 2016 presidential wrangling by solidifying what Republicans have been saying for months: Hillary Clinton is who they see as the most formidable potential candidate.
She had tried to stay above politics for months by giving high-profile paid speeches and traveling the country.
Tim Miller, executive director of the anti-Clinton America Rising PAC, said comments like that are an acknowledgment that she knows their time in the White House from 1993-2001 will be an issue if she runs.
Miller added that while he doesn't think the 2016 election will be won or lost on issues like Whitewater and other Clinton White House scandals, he does think  informing young voters, especially, about them is necessary.
His team went up with ads early and spent tons of cash, hoping that Romney would be defined on their terms to many voters by final months of the campaign.
Republicans say that is only because of the unprecedented shadow campaign around Clinton right now.
