(CNN) -- Somalia, Myanmar and Afghanistan have the lowest scores on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, which measures how people in 178 countries and territories view corruption in their public sectors.
But while the U.S. is well ahead of neighbor Mexico (3.1), it seems to have some work to do to catch Canada (8.9).
The country scored a 3.3 on the most recent index, putting it among the countries viewed as most corrupt.
Again, it's important to point out that these surveys were conducted well before these two countries' longtime leaders were ousted.
