The Italian international is the focus of racially charged remarks made by Milan vice president Paulo Berlusconi, the younger brother of former prime minister and team owner Silvio Berlusconi.
Silvio Berlusconi, as well as world football head Sepp Blatter, backed Boateng for taking a strong stance against prejudicial abuse, though the FIFA president noted that walk-offs are not a long-term solution to the problem.
"It is an insult," Foot told CNN.
Balotelli played for AC's city rivals Inter Milan between 2006 and 2010, during which time he was subjected to racist abuse by Juventus fans during a match in 2009.
I think it will happen.
"I think the Boateng incident was really positive because it put the issue on the agenda and said, 'We're not going to take this anymore' and he was backed by the authorities which was really good.
"There hasn't been a debate in Italy about racist language.
Meanwhile, speaking from the Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa, where Ghana play Burkina Faso in Wednesday's semifinal, Kwadwo Asamoah, who plays for Milan's Serie A rivals Juventus, called for an end to racist abuse in football.
"Football is about coming together," the 24-year-old Ghana international told CNN.
