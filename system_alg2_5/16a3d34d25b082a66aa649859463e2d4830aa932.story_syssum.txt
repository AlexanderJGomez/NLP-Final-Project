(CNN) -- Amanda Wagner and Jessica Tuttle turn 50 this year, but they're not letting age hold them back from their favorite exercise: running.
"It gives me an edge when I go in to work."
But a study out of Stanford University that looked at healthy aging runners found that running did not damage joints or leave runners less able to exercise.
That includes not running through pain, and resting if you have an injury, something Tuttle takes seriously.
"The biggest risk that runners will face as they age, with regard to injury, is overtraining, by far," says Mason, who recommends giving yourself a day of rest between runs, or cross-training on the non-running days.

"I really can't imagine not running; it's that much a part of my life," says Wagner.
"And I do expect and hope to be running when I'm 60 and when I'm 70 -- I truly do."
