(CNN) -- At first, Miguel Hernandez thought it was a mistake, or worse, a joke.
More likely, Hernandez was one of hundreds of undocumented immigrants released from detention because of looming budget cuts set to take effect Friday absent congressional action.
The decision was made by career ICE employees, an administration official told CNN.
Hernandez, the young man who was released in Georgia, can't know for sure that he was released because of budget cuts.
Hernandez said he believes some of those released with him are repeat offenders who have been previously deported.
He wants to know exactly how many detainees were released, and where, and the reason for each person's detention.
