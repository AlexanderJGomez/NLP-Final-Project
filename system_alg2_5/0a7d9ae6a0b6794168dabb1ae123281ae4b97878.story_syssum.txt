As families prepare for air travel this coming Memorial Day weekend, United Airlines won't be offering early boarding to families in coach with small children.
"That message has been communicated."
"We transitioned to a common boarding process across all aircraft," Hobart said.
As a policy, American Airlines also does not specifically allow families with children to get on aircraft before general boarding.
Delta Air Lines said it also offers passengers with children an opportunity to preboard, including those with first class and business class tickets.
