(CNN) -- The small plane had crashed in an extremely remote part of Alaska, miles from the tiny village of St. Mary's.
Had it not been for her going for help, more victims might have died, said Clifford Dalton, a paramedic for LifeMed Alaska.
Dalton said he and his partner, Paul Garnet, helped treat the patients at the site.
Concerned residents also came to help from Mountain Village, about 25 miles away, where most of the victims were from.
Four of those injured were hospitalized in fair condition, officials said.
Alaskans depend on air transportation far more than residents in other states because many villages aren't on the road system.
