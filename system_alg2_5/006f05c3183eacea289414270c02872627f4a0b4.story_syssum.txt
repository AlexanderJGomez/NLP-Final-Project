(CNN)  -- Low visibility caused by mist and sand created poor flying conditions for the pilot of an Afriqiyah Airways flight that crashed just before landing in Tripoli, Libyan sources with knowledge of the investigation said Saturday.
Both of Ruben's parents and a brother were killed in the crash, a Dutch foreign ministry representative said.
The family, which will raise Ruben, said the boy knows that his parents and brother were killed.
More than two-thirds of the passengers killed in the plane crash were Dutch, the ministry said.
The Dutch foreign ministry said Friday it is sending more experts to Tripoli to help Libyan authorities and Dutch colleagues identify the victims.
