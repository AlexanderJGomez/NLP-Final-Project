That was the overwhelming sentiment of women I chatted with on Facebook, Twitter and over e-mail after I heard reports that Huma Abedin, wife of embattled New York City mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner, might partly blame herself for her husband's return to sexting.
"When relationships hit the rocks, doesn't everyone have those 'What did I do to deserve this?'
"For so long, that's how I felt."
"What saddens me, but does not make me think negatively of Huma, is that she seems to be making all the sacrifices to keep her family, her husband's career and her career together."
He did that all on his own," she said.
"But the important thing is to realize that the only person who can 'fix' infidelity is the one who chose to commit it."
