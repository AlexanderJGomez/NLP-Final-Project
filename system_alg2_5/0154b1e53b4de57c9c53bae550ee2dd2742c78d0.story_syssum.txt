In France, and especially in Paris, the mood over the past two weeks has been subdued, but punctured by public displays of solidarity across faiths.
One of France's most renowned philosophers, Voltaire published his "Treatise on Tolerance" in 1763.
When first published, the "Treatise" was a revolutionary creed, and one that landed Voltaire in trouble with the French government and especially powerful religious interests, such as the Jesuits.
"What?
Voltaire wrote the "Treatise" because he was outraged by the execution of a Protestant man, Jean Calas, who was wrongly convicted of murdering his own son to prevent him from converting to Catholicism.
"We can draw anything, including a prophet, because in France, the France of Voltaire and irreverence, we have the right to make fun of religions," she said.
Some of the marchers waved copies of "A Treatise on Tolerance" as they walked and left them at impromptu memorials in the Place de la Republique.
The Societe Voltaire, charged with keeping the philosopher's flame alive, says the attacks in Paris were also an attempt to assassinate him.
Two-hundred-fifty years later, the words have new resonance.
