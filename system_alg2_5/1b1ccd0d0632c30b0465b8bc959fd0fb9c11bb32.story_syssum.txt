The co-founder of Twitter and chief executive officer of Square met with CNN's Maggie Lake to share his vision on how mobile payments will change the world of commerce.
"What I think is great about technology, and every technology that exists, [is that] it increases the number of people who can participate, in our case commerce," Dorsey said.
Square aims to have "one, end-to-end, great, frictionless experience -- and that's been our focus from day one," Dorsey said.
However, Dorsey said Square is an "entirely new canvas," dealing as it does with commerce rather than communication.
