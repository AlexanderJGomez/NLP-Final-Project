Zimmerman and another man helped four people get out of an SUV that had overturned Wednesday evening in Sanford, the same community where the former neighborhood watch volunteer fatally shot teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, Seminole County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Heather Smith said.
Zimmerman did not witness the crash, and he left after making contact with the deputy, Smith said.
Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, had a confrontation with the unarmed African-American teen after calling police to report a suspicious person, and he said he shot Martin in self-defense.
Shawn Vincent, a spokesman for George Zimmerman's legal defense team, said when Zimmerman spoke with his attorneys on Friday, the car wreck didn't come up.
