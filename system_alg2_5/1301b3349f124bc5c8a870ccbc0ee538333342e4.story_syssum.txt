But it happened in America.
It's no coincidence that Facebook, like Google, Apple, Twitter and Intel, started in the United States.
Here are some of things Facebook tells us about America -- not just what is right but what requires careful, urgent nurturing to preserve.
And the structure of support for those who have great ideas is still in place.
Interpersonal relationships have been recast by social media.
According to a report by the Partnership for a New American Economy, more than 40% of the 2010 Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children.
Americans may be rolling out one great idea after another, but other countries are getting many of the jobs that come from its inventions.
Facebook and other similar high-profile companies would not have made it without the right government decisions, ones that made the Internet possible or lowered the price of the microchips.
In the United States, people can make monumental fortunes when they have good ideas.
As a society, America should highlight the need to create and build, not just accumulate.
Hurrah to those who have transformed the world and our lives.
The secret is out.
