Just hours after delivery, a baby born with HIV in Mississippi was given high doses of three antiretroviral drugs.
The California baby is still on antiretroviral treatment, so it's too soon to tell if the child is actually in remission.
A clinical trial designed to test the effectiveness of early treatment on infants born to HIV-positive mothers is set to begin in the next couple of months, she said.
Doctors administered the antiretroviral drugs 30 hours after the girl was born in hopes of controlling the virus.
In March 2013, researchers announced that the girl was the first child to be "functionally cured" of HIV.
And HIV-positive mothers who are given appropriate treatment pass on the virus in less than 2% of cases.
Researchers say the only other documented case of an HIV cure is that of Timothy Brown, known as the "Berlin patient."
"I've been tested everywhere possible," said Brown, who now lives in San Francisco.
Even then, some HIV experts said that doesn't matter, that he's been cured.
In July, Boston researchers said two HIV patients showed no sign of the virus in their blood following bone marrow transplants.
