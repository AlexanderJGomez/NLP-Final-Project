London (CNN) -- Eight female badminton players were disqualified from the Olympics on Wednesday for trying to lose matches the day before, the Badminton World Federation announced after a disciplinary hearing.
"It's not in the spirit of the thing," said Kevin Button of Ashford, in Kent, just outside London.
In the first of the Tuesday matches under scrutiny, Wang and Yu played South Korea's Jung Kyung-eun and Kim Ha-na in a game in which "neither side seemed to be exerting themselves," the official Olympic news service said.
Former badminton player Andy Goode, who represented Team GB at the 1992 Olympics and managed the team four years later, said the disqualification was the right call for the sake of the sport.
"These players, I feel for them a little bit, because this wasn't their decision; their team has told them to lose these games," he said.
The Chinese Olympic delegation "fully respects the Badminton World Federation's decision to punish" its athletes, it said in a statement.
"Chinese players failed to demonstrate their fighting spirit of the national team.
Competition has been dominated by China, Indonesia, South Korea and Denmark, according to the federation.
