(CNN) -- Getafe became the third Spanish football club to pass into foreign ownership on Thursday after signing a deal with Dubai's Royal Emirates Group.
"Royal Emirates Group plans to invest heavily in inducting new blood and promoting the team in the region," he said.
Santander sold out to Indian businessman Ahsan Ali Syed in January, with his Western Gulf Advisory company taking over.
Since replacing coach Miguel Angel Portugal with the club's former boss Marcelino, the Cantabria-based team is four points above 17th-placed Malaga.
