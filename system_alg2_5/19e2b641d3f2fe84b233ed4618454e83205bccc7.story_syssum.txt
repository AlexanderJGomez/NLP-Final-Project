Santa Barbara, California (CNN) -- As Elliot Rodger was carrying out a deadly rampage Friday night around Santa Barbara, his parents were frantically trying to find him, having just received a chilling manifesto from their son.
His mother called Rodger's father, Peter, and said he had to watch the YouTube video.
It ended when Rodger slammed into a parked vehicle and apparently shot himself in the head, police said.
His mother came across his YouTube videos in April after she hadn't heard from Rodger in a few days, Astaire said.
In fact, Elliot Rodger himself wrote in the manifesto that he worried that someone had discovered his plan when the police visited.
For a few horrible seconds I thought it was all over.
Rodger had been seeing therapists on and off since he was 8, according to Astaire.
Before his death, Rodger was seeing two therapists, Astaire added.
Astaire told CNN that Rodger never expressed any fascination with guns.
"(His parents) were conscious and concerned about their son's health," Astaire said.
"They thought he was in good hands."
