Northern Syria (CNN) -- Tanks pounded the Syrian city of Aleppo on Saturday, a sign that a much-feared government offensive in the country's largest city has started, as the opposition warned its allies they would bear responsibility for a "massacre" if they don't act soon.
At least 160 people were killed across Syria on Saturday, the LCC said.
"The heaviest clashes since the beginning of the revolution are taking place now in a number of neighborhoods in Aleppo city," the LCC said.
She said the regime is shelling displaced people from Homs and Idlib who've taken refuge in Aleppo, and thousands of them have had to evacuate yet again.
Russia and China -- major trade allies with Syria -- have vetoed tough resolutions on Syria at the U.N. Security Council.
"We are blocking ... only an attempt to support one side in an internal conflict by a U.N. Security Council decision," Lavrov said, RIA Novosti reported.
One Free Syrian Army commander said the regime has labeled the confrontation for the city as the "mother of all battles."
The United Nations and Western countries, fearing widespread death and destruction, have urged the Syrian government to call off an offensive in Aleppo.
Heavy violence on Saturday wasn't limited to Aleppo.
"In a response to the constant pleas of the residents in the area, a unit from our armed forces started to cleanse Karnaz town in Hama from the armed terrorist gangs," Syrian state TV reported.
