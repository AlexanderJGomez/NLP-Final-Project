"The thing that this debate did is it gave people reasons to think about (a) President Romney," said John Geer, chairman of Vanderbilt University's political science department.
"Obama can afford to lose this one," said Melissa Wade, a debate professor at Emory University in Atlanta.
Still, the stakes for Romney to pull off a good performance were high and, according to post-debate polls and commentators, he dominated the president.
Obama now faces the task of recovering from his debate stumble.
"He was terrible last night and I don't understand why," Geer said.
Obama made unforced errors.
"If you want to be president, you owe the American people the truth," Obama said during a campaign stop in Denver.
The Romney campaign spent much of September trying to recover from a series of gaffes ranging from his assertion that 47% of people were entitlement-dependent supporters of Obama to his politically-charged response to the violent attacks on U.S. embassies in Egypt and Libya.
But, with just a few weeks before the general election, Romney has to do a lot more than say Obama doesn't deserve a second chance, she said.
And last night he was able to elevate his level of performance.
The town hall format is one that could easily trip both candidates, debate experts say.
"The way the questions are asked are not the way they are in practiced debates because these are from people not policy experts."
