Receivers dotted around five major cities, including Mexico City and Acapulco, will sound the alarm if they detect an earthquake.
With roughly 21 million people living both formally and informally in and around Mexico City alone, that means many will not be aware the alarm is sounding until the ground begins shaking.
Now, after combining with local engineers and tech investors based in Silicon Valley, Meira believes he may have a solution that will bring the SASMEX signal to the masses.
At a cost of just $50, it also undercuts the price of the receivers used primarily in public buildings by around 85%.
Meira also hopes versions of the Grillo system could be introduced elsewhere in the world where earthquakes are a real risk -- like in Nepal, India, the West Coast of the U.S. and along much of the Pacific Coast of South America.
Then there is the fact that only a handful of early warning systems like SASMEX exist anywhere in the world.
"The real test of a good infrastructure is the density of sensors," Meira said.
Japan remains the only nation in the world where the entire country is hooked up to an early warning facility.
The first small batch of Grillo boxes produced have been sold, although they haven't yet seen any action in the field.
Now, they await the next earthquake.
