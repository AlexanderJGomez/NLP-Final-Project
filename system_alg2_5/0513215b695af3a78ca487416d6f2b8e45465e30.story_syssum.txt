Odds of a GOP takeover of the Senate are looking up eight weeks to Election Day.
So, even if the GOP has a great Election Night, it is unrealistic to believe there could be a 30-seat gain in the House, as the Democrats enjoyed in 2006.
"I am now expecting a substantial Republican Senate wave in November, with a net gain of at least seven seats," the veteran prognosticator Stuart Rothenberg wrote Monday.
"I don't see any evidence of a wave like we had in '06 or '08," says Ayres.
Even so, his job approval rating is stagnant at 43%, and the percentage of Americans who think things are going badly in the country stands at 55%, up from 50% in April.
But for now, the numbers are compelling: A weak President and a worried electorate are the trademark ingredients of a wave.
