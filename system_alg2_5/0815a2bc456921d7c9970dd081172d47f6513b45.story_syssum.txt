(CNN) -- Chilean President Sebastian Pinera stoked an abortion debate in his country over remarks he made about an 11-year-old girl who became pregnant after being raped by her mother's partner.
"That being said, the option of abortion, in this case, for rape, seems to be the right solution."
"What is relevant is to help this girl who has been victim to a rape, but that, from my perspective, can't ever justify what is worse, which is to abort that child inside her," he said.
Having a child at such a young age is a lot to deal with, and her understanding the choice she made will be facilitated by denying interviews and staying out of the spotlight, Ana Maria Aron said.
