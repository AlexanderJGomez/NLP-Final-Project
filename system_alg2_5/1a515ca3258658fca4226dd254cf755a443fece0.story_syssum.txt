Residents of this sleepy Turkish border town breathed a sigh of relief on Thursday.
Fighting first erupted in the area on November 8, when Syrian rebels mounted an assault on Syrian government forces in the neighboring Syrian town of Ras Al Ain.
They raised the opposition flag triumphantly over Ras Al Ain, despite the fact that their offensive had sent thousands of terrified residents streaming across the border to Turkey for safety.
On Wednesday, Turkey's defense minister issued a warning to Syria.
Whether or not Damascus heeded Ankara's warning is not clear.
These frightened Syrians said Ras Al Ain had been a safe haven until last week's rebel attack.
"We are angry at both of them (the rebels and the government), because the rebels entered Ras Al Ain and because the regime bombed us with its aircraft," Mohammed said.
Roughly half of Ras Al Ain's population is said to be Kurdish.
Speaking by phone from the Kurdish-controlled Syrian town of Qoubani, Aloush said his Kurdish faction would not use force to push Syrian rebel groups out of Ras Al Ain.
"We don't care if the Kurds say you have to leave," said Yalmaz Basha of the FSA.
On Friday, the Turkish government once again denounced the Syrian regime, claiming it had no legitimacy.
