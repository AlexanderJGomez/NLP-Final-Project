(CNN) -- Hundreds of students walked out of their Oklahoma high school Monday to protest the school's response to the alleged bullying of three classmates who say they were raped by the same person.
The teens and their families say school administrators failed to take adequate action after they reported the rapes and bullying.
Friends of the teens started a Facebook page, YES ALL Daughters, two weeks ago to show support for them, Babb said.
"After hearing the story we felt compelled to help the kids do something," said Stacie Wright, whose niece started the Facebook page.
"It shows that students won't put up with this harassment and bullying," Babb said.
