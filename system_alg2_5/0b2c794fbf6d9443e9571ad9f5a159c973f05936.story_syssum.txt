"I was amazed by the beauty of the fishing boats, many of which were old, damaged by the salt and the sun or abandoned," remembers Llonch, who was at the time cycling solo around the West African country.
"It's like a reincarnation of something that had life before -- a life in the Atlantic, a life in Africa," says Llonch.
From the waters off the coast of Senegal, through the Dakar-based workshop, to several stores across the world, the journey of transforming the old fishing boats into furniture is far from easy.
Llonch says that what makes the furniture special is the history behind it and the creativity of the artisans working with raw materials that are hard to remodel.
"We started with the fishing boats ... because I was astonished when I saw the beaches with these stylish boats but maybe this is just the beginning," adds Llonch.
