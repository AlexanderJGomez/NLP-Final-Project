Crews will be able to access the site near the town of Casselton on Wednesday, where they hope to collect the rest of the data needed to finish their probe, safety investigators said.
A video camera at the head of the oil train recorded the crash as it slammed into a car of a derailed grain train.
"We are not optimistic that we will be able to retrieve data from those two recorders," Sumwalt said.
Early Tuesday, crews had tested the air for toxic fumes emitted when flames and pillars of smoke towered into the sky near the town.
