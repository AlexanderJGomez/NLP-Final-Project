Last week, a 25-year follow-up of the Canadian National Breast Screening Study was published -- one of the eight major randomized trials of screening mammography.
The allegation of cheating -- purposely putting women whom researchers knew had advanced cancers in the mammography group -- is an incredibly serious one.
The new study provides evidence that randomization did exactly what it is supposed to do: It created two identical groups of women.
For mammographers who need to point to the benefits demonstrated by earlier trials of mammography, this is an odd allegation.
Why?
Armed with these two allegations, the mammographers followed a well-worn strategy: Make the allegations often and loudly enough and maybe they will stick.
In the Canadian trial, one group received a regular physical exam of the breast -- a very careful exam performed by specially trained nurses.
The other group received the same regular physical exam plus regular mammography.
Further, the Canadian trial confirms that the harm of being overdiagnosed by screening mammography is real: One in five invasive cancers found by screening represents overdiagnosis.
It's time to get the science back in screening mammography and to recognize that mammographers may not be the ideal source for balanced information.
It's too much like asking the dentists for balanced information about routine dental X-rays.
