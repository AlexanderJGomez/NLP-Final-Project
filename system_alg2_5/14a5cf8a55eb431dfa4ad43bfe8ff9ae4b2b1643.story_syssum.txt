Davos, Switzerland (CNN) -- Free trade, transparency and a crackdown on tax cheats will be at the heart of Britain's G8 presidency, Prime Minister David Cameron told the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday as he set out his vision for a more competitive Europe.
He wants Britain to be outward-looking, Cameron said, as he insisted that his referendum promise was "not about turning our backs on Europe" but about making the 27-member bloc work for everyone.
It's necessary for Europe," he said.
Britain's desire to renegotiate the terms of its EU membership is based on the need to gain the consent of the people as they follow a path within Europe, he said.
Cameron said the biggest thing that Britain and America could do together is to work on an EU-U.S. trade deal.
Addressing policymakers in Davos, Cameron said the questions of fairer taxes, more open trade and greater transparency apply just as much to the developed countries of the G8 as to poorer nations.
On Wednesday, Cameron promised that if his party wins the 2015 general election, the country would get to vote on whether Britain stays in the European Union on the basis of a renegotiated deal, or leaves.
But critics -- including his party's coalition partner, the Liberal Democrats -- say now is not the time to create uncertainty among businesses and industry over Britain's future in the European Union.
"I am confident that if there is to be a referendum one day, the UK citizens will decide to stay in the EU and contribute to shape its future," he said.
But critics warn he is taking a big gamble.
