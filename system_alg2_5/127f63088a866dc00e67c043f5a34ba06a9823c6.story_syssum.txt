The company expects to roll out an update to its free Google Search app later this week with the new feature, which uses speech-recognition technology to understand spoken, natural language search requests.
The app also can give answers specific to your location, such as movie times or weather.
Auto-predict, the sometimes amusing feature that shows popular search terms that start with the words you are typing, will be joined by smarter, more relevant suggestions.
Another new feature is the knowledge carousel -- a collection of frequently mentioned results for certain search terms that will appear as a row of thumbnail images at the top of the screen.
When the feature is on, Google will search the Web as well as all the e-mails in your account and include a list of relevant e-mails or contacts on the side of your screen.
In 2011, the search team conducted 58,000 experiments on search and made 530 tweaks to how search works.
"The destiny of search is to become that 'Star Trek' computer," he said.
