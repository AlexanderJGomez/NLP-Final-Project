Rome (CNN) -- Mario Monti, the economist nominated to become Italy's new prime minister, began talks with political leaders Monday to discuss forming a government.
Silvio Berlusconi's People of Freedom party remains the strongest force in parliament, and Berlusconi has said he plans to remain active in it.
His party will not block a Monti-led government, he said.
Speaking to reporters, Bonino called for reforms to address Italy's political and economic crisis.
"For the time being he is waiting to see what is happening under the buildup of the new government under Mr. Monti," said Deborah Bergamini, a member of Italy's Parliament and former assistant to Berlusconi.
In announcing Monti's nomination, Italian President Giorgio Napolitano said the former European Union commissioner is "gifted, competent, experienced" and well-respected in Europe and internationally.
Within days of the oath of office, Monti would have to go to parliament to present his government -- essentially his Cabinet and his government plan.
Economists said Monday's bond yields could indicate that markets are still nervous about Italy's economic prospects, even with Monti in charge.
So my feeling is that the challenge today will be rebalancing ... politics and financial matters," Bergamini told CNN Monday.
