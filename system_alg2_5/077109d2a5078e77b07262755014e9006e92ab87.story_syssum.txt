This is how it rolls at the Marathon du Medoc, an annual festival of wine and running near Bordeaux, France, in which competitors strive to complete 26 miles and almost as many glasses of the local vin.
The run has a time limit of six hours and 30 minutes and is nicknamed "the longest marathon in the world" with little exaggeration.
To compare, the 2013 Paris marathon had an average speed of four hours and 10 minutes.
Polish national Hanna Gierzynska-Zalewska, a Medoc Marathon connoisseur, will run it for the third time this year.
"Wine, food along the course would be hard to resist and I have no idea how my body will react," he says.
My time of six hours and nine minutes wasn't going to break any records, but I thoroughly enjoyed every glass of wine offered along the way.
