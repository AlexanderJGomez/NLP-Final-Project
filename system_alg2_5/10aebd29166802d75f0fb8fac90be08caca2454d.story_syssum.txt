At issue is whether three people named by President Barack Obama to the board were ineligible to serve because their appointments were made while the Senate was technically in a "pro forma" session during the 2011-12 winter holiday break.
The Constitution allows a president to fill temporary appointments during a recess, without congressional approval.
But the court said the executive could use his power to make recess appointments even when the vacancy occurred before the Senate goes on break.
"Since President Obama took office, Senate Republicans have done everything possible to deny qualified nominees from receiving a fair up-or-down vote," said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada.
While agreeing with the outcome of the narrow question presented, four more conservative justices worried that the ruling would allow the President to retain a good deal of the "powerful weapon" of making recess appointments.
Some GOP lawmakers also accused the President of flip-flopping on the issue.
Company executives said the board lacked a binding quorum because the recess appointments made by Obama were not legal.
The case is NLRB v. Noel Canning (12-1281).
