Los Angeles (CNN) -- Charlie Sheen plans to return to work on his hit sitcom "Two and a Half Men" by the end of February, his representative said Thursday.
Sheen was "very, very intoxicated, also apparently in a lot of pain" last Thursday morning, according to a 911 call from a doctor who had just talked to the actor.
Nassif, in an interview Tuesday with HLN's "Showbiz Tonight," said he couldn't tell if Sheen, who is his friend, was drunk.
Sheen and now ex-wife Brooke Mueller were married in Nassif's Beverly Hills home, Nassif said.
Nassif drove Sheen home from the hospital, but he declined to provide details of their conversation.
