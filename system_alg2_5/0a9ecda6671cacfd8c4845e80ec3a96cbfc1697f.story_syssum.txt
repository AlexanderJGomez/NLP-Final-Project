The State Department is working with the Swedish Embassy in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, the officials said.
Sweden represents America's interests in North Korea because the United States and North Korea do not have diplomatic relations.
In 2010, former President Jimmy Carter helped secure the release of Aijalon Mahli Gomes, a U.S. citizen who had been fined roughly $600,000 and sentenced to eight years of hard labor for crossing over the Chinese border into North Korea.
South Korea accuses the North of torpedoing and sinking one of its warships in March 2010, killing 46 sailors, and last November, North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island, killing two South Korean marines and two civilians.
