(CNN) -- A fire erupted Friday at the headquarters of the Shanksville, Pennsylvania, memorial to United Airlines Flight 93, which crashed on September 11, 2001, officials said.
Four buildings were damaged, the park service said.
"I think stuff has been lost," Nacke said.
Nacke helped raise funds for the Flight 93 National Memorial and advised in its planning.
"We are deeply saddened to learn that a fire occurred at the Flight 93 National Memorial headquarters," Gordon Felt, president of Families of Flight 93 said in a statement.
All employees and volunteers were safely evacuated.
The 2,200-acre memorial park is managed by the National Park Service.
