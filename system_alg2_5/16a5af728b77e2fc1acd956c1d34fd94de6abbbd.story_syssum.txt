The Grammy Award winner started the Common Ground Foundation to help underserved youth develop leadership and life skills.
Common: I started (the foundation) with some of my team members because we wanted to give back to the youth who didn't have some of the opportunities we had.
My whole life growing up, I was doing the little things that I could do (to help people).
I want to empower them first by letting them know that they are loved and people do care.
We want to prepare them to be able to go out into the world and do things for themselves so they can be leaders.
My mother told me before going there: getting invited there, that is an important place to be because that is where a lot of people that do the real work are.
And it was super-inspiring to me.
Common: A hero to me is someone who is able to take whatever talent, gift, personality, quality and utilize it to help build others.
