McDonald's and Target dropped an egg supplier this week after an activist group released disturbing video showing what it says shows animal cruelty at three of the company's barns.
Target similarly said it was dropping Sparboe Farms, which describes itself as the fifth-largest shell egg producer and marketer in the United States.
Sparboe Farms launched an internal investigation upon learning about the undercover video, which was shot by an animal activist hired under false pretenses, according to Beth Sparboe Schnell, president and owner of Sparboe Farms.
The company said it responded to the FDA, which in turn told Sparboe Farms that some of the corrective actions it took were insufficient.
The egg industry has been a frequent target of animal rights groups, which accuse suppliers of keeping hens in unusually cruel conditions, and have sometimes used undercover videos to prove their point.
Regulators recalled about 550 million eggs from the U.S. market in the wake of a salmonella outbreak traced to two Iowa farms in August.
Wright County Egg recalled 380 million eggs, while Hillandale Farms recalled 170 million eggs.
