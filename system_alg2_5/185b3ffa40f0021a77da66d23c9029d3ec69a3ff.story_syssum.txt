Rolling Stone labeled the Everly Brothers "the most important vocal duo in rock," having influenced the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Simon & Garfunkel and many other acts.
In terms of record sales, their chief rivals during this stretch were Elvis Presley and Pat Boone.
Their style -- a product of their blend of rock 'n' roll with Appalachian folk, bluegrass and other genres more closely aligned to their Kentucky roots -- helped them earn inductions in both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Country Music Hall of Fame.
In 1957, they found a Felice and Boudleaux Bryant song, "Bye Bye Love."
After averaging a Top 10 hit every four months over the next few years, the Everly Brothers inked a 10-year pact with Warner Brothers Records (formerly part of CNN's parent company, Time Warner, though now owned by Access Industries) in 1960.
Their remaining years were highlights by occasional shows, hall of fame inductions and various other honors, including a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997.
