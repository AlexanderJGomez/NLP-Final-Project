Simons says Tuesday's quake is of interest because the fault line along Chile's coast has constantly shifted during the last 140 years.
In recent weeks, this area has seen a cluster of activity-- something like 50 to 100 smaller quakes.
Given that it's an area of frequent quakes, and frequent ruptures, it may only be a matter of time.
