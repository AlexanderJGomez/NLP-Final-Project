Believing that access to their archives can promote French culture, the city of Lyon's library has signed an agreement with Google, hoping to scan as many as 500,000 books in 10 years.
Under the Lyon Library contract, Google will scan its books and manuscripts for free.
The library's collection includes national literary treasures and collectibles, such as a 16th century bible, in 12 languages.
However, in January, an independent review for the French culture ministry criticized the lack of progress made by Gallica, and recommended a public-private partnership with Google.
Currently Google has seven library partners in Europe, including Lyon.
