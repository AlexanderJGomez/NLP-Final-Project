As Brazil prepares to welcome hundreds of thousands of international fans to the World Cup in one week's time, it has to ensure the world it will also be ready for the Olympics two years later.
Rio 2016 says 38% of the sites are done, including 11 that are already operational, including the MaracanÃ£ Stadium which will host the World Cup Final.
As for Deodoro, where the BMX, whitewater kayaking and rugby events will be held, construction isn't even expected to start until the second half of this year, but Andrada says they can quickly make up for lost time.
"It's a problem but not for sailing," he said.
"You're going to put high-performance athletes in this water, that isn't even water, it's a toilet," he said during an interview overlooking the Marina Gloria, which will serve as the base for the Olympic sailing events.
This is a problem for us," he said.
"Most of the public money is being spent not on venues, not on fancy stadiums, but on legacy, on transportation, on sewage," said Paes, Rio's mayor, pointing to the extensive bus corridors that the city has already begun, that connects venues and isolated areas of the city.
After the World Cup ends on July 13, all eyes will be on Rio's Olympic Games.
