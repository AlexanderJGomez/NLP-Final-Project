Today, five years after delivering those twins in the midst of the chaos that Katrina wreaked, Prepas dwells -- not on the death and destruction that was so well-documented -- but on the life that emerged.
"I had never in my life seen such a disaster as I had in New Orleans," Prepas says.
"There were two policemen and two security guards," Prepas says.

Prepas set up a privacy sheet in the tent and prepared a cot.

The paramedics radioed a hospital in Baton Rouge to let them know they were bringing a woman in labor with twins.

It drives me to keep wanting to do all this stuff.
