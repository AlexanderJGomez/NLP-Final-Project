Havens told Billboard that his breakthrough at Woodstock came after another artist's equipment got stuck in traffic.
Organizers asked him to do four more songs, he told Billboard.
"I came up in Brooklyn singing doo-wop music from the time I was 13 to the time I was 20.
"It was the songs that actually changed my life," he says.
They were just so powerful.
Stephen Stills of Crosby, Stills and Nash said Havens was an inspiration for the natural gravel in his singing voice.
"But he sure knew what to do when they were begging for someone to go on first, when all those people showed up at Woodstock," Stills said.
Billboard reported Havens died in New Jersey, leaving behind four daughters and five grandchildren.
