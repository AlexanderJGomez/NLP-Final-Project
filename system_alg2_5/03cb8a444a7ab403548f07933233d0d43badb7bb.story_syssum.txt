Delgarde says."
Delgarde explains the process for making paint in Haiti.
He told them, "I want to collect your paint and take it someplace where people don't have access to paint.
So far, Delgarde has donated 6,000 gallons of paint to projects in Kenya, Haiti and Uganda.
It really touched my heart to see the bacteria on the walls that were not painted.
I think he's taken something very difficult for people to do correctly, that's recycling paint and created a way to do it and do it safely.
"I was really excited to hear about Global Paint and the use for the paint in Third World nations because we have such a hard time getting rid of paint, and this kills two birds with one stone.
"We used to have a small warehouse where we would process the paint.
We need that paint, so we can give paint to everybody, to beautify the world, that's my goal.
But we need someplace where we can process the paint," he says.
We bring joy with the paint we were able to donate.
To me, that touched my heart."
