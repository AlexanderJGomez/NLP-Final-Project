In the short term, Vice President Nicolas Maduro will take over as president of Venezuela until an election is held.
He rose from a career as a bus driver in Caracas to Chavez's inner circle.
Maduro has been Venezuela's vice president and foreign minister and has been the recent author of some the country's most radical policies, said Javier Corrales, a professor of political science at Amherst College in Massachusetts.
"Capriles' 11-point defeat in October's presidential election, coupled with Chavez's allies winning 20 of 23 gubernatorial elections in December, underscores the fact that the opposition still holds little power," Meacham says.
The United States will stay out of the upcoming election, an Obama administration official said.
The U.S. may seek Venezuela's help in imposing sanctions on Iran for its nuclear program, senior American officials said.
Venezuela remains the fourth-biggest oil supplier to the U.S. market.
Chavez will be buried after the ceremony but officials have not said where.
Carlos Quijada said he fled Venezuela 10 years ago as a teen because there was no future there.
And I will not hide the fact that I am happy that he is no longer alive," he said.
