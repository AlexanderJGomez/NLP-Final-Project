A leading Italian soccer coach has called for stronger action against racism after a top-level match between AC Milan and Roma was suspended Sunday due to abusive chants by supporters.
"To get rid of this stuff in our stadiums, you have to make big decisions.
People go to the stadium to watch the two teams but there's always these uncivilized people."
FIFA president Sepp Blatter said he was "appalled" by the abuse at the Milan-Roma game.
The Italy international striker was also involved in another controversial incident during the Roma match, which ended up with teammate Sulley Muntari being sent off after manhandling the referee.
The draw mean third-placed Milan ended the weekend two points ahead of Fiorentina in the race to win a place in the qualifying rounds of the European Champions League next season, with one match still to play.
Earlier Sunday, Edinson Cavani took his Serie A-leading goal tally to 28 as second-placed Napoli came from behind to beat Siena 2-1 thanks to Marek Hamsik's injury-time winner.
