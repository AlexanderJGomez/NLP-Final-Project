(CNN) -- The Davis Cup is the just about the only major honor in tennis to elude Roger Federer and the Swiss maestro took another big step to righting that omission Sunday as he led his country into November's final against France.
The 33-year-old will be playing in his first Davis Cup final and paid tribute to the fervent supporters who willed him on to victory.
Federer and Australian Open champion Stanislas Wawrinka won their opening singles rubbers Friday but the Italians hit back the following day as Fognini and Simone Bolleli took the doubles to give themselves a glimmer of hope heading into the reverse singles.
France is seeking a first Davis Cup triumph since 2001.
