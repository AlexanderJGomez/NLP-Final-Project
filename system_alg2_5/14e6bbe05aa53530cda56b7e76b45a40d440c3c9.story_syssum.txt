WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama said his administration will offer a hand of friendship to the Muslim world but will hunt down terrorist organizations that kill innocent civilians.
The president also has pledged to address the Muslim world from a Muslim capital in the first 100 days of his administration.
The Obama administration also has taken an early interest in the Middle East peace process between the Israelis and the Palestinians, with the president naming former Sen. George Mitchell as his special envoy to the region.
They're going to have to make some decisions," Obama said.
Hamid said the real litmus test for the Muslim world is what Obama does with the crisis in Gaza.
