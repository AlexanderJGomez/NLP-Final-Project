The House Justice Committee dismissed the impeachment complaint by 42-8 votes, saying that it was "insufficient in substance," the state-run Philippines News Agency reported.
"I'm not saying that there is no substance (to the complaint), but it was insufficient," Deputy House Speaker Pablo Garcia told the committee before the vote.
The first of the impeachment charges were brought against Arroyo in 2005 for vote-tampering.
The opposition then tried to impeach Arroyo in 2006 and 2007 -- and Congress dismissed those attempts as well.
