A Hutu, Bagosora was convicted of ordering Hutu militia to slaughter rival Tutsis.
April 7, while Bagosora held a crisis meeting with top military officials, the prime minister was arrested, sexually assaulted and killed by top members of the Rwandan Army, the court found.
The killings were carried out by military personnel on the orders of Rwandan authorities including Bagosora, the court said.
During the trial, the court heard 242 witnesses -- 82 for the prosecution and 160 for the defense.
Rebel leader Laurent Nkunda says his forces are fighting to defend Congolese Tutsis from Hutu militants who escaped to Congo.
