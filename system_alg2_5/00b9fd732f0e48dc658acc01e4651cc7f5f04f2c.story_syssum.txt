(CNN) -- Jeff Yeager says the economic downturn is an opportunity for people to simplify their lives and be content with less.
Jeff Yeager: Well, you know, I'm about 50 years old.
Collins: All right.
And again, I don't really talk about a life of sacrifice.
You know, in this economy, we hear a lot of stories about how to get more stuff for 20 percent less.
Collins: OK. Wow.
Collins: OK.
Collins: OK. Well, very good.
I've got to push back for a second, because a lot of people will tell you you can be happier with a cell phone because you're out of the office and you're with your family more, still able to still do business.
All right.
Can you give up one?
Collins: OK. Give up meals prepared outside your home.
Yeager: Yes.
Collins: Yes, and then maybe just get it tailored or updated or something.
Collins: All right.
Back in my day, if you have a child in school, consider having them live at home while they go to school.
Now, of course, most kids go away to school, take out student loans.
