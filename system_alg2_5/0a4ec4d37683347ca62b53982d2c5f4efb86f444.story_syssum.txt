During his recent speech at West Point, President Obama rejected the lessons that these kinds of stories tell us about Afghanistan.
In trying to separate himself from the experience of Johnson, however, Obama did not give an accurate account of what many commentators have been saying recently, and he downplayed crucial aspects of the 1960s that do in fact offer warnings for today.
The point of the comparison is that it is impossible to ignore the fact that Obama faces similar challenges, as did Johnson when the "Americanization" of Vietnam began in the spring of 1965.
Both presidents also expanded the war just as they were trying to shape a broad domestic agenda.
In an era when American schoolchildren were being taught to duck and cover under their desks in case of nuclear war, this warning about Vietnam also made the war seem essential.
The U.S. is also depending on a highly corrupt and undependable government in Afghanistan.
And the administration might very well be handcuffing itself to a strategy of more warfare as it keeps offering grave warnings about what a victory by the Taliban would mean.
Obama should not be so defensive about the comparisons with Vietnam.
