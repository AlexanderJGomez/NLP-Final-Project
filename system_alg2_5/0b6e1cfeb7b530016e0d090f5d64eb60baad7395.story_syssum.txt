Members of the Kansas-based Westboro Baptist Church protested outside the court, while inside one of their members argued they have the right to promote what they call a broad-based message on public matters such as wars.

Snyder's family sued the church in 2007, alleging invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress and civil conspiracy.
Albert Snyder, Matthew's father, said his son was not gay and the protesters should not have been at the funeral.
During Wednesday's intense one-hour arguments, the attorney for the Snyder side -- Sean Summers -- told the court the pain Albert Snyder suffered occurred before, during and after the funeral.
There was no importuning anyone going to the funeral.
"I believe that the justices heard that and I hope that they realize that this isn't just a case about speech, it's about harassment, targeted harassment at a private person's funeral," Summers said afterward.
She held her own under sometimes withering questioning from several justices, especially over whether the church's "speech" is personal or public in nature.
Ginsburg jumped in, noting Westboro had picketed the Maryland state Capitol the same day, just before going to the Snyder funeral.
A majority of states across the nation have responded to the protests with varying levels of control over the Westboro church protesters.
Church members have participated in several hundred protests across the country.
The case heard Wednesday is Snyder v. Phelps (09-751).
