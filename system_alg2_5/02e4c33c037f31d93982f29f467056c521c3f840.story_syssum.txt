It's about what the camera is shooting: Greengrass sets up and stages organically detailed situations that he then films as if he were making a documentary.
And he proves that yet again in "Captain Phillips," his suspensefully spiky thriller based on a shattering incident from April 2009, when the crew of a U.S. cargo ship, the MV Maersk Alabama, was held hostage for several days by a band of Somali pirates armed with machine guns.
Greengrass doesn't have to fill in much about the violent, chaotic breakdown of Somalia to let us know that these men have little choice in life: Taking up arms to steal, or even to kill, is the central option their society has handed them.
One of the pirates, a young fellow named Muse, is played by Barkhad Abdi, who has the ravaged, bone-hungry face of a starving child all grown up.
Phillips sends the pirates on a wild goose chase throughout the massive ship, and Captain Phillips becomes a gripping life-or-death chess game: Who will survive?
It's that the movie, tethered for close to an hour to the strategies and tensions aboard the lifeboat, keeps giving us things to observe, but maybe not so much to discover.
