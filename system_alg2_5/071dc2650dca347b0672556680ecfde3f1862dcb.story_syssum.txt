Malala Yousafzai's ordeal is not over yet: Doctors say the 15-year-old campaigner for girls' education, whom gunmen shot in the head as she rode a school bus in Pakistan, will be readmitted in late January or early February for more cranial reconstructive surgery.
The center, a charity, offered a school for girls and vaccinations for polio, among other diseases, along with maternal health treatment.
"She wanted to be a doctor and said it was only a matter of a few years and that when she was a doctor (all our suffering), it will end,'" her father told the BBC.
"What a waste of human talent; 50% of the talent of the country we pushed off in a corner for almost 200 years," he said in an interview with Melinda Gates.
These young women and their legacies -- Malala, who will continue her fight, and the others, who will not -- are on the front lines of deciding what our world looks like.
Will young women who speak out on the need for education be stopped or celebrated?
"They wanted to kill her," said her father not long after gunmen shot his daughter.
He was right.
