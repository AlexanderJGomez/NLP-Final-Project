Somer Thompson, 7, went missing Monday on her way home from school.
You don't take from somebody.
The body of her daughter, 7-year-old Somer Thompson, was found in a south Georgia landfill, Clay County, Florida, Sheriff Rick Beseler said Thursday morning.
Police have no suspects, she said.
The sister said she brought up the fight while she and her brother walked Somer home from school, and that Somer ran off from them, apparently upset.
The landfill where her body was found is near Folkston, Georgia, 55 miles north of where the girl became separated from her schoolmates on her way home from school in Orange Park on Monday.
The garbage that was brought into that part of the landfill was collected in the Orange Park area, he had said Wednesday, noting that authorities routinely search garbage when a missing person case has been initiated.
"There is a child killer on the loose," the sheriff said.
