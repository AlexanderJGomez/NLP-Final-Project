President Barack Obama has deported more people than any other president, causing him to be known as the "deporter-in-chief" in some sectors of the immigration community.
While the Obama administration deported nearly 1.6 million people in the last four years, it's unclear how many were in the country legally.
They are seeing an increase in home raids of legal residents and there are stories like that of Navy veteran Howard Dean Bailey, who was deported in 2010 over a years-old drug offense.
He also has a pending assault charge and separate vandalism charges for egging his neighbor's house.
As with all deportations, the president has the "inherent power to choose which cases to act on," said Richard A. Boswell, immigration law professor at the University of California's Hastings College of the Law.
"A good immigration lawyer won't let that happen and I'm sure (Bieber) will be very well represented," Kolodziej said.
But, like Kolodziej said, his well-paid legal team probably won't let that happen.
You get what you pay for.
