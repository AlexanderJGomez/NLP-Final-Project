Syria feels far away; a tragedy, no doubt, but to many who strongly oppose any kind of intervention, it is simply too removed, too complicated, too foreign to view as an American problem.
1) Other dictators are watching: When the president of the United States says the use of chemical weapons is a "red line," other dangerous regimes pay very close attention to see what he means.
2) Chemical weapons will be used in future battlegrounds: More than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria.
If it passes without a response, this will not be the last time we see these weapons in use -- and not just in a distant battlefield.
In the meantime, the war is bursting beyond Syrian borders.
The Middle East remains the most explosive region of the world.
4) Inaction will hand a victory to al-Assad, Iran and Hezbollah: The Obama administration is telegraphing an attack against Syria aimed at punishing al-Assad and sending a message to the world, rather than seeking to change the course of this civil war.
5) A new generation of hatred will perpetuate this tragedy: The war in Syria has raged for 2Â½ years.
It is now a hate-filled maelstrom of Sunnis, Shiites, Allawites, Christians, Kurds and others.
The United States and its friends should strike al-Assad in a way that shows the world will not tolerate the use of chemical weapons, and prove that America's threats and international commitments have meaning and muscle.
Then they can remove al-Assad from power by wining what is, most assuredly, their war, the Syrians' war, but one that is of great consequence to America and to the rest of the world.
