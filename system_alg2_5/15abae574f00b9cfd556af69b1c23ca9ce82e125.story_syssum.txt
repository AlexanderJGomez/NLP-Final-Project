(CNN) -- David Wallechinsky didn't invent what's on the Internet.
"The Book of Lists" immediately took its place on another list -- the bestseller list -- and spawned three sequels.
"I was thrilled when the Internet came around," he says.
CNN spoke to Wallechinsky about lists, government and finding himself referenced on Wikipedia.
Wallechinsky: I think we live in an era of over-stimulation -- too much information -- so lists are a way of grasping that information.
It just makes it easier to do 11 of this or 7 of that.
I think the best lists are the ones you can't just look up -- you have to really think about and research.
Wallechinsky: No, not really.
One thing I don't like is where there's a list or a gallery and you have to click for No.
4.
I just want to see the list on one page.
So I made this list of more than 300 agencies in the U.S. government, their budget, how many people they employ and that's how I got the idea for AllGov.
CNN: The Internet is supposed to be the great leveler, now that there's all this information out there.
The Internet is just an extension of that.
Wallechinsky: I haven't looked in the last year or two, but at one point on Wikipedia it actually mentioned that either "The People's Almanac" or "The Book of Lists" was the progenitor of the Internet.
(laughs) I don't know if it's still there.
