(CNN)Searchers have found the tail section of AirAsia Flight QZ8501 in the murky depths of the Java Sea, raising hopes that the plane's black boxes and the precious information they hold might soon be recovered.
But it's still uncertain if the black boxes are in the piece of wreckage the searchers discovered.
"It's by no means certain that the recorders are located within the tail," Waldron said, noting that searchers haven't reported detecting any pings from the black boxes' locator beacons.
Soelistyo said Wednesday that divers were preparing to go back underwater in the same area, which is in one of the priority zones where search efforts have been focused.
"Elements are also still conducive for another search.
Soelistyo also said Wednesday that another body had been found in the sea, bringing the total to 40.
The vast majority of the people on the plane were Indonesian.
