An inaugural grand prix in New Jersey has now been included in the record-breaking 22 race calendar issued by motorsport's global governing body, the FIA, Friday.
Korea, the destination for the next race of this season, has been moved forward to April and has also been given provisional status on the 2014 calendar.
The New Jersey race has already been postponed once, having been initially scheduled for June this year.
Austria also makes a return to the calendar in June -- a race that has not been given provisional status.
The race will be held at the Red Bull Ring, which staged the Austrian Grand Prix between 1970 and 1987 in its former guise as the Osterreichring.
F1 generates more than $4bn in revenues annually -- and with more races in 2014 that sum could be set to rise.
