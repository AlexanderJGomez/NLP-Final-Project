In my mind, Rwanda was going to be this country that was still on the brink of economic disaster.
When I was assigned to Rwanda 18 years later, my first thought was the genocide -- this is probably true for most people.
Rwanda's countryside is dotted with what appear to be literally a thousand hills that are a mixture of mountains, volcanoes and hillocks.
For anyone who has spent time in Africa, it's incredible to see people actually wearing helmets on motorcycles, drivers and passengers alike, both in Kigali and in the countryside.
During the last Saturday of each month, citizens do some type of community work in their neighborhood, like picking up garbage or cutting the grass.
Four months after my arrival, I was ready to see the Kigali Genocide Memorial.
You almost weep when you realize they will never identify them all.
But I know from what I had seen, and from my organization's work, that it is possible.
Looking at Rwandans today with a certainty that such an atrocity can never happen again, you wonder "How did this ever happen in the first place?"
When Rwandans say "never again," I believe them.
My time in Rwanda has shown me the limitations of what the international community will do in situations like this, but also taught me lessons and given me hope.
Peace is possible.
