If you eat in your car you may want to consider fabric or leather protections.
We wanted to know which of these new car extras were worth it and which ones a consumer can do without.
"I think that most paint jobs on cars are pretty good these days, so in most cases you probably don't need that anymore," said Bennett, who offered one caveat.
Also, if you get a chip or a ding, get it fixed so the rust doesn't get a chance to set in and spread."
"Also, look at exclusions in the plan," advises Bennett.
Each of these policies or plans is probably offering something different, and you need to read all of the exclusions before making that purchase, because it might not be a good one for you."
It's also a good idea , to use a leather conditioner regularly on leather seats to restore moisture and to maintain its appearance.
But if you want to go the more high-tech "tracking" route, using a security system like LoJack may give you more peace of mind.
Then, police cruisers and aviation units that have the LoJack tracking system can identify the vehicle's location, track it and recover it.
If you live in a high-crime area, a system like this could provide you with peace of mind," advises Bennett.
So if you buy a GM car with the OnStar system, you may want to pass on a LoJack or similar tracking system."
"So if you plan on selling the car after three or five years, it probably doesn't make sense to buy the extended warranty."
"That's a pretty good warranty, so if you plan on only keeping your vehicle for five years or less, the extended warranty is probably money you don't need to spend."
