(CNN) -- Schools, major roads and an airport remained closed Tuesday, as a thick cloud of filthy smog smothered the northeastern city of Harbin.
Harbin's environmental bureau has also conducted checks on factories known to discharge pollutants, the China Daily report added.
Residents of this city of 10 million people were also surprised by the thick smog.
"We must put air quality control as an ecological red line for economic management and social development," China's Vice Premier Zhang Gao Li said in a statement as he announced the new policy at the 18th Air Pollution Control Conference in Beijing.
An explosion in the number of cars on the roads, as well as industrial pollution are seen as the main contributors.
