Yet this tale has taken a sudden and unexpected twist: The killer got a pardon and a hero's welcome.
The parole has exacerbated long-standing tensions over disputed land between Armenia and Azerbaijan, former Soviet republics that are nestled in the Caucasus region near Turkey, Iran and Russia.
Not long after Safarov arrived in Azerbaijan, though, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev pardoned him.
The United States, meanwhile, was among those nations objecting to the pardon.
Sabine Freizer, director of the International Crisis Group's Europe program, said world powers have taken note.
The disputes between the countries over Nagorno-Karabakh and other territories remain an "unresolved conflict of the Soviet period," Freizer said.
And Azerbaijan's oil and gas wealth is making its way into the budget for a military preparing for war, Freizer said.
Hungary defended its extradition and said it received assurances the killer would carry out his term.
Azerbaijan has strong military links with Turkey and they (Armenia and Azerbaijan) are both on the border with Iran," de Waal said.
Also, he said, the Armenian-American community "will beat the drum" and push for U.S. action.
When there is no peace process, he told CNN, "the vacuum is filled by war talk."
"If there is any silver lining to this dark episode it could be that the international community pays more attention to the dangers of a new Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh," de Waal wrote in his column.
