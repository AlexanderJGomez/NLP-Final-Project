Police said one of the bikers -- Robert Sims -- also stomped on the driver's head and body, according to a detective's criminal complaint.
His wife said he is paralyzed.
Chance appeared for arraignment Sunday and was charged with first-degree assault and gang assault, both felonies; unlawful imprisonment; criminal possession of a weapon and criminal mischief, according to court papers.
Lien was in his Range Rover on his way back from an outing to celebrate his wedding anniversary with his wife and their 2-year-old daughter.
Lien stepped on the gas, plowing into three more bikers, including Mieses, who was critically injured.
A man, who police say was Sims, got off his motorcycle and opened Lien's door, police spokesman Sgt.
An off-duty New York police officer was riding with the bikers Sunday and saw much of the confrontation that ended with five injured.
He has hired a lawyer and is being investigated by the New York Police Department's internal affairs unit.
Cruz was later released after posting $1,500 cash bail and a $15,000 insurance bond.
He never tried to assault him in any way.
Mieses' wife, Dayana, told CNN affiliate WBZ that he got off his bike to help the SUV driver.
"He got scared; he peeled off, and he paralyzed my husband on the way," she said.
Bikers have called for Lien to be charged.
"The true question is how could we have avoided what happened last Sunday, and what can we do to prevent that."
