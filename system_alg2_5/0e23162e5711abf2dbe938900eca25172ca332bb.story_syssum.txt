That's why it is imperative and urgent that the Obama team and their allies take a deep breath, pull themselves together and get this war effort on solid footing.
Who knew after so many contradictions from the administration?
Even as a coalition grows of nations proclaiming their support, questions also rise of just how much -- or how little -- they will actually do.
And listening to two of Obama's former defense chiefs, Bob Gates and Leon Panetta, one suspects they would have strongly opposed the plan if they were still in government.
In truth, Obama and the military have been able to work together in a professional way through most of his administration.
Soon after he took office, Obama felt that through leaks to the press, his generals were trying to box him in on how many additional troops he would send to Afghanistan, trying to push him to higher numbers.
The military worries that Obama and his team will micromanage, especially in Syria -- something that President Lyndon Johnson did with disastrous results in Vietnam.
An additional challenge the administration faces is that the President has now announced America is going to war, but there are virtually no signs of mobilization on television.
In coming days, through his time at the United Nations and back in the White House, the President must dramatically seize the reins of leadership.
It is inconceivable that the United States, with the best trained and equipped military in the world, can't clear the battlefield of a band of thugs.
