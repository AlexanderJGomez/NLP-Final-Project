Jean Lindsay records a video telling people to get out of their nightgowns and look for work.
A few days later, though, she tossed on a red sweater, plopped down in front of her computer, flipped on her Web camera -- and, suddenly, while streaming her story onto the Internet, things seemed OK.
At a time when the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says that 1.07 million people 55 and older are unemployed and looking for work, the Internet is an increasingly useful tool for older people looking for jobs and a sense of community, said Deborah Russell the AARP's director of workforce issues.
"It's a great way of being able to network with people who are either in a similar situation or who may have some resources to help you," she said.
Almost immediately, she was hooked.
"I was in my nightgown at noon, and I wasn't getting at the job search very fast, and I thought, 'this is instructive,' " she said, laughing.
The same goes for her job search.
Like a good book, Lindsay says the Internet also opens new worlds for her.
While she's not sure exactly how, she has a sense that all of her online storytelling will help her in the job search.
The 72-year-old added: "It helps an older person feel younger because there is so much youth [online].
Lindsay, who said she needs a job because she has home-improvement debt and can't sell her house in this slumped market, said she is able to keep hunting for jobs partly because of her creative outlet online.
Those experiences translated into her love for hardware stores, gardening and gadgetry.
Her online life helps ensure she won't have to.
