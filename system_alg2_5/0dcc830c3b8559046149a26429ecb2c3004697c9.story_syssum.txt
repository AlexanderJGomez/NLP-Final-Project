The Home Office named only 16 of those on the list; it said it was not in the public interest to disclose the names of the other six.
One of the most recognized names on the list may be U.S. radio talk show host Michael Savage, who is listed under his real name, Michael Alan Wiener.
Fred Phelps and his daughter, Shirley Phelps-Roper, are also listed for "engaging in unacceptable behavior and fostering hatred."
Phelps did not issue a response on his Web site.
Black established the white supremacist Web site Stormfront, which the Home Office called one of the oldest and largest hate group sites.
Samir al Quntar, a Lebanese man who spent three decades in prison for killing four Israeli soldiers and a 4-year-old girl in 1979, is also on the list.
Al Quntar is "engaging in unacceptable behavior by seeking to foment, justify or glorify terrorist violence" in order to provoke terrorist acts, the Home Office said.
"This is the driving force behind tighter rules on exclusions for unacceptable behavior."
