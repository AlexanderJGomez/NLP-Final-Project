"He's my sort of man," Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone says of Russian president Vladimir Putin's influence in the project to stage the nation's first grand prix this October in Sochi.
"He's been following the plans all of the way through," Ecclestone says of Putin's involvement.
F1 is a world championship, so it's difficult to think of leaving Russia out of a world event like this," Ecclestone said.
So organizers turned to track designer Hermann Tilke -- "nothing is impossible for him," says Zabara -- with the German engineer offering another plan more suitable for the Olympic Park facilities.
"I've had more meetings about Sochi than any other track," the architect says.
The promoter is hoping a race on Russian soil will attract many of the country's F1 fans who already travel the world to watch the championship, as well as creating a new domestic supporter base willing to pay $200 a ticket to attend.
The plans for the Sochi GP certainly don't lack for ambition and chime well with the wider Putin-driven plan of trying to rebrand Russia through the city.
Maybe the same will soon be said of the Sochi Grand Prix.
