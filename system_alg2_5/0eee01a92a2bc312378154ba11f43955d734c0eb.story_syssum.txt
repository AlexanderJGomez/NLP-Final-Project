Weeks after Randy Jackson announced his departure from Fox's long-running music talent show, two of his fellow judges -- Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj -- followed him out the door Thursday.
"Thank you American Idol for a life changing experience!
"Nicki Minaj is a superstar who brought a level of honesty and passion to 'American Idol' and who had a tremendous positive impact on so many contestants this season," they said.
Carey and Minaj, though, ended up generating headlines more for their reported tiff than they did for bringing in more viewers.
Earlier this month, he announced he had voted himself off the show.
