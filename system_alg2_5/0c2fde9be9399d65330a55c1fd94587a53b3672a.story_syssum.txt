Grosseto, Italy (CNN) -- The captain of the Italian cruise liner Costa Concordia "committed a tragic error," but his crew did their best to evacuate the ship's 3,200 passengers, the last survivor found aboard said Wednesday.
At least 17 people died when the Concordia ran aground and settled sideways on the sea bottom off Giglio, with half of the vessel still sticking out of the shallow water.
Schettino had invited him to the bridge to watch as he steered the ship past Giglio in what the captain called "a salute" to the island town, Giampedroni told reporters on his way out of the hospital.
"In this occasion, we cannot say, 'Captain, we are too near the coast.'
"Consider that the ship was leaning very fast, it was a little difficult for us to put the people in safe, on the life boats," he said.
Most of the 3,000-plus passengers and the ship's crew of about 1,000 made it safely off the ship in less than two hours, he said.
Giampedroni was half-submerged in the chilly water flooding the restaurant when found.
