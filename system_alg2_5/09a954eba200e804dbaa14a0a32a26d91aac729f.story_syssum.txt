One day after the Gulf Cooperation Council released a statement urging Yemen President Ali Abdullah Saleh to transfer powers to his vice president, thousands of protestors returned to the streets Monday for marches and opposition leaders are vowing not to back down.
The Embassy of the Republic of Yemen in Washington responded to the GCC initiative on Monday in a statement which  said Saleh has agreed to transfer powers in accordance with the Yemeni Constitution, which means he will not step down from power until his term ends in 2013.
"The opposition is now the one going against the GCC initiative," said Ganadi.
There was no mention of that proposal in the statement released by the Yemen government.
An eyewitness claims hundreds of protesters attended an anti-government march in streets of Sanaa, and other cities across Yemen.
"We will not differ with the revolution youth and we will support them," Yahya Abu Osbaa, a senior JMP official said.
"In the end, I can assure you that we will agree on terms," Osbaa said.
