(CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said Thursday that he is breaking off relations with Colombia.
Venezuela recalled its ambassador to Colombia on Friday in reaction to the accusations of protecting rebels.
Colombia has accused Chavez of supporting the rebels, and Chavez has said Colombian officials and right-wing paramilitary units have plotted his assassination.
Colombia said it had evidence that shoulder-fired anti-tank weapons recovered from FARC guerrillas were of Venezuelan origin.
