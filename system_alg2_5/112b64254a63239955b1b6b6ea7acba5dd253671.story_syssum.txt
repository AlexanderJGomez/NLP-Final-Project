Young Benoit dreamed of wrestling like the Dynamite Kid, whose real name is Tom Billington.
When asked about Benoit's double murder-suicide, Billington told CNN, "It can make you aggressive, the steroids.
And from the steroids, he said.
McMahon, appearing with Linda McMahon, his wife and WWE CEO, told CNN: "Nothing from the WWE, under any set of circumstances had anything to do with Chris Benoit murdering his family.
"Our policy stacks up just as well as anyone else's in sport, although again emphasizing we are entertainment, and no one in entertainment, no one has this kind of wellness policy," McMahon said.

McMahon denies that his wrestlers are pushed to use steroids.
