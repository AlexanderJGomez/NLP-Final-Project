New York (CNN) -- A former Army sergeant is facing conspiracy charges in a federal sting operation that focused on a team he allegedly supervised in what the team thought was international drug trafficking and planned killings, according to the U.S. attorney in Manhattan.
The story as spelled out in a federal indictment starts in early 2012 when Hunter believed he had made contact with Colombian drug traffickers.
The men Hunter thought were Colombian traffickers "were in fact confidential sources for the DEA," according to the indictment.
There are references to talks among the alleged team members about "bonus work," which Hunter explained meant assassinations, the indictment said.
But the indictment did not elaborate on those purported killings or say where or when they supposedly took place.
Hunter was arrested in Thailand and was expected to arrive in New York on Friday evening.
Vamvakias and Gogel, who also were arrested abroad, were brought to New York and were in court Thursday afternoon.
