Apparently, Chief Charlie Beck thinks it is tolerable to have officers on the beat who use the N-word -- as a bar security guard alleged Hillman did -- and refer to young black men as "monkeys," as Hillman can be heard doing on the audio recording.
When I think about officer Hillman's alleged encounter, I am reminded again of the troubling overrepresentation of black men in the criminal justice system.
If black men are more likely to be seen as perpetrators of violence, are cops justified in being more wary of black men?
In our communities, police officers are the face of authority.
By allowing the officer who allegedly made these racial slurs to remain on the force -- even after a disciplinary board rules that he should be fired -- LAPD Chief Beck has sent a message to all young black men in Los Angeles that his officers are not to be trusted.
Whatever you say will be put in the police report, and it will be used against you by the prosecutor.
We can start with demanding action from LAPD Chief Charlie Beck.
