The National Transportation Safety Board recommended on Tuesday that all 50 states adopt a blood-alcohol content (BAC) cutoff of 0.05 compared to the 0.08 standard on the books today and used by law enforcement and the courts to prosecute drunk driving.
Hersman said progress has been made over the years to reduce drunk driving, including a range of federal and state policies, tougher law enforcement, and stronger advocacy.
Under current law, a 180-pound male typically will hit the 0.08 threshold after four drinks over an hour, according to an online blood alcohol calculator published by the University of Oklahoma.
States set their own BAC standards.
But over the next 24 years, Mothers Against Drunk Driving and other groups pushed states to adopt the 0.08 BAC standard, the last state falling in line in 2004.
In recent years, about 31 percent of all fatal highway accidents were attributed to alcohol impairment, the NTSB said.
Many of the recommendations "are going to be unpopular," Sumwalt said.
The NTSB has asked all 50 states to do the same.
The safety board also recommend that NHTSA provide financial incentives to states to carry out the changes.
The NTSB recommended last December that states require ignition interlocks for all DUI offenders and said states should improve interlock compliance.
