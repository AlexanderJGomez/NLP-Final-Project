Now the estate of Marshall is releasing some of the never-before-seen photos of the band in a new book "The Rolling Stones 1972" (Chronicle Books), out on August 15.
(Marshall died in 2010.)
"He really was everywhere with the musicians on the tour bus or offstage," Davis said.
Marshall's ability to camouflage without disturbing the band's dynamic also allowed him to experience the touring life of the Rolling Stones, Davis said.
"He partied with them.
"Mick was very business-oriented," Davis said.
"Jim was always trying to show the true face of whatever he photographed," Davis said.
He said, 'I was a historian with a camera and I didn't know it.'
