What the #@!%?
On Monday, Microsoft confirmed it's trying to clean up language in its online community.
Because Skype often was one of the apps suspended, some players said they thought their behavior on the voice-calling service was being monitored.
And as I don't think that language deemed by some as 'foul' should be banned while playing games, I don't think that it should be banned in uploaded videos of games being played."
Microsoft said players who run afoul of its rules are being temporarily suspended from using certain apps, not banned from Xbox Live indefinitely.
