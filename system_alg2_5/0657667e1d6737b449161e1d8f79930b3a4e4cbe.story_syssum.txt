Jeb Bush's surprise announcement that he'll "actively explore" a presidential bid Tuesday morning did little to dissuade his potential Republican opponents from the race.
And Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's spokesman, Alex Conant, said while Rubio has "a lot of respect" for Bush and thinks he'd make "a formidable candidate," Bush's decision has no bearing on his own.
But a source close to Rubio said Tuesday that while Tuesday's announcement changes the dynamic of the race, the junior Florida senator is still "on track to run for president" in 2016.
But even though Bush is seen as one of the top establishment picks in the primary if he runs, it was clear Tuesday morning he'll still have some work to convince some party leaders.
Rob Portman, considered a possible vice presidential pick, told reporters he has talked to Bush recently about a potential campaign.
New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, also seen as a possible vice presidential pick, noted Bush has yet to stop by her state — which hosts the first primary in the nation — to meet with grassroots activists.
"It will make a difference how hard the candidates work in terms of meeting the activists and answering the hard questions," Ayotte said.
