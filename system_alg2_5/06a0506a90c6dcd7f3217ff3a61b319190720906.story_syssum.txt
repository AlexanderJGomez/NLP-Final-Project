In 1988, Nicotero co-founded KNB EFX group, a popular effects studio for film and TV, and went on to establish a reputation in Hollywood.
Nicotero, who still runs KNB, has now become involved in the theme park business by acting as a consultant for Universal Studios Orlando's "Walking Dead" attraction at their Halloween Horror Nights event.
Greg Nicotero: I appreciate you saying that because every season when I watch the show, I'm constantly looking at what I feel people responded to and what people like, and what I thought was successful or could be refined.
So the teeth don't clip onto the actor's teeth but the teeth attach inside the prosthetic, so you don't have to put custom dentures into every single performer.
I am really proud of Season Four and where the show is going.
The show has been able to attract quite a significant fan base, and what interested me in this collaboration was giving fans a little more of an interactive experience.
What Universal Orlando has been able to do is put fans directly in the middle of the experience.
NIcotero: I am a movie fan.
They're going to connect themselves to the experience, and they now know what it's like to be on the set of "The Walking Dead."
There was a 30th anniversary screening of "Day of the Dead," and I went and hadn't seen George in about two years.
"Dawn of the Dead" and "Jaws" teeter back-and-forth as the number one movie that I loved, and which influenced me.
... Robert Kirkman's comic book is really a love letter to George Romero.
The thing I love the most is I've been doing this 30 years, and every day I come to work and still learn more.
It really is the ultimate position, creatively, for me.
