Lubitz, the co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525 who authorities accuse of deliberately crashing the plane, told his Lufthansa flight training school in 2009 that he had a "previous episode of severe depression," the airline said Tuesday.
Medical records reveal that Lubitz was suicidal at one time and underwent psychotherapy before he got his pilot's license, prosecutor's spokesman Christoph Kumpa said.
Investigators are looking into whether Lubitz feared his medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot's license, a European government official briefed on the investigation into last week's crash told CNN on Tuesday.
Lubitz told the neuropsychologist that he was too stressed with work, the official said.
"One can hear cries of 'My God' in several languages," Paris Match reported.
The publications reported that they watched the video, which was found by a source close to the investigation.
He noted that investigators only revealed they'd recovered cell phones from the crash site after Bild and Paris Match published their reports.

The BEA, France's accident investigation agency, said its ongoing safety investigation was focusing on a more detailed analysis of the flight history leading up to the crash, based on the audio recovered from the cockpit voice recorder and any other available data.
