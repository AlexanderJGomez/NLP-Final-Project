(CNN) -- The woman who scrambled to safety after a small plane crashed into her Florida home gave thanks to God on Saturday for allowing her to escape without a scratch and for keeping her family safe.
"From what we've been told, the pilot was having some malfunctions in flight," said Chief Investigator Terry Duprie of the National Transportation Safety Board.
A preliminary NTSB report on the crash is expected in about 10 days, Duprie said, but the full investigation is expected to take many months.
Crockett said she was getting ready to leave her house when something told her to stop.
"I'm just praising God that I'm alive," Crockett said Saturday.
