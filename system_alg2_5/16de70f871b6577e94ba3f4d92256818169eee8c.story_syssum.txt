Will Michael Schumacher ever recover from the serious head injury he suffered in a skiing accident six months ago?
The only thing I want is that the recovery takes as quick as possible and to see him here with us."
"It's very positive to hear but, like I said, it's been many, many weeks and months since the incident and obviously you find yourself busy in Formula One thinking about a lot of things.
"The policy of the family is to keep everything very, very private.
"What tortures the public is the same thing that tortures the family --progress is slow, progress is uncertain," said Peter Hamlyn, a consultant neurological and spinal surgeon and expert in the field of head injuries in sport.
Hamlyn speaks from a very public, personal experience following his successful high-profile treatment of brain-damaged boxer Michael Watson.
Hamlyn, who operated to remove a blood clot on Watson's brain shortly after his collapse and then guided his slow and painful recovery, is credited with saving Watson's life.
"The thing about supreme athletes like Michael Watson and Michael Schumacher is that they have extraordinary physical reserves," Hamlyn said.
"I think that does come from the sort of tenacity, reserve and determination that you have to have if you're to get to the top of any world sport.
The families never gave up.
For the watching world, it is difficult to know how far Schumacher has come on his journey since the accident and how far there is to go.
"One day, some months into this business, Muhammad Ali came to see him at the hospital," recalled Hamlyn.
The world waits to see whether Schumacher, the ruthless racer, the sport's record-breaking world champion, can once again be his own inspiration.
