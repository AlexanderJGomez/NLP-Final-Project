And even when devices are broken or useless, I can't bring myself to landfill them -- I save them up for local electronics recycling drives.
(Cult of Mac, Wall Street Journal and many other venues are reporting the same problem.)
So I found a middleman to shield me from embarassment, keep my old iPhone out of the landfill and let me make some easy money all at the same time.
Admittedly, $93 is less than half of what people here in the Bay Area are asking today for an 8GB iPhone 3G on Craigslist (although that may not be the price they're actually getting).
My time is worth money.
Gazelle.com spokesperson Kristina Kennedy explained that the company, which buys over 20 categories of electronics products in addition to cell phones, ends up "finding new homes" for more than 90 percent of the used devices they buy.
"There tends to be a large secondary market for their used devices, which normally aren't very old."
The Gazelle.com site did not ask me which operating system is on my iPhone 3G.
"As phones become more like computers, we might start to pay closer attention to that."
