But in a battle of former world number one's, Sharapova was taken all the way by Ivanovic, who led by a set and 3-1 and looked set to take the keys of the Porsche herself.
Serbia's Ivanovic had underlined her improvement with a fine run to the title match, but was left to rue missed opportunities to close out the match in the second set.
Nishikori was always on top as he won his second title of the year and fifth of his burgeoning career.
He hit 19 winners to leave Giraldo with few opportunities to show his best in a one-sided match.
