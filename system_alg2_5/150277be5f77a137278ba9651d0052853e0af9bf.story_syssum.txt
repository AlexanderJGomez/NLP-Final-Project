William Jelani Cobb says Somalia's piracy problem was fueled by environmental and political events.
Clearly this escalating pattern of pirate attacks may soon constitute an international crisis.
And like Afghanistan, Somalia quickly fell into disarray after the Cold War ended and the United States cut off support.
The 9/11 attacks and Afghanistan's role in sheltering al Qaeda should have given us reason to re-examine other regions where similar blowback might take place.
In the wake of the government collapse, the Somali coast became a target of illegal commercial fishing.
To add to the burden, the coast also became a favorite locale for nuclear waste dumping.
Given the recent history of unstable states like Afghanistan and Iraq, piracy is actually one of the milder problems we could have expected from the region.
In light of this incident we should recognize there are two sets of victims here: innocent workers taken hostage by pirates and those people living along the poisoned and depleted Somali coast who may well see these pirates as heroes.
