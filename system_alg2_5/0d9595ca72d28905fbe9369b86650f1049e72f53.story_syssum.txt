The terrain also is inaccessible by road, Ecweru said.
"We have not found anyone alive today," Ntabadde said.
Most of the bodies were recovered from a hospital engulfed by the landslide after residents sought shelter, officials said.
The landslide occurred near Mount Elgon, on the Kenya-Uganda border.
