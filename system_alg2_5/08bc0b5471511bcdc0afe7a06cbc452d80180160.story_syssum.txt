"It was his time to relax," his wife's cousin, Josie Guerrero, said Saturday.
A young man boarded the bus, police said.
"Just as everyone in New York probably feels terrible about it, we feel terrible about it too," Anderson's lawyer, Frederic Pratt, told reporters, according to CNN affiliate WCBS.
Anderson allegedly belonged to Stack Money Goons and targeted a rival from another group known as TWAN Family, police said.
The couple has two children: a 12-year-old son, Saury, and 8-year-old daughter, April.
Guerrero said, "He was just sitting on a bus.
His laughter and his presence stayed with you."
