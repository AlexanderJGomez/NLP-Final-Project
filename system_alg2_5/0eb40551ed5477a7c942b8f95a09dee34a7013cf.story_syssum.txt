Incumbent Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad casts his vote in Tehran last week.
June 15 Khamenei agrees to an investigation into the disputed presidential election and asks opposition leader Moussavi to pursue his allegation of ballot fraud through legal means.
Moussavi supporters take to the streets in the largest protest since the 1979 revolution.
Ahmadinejad returns to Iran later the same day.
With rival rallies planned by backers of both Moussavi and Ahmadinejad in the center of Tehran, Moussavi urges his supporters to stay away, fearing further violence.
June 17 Iran's Revolutionary Guard, a powerful military force that enforces strict Islamic codes, threatens legal actions against Web sites it says are inciting violence.
June 18 Thousands of supporters of Mir Hossein Moussavi protest for a sixth consecutive day, many trading their green clothes for black garments in honor of at least eight protesters killed Monday.
June 19 In his first public appearance since the elections, supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei endorses Ahmadinejad's win, insisting the margin of victory -- some 11 million votes -- was too large to have been manipulated.
