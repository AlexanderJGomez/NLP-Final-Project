(CNN) -- Chief Clerk Walter Dimmick was convicted of stealing six bags of gold coins -- worth $30,000 -- from the U.S. Mint in San Francisco in 1901.
The treasure is known as the Saddle Ridge Hoard because it was discovered near a hill the couple called Saddle Ridge.
They dug and eventually discovered eight metal cans, containing more than 1,400 gold coins.
"If you had robbed the U.S. Mint in 1901, you'd have 1901, 1900, 1899 coins.
The coins, in $5, $10 and $20 denominations, date from 1847 to 1894.
"Nothing resonates like buried treasure," Kagin said, as a smile broke across his face.
"Unlike other hoards and treasures, this one includes a great variety of coins struck over many different years, and many of the coins are still in pristine condition," Kagin said.
