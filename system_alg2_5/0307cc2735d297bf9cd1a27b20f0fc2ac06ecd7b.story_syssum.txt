Staff at the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program in Charleston, South Carolina, allegedly shared information about the test on reactor operations among themselves, officials said of their findings so far.
Navy officials said staff must qualify to operate and instruct students on a training reactor.
Adm. John Richardson, director of the propulsion program, said the investigation is ongoing but did not disclose what information may have been exchanged.
But Richardson saw no parallels with the Air Force on that issue.
