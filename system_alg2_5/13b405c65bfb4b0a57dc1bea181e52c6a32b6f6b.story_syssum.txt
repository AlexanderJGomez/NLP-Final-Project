(CNN) --     More than 5,000 patients of a South Dakota urology clinic may have been exposed to hepatitis and HIV when the facility reused single-use medical products, state health officials said Friday.
On January 21, South Dakota Department of Health inspectors entered an examining room where a cystoscopy was about to take place, and noticed that a saline bag, which was hanging on a pole, was dated January 19, said Bob Stahl, of the South Dakota Department of Health.
He said the workers at the clinic told the inspectors they'd been reusing bags and tubing since the clinic opened in 2002.
He said that the clinic had been inspected seven times since it opened, and no one had noticed that the clinic was reusing equipment.
Fluids from patients can retreat into saline bags and tubing while the equipment is used, and reusing the tubing or saline bags could put patients at risk for contacting diseases from previous patients.
