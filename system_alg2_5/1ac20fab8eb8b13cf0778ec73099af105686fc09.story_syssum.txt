Look at any beer ad or wander into any beer garden and you'll realize that Bavarians absolutely revel in the traditional cliches about beer and go to great lengths to live up to them.
Then there's Sister Doris.
Only a small handful of women brew beer in Bavaria.
Which is why Sister Doris is so important.
What sets Mallersdorf apart from the handful of other surviving abbey breweries is that Sister Doris is the only remaining nun brewmaster -- in all of Europe.
In what must be the most unusual career move ever made by a nun, when Sister Doris took the veil she became a brewmaster instead, succeeding the elderly Franciscan sister who had been operating the abbey brewery since the 1930s.
She's proud that northern Bavaria has the largest number of female brewers in Germany.
Or to put it the other way around: the smaller the brewery and the closer the brewer is to the brewing process, the more flavorful the beer is likely to be.
To say that this is infinitesimal by industry standards is an understatement.
Not only is Sister Doris's beer -- luscious as it is -- not exported.
Drinkers need to travel to Germany, but even then, they may not have an easy go of it.
Mallersdorf Abbey has a "brand" and her name is Sister Doris.
