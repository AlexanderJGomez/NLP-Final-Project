New Delhi (CNN)If there were an annual prize for the "World's Most Hopeful Economy," it would likely go to India.
Modi has fashioned a role for himself not only as CEO of India Inc. but also as its global ambassador, with blockbuster speeches promoting India in New York, Tokyo and Sydney.
That suggests 2015 will be a defining year for India.
Let's start with economics.
India's government will look to use that money well.
In any case, India needs much more money and investment, likely from abroad.
Can Modi legislate as well as he can campaign?
He will look to strike deals not only with Obama, but with many other world leaders in 2015 -- on energy, trade, defense and infrastructure partnerships.
Can India remain everyone's friend?
Will Modi develop a values-based vision of India's place in the world?
In 2015, Modi will need not only to be a voice of reason, but he will also have to rein in radical fringe elements of his Hindu support base.
How can that be good enough for a country that aspires to be a major world power?
The pace of technology adoption, coupled with faster and cheaper hardware, will transform India in ways we are only just beginning to comprehend.
So, expect India to start leapfrogging many of the problems the West has spent decades dealing with: India has never had a real database of its citizens, but soon it will be the first country to have an entirely digital biometric ID system.
