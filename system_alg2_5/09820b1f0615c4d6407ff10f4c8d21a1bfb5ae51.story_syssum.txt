"My heartfelt and deepest sympathies go out to the family and loved ones, and to all of those who were involved or injured in this terrible accident," Jenner said in a statement released Sunday by his publicist, Alan Nierob.
Phillip Brooks of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department told CNN Sunday.
Jenner first catapulted to fame after winning the 1976 Olympic decathlon and now draws the celebrity spotlight for his role on the "Keeping Up With the Kardashians" reality show.
Jenner, 65, was not injured in the crash, publicist Alan Nierob said.
The department later opened a vehicular manslaughter investigation, a source close to the case told CNN legal analyst Mark Geragos.
Mike Parker of the Sheriff's Department tweeted.
The driver was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence, Parker wrote.
