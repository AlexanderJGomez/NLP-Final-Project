Austin, Texas (CNN) -- If 2011 was the year that South by Southwest Interactive grew up, 2012 may be when it decides it wants to don a suit and enter the corporate world -- or run off and join the Peace Corps.
Both events were turning points for SXSW Interactive -- known to festival veterans as "South By" -- which at the time was still recovering from some lean years after the dot-com bust.
Last year, the fest saw another spike, to nearly 20,000 attendees.
They're tasked with deciding what the future of Interactive will be in the face of more people, more programming and more interest in what is the festival's hot new tech.
"One of the tensions we faced this year is we've got lots and lots of the start-up stuff and that's very exciting, but at the same time, it's not completely what we're about."
For the first time, the festival will give out a Hall of Fame award at its Interactive Awards ceremony.
The 2011 festival also attracted the attention of Apple, which opened a pop-up store in downtown Austin to accommodate crowds clamoring for its just-launched iPad 2.
It's a cutting-edge gathering that hates pretension.
Like any ambitious 19-year-old, SXSW Interactive is restless, driven and hard to pigeonhole.
