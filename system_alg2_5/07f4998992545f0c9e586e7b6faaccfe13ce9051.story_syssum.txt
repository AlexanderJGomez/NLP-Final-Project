MADRID, Spain (CNN)  -- Human rights groups from the United States and Spain filed a lawsuit in a Spanish court Thursday, charging El Salvador's former president, Alfredo Cristiani, with covering up crimes against humanity.
The case filed by two human rights groups in Madrid argues that justice was never done in El Salvador.
The case was taken to Spain's National Court, because of its involvement in other high-profile human rights cases.
Family members from at least two of the slain Jesuits will join the lawsuit later, the groups said.
But a lawyer for the Center for Justice and Accountability told CNN that the most immediate practical effect of the case might be an effective ban on Cristiani and the 14 former officers from leaving El Salvador, for fear of arrest.
Ignacio Martin-Baro, another slain Jesuit, spoke at the time about the chilling effect of the long-running Salvadoran civil war.
Uniformed troops were seen searching the living quarters of the priests at Central American University two days before they were killed, CNN reported.
