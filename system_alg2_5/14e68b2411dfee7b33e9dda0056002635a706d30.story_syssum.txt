(CNN) -- How much is playing the same video game for a month worth?
Chavarria said he played the game for about 30 days before finally getting a perfect game that qualified him for the playoffs.
Chavarria got his perfect game with pitcher Kevin Slowey of the light-hitting Miami Marlins.
"It is a video game, so you don't have to be a star athlete or a pitcher in the MLB.
That was a lot of pressure gone and I didn't have to worry about it as much (after that)," he said.
Chavarria added another home run later in the game, and his pitching kept Holland's A's off balance as he won 3-1.
You just never know."
