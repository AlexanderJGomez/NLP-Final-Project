(Rolling Stone)  -- There are moments when "Move Like This," the first new album by the Cars in 24 years, sounds so much like a record by the Cars that you find yourself laughing out loud.
"Move Like This" is a reminder that New Wave can still sound new, especially when the Cars do it.
But the thing that has really set them apart is groove, and Ocasek is at his best in songs like "Keep on Knockin'," singing a jittery version of the boogie blues.
"Your eyes are dim, your heart is blue/'Cause nothing ever lasts," Ocasek croaks over chiming guitar arpeggios in "Take Another Look"; on "Sad Song," he sings, "It's just a sad song that pulls you along."
It pulls you along.
