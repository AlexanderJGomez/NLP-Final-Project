In 2011, the same year Peng was appointed as a U.N. goodwill ambassador for AIDS, Hao Yang tested positive for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, when he was trying to donate blood as a young military officer.
Although he still receives a monthly salary from the army, Hao Yang -- a pseudonym he uses to protect his identity -- feels his life is in limbo.
Their most recent outcry was triggered by a Commerce Ministry proposal that would bar people with HIV from entering bathhouses, including those offering spa and massage services.
"HIV transmission in a bathhouse or spa setting is not possible, and the use of such facilities by people living with HIV poses absolutely no risk from a public health perspective," the China office of UNAIDS said in a statement.
"Even people knowledgeable of HIV's transmission still feel scared because of many half-truths reported by the media," said the former sound mixer, 22, still fuming over the proposal's negative impact on his cause.
Last month, another HIV-positive man in Jiangsu Province sued local officials, when he was denied a government job despite scoring the highest among all applicants.
"What's really dreadful is the ignorance on HIV/AIDS and the prejudice against AIDS patients."
"We have brought the topic of HIV/AIDS into schools but we only talk about the harm caused by the disease," said Meng Lin, who tested positive for the virus some 20 years ago and now runs the China Alliance for People Living with HIV/AIDS.
