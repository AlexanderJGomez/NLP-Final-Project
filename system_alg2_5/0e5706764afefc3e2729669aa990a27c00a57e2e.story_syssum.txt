BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN) -- Federal officials said Monday they are probing allegations by a former investigator into the deadliest terrorist attack in Argentine history that he was kidnapped and tortured by men who said they were national intelligence agents.
Lifschitz said his abductors tortured him while asking about the AMIA investigation.
He was treated for injuries in a hospital.
Lifschitz, who has also worked as a lawyer for Argentine Federal Police, is the former legal secretary for Judge Juan Jose Galeano, who headed the investigation into local connections to the AMIA bombing until he was removed from the case.
Menem appeared in federal court Monday on an issue related to the AMIA attack investigation but declined to testify.
Lifschitz, who said he is a non-practicing Jew, also told CNN the men were interested in his religion.
Jewish leaders from around the world called for an investigation into the attack on Lifschitz.
Earlier this month, an Argentine court ordered the seizure of property owned by a former Iranian diplomat in Buenos Aires sought for his role in the 1994 AMIA attack.
