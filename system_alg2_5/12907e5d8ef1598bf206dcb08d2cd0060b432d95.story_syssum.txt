But in fact, the insanity defense is raised in less than 1% of felony cases, and it's only successful in a fraction of those.
The legal standard for insanity varies across America, with each state free to apply any number of tests developed over the last centuries.
This led to the development of another kind of test -- the "irresistible impulse" provision in many states, under which a defendant who can distinguish between right and wrong can still be absolved if he is still unable to stop himself from committing an act he knows to be wrong.
The Durham rule was also criticized as vague and overly broad; many states rejected the test, and in 1962, the American Law Institute, or ALI, announced yet another insanity defense, which enjoyed immediate popularity with many legislatures and judiciaries.
As it stands today, some 46 states have an insanity defense, and 45 of those have insanity tests based on either M'Naghten or the Model Penal Code tests.
Some states don't even have the insanity defense.
It may seem strange that a medical-sounding determination like insanity has different definitions from state to state.
Should our legal definition and recognition of illness and brain function vary from state to state?
Not only are the states free to develop disparate law in the field of legal insanity, but under the Constitution, they are encouraged to do so.
We'll reconvene after.
