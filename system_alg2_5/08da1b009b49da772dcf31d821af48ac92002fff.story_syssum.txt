But together these different perspectives strengthen our shared work both as chefs and as advocates.
Oxfam invited us to Haiti to meet some of the Haitian farmers and chefs who are planting seeds of hope in a country that has faced more obstacles than any community should rightly be expected to overcome.
They are working to build a stronger Haiti that can prosper and thrive.
The gardens offer the prospect of a new way to earn a living -- growing fresh, healthy food for their community.
The innovation, ingenuity and hope we saw can create the foundations of a Haiti known for its food, culture and beauty rather than its poverty.
Together, Haitian people can lift themselves up and build a better future for their country.
