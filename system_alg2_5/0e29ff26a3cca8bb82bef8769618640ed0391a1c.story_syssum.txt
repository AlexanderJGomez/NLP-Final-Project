(CNN) -- The reaction to the death of 23-year-old baseball player Christopher Lane has been swift and far-reaching, stretching from America's heartland to his home in Australia.
That range of emotion is palpable on a website created to raise money for Christopher's family to fly to the United States and take his body back to Australia.
"I pray for your family, and Christopher, in the hopes that you may find peace after this tragedy.
Please find some comfort in knowing that he is in good company with the Lord now."
"The first thing that you would notice about Chris was his strong Australian accent, which would just draw people toward him, especially in Oklahoma where most people have never heard it other than in the movies," he said in a statement.
You wanted to talk to him because he was the kind of guy who you could tell anything, one of those people you just loved to be around.
It just breaks my heart knowing how much more he could have brought to this world as a husband, father, son, brother and friend."
