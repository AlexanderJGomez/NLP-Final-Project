Specifically, 24 percent of people polled in the 2009 Deloitte Survey of Health Care Consumers decided not to seek medical care when they were sick or injured.
They either didn't have medical insurance coverage or they perceived the cost of such care to be excessive, according to the survey, which was released early Tuesday to CNN by the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions, a nonpartisan, independent research center.
There has been a lot of perceived loyalty and commitment in health care, Keckley said, and many providers think patients will stay with them.
I sense a lot of people feeling unnerved by having to choose less [insurance] coverage because that's all they can afford," Stoll told CNN.
Last month, the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation released its own health-care survey findings, with even greater numbers reflecting cutbacks in spending on medical services and treatments.
