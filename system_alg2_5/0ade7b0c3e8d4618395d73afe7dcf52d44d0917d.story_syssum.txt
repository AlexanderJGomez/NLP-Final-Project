Denise Lee's frantic 911 call was the centerpiece of her killer's trial.
They had maintained a daily presence in the courtroom during a trial that included the heartbreaking tape of Denise Lee's frantic 911 call on her captor's cell phone.
Denise Lee's father and husband had hoped for the death penalty.
Several jurors had tears in their eyes as Nathan Lee described his wife as a devoted mother who was nursing one son and potty-training another when a stranger abducted her from their home.
One expert described the injury as a "divot" in his brain.

Lee's husband has launched a foundation bearing her name that works toward 911 reform.
