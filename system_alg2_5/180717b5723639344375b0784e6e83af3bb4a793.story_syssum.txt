Alexandria, Egypt (CNN) -- Emotional congregants returned to their church Sunday in Alexandria, Egypt, mourning the loss of fellow worshippers in a bombing a day earlier.
Evidence indicates that a suicide bomber caused the blast, the country's interior ministry said Saturday, though witnesses reported seeing a car parked outside the church explode.
"What did we do to them?
The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom said in November that 10 Coptic Christian homes and several businesses were burned and looted in Qena province in southern Egypt following rumors of a romantic relationship between a Christian man and Muslim woman.
"In the beginning, we thought the attack was sectarian, to be honest," he said Sunday.
A nearby mosque was also damaged in the blast and eight Muslims were among the wounded, the interior ministry said.
Authorities believe the bomber was killed in the blast, Egypt's Interior Ministry said in a statement Saturday.
