The message was an invitation to try something called AMI Bar Link.
.
The more recent app-enabled jukeboxes -- there is competition in the field; AMI is not alone -- are based upon a perceived desire: that customers in bars and restaurants are eager to pull out their smartphones, gaze at the little screens, see a full selection of the songs on the jukebox that's across the room, then, in AMI's words, take advantage of "a greatly improved user interface and a variety of new features, including automatic check-ins, better search capabilities, and a more secure purchasing process."
For starters, is it really such a burden to stand up and walk the few feet to a jukebox?
Jukeboxes, though ... well, jukeboxes were never meant to be regarded from a distance.
What could be simpler: Head over to the jukebox, commune with its list of songs, feed it some money, listen to the music you've chosen.
It's certainly worth getting up from your seat.
There is, at least symbolically, a throwback aspect to the app plan: Americans who are old enough may remember the little wall-box jukeboxes that were mounted next to booths in some restaurants, for the convenience of customers in mid-meal.
Let people, at their homes, in their cars, at their offices play personal music on their phones to their hearts' content.
Now, that would be something worth getting out of your seat to see.
