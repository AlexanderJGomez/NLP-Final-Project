(CNN) -- Polygamist sect leader Warren Steed Jeffs, who is awaiting trial in southern Utah, was charged with eight additional felony counts from Arizona in two separate cases, authorities said Thursday.
According to Arizona law, sexual conduct with a minor is a Class 6 felony punishable upon conviction by up to a year in prison.
At the time, Shumate said the delay was due to "recent information in the case," but he did not elaborate.
Jeffs previously was charged in Arizona with two counts of sexual conduct with a minor for allegedly presiding over arranged marriages, along with an additional charge of conspiracy.
At the time, he had been on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted List for months.
