(CNN) -- Charlie Sheen has filed a lawsuit against adult film actress Capri Anderson, claiming she tried to extort money from him following an October incident at New York's Plaza Hotel, a representative for the actor told CNN Monday.
She answered that she was in  shock, "I never expected the night to unfold the way it did," said  Anderson.
Anderson said she was offered $3,500 to appear at a dinner party with the actor.
Sheen spent several hours in a New York hospital in October after police responded to an early morning call about "an emotionally disturbed person" at The Plaza Hotel, a law enforcement source said.
