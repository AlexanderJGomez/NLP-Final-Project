(CNN) -- Google is tightening its grip on the booming tablet market, with a new tablet, updated version of Android and a social take on games.
The streaming-video company's new Android app will stream movies at 1080p on the Nexus 7.
The device will run Android Jelly Bean 4.3, a new version of Google's Android operating system.
Many of those users are downloading content such as apps, music and movies from the Google Play store.
Older Nexus devices will also be able to test out the Android upgrade -- existing Nexus 4, Nexus 7, Nexus 10 and Galaxy Samsung devices will receive over-the-air updates for the operating system.
