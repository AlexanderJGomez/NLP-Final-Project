"Queens Day will never be the same," the Trouw newspaper said.
And will we continue to see the members of the royal family cycling through the canals of Amsterdam or hunting for bargains in the Bijenkorf in The Hague?"
Although Queen Beatrix's birthday is January 31, she officially celebrates her birthday April 30, according to the Dutch government.
The day is marked with the color orange all over the country as a reference to the colors of the royal family, who come from the House of Orange-Nassau.
