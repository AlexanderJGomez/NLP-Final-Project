Martin was a model and aspiring art therapist, described as Native American on her page on iStudio.com, which says it serves "the modeling, photography, and associated industries."
With that move, the combined Anheuser-Busch InBev became the world's largest brewer.
August Busch IV is the only representative of the family -- and its former namesake company -- on the Anheuser-Busch InBev board of directors.
