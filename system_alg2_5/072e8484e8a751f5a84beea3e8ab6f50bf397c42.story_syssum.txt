(CNN) -- It seems like the opposite of what you'd expect, but my cancer diagnosis -- a staggering Stage IV colon cancer diagnosis, delivered to me at the age of 28 -- gave me a new lease on life.
And it has.
And I will continue to fight until cancer gives up, because there's no way I will.
I manage stress levels and I make sure I always get enough sleep.
Becoming sick was the way I learned how to be well.
That's because they are.
A simple but revolutionary initiative that sees every penny donated going to cutting-edge research that I hope will get us to the cure for colon cancer in under 10 years.
The cure.
If you had all the money in the world, could you cure colon cancer?
It sounds like an impossible goal -- to find the cure for cancer -- but it is possible.
I think that I always knew, deep down, that it was the end of the line for cancer.
And through The Wunder Project, I know it will be.
