Mushfiqur Rahim delayed the end with a stroke-filled 101 after opener Tamim Iqbal bolstered the innings with 52, but the home side -- 67 for two at the start of play -- were bowled out for 301.
But Sehwag brought himself on just before the lunch interval and struck in his second over, luring Tamim into a wild slash and inducing the edge, Dravid completing the dismissal with a sharp catch at slip.
But that reprieve hardly proved costly as Mishra held a low return catch from Shafiul in the next over to send back the batsman.
Mishra, however, brought up victory by prising out Mushfiqur, the wicketkeeper-batsman lofting the bowler over the top, but only finding the fielder at long-off.
