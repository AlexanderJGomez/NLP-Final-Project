(CNN) -- Toronto police made a gruesome discovery Wednesday when they opened a suitcase that two boaters on Lake Ontario had towed back to shore.
A post-mortem examination is scheduled for Thursday.
Wednesday's discovery of the suitcase came one week after a woman's torso was found in the Canadian portion of the Niagara River.
The Niagara River case is not related to Liu's death, police have said.
