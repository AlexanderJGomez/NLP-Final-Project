More than 100 undocumented children without families were expected to arrive in Arizona from south Texas on Sunday as part of a federal transport of underage immigrants to the state by the Department of Homeland Security, a spokesman said.
Although children crossing the border alone has long been an issue, the recent spike could be attributed to better weather or worsening economic conditions in their home countries, officials said.
As of late last week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement was no longer releasing "large family groups" at the bus stops in Arizona, a DHS spokesman said, but children under age 17 are continuing to be transferred to the state.
There's no one (back home) to deport them to," a DHS spokesman told CNN.
The record spike in migrants coming from Central America and crossing into the United States via Mexico is not expected to slow down, a spokesman told CNN.
Last year, roughly 10% of people caught by Border Patrol agents were minors, according to a Border Patrol official.
