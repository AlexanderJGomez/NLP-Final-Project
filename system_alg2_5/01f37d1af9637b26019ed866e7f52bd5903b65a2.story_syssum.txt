Washington (CNN) -- Macy Friday can't remember what she was thinking when -- mouth agape, eyes bugged -- she shook hands with Hillary Clinton in Denver this week.
What does she like about Hillary Clinton?
I was just like, 'Wow.'
They went into a coffee shop and we were like, 'Oh no, they are going to leave.'
(long pause) I turned back at my family and I, like, I, you know, made the face.
And she is just a good role model for girls because, you know, she is just sort of, like, to everybody, 'Girls can be awesome, too.'
And her niece's name is Macy.
Did I already say Taylor Swift?
Macy: Maybe!
Macy: Yes, totally.
CNN: Thanks Macy...
