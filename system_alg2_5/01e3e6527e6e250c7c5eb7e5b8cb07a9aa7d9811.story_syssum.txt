(CNN) -- As Michael Ballack finally calls time on his 17-year professional career, German football can bask in the knowledge they boast the best two teams in Europe.
"In Germany we have a situation now where Dortmund and Bayern are far, far more away from the other teams, and that's what we don't want to see in the Bundesliga," said Ballack, who has 98 Germany caps to his name.
Shortly before the end of the season it was announced that Mario Gotze -- one of Dortmund's best players -- would be joining Bayern for $49 million, with striker Robert Lewandowski expected to make a similar move in the coming weeks.
"It is just Bayern Munich who has this good position, and from a financial point really good, and really healthy.
But if you see this Bayern Munich team now, I can't really see where he needs to change.
"But on the other side, like I said, you can't really change a lot because everything works well.
And Ballack, who won one Premier League title and two FA Cups in his four years at Chelsea, and three Bundesliga crowns with Bayern, says his time with Mourinho was a golden spell in his career.
He's a charismatic manager and I really enjoyed working with him for two years and most of the players as well I can say.
And that's what I can say is special, because his attitude, his personality, if he comes in front of the group if he talks to us.
