"I think it will change the whole industry," says Sengeh, who is from Sierra Leone.
"Seeing people who had lost their limbs and whose lives were just kind of cut short was very, very traumatizing," says Sengeh, who is from Bo, the West African country's second biggest city.
Next, he got into Harvard to study at its School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, before joining MIT's Media Lab.
He had realized early on that many amputees in Sierra Leone opted not to use any prostheses because of the discomfort they were causing them.
One of the young students Sengeh mentors through this initiative is Kelvin Doe, a 15-year-old boy who created a radio station from scrap materials and discarded electronics.
"We do have the talent and young people within Sierra Leone, within Africa as a whole, to invent the future," he says.
Those are what's needed to develop products that will change the world.
