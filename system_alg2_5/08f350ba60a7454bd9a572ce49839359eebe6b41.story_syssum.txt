(CNN) -- "Borderlands 2" wants to raise the stakes and improve upon its signature art style and outlandish weapons while broadening the story on the planet of Pandora.
The other class available for play was the "Siren."
The art style remains the same as in the original, with its familiar hand-painted look and dark outlines.
Varnell said bringing an antagonist to the plot gave the team more options to make the story personal for the players.
he said.
"In 'Borderlands,' (designers thought) it was just a fact that as a four-player (co-op) game, the vehicle had two seats," he said.
Little refinements, he hopes, will make the gameplay and the experience even more enjoyable for fans of the franchise as well as new players who are seeing Pandora for the first time.
More than 200 unique types of creatures will be in the way of players as they work their way through the game quests and other missions.
The player characters from "Borderlands" will also show up in the new game as nonplayer characters, providing backstory and missions for the gamers to complete.
