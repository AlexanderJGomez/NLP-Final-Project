But for Aerin Lauder, the 44-year-old granddaughter of Estée Lauder, who founded the eponymous make-up company, the legacy has been an inspiration rather than a burden.
AL: It is an amazing legacy and I think she is always looking down at me very proud.
We traveled every weekend, I experienced incredible new cultures, museums, cities and it really opened up my eyes.
It's the idea that every woman can be beautiful, which is a concept Estée has which is still so modern today.
AL: I think it is very important to learn to say "no."
AL: I think you can get inspiration from anything.
I think the Internet is a great way to get inspiration.
