NEW YORK (CNN) -- For someone who claims to be incredibly laid back, Jason Mraz is certainly piling up the accomplishments.
"To have the music shared all around the world, and to be acknowledged by communities like this ... it's inspiring."
A fan of maintaining a diet of predominantly raw foods, Mraz is also a farmer of sorts: He owns an avocado farm in his home city of San Diego, California.
What's that like?
Yes, the trees give me avocado and fruit that we sell and we eat tons of, but I feel like I have a role to play back to that, too.
Mraz: I do, thank you.
Mraz: I do.
Mraz: Well, I bring tons of backup supplies with me.
Mraz: I loved it.
I was like, "What does he think?"
I just don't know that I could commit myself to something like that.
Mraz: Very surprised.
Where were you?
Mraz: I was at home.
Mraz: This year we're going to explore South America, which I've visited as a tourist, but I've never taken my music down there.
I love Spain.
