Cooper took up the "Fusion Journey" challenge to travel from New Zealand to New Delhi, India's capital.
There she was tasked with creating a new fashion line that would combine her own sophisticated modern style with the vibrant, brightly colored traditions of Indian dress-making.
It's one of the very best places in the world to find that expertise still thriving.
So in one sense, I've been fusing my clothes with Indian influences for a while.
In fact, when it comes to bold use of colors and the use of these rich, deep dyes, how can anyone deny the huge influence of India on fashion around the world?
I recall a beautiful woman wearing a sari in bright, radiant pink mixed with a lime green print.
However, what I took back to New Zealand, was their techniques, their intense celebratory colors, their detailed embellishments, their expert use of beads and sequins.
But I'll only know I have finished the creative process when someone comes in and says that, no matter what, they have to have it.
