Sandra Cantu, 8, had been missing almost two weeks before her body was found.
But today she is skipping on the streets of gold, into the arms of a loving God", said Brent Ives, mayor of Tracy.
A private memorial service for Sandra was held Wednesday.
Her casket, signed by classmates, was taken to a nearby burial site by a horse-drawn carriage.
