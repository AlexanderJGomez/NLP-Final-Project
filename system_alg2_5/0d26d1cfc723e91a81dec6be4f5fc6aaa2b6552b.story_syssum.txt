After inpatient rehab, Felicia Anderson sought help from Mothers Making a Change to help beat her addiction.
Anderson spent three weeks in residential treatment -- all she could afford -- but didn't think that was enough, so she enrolled in Mothers Making a Change, a year-long outpatient drug and alcohol program in Atlanta, Georgia.
Anderson was both.
"I can say with everything in me, with every bit of my breath, that program helped me turn my life around," said Anderson, who now runs a program to help the developmentally disabled in DeKalb County, Georgia.
Anderson began drinking and smoking marijuana in high school.
And she began stealing to keep her children clothed and fed and to support her habit.
The crack was my job.
Anderson said she even smoked crack as she went into labor with her second child.
He convinced the judge to let Anderson and her two daughters come to Georgia with him and to let his sister check into rehab instead of going to jail.
And laying there at that moment, I did say to myself, 'I can do this.
Anderson now has everything she had lost for a big part of her adult life: a stable home life, a job.
