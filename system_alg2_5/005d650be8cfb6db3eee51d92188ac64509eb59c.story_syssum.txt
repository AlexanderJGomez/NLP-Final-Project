Israeli airstrikes killed at least five more people in Gaza on Saturday, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA reported.
The Israel Defense Forces said that, since the end of the cease-fire early Friday, about 100 rockets were fired toward Israel from Gaza.
That figure includes at least 30 launched Saturday, of which 24 hit Israel, the military said.
According to el-Qedra, at least 1,911 in Gaza have died since the conflict began, in addition to just under 10,000 injured.
Israeli officials say 64 Israeli soldiers have died, and three civilians were killed in Israel.
Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said it was Hamas' fault regardless, telling CNN the group runs Gaza and "can't outsource terrorism to the other groups.
The two groups have been at odds but also made repeated efforts at a unity government, including one earlier this year.
Palestinians also wanted Israel to extend Gaza's fishing zone in the Mediterranean from three miles off the coast to 20.
Yet Israel is resisting in-depth talks as long as rockets continue to head toward its territory.
