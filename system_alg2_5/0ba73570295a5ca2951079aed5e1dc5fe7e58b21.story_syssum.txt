Some of those students, at one point or another, were believed to be hostages in one of the four dormitories on campus.
"I am lucky to be alive, because I jumped through the fence with other students."
And that's largely thanks to Al-Shabaab.

It's too early to tell what the future now holds for Garissa University College.
