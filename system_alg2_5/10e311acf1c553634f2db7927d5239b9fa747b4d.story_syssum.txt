NATO urged Russia to keep its word this time and withdraw troops along Ukraine's eastern border, saying it has seen no signs of soldiers returning to their bases.
"I think it's the third Putin statement on withdrawal of Russian troops ... but so far we haven't seen any withdrawal at all,"  he said.
... Russia should stop their support for these armed groups,"  he said.
"The fact is that Russia has been maintaining significant forces in forward deployment areas along Ukraine's border," the official said.
The official said  the White House is monitoring the issue for evidence of withdrawal.
He did not provide any more details.
Over the weekend, the Russian Foreign Ministry accused Ukrainian troops of attacking Ukrainian citizens and questioned whether Sunday's scheduled elections could be held amid the chaos.
