Obama said his administration is trying to clean up "a mess" left behind by the Bush administration.
In the past two months, the former vice president has become a frequent critic of the new administration in numerous national media interviews.
"The administration asserts that transferring terrorists from a detention facility on an isolated island to a prison inside the U.S. will make Americans safer.
Following in the steps of House Democrats, Senate Democrats on Tuesday rejected the administration's request for $80 million to close the facility.
Obama on Thursday pledged not to release any Guantanamo Bay detainees who threaten the United States.
And Michael Steele, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said it would be "dangerous, naive and a threat to America's national security" to put detainees on U.S. soil.
The American people don't want to know how closing Guantanamo Bay will make us more popular, they want to know how closing Guantanamo Bay will make us safer," he said.
We have the best justice system in the world," he said.
Former Navy lawyer Charles Swift, who won a landmark Supreme Court ruling that knocked down the Bush administration's system of military commissions, said U.S. laws already cover the "vast majority" of cases the Obama administration will face.
As far as former President Bush's thoughts on the dueling speeches, he didn't watch them.
