But in his most recent film, "Observe and Report" -- a dark comedy co-starring Seth Rogen as a bipolar mall security guard and Anna Faris as the vapid make-up counter clerk he's in love with -- Liotta inches away from his edgy persona to play a detective investigating a flashing incident at the mall.
Liotta first made his mark on the film industry by playing a psychotic ex-husband determined to win back his ex-wife in "Something Wild."
He formed his own production company in 2002 and made his debut as a producer on the film "Narc," in which he also starred as a corrupt cop.
In 2004, Liotta starred in an episode of the hit NBC drama, "ER," winning an Emmy for his guest appearance.
