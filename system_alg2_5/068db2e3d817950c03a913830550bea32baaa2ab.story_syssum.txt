Only one of those five states, Virginia, has a contested U.S. Senate race this year.
Of those states, three -- Colorado, Kansas and North Carolina -- are home to big Senate races.
Sure, vulnerable Southern Democrats -- like Sen. Mary Landrieu in Louisiana and Kay Hagan in North Carolina -- may be wary of letting social issues become a prominent force in the midterms, as they tend to galvanize conservative bases.
While Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said conservatives are right to be outraged by the courts' action on the issue, he doubts same-sex marriage will become a big force in the elections next month.
I think the states should.
With half of Virginia voters supporting same-sex marriage, according to a Quinnipiac poll earlier this year, a Republican candidate running for a statewide seat would almost need to take a measured approach on the issue.
In Colorado, Republican Cory Gardner -- who's angling to oust Democratic Sen. Mark Udall -- has yet to comment on the Supreme Court decision.
Over in North Carolina, where Republican Thom Tillis is working to unseat Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan in the most expensive race this year, neither candidate has commented on the decision.
The issue could also come up in Kansas, another one of the six extra states affected.
