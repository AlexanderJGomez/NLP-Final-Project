Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A strong storm system made driving dangerous in the Rockies and the upper Plains and contributed to a pileup involving about 100 vehicles Thursday near Fargo, North Dakota, officials said.
Abel Maldonado declared a state of emergency for Mariposa County Thursday because of extreme weather and storm conditions.
Officials in Mariposa County, which describes itself as the home to Yosemite National Park, had earlier declared a local emergency, Maldonado said in the proclamation.
A series of Pacific storms have created the wettest December ever throughout southern California, according to National Weather Service recording stations in Los Angeles, Long Beach, Camarillo, Santa Barbara and Santa Maria.
Snow, ice and low visibility snarled traffic, and parked cars made it difficult for some of the nearly 300 state snowplows to do their work, Tait said.
This week's storms were also "a contributing factor" in the death of a 70-year-old woman in a northern California exotic wildlife preserve, authorities said Wednesday.
Weather specialist Stuart Seto said this week's rainstorms, pushed by a cold front out of the Gulf of Alaska, didn't produce major debris or mudslides on Tuesday or Wednesday.
The Alaskan front brought low temperatures to southern California Thursday and is expected to bring freezing temperatures to the Los Angeles suburb of Woodland Hills, which could see 31 degrees Friday morning, Seto said.
