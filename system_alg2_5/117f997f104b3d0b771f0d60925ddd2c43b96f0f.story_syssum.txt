(CNN) -- The Supreme Court on Monday took away some of the government's power to tighten emission standards, but preserved the majority of its authority under federal law to regulate greenhouse gases.
Many conservative groups have characterized President Barack Obama as misusing his power and ignoring the will of Congress.
And the court's action will not end what are expected to be further court fights between the administration and industry.
The justices in 2007 agreed with EPA and many environmentalists that greenhouse gasses, including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions, cause air pollution, but that case dealt with emissions from motor vehicles.
"Today the U.S. Supreme Court delivered a stern rebuke to the President," said Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott.
Some progressive groups worry the conservative majority Supreme Court has been overly friendly to corporate interests in recent years.
