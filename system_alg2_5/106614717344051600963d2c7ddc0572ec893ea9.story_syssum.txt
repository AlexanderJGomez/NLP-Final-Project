At 21, Angie Sanclemente Valencia was crowned as Colombia's "Queen of Coffee."
But Sanclemente's career came to a screeching halt in May of 2010 when she was arrested in Argentina and charged with drug trafficking.
"I have been here [in prison] one year and seven months.
The former queen of coffee became known as "the queen of cocaine."
She says her Argentinian boyfriend and his uncle, who are also in prison, were indeed involved in drug trafficking, but not her.
Moving to Argentina from Mexico, Sanclemente says in retrospect, was a big mistake.
She was dethroned as Colombia's queen of coffee for breaking the rules by having been married.
