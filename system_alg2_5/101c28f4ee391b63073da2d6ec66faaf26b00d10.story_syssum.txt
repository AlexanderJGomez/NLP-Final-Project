I'm not mad at Tiger Woods, or Nike.
Back in 2009, when Woods took his public plunge into disgrace by cheating on his wife with a long list of silicone-enhanced beauties, we criticized him for being a fake.
He's being honest with the public.
And good for Nike for standing by him through what was in the end just a personal flaw.
Don't be mad at Tiger.
Or, be mad at yourself.
Or, "One win will make my bosses happy and all will be forgotten?"
Just think of Super Bowl Champion Ray Lewis, who the NFL calls one of the best men to ever play the game.
Why?
Tiger got back up.
