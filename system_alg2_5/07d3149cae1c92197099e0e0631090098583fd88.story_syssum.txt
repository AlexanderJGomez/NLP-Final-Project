AUSTIN, Texas (CNN) -- Lady Bird Johnson, who was first lady during the 1960s and in her later years became an advocate for beautifying public landscapes, died Wednesday, family spokesman Tom Johnson said.
"Lady Bird Johnson embodied all that is beautiful and good about the great state of Texas," Perry said.
The former first lady was born Claudia Alta Taylor in 1912 in Karnack, Texas, a small town near the Louisiana line.
She hoped to become a newspaper reporter, but those plans changed after she met a 26-year-old congressional aide named Lyndon Baines Johnson.
She turned it around and later used the station as a base for a multimillion-dollar communications company based in Austin.
As the Johnsons moved into the White House, Lady Bird Johnson "went around and went to all of the staff that was remaining in their jobs, told them how happy she was to have them there," said Leticia Baldridge, Jacqueline Kennedy's former social secretary.
"She needed their help.
Lyndon Johnson died in 1973.
The center was renamed the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center in 1998.
