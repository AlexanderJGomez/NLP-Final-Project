The mood at the show was somber, said Bob Templeton of Crossroads of the West Gun Shows.
Jared Lee Loughner, 22, allegedly carried a knapsack to the shopping center, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation.
Bill Schaeffler of Tucson, among those at the show Saturday, said he knows gun control and high-capacity ammunition magazines will be hot topics.
"Being armed is the natural state of man," he said.
Federal law enforcement officials were on site to monitor buyers and sales activity, Templeton said.
