Without dissent and protest, there is no United States of America!
Every American, no matter if you're young or old; rich or poor; red state or blue state; Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, Native American; has the freedom to assemble and freedom of speech, which is at the heart of these protests.
Instead, they organized and mobilized to affect the political discourse in the Republican Party and have definitely had their voices heard.
What would this world be without protest?
We would have never seen freedom in Eastern Europe were it not without the people there, in the words of civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer, being "sick and tired of being sick and tired."
As a supporter of Occupy Wall Street, I understand fully the sentiment that is being expressed.
No, Occupy Wall Street is about trying to bring some decency and honesty back to an industry that used to have some.
This fight that Occupy Wall Street is engaged in is nothing short of a battle for the soul of this nation.
That mean the young and righteous Davids must protest, march, sit-in, work the halls of Congress and state capitals nationwide, and make it clear that as long as Wall Street, its lobbyists and political protectors continue to mistreat the common man and woman, they are our mortal enemy.
