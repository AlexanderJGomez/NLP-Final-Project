LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigeria has set its sights on making multibillion-dollar oil deals with China amid peace moves with militants.
The state-run China Daily reported in September that the China National Offshore Oil Corporation was negotiating with Nigeria over a $30 billion oil deal.
The talks are part of China's oil-buying binge this year.
Last week, the group said it was calling off the truce, but there have not been renewed attacks.
Nigeria hopes to leverage the fragile peace to reap big dollars from its oil industry, Ajumogobia said.
