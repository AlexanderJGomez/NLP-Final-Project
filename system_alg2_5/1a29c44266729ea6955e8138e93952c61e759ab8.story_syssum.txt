(CNN) -- My son Cole died two and a half years ago from neuroblastoma, a common childhood cancer, after suffering through multiple surgeries, chemotherapy injections and painful radiation therapy.
By talking to many other parents who have lost children to childhood cancer, I have come to understand that this pain will last until I am gone.
Pediatric cancer kills more kids in the United States than any other disease.
My dream was to see as much gold in September for Childhood Cancer Awareness Month as there is pink in October for Breast Cancer Awareness Month.
I just wanted the same for kids fighting cancer.
Lighting gold is the first step toward greater awareness of childhood cancer -- awareness that will hopefully lead to increased funding, which will lead to more research, that will hopefully lead to a cure for all types of childhood cancer.
After my son died, I had a difficult time going back to Boston; there were too many painful memories there.
