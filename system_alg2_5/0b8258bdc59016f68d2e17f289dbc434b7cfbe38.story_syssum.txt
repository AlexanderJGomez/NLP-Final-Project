(CNN) -- The remains of Amber DuBois, a 14-year-old San Diego, California-area girl who was missing for more than a year, have been found, police said Sunday.
Amber DuBois' parents, who police said were notified of their daughter's found remains Saturday, attended the press conference.
Authorities said last week they were investigating John Albert Gardner III, who pleaded not guilty Wednesday to raping and murdering Chelsea King -- another San Diego-area teen -- to determine whether he was connected to Amber DuBois' disappearance.
Maher did not mention any suspects during his brief news conference Sunday.
