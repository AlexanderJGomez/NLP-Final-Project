(CNN) -- Each Father's Day, I thank my father for giving me life -- twice -- the first time in the traditional sense and the second when he donated his kidney to me.
We kept our spirits high and our minds off the possibility of a failure or a postponement (if one of us got sick, for instance, or if my kidneys got worse and I needed dialysis) by making plans for the future -- all the things we wanted to do individually and apart.
Waiting for an organ on the regular transplant list may take years.
I believe that many more people would do what my father did for me if they knew more about the transplant process and outcomes.
It's the gift I've been giving him each year since we were in the OR side by side.
