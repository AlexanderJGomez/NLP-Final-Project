In August 1992, Becker and Stich had much to celebrate as the duo became the first German tennis team to win Olympic gold -- beating South Africa to claim the men's doubles title in Spain.
The Olympics had come at the height of the duo's rivalry, says Becker, with the pair not just the best tennis players in Germany but also the world, as they vied with one another for major honors.

Amid all this dressing room tension as players try to be the main man and with enmity between teammates potentially sinking any team, Abrahams warns that strong friendships between players can also bring complications.
"Strong characters like Becker and Stich can deal with an intense rivalry but the less robust cannot," says Abrahams.
We wanted to win the medal so we had to do well in doubles and we were professional enough to just go on that path."
