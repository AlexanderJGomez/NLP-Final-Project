(CNN)Two state senators in California are proposing legislation that would eliminate the "personal beliefs" exemption for parents who don't want their children to be vaccinated.
"As a pediatrician I have personally witnessed children suffering lifelong injury or death from vaccine-preventable infection," said Pan, who also wrote the California law that requires people who want to file a personal exemption to consult a doctor.
While once widespread in the United States, cases dropped significantly because of vaccines.
It's not clear when, where or how the child got the disease.
