BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN) -- Colombian emergency officials have begun evacuating 800 families from an area at high risk from the expected eruption of a volcano that killed at least six people in November.
The volcano's crater holds 52 million cubic meters (1.8 billion cubic feet) of lava, said Colombia's Caracol Radio.
The youngest victim was a year old.
Colombian emergency officials said Monday they are asking the 800 families where they want to be moved to, Caracol Radio said.
Officials also plan to install a microphone on Huila to detect any new rumblings from inside the volcano, Caracol said.
