But a new line of Harry Potter stamps released this week by the U.S.
As the former head of the American Philatelic Society (that's a stamp collecting society to the rest of us) noted:  "Harry Potter is not American.
But the "American experience" is not just colored by U.S. citizens.
This is not the first time a new set of stamps has caused controversy.
Why?
This very issue has caused friction between the Postal Service and the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee -- a body established in 1957 to evaluate and recommend to the USPS what should be chosen for stamps.
So I say it's time for the Postal Service to roll out stamps that will make money.
