But the outcry over Devyani Khobragade's treatment is drowning out the serious allegations of exploiting her employee, also an Indian national, and the pervasive violations against millions of other domestic workers around the world and in the homes of diplomats in America.
In reality, federal prosecutors say, the domestic worker received less than $600 a month and was forced to work far more than 40 hours a week.
But the treatment of domestic workers, who number more than 50 million worldwide and are one of every 13 female wage earners, is often even more degrading.
Cut off from their family and other sources of support, many feel they have little choice but to work under slavelike conditions.
The U.S. State Department has received dozens of allegations of abuse by foreign diplomats and by officials at the World Bank and other international financial institutions.
In another, a domestic worker for a former Philippine ambassador said she was forced to work 126 hours a week without pay.
The Khobragade case has raised good questions about the treatment of criminal suspects in the United States, including the use of routine strip searches.
Their treatment is just as important.
