"Whether it's Denali (the Alaska peak known officially as Mount McKinley) or the Florida high point, they all count equally the same."
But if you want to climb all 50 state high points, as Slayden has done, you need to bag the baby peaks along with the big ones.
"There are a lot of states where the actual high point is less than a 10-minute walk from your car," Slayden said.
But while all the highest and most challenging peaks are in Western states, Slayden has a soft spot for many of the little ones in the Midwest and coastal states of the South.
