George W. Bush, a fellow Texas Republican, ran for and won the presidency in 2000 and served two terms, the lawmaker told CNN.
Even if he served four years, then maybe.
The path to the presidency is especially challenging for Republican women and it contrasts sharply with Democrats who -- as buzz grows around Hillary Clinton -- may be poised to nominate the first female presidential candidate of either major party.
"Women should naturally be considered for the highest office in the land," Snowe said.
In each of the past 10 election cycles, GOP women have won a smaller percentage of primary elections for U.S. House seats than have their Democratic counterparts, according to a study by Rutgers University's Center for American Women and Politics, and only twice -- in 1994 and 2010 -- have more Republican than Democratic women run in primaries.
The group is also supporting Monica Wehby, an Oregon physician running for Senate, among other candidates.
The other challenge female candidates to federal office face is an "ideological shift to the far right among the Republican primary electorate," the study found.
But some senior Republican women say that despite plenty of lip service paid to elevating women within the party, representation at the federal level is paltry, and the performance trend in primaries shows fewer Republican women are winning in those races than just two decades ago.
"The Republican Party hasn't done the groundwork to build a strong bench of Republican women to launch a presidential candidacy."
Hutchison said.
"Republican women have to do what Hillary Clinton is doing.
... She's a good example of a case study for how women should model their efforts for running for office."
