Meanwhile, Democrats blamed the Bush administration for the financial crisis, while the White House pointed a finger at Congress.
Republican Rep. Roy Blunt of Missouri complained about not getting a heads-up about the bailout and said House Republicans are struggling to "understand a coherent strategy" about which firms get rescued and which ones don't.
"The most recent bailout initiated by the Bush administration -- that of AIG -- is just another example that George Bush is a failed manager," said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California.
White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said Congress could have done more to head off the crisis.
He also said the Federal Reserve should make sure the bailout plan protects well-paying jobs and helps Americans pay their bills.
"We're going to reform how Wall Street does business and put an end to the greed that has driven our markets into chaos," McCain said.
We'll make businesses work for the benefit of their shareholders and employees, and we'll make sure your savings -- IRA, 401(k) and pension accounts -- are protected."
