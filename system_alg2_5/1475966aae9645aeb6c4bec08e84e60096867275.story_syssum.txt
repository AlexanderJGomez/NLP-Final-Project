Washington (CNN) -- A federal budget compromise that already passed the House cleared a key procedural hurdle on Tuesday in the Senate, increasing the likelihood it will win final Congressional approval this week.
The budget plan easily passed the House last week on a 332-94 vote.
Some Senate Republicans said before Tuesday's vote that the most important thing for now was to lower the budget deficit, even if only by a small percentage, and prevent further government shutdowns like the 16-day stoppage in October that proved politically damaging to the GOP.
I'm sure it's not the kind of deal Paul Ryan would want to produce."
Current federal spending expires in mid-January, raising the possibility of another shutdown at that time if there's not a new agreement in place to keep federal coffers filled.
"I'd really like to stay within the (spending) caps," complained GOP Sen. John Boozman of Arkansas.
