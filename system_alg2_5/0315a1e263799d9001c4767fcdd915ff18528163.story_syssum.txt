Seriously.
Just because a woman is hot does not mean that her life is perfect.
As a woman, I know this to be very true.
A hot man can become hideous, and an average-looking man can become the sexiest guy in the room.
Women DO NOT like bad boys.
Women want to be approached, as long as it's by the right person.
If you see a girl you like, stop, breathe and think to yourself, "She's adorable.
Respect yourself first, and women will follow.
Sitting on your couch watching "Law & Order" is not going to bring you results with women.
