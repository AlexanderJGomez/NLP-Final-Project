Van der Sloot also was charged with robbery in last week's slaying of Stephany Flores Ramirez, according to a release from the Lima Superior Court of Justice.
Van der Sloot told authorities he attacked Flores on May 30 after she read an e-mail on his computer connected with the Holloway case, Peruvian national police said in a statement Thursday.
In the Holloway case, van der Sloot told investigators during an interrogation that he knows the location of her body, a Peruvian police official said.
But van der Sloot would not identify the location or say what happened to her the night of her disappearance, said Miguel Canlla, head of the homicide division of the Peruvian national police investigative unit.
Bloodstains found on van der Sloot's clothes match Flores' blood type, he said.
After killing her, the police statement said, van der Sloot cleaned the room in an attempt to hide evidence of the crime, changed clothes and fled with Flores' money, bank cards and black Jeep.
A FBI affidavit says van der Sloot tried to extort money from Holloway's mother.
The FBI and U.S. attorney's office in Birmingham, Alabama, arranged for a meeting in which van der Sloot was paid $10,000 in cash and another $15,000 in a wire transfer, the affidavit said.
According to the affidavit, van der Sloot said his father helped him conceal Holloway's body and buried it under the house a few days later while van der Sloot waited in a car.
