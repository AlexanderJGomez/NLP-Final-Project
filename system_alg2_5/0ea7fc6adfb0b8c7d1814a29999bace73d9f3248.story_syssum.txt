Its aim is to do something about the more than 7,000 girls 17 or younger who get pregnant in New York City annually, with 90% of those pregnancies unplanned, according to the city's health department.
Its purpose is to prevent a pregnancy, not to end one.
In New York, a person must be 18 or older to buy the pill over the counter.
The health department said recently, though, that only 1% to 2% of parents have done so.
"Kids are having kids, and that's the end of their education," said Frances Mejias, who said she wishes her daughter's high school had the program.
One New Yorker who strongly supports the program -- which, so far, has led to more than 1,100 students receiving birth control pills, including Plan B, according to the health department -- is its mayor.
"There (are) still an awful lot of girls who get pregnant at a very early age, when history shows its very difficult to raise a child and give the child the care it needs when the parent just is very young and hasn't had the experience of adulthood," Bloomberg said.
