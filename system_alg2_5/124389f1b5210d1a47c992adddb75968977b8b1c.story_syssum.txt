(CNN) -- Both people who died of swine flu in the United States had pre-existing health problems, federal health authorities said Thursday in a report.
Of the 22 hospitalized patients for whom data were available, four were younger than 5.
As of Tuesday, 18 of the 22 patients who had been hospitalized had recovered, it said.
Brazil's health minister told reporters Thursday that four cases of H1N1 infection have been confirmed in Brazil.
Two of the patients had recently been in Mexico City; the other two had recently been in Florida, he said.
"We can't make any definitive projections about where this is going.
We shouldn't be seeing this much influenza and it's with a new virus and that's the cause fo the concern."
