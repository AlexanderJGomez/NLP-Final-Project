Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- A Japanese coast guard crew member has confessed to leaking a video of a boat collision that sparked a recent diplomatic battle between China and Japan, officials said Wednesday.
After the collision, Japan detained the crew of the Chinese fishing boat off the disputed islands in the East China Sea.
Though the leaking of the video has alarmed Japanese officials, officials in China have questioned its accuracy.
