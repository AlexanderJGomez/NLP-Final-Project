(CNN) -- A 1-year-old child whose family fought a Canadian hospital over whether he should be allowed to die will likely have an operation to allow the insertion of a breathing tube by the end of the week, his new hospital said.
Joseph, who has a deteriorating neurological condition, was transferred to Cardinal Glennon Sunday from a hospital in London, Ontario.
The hospital in Canada said it would not perform a tracheotomy because it is an invasive procedure typically recommended for patients who require a long-term breathing machine.
Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, flew to Ontario Sunday night to help with the transfer.
Joseph "needs to be in a hospital that cherishes life over the bottom line," he said.
