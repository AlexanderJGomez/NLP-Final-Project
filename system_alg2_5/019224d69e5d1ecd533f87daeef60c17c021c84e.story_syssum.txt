"There is big advantage to moving first, and when you're a whale like both Jeb and Romney are, and you jump into that pool first, its hard for anyone else to squeeze in," said B. Wayne Hughes, a California billionaire and Republican donor who has not committed to supporting a candidate.
His surprising decision last week at a New York donor meeting to "show some 2016 leg," as one attendee put it, was designed to keep Bush at bay as he mulls a third presidential bid.
But their moves are also complicating things for Christie, who is still expected to launch a presidential bid but is moving at a much slower place than Bush or Romney.

They like his authenticity, which he has got all day long.
Though he's been slower than Bush or Romney when it comes to hiring staff and building out a campaign, Christie is still looking and sounding very much like a candidate-in-waiting.
And Chris has got that."
"He said something to the effect of, 'Today is Nikki Haley's day, but maybe it will be Chris Christie's day in South Carolina soon," the source told CNN.
"The man tells it like it is...we like that in S.C.!"
