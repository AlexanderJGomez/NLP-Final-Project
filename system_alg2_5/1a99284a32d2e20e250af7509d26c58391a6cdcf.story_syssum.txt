That's the kick of "Hot Sauce" -- the Beasties sound exactly like themselves, cutting loose without straining to fit anyone else's idea of relevance.
It's also a return to classic Beasties chutzpah: On "Hot Sauce Committee," they're not sweating to impress anyone except one another.
They get guest shots from Nas ("Too Many Rappers") and Santigold (the reggae detour "Don't Play No Game That I Can't Win").
So it's no surprise that on "Hot Sauce Committee Part Two" they make no effort to accommodate or even acknowledge any of the latest hip-hop trends.
