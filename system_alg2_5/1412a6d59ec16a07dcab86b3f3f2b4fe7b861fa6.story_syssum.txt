Allegations against the Japanese camera and medical equipment maker came to light after the October dismissal of former President Michael Woodford -- a rare foreign chief executive in corporate Japan -- after he questioned ex-board members about dubious transactions at the center of the case.
The former 11 members of the Olympus board stepped down en masse Friday.
Woodford also questioned Sasa's experience to lead Olympus out from under the shadow of the scandal.
Olympus is the world's largest maker of endoscopes, and Sasa is currently director of Olympus Medical Services.
Meeting with the press yesterday in Tokyo, Woodford said he wanted to shine light on corporate governance in Japan.
Olympus shares lost nearly 80% of its market value in the weeks after Woodford went public with his allegations.
