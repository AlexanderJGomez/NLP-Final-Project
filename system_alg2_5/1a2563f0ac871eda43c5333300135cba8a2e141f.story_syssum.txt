Sara Payne, whose slain daughter was the namesake of Sarah's Law, said Thursday that police have confirmed unspecified "details" on a list kept by private eye Glenn Mulcaire, one of the central figures in the scandal that took down the 168-year-old News of the World earlier this month.
The News of the World led the crusade for the law for a decade and provided a mobile phone for Payne, the paper's ex-editor said Thursday.
News of the World provided Payne with a mobile phone for the past 11 years as part of the campaign for Sarah's Law, and "The idea of her being targeted is beyond my comprehension," Brooks said in a statement regarding the allegation.
Thursday's disclosure was the latest twist in a scandal that has reverberated across the highest levels of the United Kingdom, featuring allegations of widespread phone-hacking, bribery of police officers by journalists and a bungled initial probe.
Prime Minister David Cameron announced the inquiry July 13 in response to public fury at the accusation that people working for News of the World illegally hacked into the phone of a missing British schoolgirl who was later found dead.
