Fenton and Devrieze are a part of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society's Team in Training program.
The program started 23 years ago when Bruce Cleland formed a group to run the New York City Marathon in honor of his daughter, a leukemia survivor.
His sister had called from Manhattan.
His mom, Barbara, is the matriarch of the Fenton family.
Fenton's left Achilles tendon is screaming at him as he talks about his mom -- now the picture of health at 78 -- from home in Kohler, Wisconsin.
He's running 10 marathons (to celebrate her 10th anniversary of going into remission) in six months -- the time it took from diagnosis to remission.
People loved Harry Devrieze.
It was from him that she learned plumbing, drywall and her way around the Home Depot store.
It was during this time that she went to her first Team in Training meeting and signed up for the Rock 'n' Roll marathon.
"It was always important for him for me to be involved and kind of have a cause," Devrieze says.
For a couple of weeks, Devrieze refused to run, clutching to the friends and family Harry had held so close.
That's why she's all the more determined to do exactly that.
It's mind over body, and having a greater purpose ... makes the mind part work better."
