We spent some time testing and touching the new iPad Mini and iPad Air after Tuesday's press conference.
Physically, the iPad Air is indeed lighter and thinner than its predecessor.
Unfortunately, I didn't have an older iPad on hand to do a weight comparison, and I'd picked up an iPad Mini first.
The iPad Air has a 64-bit A7 processor, the same chip recently introduced in the iPhone 5S.
A number of Apple products already have the Retina Display: the iPhone 4S and up, the fourth generation iPod Touch, the 10-inch iPad and some MacBook Pros.
Like the iPad Air, the iPad Mini with Retina has the A7 chip inside.
Though other products can usually be had for much less, any hands-on time with Apple products remind you that one of their greatest selling points is solid, high-quality construction.
Faster processors gobble up more battery power, so maintaining 10 hours of battery life from an old tablet to a new tablet probably requires battery improvements.
For now, Apple is comfortable enough with the competition to just iterate on its well-designed, popular products, making the usual round of improvements and throwing in the occasional flashy feature to grab attention, such as fingerprints on the iPhone 5S.
The competition will stay close until the first company breaks out of the usual faster, thinner, faster upgrade cycle and solves the battery problem.
