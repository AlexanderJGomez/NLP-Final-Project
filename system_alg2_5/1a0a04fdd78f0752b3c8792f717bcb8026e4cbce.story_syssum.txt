(CNN) -- Yes, they exist.
According to the report from the Pew Internet & American Life Project, 92% of respondents who said they aren't on the Internet also said they have no desire to be.
Forty-four percent of adults 65 or older said they don't use the Internet.
More than one-third said they are "just not interested," "don't need it/don't want it," or "think it's a waste of time."
