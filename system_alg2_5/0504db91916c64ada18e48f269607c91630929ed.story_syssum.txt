Speaking briefly backstage, Ono expressed feeling that it was wonderful for Starr to be honored, "just sad John and George aren't here," referring to her late husband John Lennon and Beatles guitarist and fellow songwriter George Harrison.
Starr said in a backstage interview that he couldn't recall the incident specifically, but admitted that there had been a lot of shows in between.
Others receiving Rock Hall honors included Paul Butterfield Blues Band, early soul act The 5 Royales, singer Bill Withers, punk rockers Green Day, Lou Reed, Joan Jett & the Blackhearts and Stevie Ray Vaughan.
She recalled a night when they wound up in the same hotel and Reed invited her up.
Green Day was inducted by Fall Out Boy, who referenced the length of some of the speeches.
