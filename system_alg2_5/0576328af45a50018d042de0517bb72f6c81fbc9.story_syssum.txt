The IRS is trying to reach people who do not normally file tax returns so they can apply for stimulus checks.
The commissioner said the IRS received 72 million calls in May this year, compared with 19 million in May 2007.
"The numbers are staggering," he said.
The notices sent to those who didn't file an income tax return in 2006 told them they should file a 1040A tax form for 2007 even if they had no tax liability.
