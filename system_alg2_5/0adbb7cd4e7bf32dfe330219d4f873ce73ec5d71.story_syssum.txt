(CNN)When Longmont, Colorado, police officer Billy Sawyer responded to a 911 call from a pregnant woman who was stabbed and had her fetus ripped out, he wasn't prepared for what they would see.
Despite her shock, Wilkins was able to tell Sawyer that she had responded to a Craigslist ad and had been attacked.
The grisly cutting of the fetus from Wilkins began when she responded to a Craigslist ad about baby clothes for sale.
Michelle Wilkins' uncle Chris Wilkins said, "She's alive because professional first responders execute perfectly."
But Piotrowski believes Wilkins is the one who "saved her own life."
