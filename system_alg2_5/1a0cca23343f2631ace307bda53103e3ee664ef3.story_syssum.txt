Kathleen Sebelius dives into discussing the swine flu at the White House after being sworn in.
Until her confirmation, the White House, which declared a public health emergency Sunday, was dealing with its first crisis without a secretary.
The Kansas governor came under fire for her ties to Dr. George Tiller, a late-term abortion provider.
Sebelius, 60, is the daughter of former Ohio Gov.
A number of leading social conservatives have criticized Sebelius for her record on abortion, citing, among other things, her veto as governor of legislation that would have tightened abortion regulations in Kansas.
Former Senate GOP leader Bob Dole, also from Kansas, testified on Sebelius' behalf in March, arguing that her record had proven her ability to work in a bipartisan manner.
Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and Jon Huntsman of Utah commended her selection.
