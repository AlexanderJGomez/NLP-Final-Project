(CNN) -- Convertibles are selling well at the Mercedes Benz dealership in Sendai in North Japan.
In the aftermath the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, business across Sendai is experiencing a reconstruction bounce.
"People used to try not to spend so much and save money, but after the quake, (they) spend more on luxurious cars, also because the stock market and exchange market are not doing well now."
"One year on from the earthquake, Japan's economy remains deeply affected by the disaster," Takehide Kiuchi, chief economist of Nomura Securities, wrote in a recent research report.
"In contrast to the great efforts made by the private sector, the response of the authorities has left much unresolved," Kiuchi said.
He hopes the rebuilding will not be a return to the old ways, but an opportunity to reform the government and make Japan's economy more integrated with the outside world.
Still, in Sendai, business is booming.
Many say there is also a change in attitude towards spending, with locals flocking to luxury stores in a way they didn't see before the quake.
"But after such experience we learned that such an idea was no use."
