The lawsuit "may be the first civil lawsuit of its kind on behalf of a child victim of sex trafficking against a buyer of a commercial sex act with that child," the victim's attorney, Gloria Allred, said at a news conference.
Prosecutors said Taylor paid Fierro, who has repeatedly denied allegations that she was a prostitute, $300 for "sexual acts."
At the news conference Monday, Fierro said she was dissatisfied with the plea deal Taylor struck with prosecutors last spring.
The lawsuit seeks "compensatory and punitive damages" from Taylor, Allred said, but she declined to specify a dollar amount.
"Suing the buyer can have an impact on the demand for commercial sex of children," Allred said.
