San Francisco (CNN) -- While Google waits for regulatory approval on its bid to acquire Motorola Mobility, company executives have repeatedly worked to assuage partners' fears that the Android software developer is preparing to compete with them.
A spokesman declined to comment on the matter last week.
Sony Ericsson CTO Jan Uddenfeldt said at a conference last week that Google still maintains it is buying Motorola primarily for the patent portfolio of one of the world's oldest mobile-phone companies.
Even with Motorola's help, Google could struggle to transition from a software developer to bringing hardware products to market, Uddenfeldt said.
Google has suggested that it plans to leverage Motorola's hardware expertise in order to understand how to integrate software more closely with hardware, Kevin Packingham, the senior vice president for Samsung Electronics products, said in an interview.
Even more so than Motorola, Samsung has been very close with Google over the last two years.
Being chosen as the lead-device partner is a competitive advantage, Packingham said, because the company gets direct access to Google engineers and to Android code before rivals.
According to Packingham, Samsung was chosen for two of the three Nexus phones because of its hardware expertise and access to components, and there is no bidding involved in the lead-device program.
