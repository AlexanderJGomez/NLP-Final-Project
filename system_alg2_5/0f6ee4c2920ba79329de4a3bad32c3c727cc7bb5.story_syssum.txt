Federer recorded the second double bagel of his career when he defeated wildcard Mischa Zverev 6-0 6-0 on Friday to reach the semifinals of a Wimbledon warm-up in Halle, Germany.
He lost to Tomas Berdych in the U.S. Open quarterfinals last September, Andy Murray in January's Australian Open semifinals and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in this month's French Open quarterfinals.
Haas and Federer, good friends, played doubles together this week in Halle.
"I thought the first set was good, and then he started playing much better in the second," Murray said in a televised interview.
The conditions were tough, again, but it's only my first week on grass."
Del Potro, still learning the finer points of playing on grass, missed the French Open due to illness.
Cilic almost exited in the third round, trailing Feliciano Lopez 5-2 in the third set before staging a comeback.
