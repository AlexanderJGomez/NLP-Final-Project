(CNN) -- As a psychiatrist, former university president and advocate for Arab women in science, Rafia Ghubash is one of the United Arab Emirates' most influential women.
In searching for a home for the museum, Ghubash turned down a free site in Dubai's official heritage district for an old house in the historic Gold Souk neighborhood she grew up in.
Ghubash said her grandmothers' generation contributed far more to the politics, economy, education and literature of the region than has been recognized.
"I came from a family where both parents made sure there were books available in the house," she said.
Ghubash trained as a doctor at the University of Cairo and for a PhD in London, before returning to the United Arab Emirates as an assistant professor of psychiatry.
She is already working on her next project to compile an encyclopaedia of women of the United Arab Emirates.
