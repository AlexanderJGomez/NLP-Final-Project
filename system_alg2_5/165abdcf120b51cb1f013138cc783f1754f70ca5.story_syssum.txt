LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Holly Williams is one of the only artists in country music male or female who doesn't have a stylist.
Williams just released her sophomore album, "Here With Me" (Mercury Nashville).
Williams spoke with CNN about her new album and her family's legacy.
Holly Williams: It wasn't planned at all.
And it's just so random, because out of the 52 weeks of the year, it just happened.
Williams: Well, my mom raised my sister and me.
CNN: What was it like for you going into the music industry?
I'm 28 now, and I've been doing it for 10 years nonstop.
Williams: I do.
I remember just telling my mom, "Just please call the publishing company.
Why did you go into country with this album?
Williams: Growing up in my house, you would assume I was growing up around country music with my dad being Hank Williams Jr.
I'm on a country label now.
...
I would love to play in arenas -- but what I really want to build is a core fanbase, and just hopefully build a place in the Williams family.
