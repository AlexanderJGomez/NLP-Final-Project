Washington (CNN) -- Taj Magruder has never voted for Hillary Clinton.
"I have yet to vote for Hillary," said Magruder, who was too young to cast a ballot the last time she was on one.
"I just want to make sure that Hillary has, if she does run, a kind of presence on social media that she hasn't always had."
"She was so good last night," he tweeted after Clinton's sit-down on the Colbert Report.
And while he only has 780 followers, many of those include reporters following Clinton and representatives from the groups looking to help her if she runs again.
Some, like Still 4 Hill, have devoted years to blogging about her every move.
Still 4 Hill started her blog after Clinton ended her presidential campaign in 2008.
There is more to the online response, though: People like Magruder and Still 4 Hill have received a little notoriety for their persistence.
According to blogger, Clinton responded, "Still 4 Hill!
Both Magruder and Still 4 Hill are building a online record of their thoughts and feelings about Clinton and that record -- at some point -- could come back to haunt them.

"I would love it if a role is available for me.
If there is one, I would love it," Magruder said.
