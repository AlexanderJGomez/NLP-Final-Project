Specifically, Congress hasn't passed a budget in almost four years.
If members of Congress can't pass a budget on time, they wouldn't get paid until they did.
And our elected representatives seem to have forgotten that presenting a stable plan on how to spend the money is a basic part of their job description.
Now, House Republicans have seized on this idea as part of their bid to extend the debt ceiling deadline until mid-May.
The proposal was the cornerstone of the "Make Congress Work" plan released last year.
"No Budget, No Pay" is a no-brainer.
Let me be clear: A long-term solution to the debt ceiling debacles still needs to be found.
But the House GOP vote to at least extend the debt-ceiling deadline and impose a common sense measure like "No Budget, No Pay" is sign of sanity at the start of the second Obama term.
If patriotic conscience can't compel Congress to work together, maybe requiring them to have some personal skin in the game will inspire them to do their job.
