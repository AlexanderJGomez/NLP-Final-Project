Kurdish fighters defending the key Syrian border city of Kobani are dangerously outmatched as ISIS advances, a top United Nations official said Tuesday, calling for the international community to step in.
And hours after U.S. airstrikes targeting ISIS struck near Kobani overnight, the city's future was far from certain.
"It's obviously horrific to watch what's going on the ground, but it's important for the United States, for us to also step back and remember our strategic objective as it relates to our efforts and our engagement in Syria," spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters.
Five airstrikes targeting groups of ISIS fighters struck near Kobani overnight, U.S. Central Command said.
Airstrikes against the radical Islamist group in Kobani can be challenging because many targets are too close to the Turkish border or Kurdish forces to strike, a senior U.S. military official said.
Three people were killed and at least 36 injured in demonstrations throughout Turkey, police said, according to Anadolu.
CNN affiliate RTL Belgium said about 50 protesters stormed into the building.
Belgium participated in overnight airstrikes in Iraq, U.S. Central Command said.
If left unchecked this terrorist organization will grow and grow quickly."
Elsewhere in Syria, two strikes west of al-Hasakah hit multiple ISIS buildings, one near Deir Ezzor struck an ISIS staging area and IED production facility, and one southwest of Rabiyah struck a small group of ISIS fighters.
U.S. military airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria have cost more than $62 million so far, according to data provided by the U.S. Defense Department.
It also detailed locations of targets and specified the costs of munitions used.
