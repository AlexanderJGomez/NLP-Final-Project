Josh McDermitt: When I booked the role, I knew that Eugene wasn't a scientist, but I didn't know it was gonna come this season.
For it to happen that quickly, it will be fun to see where Eugene heads next -- if he's alive!
I don't know if I would lie like that, but I'm just happy I didn't get Daryl killed or anything -- then everyone would hate Eugene for sure.
I think that's where Eugene will want to go: "How do I get back into this group?
I was able to bring some of that from the comics into the character and that brings something to what we're doing.
McDermitt: In the audition they're very secretive; they won't tell you the character name.
I don't think we've had a good mullet on TV since Uncle Jesse from "Full House," so I'm glad to bring it back.
We'll see how the damage is repaired, and it's not pretty, I'll tell you that.
