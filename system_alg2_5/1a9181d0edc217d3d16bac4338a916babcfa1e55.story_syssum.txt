In an eerily similar incident in May 2004, former Springbok rugby player Rudi Visagie was awoken by his wife, who heard a car in their driveway in Nelspruit, South Africa.
"I wondered what's happening now ... and he told me it's Marle in the car."
"It happened that one shot out of a million ... went right through the door and penetrated my daughter through the neck," Visagie said.
Visagie was a household name and had represented South Africa in a series of international rugby games.

The former rugby player said he sympathizes with the sprinter.
Despite the heartbreak, his Christian faith has helped him through the tough times.
