(CNN) -- Larry Smith's desire to make sure he's alive to watch his grandchildren grow up was his light bulb moment.
"During the first day of the program I thought I wouldn't be able to keep up with it because it felt very intimidating and I worried about my weak knees," he said.
The grandfather of three said an e-mail in his work inbox announcing the "Fit 4 Change Mississippi Fitness Challenge" was the final push he needed to jumpstart his journey toward a healthier lifestyle.
"The fitness event was one of the hardest things I have ever done in my life," Smith said.
Before the challenge started, Smith had high blood pressure, high sugar glucose levels and did not eat well-balanced meals.
Smith said his goal was simply to get in shape, and he never aspired to win the fitness challenge.
"Paul's program was the jumpstart I needed, and now I am continuing my weight loss journey on my own," he said.
"I look forward to spending many healthy years into the future with my grandkids, and am glad I am taking the necessary steps to do it," he said.
