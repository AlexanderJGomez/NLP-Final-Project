Today it's one of China's best-preserved destinations, thanks to the careful stewardship of its pagodas and pavilions, mountain-fringed West Lake, and terraced plantations growing the region's famous longjing green tea.
A 25-minute drive away, Banyan Tree Hangzhou (doubles from $550) abuts the 2,800-acre Xixi National Wetland Park.
A number of restaurants offer views of West Lake, but West Lake One (dinner for two $45) stands out with its covered terrace and extensive menu featuring dishes from throughout China.
Tea fanatics might head to Old Dragon Well Imperial Tea Garden to pay homage to the 18 bushes set aside for the Ch'ing dynasty emperor Qianlong.
Close by, on the edge of the verdant, waterway-filled Xixi National Wetland Park, the National Wetland Museum (free admission) will open an Arata Isozaki --designed viewing platform later this year.
Getting There: Hangzhou is a 100-minute train ride from Shanghai; express trains launching next month will take 38 minutes.
