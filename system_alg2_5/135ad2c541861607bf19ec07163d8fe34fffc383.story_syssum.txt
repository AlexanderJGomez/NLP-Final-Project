And those who didn't follow party rules came under scrutiny, had their choices of a career and a life limited, and sooner or later became a case for the Stasi, the secret police of East Germany.
That is why the Stasi became an all-encompassing entity in East Germany.
Any and all technical means, including phone tapping, were used by the Stasi to gather information.
Over the past 20 years Germany through the Stasi archives has examined the exact mechanisms of control through the secret police to better understand their vast network of information gathering and its consequences on the lives of many people.
So when the Chancellor's phone is bugged, Germans don't have the bliss of ignorance as Americans might have.
It is something we do today, knowing full well the dangers to democracy if we don't.
And it also makes one wonder what the Stasi would have done with a vast information hub like Facebook that would have let it pry into many, many lives and gather personal information beyond its wildest dreams.
