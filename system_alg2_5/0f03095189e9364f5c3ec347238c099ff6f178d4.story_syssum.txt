Manama, Bahrain (CNN) -- At least two people were killed early Thursday morning when Bahraini police swarmed into the capital, Manama, to roust protesters from the Pearl Roundabout, emergency hospital services said.
Hundreds of white-helmeted police swarmed the roundabout.
Robertson said demonstrators he'd spoken to were outraged by the way they'd been treated by security forces.
No!
I'm going!"
"We were sleeping," he said.
Police were outside the hospitals as well, he said.
Ebrahim Sharif, secretary-general of the opposition National Democratic Action Society, said he saw ambulances taking people to hospitals but that police were blocking people from going in that direction.
Earlier Wednesday, thousands of people gathered for a peaceful funeral procession for a Bahraini man killed when clashes erupted during another protester's funeral procession, the president of a human rights group said.
Human rights groups say Matrook was shot by security forces using pellet guns during the Tuesday procession for Ali Abdulhadi Mushaima, who was killed Monday.
By Wednesday morning, thousands of activists were camping out at the foot of the Pearl Roundabout, a Bahraini landmark.
In a recent report, the group said Bahraini authorities detained 23 opposition political activists in August and September, and held them without contact for two weeks, "during which some allege they were tortured."
In Washington, the State Department said Tuesday it was "very concerned" by the violence and said it welcomed the promise of an investigation.
