Sondra Oster Baras: "Israel has many enemies.
Baras stumps for money from evangelical Christians to support Jewish settlements in the occupied territories -- land she calls biblical Israel.
Christofaro and Baras are part of a growing alliance between evangelical Christians and Israelis.
One of the most successful Jewish fundraisers, Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, raised $39 million last year from Christian Zionists to fund human services and humanitarian work in Israel and the settlements.
Baras said God called her to this work.
"I was Jewish."
"My parents felt very safe in America ... but there was always a part of them that said there needs to be an Israel in the event that we have another Hitler.
She said she fought back by encouraging support from evangelical Christians in America.
"If you don't live somewhere, if you don't take possession of it, it is not yours," Baras said.
Now such historic anti-Semitism has given way to an urgent support of Israel among some evangelicals, many of whom believe that when Jews live in all of the Holy Land -- what they call Greater Israel -- only then will Christ return and true believers be raptured up to heaven.
"Israel has many enemies," she said.
