(CNN) -- No one may ever know for sure whether Ohio's execution of Dennis McGuire -- in a procedure during which he reportedly gasped, snorted and struggled -- was inhumane, but his family and medical and legal experts said Friday the ordeal points out fundamental flaws in the use of lethal injection.
For about 10 minutes, McGuire appeared to be straining against his restraints, Johnson recalled.
He said the family plans to file a lawsuit next week in federal court seeking an injunction against the state's use of the drug combination, alleging that it represents cruel and unusual punishment and, as such, violates the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution.
The family's concern that other people should not have to endure such treatment makes "a nice political statement," Berman said, but may not be enough to file a claim related to the fait accompli.
"Ohio will have to review this new procedure they've put in place," said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, about the drug combination that was used for the first time on McGuire.
Previously, Ohio used a single drug, pentobarbital, for many of its executions, but the manufacturer has said it did not want its product to be used in executions and the state's stockpiles of the drug had expired, Dieter said.
As different states begin to use different drug combinations, "some of this is a bit of an experiment," Dieter said.
And then that's all."
The compounds used by Ohio are in short supply, and their diversion from use in treating people to use in execution is questionable, he said.
But the medicalization of the procedure has been perfunctory, he said in a telephone interview, noting that neither of the two drugs used on McGuire appears to have been tested in animals for lethality.
But lethal injection is called for by all 32 states that have the death penalty.
