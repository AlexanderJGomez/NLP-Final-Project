Afghan commanders also would not have the authority to release detainees on their own, according to agreement.
That facility, called the Bagram Theater Internment Facility, was the site of abusive interrogation that ended in the deaths of two detainees in 2002, according to Amnesty International, which has described abusive treatment of detainees at the facility as common.
The Bagram base was also the site of the recent Quran burnings that set off a wave of protests and violence targeting NATO troops.
