Before I became a history professor I carried mail for the Postal Service for 20 years.
Who were my co-workers?
The postal worker's job could include processing mail as clerks and mail handlers, delivering it as letter carriers, driving it as truck drivers, and as maintenance workers keeping up the vehicles, buildings, and grounds.
Even as they faced discrimination at other jobs, many found work there with college degrees or military service under their belts.
Postal Service -- a self-supporting quasi-corporate government agency that remains committed to universal service by constitutional and congressional mandate.
Or that the post office is the victim of an artificial deficit created by the 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, signed by President George W. Bush, which forces the Postal Service to pre-fund its retiree health benefits 75 years into the future over the next 10 years.

People could demand that Congress treat the Postal Service as a venerable American institution worthy of fulfilling its enduring mandate, for which it has recruited generations of skilled and dedicated professional government employees.
