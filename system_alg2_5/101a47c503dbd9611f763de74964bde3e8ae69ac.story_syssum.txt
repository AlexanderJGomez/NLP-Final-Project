Israeli fighter jets struck a Syrian convoy suspected of moving weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon, a senior U.S. official said Wednesday.
"Israeli warplanes penetrated our airspace at dawn today and directly bombed one of the scientific research centers responsible for raising the level of resistance and self-defense in the area of Jimraya in the Damascus countryside," the military said in a statement aired on state-run TV Wednesday.
But the senior U.S. official said American authorities do not believe the strike was linked to growing concerns about chemical weapons.
"Whether it was an attack against a supply convoy or a terrorist leader, it's not particularly surprising," senior Brookings fellow Michael O'Hanlon said.
The United States has provided more than $200 million in humanitarian aid and other funding to the Syrian opposition.
But Washington has been circumspect about its involvement in Syria.
