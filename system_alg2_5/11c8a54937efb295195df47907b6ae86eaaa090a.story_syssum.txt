New York (CNN) -- If the Americans followed the French presidential elections as avidly as the French stare at the poll ratings of Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, they would know that "Sarko l'Américain," Sarkozy the American, may soon have to say "good bye" to the Elysée Palace.
Tons of "Freedom Fries," the creative rants of Bill O'Reilly and George W. Bush, even the sad visit to the White House in 2004 of our then ambassador to check officially on the status of France ("Friend or Foe?")
No.
The reality is that history has not made us equal.

It is one of the reasons why, in contrast to most other western countries, the French conservative parties and its establishment never saw the American entrepreneurial way of business as a suitable model.
