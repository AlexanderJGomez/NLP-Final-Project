Los Angeles (CNN) -- Justin Bieber will not face a felony charge of robbery despite a woman's claim the singer tried to steal her cell phone last month.
Bieber and the woman "tussled over it for a moment," she said.
Her 13-year-old daughter began to cry, the woman said.
"Justin was just enjoying hanging out with friends at the batting cage and playing mini-golf," the source told CNN.
