Wednesday was a day of continued wedding preparations for Friedman, 25, of Knightdale, North Carolina, just east of Raleigh.
Friedman's father, Larry, will push her down the aisle, so that she can hold a bridal bouquet as she approaches Chapman, 28.
Afterward, the group went to her best friend's home, where they started playing around near the pool.
"We're there for each other," Friedman said.
Individuals, businesses and foundations have provided other assistance.
After CNN wrote about the couple and HLN's Vinnie's Politan interviewed Friedman, a wedding and honeymoon planning company approached the couple.
"It's perfect," she said of the nuptial plans.
Carol Friedman and Rachelle's 32-year-old brother help her during the week while Chapman is at work.
"She was and is my best friend.
Excited about being able to lie on the beach in Fiji, Friedman also anticipates three weeks of treatment at Project Walk, a facility in Carlsbad, California, that helps people with spinal cord injuries.
"Rachelle is a very motivated person," said Miranda Strider-Allen, program director at Resources for Seniors, where Friedman helped provide services to Wake County senior and disabled adults.
"My hope is she finds her new niche in life," Carol Friedman said of her daughter.
