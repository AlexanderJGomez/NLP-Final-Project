(CNN)Just over a month ago, Kamron Taylor sat in an Illinois courtroom to hear a jury convict him of murder.
Taylor beat up the guard, put on his uniform and took his keys.
No.
What they don't know is how Taylor got out of his two-man cell, when he should have been locked down.
Taylor walked out the door and into the detention center's parking lot, where, authorities said, he clicked the correctional officer's key fob to find the Chevy Equinox.
That officer is now in an intensive care unit at St. Mary's Hospital in Kankakee, Bukowski said.
The fact that he tried to get away once before and has been involved in fights "raises an alert, I guess," the Kankakee County sheriff said.
