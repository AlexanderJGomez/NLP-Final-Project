WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Obama on Monday gathered together every confirmed member of his Cabinet for the first time as president and challenged them to cut $100 million in the next 90 days.
The edict is part of Obama's "commitment to go line by line through the budget to cut spending" and "reform the government," a senior administration official said.
In the context of the federal budget, $100 million in savings is a small amount, critics said.
"It is where I'm from.
"None of these savings by themselves are going to solve our long-term fiscal problems," Obama said.
