LONDON, England (CNN) -- Campaigners in London planned to petition the British government Friday for a posthumous pardon for the hundreds of people executed for witchcraft between the 16th and 18th centuries.
Around 400 people were executed in England and some 4,000 in Scotland for alleged witchcraft, campaigners say.
A century later, Mary Trembles and Susanna Edwards were begging for food in Exeter, England, when a local woman blamed one of them for an illness and they were jailed.
Lowes was hanged in Bury St. Edmunds, England, after conducting his own funeral.
In 2004, one Scottish town managed to get a pardon for the 81 accused witches that had been put to death there.
In its ruling, the court pardoned both the accused witches and their cats who, it said, were executed for "conjuration or sorcery."
Webb said while few people today may believe those men and women deserved execution, their stories still generate suspicion and stigma.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice would not comment on the case but said the granting of such a pardon is extremely rare.
The names of 14 were cleared in 1711 after their families applied to the government, D'Amario said.
