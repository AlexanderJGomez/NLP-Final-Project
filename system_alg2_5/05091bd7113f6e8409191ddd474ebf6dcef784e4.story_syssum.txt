Studies have indicated that long-term cell phone use may be associated with brain cancer, according to Dr. Ronald Herberman, director of the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, and Dr. David Carpenter, director of Institute for Health and the Environment at University of Albany.
The results indicated that people who use cell phones have double the chance of developing malignant brain tumors and acoustic neuromas, which are tumors on the hearing nerve.
The evidence for the connection between cell phones and cancer is inconclusive and more research is needed, he said.
"The available scientific evidence and expert reviews from leading global health organizations such as the American Cancer Society, National Cancer Institute, United States Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization reflect a consensus based on published scientific research showing that there is no reason for concern," Largent's statement said.
Carpenter and Herberman testified that the risk of brain cancer for children is far greater than for adults.
But the SAR standard reflects a biological response to cell phone radio frequency energy heating tissue, Kucinich said.
Herberman had issued a warning to physicians, scientists, and staff at the University of Pittsburgh in July advising them to limit cell phone use because of the possible risk of cancer.
The tumor is on the same side of his head where he held his cell phone, which he used about 30 hours per month.
