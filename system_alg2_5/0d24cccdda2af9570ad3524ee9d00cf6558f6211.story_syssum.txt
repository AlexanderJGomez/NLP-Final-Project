Introducing the Water Discus Hotel, a luxury multi-million dollar resort featuring 21 moveable rooms found in the heart of spectacular coral reefs.
"A lot of people have said it looks like something from a James Bond film," said Podwojewski.
Those wanting to explore the spectacular underwater world, can also dive straight in from the hotel's airlock compartment, including its own decompression chamber.
Not only does the hotel look like a spaceship -- it actually moves like one, with the largest underwater saucer-shaped room able to slide to the surface in emergencies.
Developers hope to limit the impact on coral reefs by laying the foundation in as few points as possible.
But it seems this unique underwater hotel will be much closer than you think.
