Captured in waters off Washington State in 1970, Lolita is an orca -- a killer whale.
Can a killer whale be a slave?
Compared to say, 40 miles, 80 feet is about 1/2600th the size of an orca's normal daily life.
Like a second lump of sugar, a whale named Hugo who had been captured from the same free-living whale community two years earlier, shared Lolita's teacup for 10 years.
Unlike any other known creature, unlike elephants and humans, orcas like Lolita never leave their birth family.
"The captures of young whales in the 1960s and '70s really caused a long-term problem," Balcomb told me.
Before the captures they totaled about 120 whales.
The whole U.S. resident population now has just two-dozen females of reproductive age.
There, she can be in vocal contact with her family.
Bottom line: What's proposed for her is better than the situation she is in.
