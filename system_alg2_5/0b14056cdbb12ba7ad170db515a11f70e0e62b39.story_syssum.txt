According to Morrissey, he's had a cancer scare, although in talking about the disease, the singer doesn't seem that scared at all.
And if I don't, then I don't.
In early 2013, Morrissey spent some time in a Michigan hospital after suffering from "a concussion, a bleeding ulcer and Barrett's esophagus."
In a recent interview where Morrissey talked about his many health issues, he proclaimed that, "The worst was in June in Boston, when I was hospitalized with acute fever.
At press time, Morrissey hasn't updated his fan sites about the cancer reports.
Whatever the diagnosis, Morrissey is back out on the road, and NME reports that the singer's backing band is proudly donning shirts that say "F*** Harvest" as a nod to his record label after the label released Moz's new LP "World Peace Is None of Your Business."
