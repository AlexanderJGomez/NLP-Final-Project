A wave of explosions targeting Syrian government forces killed dozens of people at a popular Aleppo square Wednesday in an attack for which a Syria-based extremist group has claimed responsibility.
A fourth car bomb exploded near Aleppo's chamber of commerce, the government and opposition said.
Opposition groups later reported that "a number of regime forces" had been killed following the shelling of a Syrian military center near the town of Tal Abyad.
At least five people were killed and 10 injured when a shell landed on a house in the Turkish town of Akcakale, near the Syrian border, the town's mayor said Wednesday.
The United Kingdom will provide an additional 1 million pounds ($1.6 million) to help Syrian refugees through the Turkish winter, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said Wednesday.
Turkey has taken in more than 93,000 Syrian refugees, more than any other country in the region.
