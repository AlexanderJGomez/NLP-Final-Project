And they hope pharmacy employees -- or anyone, for that matter -- will report such activity to its new prescription drug abuse tip line.
The agency launched an initiative, TIP411, this week to allow the public to quickly and anonymously report suspicious activity.
Prescription drug abuse is a national epidemic, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
Most abusers get the pills from a friend or family member who had the initial prescription.
"The illegal prescription drug market and relative ease of which pharmaceutical substances can be obtained has resulted in a sharp increase in prescription drug abuse," said Harry Sommers, special agent in charge of the DEA's Atlanta division.
The guide, a pamphlet, suggests that people get these drugs illegally by stealing doctors' prescription pads or altering a legitimate prescription with a different callback number that can ring to an accomplice that would verify the prescription.
Sommers said he doesn't think his agency will get a ton of tips through the new tip line, but he believes the tips it does get will yield good results.
