(CNN) -- Former CNN anchor Lou Dobbs said Thursday said neither he nor his companies have ever hired illegal immigrants and it was not his responsibility to check their papers.
But Macdonald said that the situation involved Dobbs and his Dobbs Group hiring contractors that she said used undocumented workers.
That doesn't sit well with me," Dobbs told the author.
Macdonald said Dobbs is responsible for those working at his properties.
In particular, he has said that employers who hire illegal immigrants should be prosecuted.
The next day, he said on his show that field workers are paid "not, in my opinion, an adequate wage, but a decent wage," adding: "These people deserve to be paid more.
Another man whom the article says cared for Dobbs Group horses is quoted as saying the job required him to be available at all hours, day and night.
"You put out an article that is being used by the left-wing press as a hammer on me," Dobbs told Macdonald.
"Your listeners deserve to know the truth," said Macdonald.
Dobbs did not return calls from CNN seeking comment Thursday.
