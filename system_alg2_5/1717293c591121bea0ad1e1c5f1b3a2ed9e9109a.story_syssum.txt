Washington (CNN) -- Lenient enforcement of a law requiring U.S. citizens to have passports when re-entering the country at land border crossings has heightened the risk that an imposter might get in, according to a government report released Monday.
The federal Customs and Border Protection agency, though, contends that the program is working, adding that it believes it is better to encourage compliance gradually then to enforce it right away.
Compliance has been greatest along the northern border, where 98 percent of travelers had the appropriate documents, the inspector general's report says.
The inspector general says the non-compliance rate could spell trouble when Customs and Border Protection seeks "full compliance" with the law, saying the latter agency does not have the resources to process large numbers of non-compliant travelers through secondary screening.
The agency said the program is working, adding that it believes it is better to encourage compliance then to enforce it at this time.
