He was also convicted of two counts of sexual assault for attacks on two other women.
A pair of panties that did not belong to Denison were found near the body, in what police said was a "calling card" that helped them connect Biela not only to Denison, but also to the other assaults.
The woman testified that her assailant asked for her panties and took them with him.
Police released a photo of the panties near Denison's body and a description of the pickup truck.
Lab tests showed that the boy's father -- Biela -- was almost certainly a match for the DNA found on the doorknob and at the crime scene, police said.
