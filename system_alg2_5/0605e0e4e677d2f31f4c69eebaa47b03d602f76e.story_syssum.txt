More than 20 million books and magazines have been scanned using optical character-recognition technology, making each word or phrase searchable, so snippets of text are part of Google search results.
Google did not seek approval to scan many books that were still under copyright, nor did it offer to compensate authors or publishers in any way, claiming the scans were fair use.
"As we have long said, Google Books is in compliance with copyright law and acts like a card catalog for the digital age, giving users the ability to find books to buy or borrow," said a Google spokesperson.
He said the Google Books program provided benefits to the public.
By converting print to digital text, the program has also made it easier to convert titles into more accessible formats, like text-to-speech and Braille.
