Sara is a 115-pound federally protected loggerhead sea turtle who, if not for sheer luck, would be dead today.
The shooting of the turtle had to be deliberate, said Rich Moretti, who runs the Turtle Hospital in Marathon.
He said he does not believe whoever shot the turtle was from the Keys.
After stabilizing Sara and giving her antibiotics, Mader was able to remove the spear from her head and the flutter ended.
Once that happened, Moretti said, "we knew it was time for her to go back home."
The staff at the Turtle Hospital sees many accidental injuries, "animals tied up in fishing line or hit by a boat," Moretti said.
