Sony, makers of the top-selling PlayStation 4, has rolled out "Project Morpheus," a virtual reality system it says will pair with its top-selling gaming console to immerse players in the virtual worlds in which they're playing.
Morpheus will feature a visor-style headset and interact with the camera on the Playstation 4 using sensors that track the player's head movements.
It all raises the question of whether top-tier game developers will be willing to make the considerable investment of time and resources it will take to create games for a new, untested system that will only be owned by some gamers who own one particular console.
"But because Project Morpheus is essentially a new platform on its own, there will be plenty of developers who will want to be first or early on it.
So, even if the console makers each develop their own systems, there's plenty of space for the system to thrive despite the competition.
"Third-party games have been in the works for the Oculus Rift for quite some time now, so the company is in a good spot for when the headset releases."
"If Sony's announcement forces Oculus to be even more aggressive in creating a top-notch VR unit and getting it to market more quickly, then the consumers will benefit."
