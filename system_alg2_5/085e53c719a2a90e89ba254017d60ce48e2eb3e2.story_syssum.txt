Most of these cases -- 208, to be specific -- have been linked to Ohio State University in Columbus, the city's health department said.
But none were still in hospitals as of Friday, and no deaths have been linked to the disease, Amato said.
The Ohio Department of Health reports the first symptoms tied to this outbreak arose on January 7.
Mumps isn't the only infectious disease outbreak that Ohio is dealing with.
Earlier this week, authorities reported 68 people had come down with measles in the state, part of what is already an 18-year high of measles cases in the United States.
