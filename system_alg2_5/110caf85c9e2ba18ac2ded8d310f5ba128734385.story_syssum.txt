What?
In a small but highly controversial way, Patton may be doing something similar for young women in college who want to get married and have kids someday.
...
Many modern women like myself believe in empowering women to make the choices they want to make, and that many women would choose a career and marriage and motherhood, too.
...
Kelly: I don't know if people would say it's so retro.
...
Kelly: You say women should spend 75% of their time in college looking for a man versus 25% on their career.
...
Kelly: You talk about "Marrying Smart" and spending more time in college to find that right person, but you have to believe it's also very important for women, at the same time, to be fulfilled and find what they want because their marriage could end; 50% of marriages end in divorce.
I am not saying a man is going to make you happy.
Don't expect to only be happy because of your marriage.
...
Kelly: You basically say if you require major (cosmetic) bodywork, get it done in high school.
Patton: There's not a thing that I've said that they haven't heard me say for decades.
...
Kelly: Many people think you are evil.
Patton: I'm not the one that's evil.
What do you think of Patton's argument that women who want to get married should look for a husband in college?
