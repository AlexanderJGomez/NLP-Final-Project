(CNN) -- Renewable energy is generating a lot of political heat.
Yet it is still a relatively small business compared to the overall energy business, and one that still faces big challenges in getting to scale on a global basis.
The modern renewable industry -- wind, solar, and other forms of energy -- was born with a great deal of excitement in the 1970s and early 1980s.
The European Union's energy policy is now predicated on using renewables to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 80% by 2050.
Over the last decade, growing support by governments for renewable energy has been critical to its development.
Germany and Denmark took the lead in repowering renewables with a new system of electricity rates that blended the higher cost of renewable power into the overall price.
This is considered extremely ambitious, especially given the state's difficult economic situation and a 12% unemployment rate.
One solution is more use of natural gas as renewables' "partner" -- to generate electricity at those times when the sun and wind are off duty.
In the case of renewables, much of the focus is on cost reduction.
To achieve big impact, however, renewables still need to establish that they are competitive at large scale.
In the first half of 2011, renewables constituted 9% of total U.S. energy.
As costs go down, more solar will come into use around the world.
In other words, wind and solar have much ground to cover, and it will take time.
Renewable will be part of a growing global business that will be measured in hundreds of billions of dollars.
