WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Jordan's King Hussein sent a secret message to President Richard Nixon in 1970 pleading with him to attack Syria, according to declassified documents released Wednesday by the former president's library.
The document, a U.S. State Department telegram from the embassy in Jeddah to Washington reads, "BSO and Fatah [are] now linked together in vicious effort to create chaos and uncertainty.
"Even though it is clear from the documents that the United States government did not encourage Israel to acquire a nuclear deterrent, it became a fact of life," Naftali said.
"Syria had invaded Jordan and the Jordanian king, facing what he felt was a military rout, said please help us in any way possible."
The library has withheld the Nixon documents from public access until Wednesday and have been reviewed for release and/or declassified, Naftali said.
