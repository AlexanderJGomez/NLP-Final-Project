Bowe Bergdahl was released from nearly five years in captivity, yellow ribbons and banners celebrating his release decorated the main street, red-bricked storefronts of his hometown.
The letters were sent to the White House as part of a "Bring Bowe Home" campaign started through social media last November, just months before Bergdahl would be released.
In three months, O'Neill said, several hundred thousand letters poured into the White House.
"We would hope that he would like to read through them one day to see just how much he meant to so many people."
But Bergdahl is also waiting to hear if he'll face any criminal charges in the military justice system.
The report will now be reviewed by the director of the Army staff and senior Army leaders.
In the days after his son's release, critics used those details to accuse Bob Bergdahl of sympathizing with the Taliban.
But the expected family reunion never materialized and the Bergdahl family soon stopped answering questions about why Bowe Bergdahl was refusing to see his parents.
Military officials have said Bergdahl has been given every opportunity to reunite with his family.
But Kemery couldn't say if that childhood rebellion was still a source of tension between Bergdahl and his family.
Around Hailey, one often hears people asking the same question, will Bowe Bergdahl ever come back home?
Bergdahl must wait to hear what military commanders will determine about his fate.
We are going to talk about things around the fire," said Kemery.
