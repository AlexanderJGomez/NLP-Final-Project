Tijuana, Mexico (CNN) -- Part of the fence separating the United States and Mexico sits about 50 yards away from hundreds of tunnel-like holes and makeshift tents where people live, stuck between two countries.
It's inside Mexico, just outside the city limits of Tijuana.
Miranda and the others living in El Bordo are stuck in between two countries and their laws.
That was the case for 37-year-old Miguel Valdez, who was in the United States legally just last week.
After serving a five-year prison term, Valdez had his green card revoked just last week, and he was put on a bus and dropped off near Tijuana.
"It just feels the gate itself is so far away, even if I'm standing right next to it," Valdez said, staring at the border separating him from the United States.
"See, it's pretty strong," Miranda said as he jumped on it.
After having lived in the United States for 25 years, Miranda had a home, a job and, most important, a family: a wife and four children, all American citizens.
The deportees have to hide underground to evade local authorities, and for them this is the safest place in Tijuana.
I don't like it at all," Miranda said.
Unwanted by the United States and Mexico, this is the place where thousands have found refuge while they save up enough money to cross back into the United States.
Barajas, a U.S. Army veteran, had his green card revoked and was deported in 2004 after being convicted of a felony for shooting an illegal firearm.
You look like you're homeless.
He doesn't hide the fact that some of the deportees living at El Bordo are heroin addicts.
"Yeah," he said sheepishly, like a child caught eating too much candy.
"Why?
Back at El Bordo, Miranda wastes no time counting down the days until he returns home.
The situation here is no good."
