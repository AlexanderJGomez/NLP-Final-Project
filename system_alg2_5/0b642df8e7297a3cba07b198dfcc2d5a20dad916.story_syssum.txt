Amy Stokes: They will talk about being very happy as children and growing up with two parents until they were grade school level.
They will move where they can be in a community that helps support them and then they'll lose the other parent.
There's no technology; there are no computers.
If you reach out to them they will grab that lifeline and work so hard to make your investment of time and talent worth your while.
When they get connected with their mentors, the mentors make sure that no one is ever truly alone.
