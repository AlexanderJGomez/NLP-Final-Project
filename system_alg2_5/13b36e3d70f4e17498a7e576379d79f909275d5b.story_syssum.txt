Gen. Martin Dempsey traveled to Iraq "to confer (with) Iraqi political and security officials on next phase of the campaign to defeat (ISIS)," according to a tweet from Brett McGurk, a U.S. diplomat focused on ISIS as well as Iran and Iraq.
The Joint Chiefs chairman met there with Massoud Barzani, the President of the semi-autonomous region, according to Gregory.
That's what Washington is calling its military campaign against ISIS, which consists largely of U.S.-led airstrikes against the terrorist group as well as support for the Iraqi military.
Yet in testimony Thursday to the House Armed Services Committee, Dempsey said he would not rule out asking the President to send U.S. ground troops into Iraq.
He told the committee that he could envision scenarios in which a U.S. ground contingent would be necessary there, particularly if the coalition moves to retake Mosul or the western border with Syria.
