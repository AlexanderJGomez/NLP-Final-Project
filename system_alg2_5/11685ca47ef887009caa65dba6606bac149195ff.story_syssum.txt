CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Hey, I'm Carl Azuz, reporting from Washington, D.C. this week where -- get this -- it is actually hotter than it is 500 miles south in Atlanta, Georgia at CNN's world headquarters!
KAREN CAIFA, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Right, Carl.
REBECCA SCRITCHFIELD, REGISTERED DIETITIAN: We need to be eating, and we need to be eating light meals, eating often, and we also want to make sure that we replace a lot of the water that we lose when we're sweating.
SCRITCHFIELD: Some of the nutrients that you get in dairy foods, you can actually get in vegetables.
CAIFA: And most people know to stay hydrated, but check the labels on flavored waters and other drinks.
CAIFA: And you want to be sure you're not taking in too much caffeine and things like soda and things like iced coffee, because when it's really hot outside and you're working and you're running around, your heart rate can start racing really fast.
CAIFA: You can stick with that in moderation, like all good things.
