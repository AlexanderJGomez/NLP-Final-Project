(CNN) -- On the morning of August 5, my uncle, Satwant Singh Kaleka, and five other innocent people were gunned down in our place of worship, the Sikh Temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin.
A recent study by the New America Foundation found that non-Islamic U.S. citizens were behind 10 attacks from 9/11 through 2011, while jihadists carried out four.
The study found not a single jihadist terrorist possessed or tried to acquire chemical or biological weapons.
A coward killed my uncle.
This problem affects each and every one of us, so it's imperative that we act decisively, and act now.
Together we can -- together we must -- address this challenge by calling on our elected officials to do their duty: defend the safety and freedom we as all Americans cherish.
