And I'm not prepared to comment on what kind of democratic process the Egyptian people can construct for themselves.
But we obviously want to see people who are truly committed to democracy, not to imposing any ideology on Egyptians, and therefore we would like to encourage that people who have been the voice of protests and been the voice of civil society be the ones at the table trying to design what would be an orderly transition to meet the democratic and economic needs of the people."
-- Clinton, "State of the Union"
And Mubarak is not Egypt."

And I don't think the American people will tolerate increasing the debt limit without serious reductions in spending and changes to the budget process, so that we can make sure that this never happens again.

I came here to do something.
I came here to do something on behalf of the American people."
