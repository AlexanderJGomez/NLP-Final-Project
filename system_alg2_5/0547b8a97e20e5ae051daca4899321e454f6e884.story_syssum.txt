(CNN)  -- President Obama said in an interview aired Sunday that the hardest decision he's made since taking office was to send more troops to Afghanistan.
Coming off a tumultuous week over the millions in bonuses paid out to employees of AIG, Obama said Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's job is secure despite critics calling for his resignation.
"As a general proposition, you don't want to be passing laws that are just targeting a handful of individuals," Obama said.
"You want to pass laws that have some broad applicability ... you certainly don't want to use the tax code to punish people."
