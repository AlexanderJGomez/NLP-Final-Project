But even while Clinton was in Beijing, the Chinese government was maintaining a heated diplomatic back-and-forth on another territorial controversy, this one concerning a set of small islands in the East China Sea also claimed by Japan and Taiwan.
The uninhabited islands are known in Japan as Senkaku and in China as Diaoyu, and are privately owned by a Japanese family.
Both the Chinese and the U.S. camps sought to play down the cancellation of Clinton's meeting with Vice President Xi on Wednesday, saying he had also called off meetings with other foreign officials.
Chinese officials said Xi would send a letter to Clinton.
The territorial disputes over islands in the South China Sea complicate that role.
The stakes are raised further by estimates that potentially huge reserves of natural gas and oil lie underneath the seabed.
"While the likelihood of major conflict remains low, all of the trends are in the wrong direction, and prospects of resolution are diminishing," the International Crisis Group said in a July report.
