That's more than the TSA has seized in any other year of its existence, and it's a 22% increase from the 1,813 guns seized in 2013.
Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport security seized the most guns last year, with 120.
Passengers whose guns are spotted by TSA security during the screening process can be arrested by airport or local police and face criminal charges, and the TSA can impose civil penalties.
The 1,813 guns seized by the TSA in 2013 was up from 1,556 seizures in 2012 and 1,320 in 2011.
The TSA also found more than 1,400 firearm components, replica firearms, stun guns and other "dangerous objects" in carry-on luggage.
Check them or ship them ahead of time.
