(CNN) -- A typhoon that left at least 18 people dead and thousands displaced in the Philippines was expected to move offshore Wednesday afternoon, the state-run Philippines News Agency reported early Wednesday.
In Albay, in southern Luzon, more than 3,000 people were affected, the state-run news agency said early Wednesday.
On Tuesday, weather officials said the storm was packing top winds of 140 kph (87 mph).
Several areas in Metro Manila and nearby provinces were without electricity as the powerful storm cut power and transmission lines.
Dacalanio said the winds had uprooted street lights and brought down trees and road signs, but that luckily there was no flooding near his home.
