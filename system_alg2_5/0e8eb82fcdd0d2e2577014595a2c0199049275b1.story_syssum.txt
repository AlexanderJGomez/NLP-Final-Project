Last month in Florida, a school bus driver witnessed a vicious assault on a 13-year-old boy.
We all want to think that we would disregard our own personal safety to help children, but in a highly charged moment, a bystander is forced to make an instant, possibly haunting judgment about risk and danger.
Fail to intervene, and it haunts you; intervene, and you may become the victim.
In the Florida situation, there was an immediate danger that required a response but not necessarily significant physical risk.
Bus drivers can be trained in the use of tools and techniques that can help disable violent teens (e.g., use of pepper spray).
