Orbital Sciences Corp. sent up its first entry into the space freight business Wednesday with the launch of a new unmanned cargo carrier to the International Space Station.
Unlike the SpaceX Dragon capsule, which is designed to be reused and eventually carry passengers, the can-shaped, 17-foot Cygnus is a one-shot craft that will burn up on re-entry after its flight to the space station.
Orbital has a $1.9 billion contract with NASA to make eight flights to the space station under the space agency's commercial supply program.
SpaceX has so far made two of its 12 scheduled flights to the ISS under a $1.6 billion contract.
