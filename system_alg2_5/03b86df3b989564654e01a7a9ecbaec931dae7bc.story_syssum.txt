To transform this positive choice into a global movement, Stein and I created the first World Vasectomy Day in 2013 -- and set out to inspire 100 doctors in 25 countries to do 1,000 vasectomies.
It has a less than 1% failure rate, compared with 18% for condoms, making it an important option for men whose families are complete.
Sadly, while men waffle on the sidelines, more than 300 million women have had tubal ligations -- six times the number of men having vasectomies, even though tubal ligations are more invasive, costly and risky.
With all these reasons, you'd think for men who no longer wish to have children choosing a family planning option that is permanent, safe and secure would be a no-brainer.
In my travels, I met men in their 20s who know they don't want children and men in their 70s who do.
On World Vasectomy Day, we don't decide who should or should not get a vasectomy, but we do insist that it be voluntary.
The bottom line is that all methods of birth control come with some element of risk.
What we learned in creating World Vasectomy Day bodes well for our future.
