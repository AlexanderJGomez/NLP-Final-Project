President Theodore Roosevelt.
The problem was that a serious movement was afoot to ban the sport -- to get rid of football.
Remember, the NFL did not exist -- the college game was the top level of the sport.
...
Thus, Roosevelt convened a meeting in the White House of the most influential men in college football.
Miller said that Roosevelt did not use the "big stick"-- he did not threaten and he did not pound the table.
There was some resistance during and after the meeting, but eventually football's leaders would agree to get rid of many of the elements that had turned the sport into all-but-unregulated brutality.
"It revolutionized the game," Miller said.
If football leaders were called to the White House today, the whole country would know it in advance, and for any president, "the risk of getting involved at that level is the risk of not succeeding."
