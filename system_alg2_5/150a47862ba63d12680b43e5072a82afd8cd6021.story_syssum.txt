Police say a girl was lured to a storage shed at an apartment complex where she was sexually assaulted.
The victim and the boys charged are all from refugee families that have come to the United States from the war-torn West African nation of Liberia, police said.
Andy Hill said.
CNN affiliate KTVK said it interviewed the girl's 23-year-old sister, who said she was baby-sitting the girl at the time of the alleged attack.
Now the other people, they don't want to see her," the sister told KTVK.
"The family [believes they] have been shamed by her, not a crime, but the name of the family has been degraded and news will get back to Liberia.
"In Liberia, the family and law enforcement officers would be embracing the victim.
