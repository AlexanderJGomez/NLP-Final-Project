(CNN) -- Writer and producer Larry Gelbart, most known for his work on the hit television series "M*A*S*H," died Friday morning in his Beverly Hills, California, home, his wife said.
"I never had any aspirations of [a] literary career, but writing for radio seemed to be a natural extension of being such a radio fan," Gelbart told CNN in 1999.
Not just because it got there first, but because it got there first with so much," Gelbart said.
In 1972, Gelbart helped create the Korean War comedy drama "M*A*S*H." The show went on for another 11 years, although Gelbart only wrote and produced "M*A*S*H" for the first four seasons.
"I said once that the only way before 'M*A*S*H' you would get any feeling out of your television set is if you touched it while you were wet," Gelbart said.
Gelbart continued steamrolling through the industry, with works including the 1982 hit film "Tootsie," "Oh, God!"
