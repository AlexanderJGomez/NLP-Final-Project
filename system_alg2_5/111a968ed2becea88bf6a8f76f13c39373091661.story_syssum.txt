Private jet sales slowed to a crawl following the global recession, falling 3.4% to 682 in 2012 in the U.S. and rising just 0.9% the following year.
This week at the Farnborough International Airshow, Parajet is showcasing the SkyRunner to potential aviation distributors with a price tag of $80,000.
"We have built it and proved it works so now we can take it forward to manufacturing.
New competitors are also emerging.
The existing market for private planes is "not dynamic or growing", says Charles Alcock, Editor-in-Chief of Aviation International News, suggesting there could be an opportunity for innovators to steal a march, as occurred before the crash.
But if the SkyRunner design is not yet cleared for take off, it provides an exciting and plausible glimpse of a future of aircraft ownership we can all aspire to.
