In July 2001, 96 U.S. senators voted to extend sanctions against Iran.
Chuck Hagel was one of only two senators who voted against sanctions.
In July 2008, Hagel recommended that Washington go beyond direct talks and establish a U.S. diplomatic mission in Tehran.
It is a messianic theocracy intent on exporting its violent Islamist revolution.
More recently, in January 2009, Hagel signed a letter advising Obama to spearhead direct, unconditional talks with Hamas, a terrorist group that had just fired hundreds of rockets into Israel.
Oh Allah, destroy the Americans and their supporters.
