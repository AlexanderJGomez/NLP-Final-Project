Recently, the embattled comedian's attorneys filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit accusing the actor-comedian of sexually assaulting plaintiff Judith Huth in 1974 at the Playboy Mansion when she was 15.
A demurrer essentially says the complaint is so defective as written, that it should be dismissed His attorneys have also gone on the offensive, asking the court to impose sanctions against the attorneys who filed this lawsuit.
Huth's attorneys should have complied with these rules.
Huth filed her complaint long after the time permitted by the statute of limitations.
Accordingly, some jurisdictions have special rules extending the time to file in cases of childhood sexual abuse.
Huth was 15 years old in 1974 when the alleged abuse took place, and at least 55 years old when she filed this lawsuit.
That's why a plaintiff is prohibited under the rules from identifying the defendant by name until the court gives permission.
She didn't.
Even if Huth amended her complaint, Cosby's name is out there.
But, under the rules of the Superior Court of California, this complaint should be dismissed.
