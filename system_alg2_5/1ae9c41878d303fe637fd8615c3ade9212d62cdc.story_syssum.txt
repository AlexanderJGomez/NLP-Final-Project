Except Anthony is living for a year in Beijing with a Chinese family.
Their ranks include Shunshun Zhang, 18, who spent three years studying at a high school in Vermont.
Many of my American classmates thought it was insane to leave America and go to school for a year in China.
The Chinese people I meet are always friendly and willing to help.
Living with a Chinese family has been wonderful.
I consider and treat my host family as if they were my own family at home.
Shunshun Zhang recently graduated after studying at a high school in Vermont for three years.
At first, I thought it would be very hard for me to make friends among the high school students but within the first few weeks I was proved wrong.
I grew up in Beijing and I never experienced country life and every family seems like a small part of a bigger family.
There are a lot of things that I would never have learned and experienced if I went to school in Beijing.
My high school in the U.S. offers many more diverse classes compared to schools in China.
I never thought that the knowledge I learned from school could be so diverse.
