He's the guy that got me to sing with him.
I had no experience whatsoever; I just wrote the first four songs in my life, which were "Bad Motor Scooter," "Make It Last," "One Thing on My Mind," and "I Don't Want It," played them for Ronnie upon first meeting, shook my hand, and said, "Let's start a band."
I said, "I'm going to be like that guy.
I was talking to a guy a couple of days after the show, and he said, "That's Ronnie Montrose, and that was his last show.
You got any songs?"
I played him my four songs, we shook hands, and he said, "Let's start a band.
Like I said, I went from zero to a hundred in the blink of an eye -- all because of Ronnie.
We butted heads and I got thrown out of the band [after one more album, 1974's Paper Money], but I carried on with that "first Ronnie Montrose" I saw.
The first time Eddie Van Halen and I met, it was around 1977.
He said on the first Van Halen record, he took the first Montrose record in there and said, "Boom.
Eddie had a totally new twist on the whole guitar style thing, but as far as the chording goes -- not his soloing as much as the chording -- yeah, he took some of that big open chord thing [from Montrose].
I said to Ronnie, "Come on, man.
And he was in, we were all in.
And Ronnie was in.
But if you're going to remember him for anything, put on that first Montrose record.
The only positive I can grab onto is the fact that the music will live on.
