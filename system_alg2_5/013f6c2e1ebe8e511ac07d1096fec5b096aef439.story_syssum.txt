I've consistently faced "random" selections for extra screening at the airport after I decided to wear the hijab, or Muslim head covering.
One time, the woman in front of me had a hairdo that could pose more of a security threat than any head scarf could.
The TSA uses the hijab to profile Muslim women, and passengers can now expect a full-body pat-down, an appallingly invasive "enhanced pat-down search  that could include the chest and groin, or a planned "mind-scan"  that would track people's reaction to terrorist symbols.
Radio host Mike Gallagher said, "There should be a separate line to scrutinize anybody with the name Abdul or Ahmed or Mohammed."
For people who aren't affected by racial profiling at airports, imagine this: The TSA implements a new rule to counter drunken driving, which kills over 13,000 Americans every year.
Thirty-two million Americans report that they have been the victims of racial profiling.
There are some people who don't know Muslims and are numb to realizing the effects of profiling.
And Muslims, here's something to think about: If your knowledge of Islam came from common stereotypes, wouldn't you also be misinformed about the faith and its followers?
There are some Americans who think Muslims are terrorists and some Muslims who think that other Americans are willfully ignorant.
It's essential for U.S. security that airport screening be done.
