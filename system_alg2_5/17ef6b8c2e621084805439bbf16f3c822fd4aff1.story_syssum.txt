U.S. airplanes are dropping medical supplies and weapons into this Kurdish city as defenders try to beat back the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS.
Even though local defenders control some 70% of the city, Kobani is cut off, and ISIS forces have been shelling it with mortars from the east and south, local government official Anwar Muslim said this week.
But a video posted on social media shows what appears to be an ISIS fighter next to a parachute bundle.
Fighting in Kobani continued Wednesday, with six Kurdish defenders killed and the bodies of 10 ISIS fighters recovered, a Kurdish fighter there said.
