The Log Cabin Republicans had filed an emergency request with the nation's highest court to reverse the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals decision allowing the military to continue with "don't ask, don't tell" while the government appeals a lower court ruling that the law is unconstitutional.
They are likely to tackle the constitutional questions after the appeals court issues its ruling, if Congress or the White House does not act first to repeal the current law.
The Justice Department requested a temporary stay of that ruling, which was denied by Phillips but granted by the appeals court.
The appeals judges also noted that legislation pending before Congress to repeal the policy would render the case before them moot.
In their appeal, the Log Cabin Republicans said allowing the policy to remain in effect pending appeal is unacceptable and would cause "irreparable harm."
The legislation before Congress includes the process for repeal agreed to with Gates and Mullen.
In response to the court case, Gates recently raised the level at which gay and lesbian troops can be discharged under "don't ask, don't tell" by ordering that it be done only by the secretaries of the Army, Navy and Air Force.
