Thousands of people tuned in last weekend to watch as two tiny eaglets emerged from their carefully-guarded eggs, thanks to a live streaming Eagle Cam installed by the school.
"People are personally invested," said Christine Reinolds Kozelle, director of news and editorial services at Berry College.
Soon, cameras were installed: one on the approach to the tree and two infrared cameras with direct views into the nest.
Kozelle said there have been over 20 million views since the livestream was set up last year.
Then India.
But school officials point out that this natural behavior for eaglets.
"It's very common when there is more than one sibling for one to dominate," Kozelle said.
The eagles bring thousands of visitors to the campus of Berry College.
"One of the wonderful takeaways is that it has brought to light the resurgence of eagles," Kozelle said.
