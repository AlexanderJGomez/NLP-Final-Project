"It's a great honor to be asked to be the next manager of Manchester United," Moyes told United's official website.
"I have had a terrific job at Everton, with a tremendous chairman and Board of Directors and a great set of players.
"David is a man of great integrity with a strong work ethic.
Moyes told Everton chairman Bill Kenwright of his desire to join Manchester United and succeed Ferguson on Wednesday.
"Everton can confirm that David Moyes will leave the Club at the end of the season," the Merseyside club said in a statement.
His final two games as Everton manager will be against West Ham United and Chelsea.
Moyes may need to find a replacement for Wayne Rooney, who has told the club he wants to leave according to British reports Thursday -- but United said he is not for sale.
Moyes gave Rooney his debut as a 16-year-old at Everton but they fell out when the England striker left for Old Trafford in 2004.
