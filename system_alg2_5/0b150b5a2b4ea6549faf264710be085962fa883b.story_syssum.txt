Natalie Dylan, 22, said she has put her virginity up for auction through the Moonlite Bunny Ranch.
But as to why men would bid so much money on virginity, she said she has no answer.
"I feel people should be pro-choice with their body, and I'm not hurting anyone," she said.
Through the 1950s in America, women were expected to remain virgins until marriage, Carpenter said.
The new part is the Internet," Carpenter said.
Dylan said she was inspired by a report of a Peruvian woman who put her virginity up for sale.
Others say there's just too much hype around virginity.
Many people say losing one's virginity has different implications for men than women.
The importance of a woman's virginity may vary in different cultures, but generally there's not the high value there used to be, Ray said.
Generally people have been supportive, Dylan said.
"I would always want to find a partner that can accept me for me."
