Washington (CNN) -- House Appropriations Committee Chairman David Obey, a senior member of the congressional Democratic leadership, announced Wednesday that he is not seeking re-election this November.
But even more frankly, I am bone tired," he said.
I haven't done all of the big things that I wanted to do when I started out, but I've done all of the big things that I'm likely to do," he said.
Earlier this year, Time magazine named Duffy as one of 10 GOP contenders capable of providing a Scott Brown-like upset, referring to the Republican's surprise win in the Massachusetts Senate election.
"Chairman Obey would have won re-election again had he run.
Obey said he believes the job of a good politician is to be "used up" fighting for causes one believes in, and then stepping aside to let someone else carry on the battle.
