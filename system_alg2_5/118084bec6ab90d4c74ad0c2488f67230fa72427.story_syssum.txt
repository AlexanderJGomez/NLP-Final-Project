LONDON, England (CNN) -- Nobel laureate biologist James Watson was suspended Friday from his longtime post at a research laboratory and canceled his planned British book tour after controversial comments that black people are not as intelligent as white people.
The biologist apologized "unreservedly" Thursday for his comments and said he was "mortified" by the words attributed to him.
Soon afterward, a spokeswoman for the Center for Life in Newcastle, where Watson was expected to speak Sunday night, said they had been told Watson was canceling all speaking engagements and was already flying home.
It said the board publicly disagreed with the comments attributed to Watson in the Sunday Times.
