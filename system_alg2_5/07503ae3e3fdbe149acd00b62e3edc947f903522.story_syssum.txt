One day after Ai Weiwei was released on bail, the dissident artist remained at home, unable to speak with anyone about why he was detained or what awaits him now.
Ai's release came without much fanfare.
It was not a customary answer from the provocative conceptual artist, renowned as a harsh, uncompromising critic of Chinese government policies.
He also has accused the Chinese government of trying to silence dissidents.
Beijing police accused him of evading a "huge amount" of taxes, Xinhua reported in May, more than a month after he was detained.
Observers in Beijing said it may not be coincidental that Ai's release on Wednesday took place on the eve of Premier Wen Jiabao's upcoming visit to Hungary, Britain and Germany, where Ai enjoys wide support among artists and politicians.
International reporting on Ai, including on CNN, was blacked out.
"He's got to keep quiet and behave according to the criteria of the Chinese police for the foreseeable future," Cohen said.
Beijing police told state media that Ai had been released on bail because of his good attitude in confessing his alleged crimes and also said he was suffering from a chronic disease.
"A lot of the censorship that happens in China is self-censorship, and I think the fact that Weiwei doesn't engage in self-censorship is a big reason why people gravitate to him," said Klayman, whose feature film "Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry" is set to be released this fall.
