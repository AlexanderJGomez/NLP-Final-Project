Why?
Most Americans who don't currently go online have never gone online before -- and no one else in their household uses the Internet.
People with disabilities also are more likely to not use the Internet.
Having broadband access at home is one of the best ways to get the most benefits (or at least the most use) from the web -- and Pew found that right now 40% of U.S. adults don't have broadband at home.
Even with these gains, however, minorities are still less likely than whites to have home broadband overall.
However, a third of these people don't have home broadband -- and their smartphone is the main way they access the internet.
"Once someone has a wireless device, she becomes much more active in how she uses the internet -- not just with wireless connectivity, but also with wired devices," said Pew.
