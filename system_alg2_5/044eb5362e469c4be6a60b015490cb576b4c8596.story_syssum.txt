At least 79 people died as a result of last week's crash.
Questions have focused on the speed at which the train was traveling as it entered a curve in the track near Santiago de Compostela on Wednesday evening.
At least 63 of the dead are Spanish, she said.
He was injured and later released from the hospital.
The death toll rose to at least 79 on Sunday morning when another person died, a representative for the regional health department said.
At least five U.S. citizens were injured, said State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf.
But she said the speed limit for the bend of track where the crash occurred is 80 kph.
Maria Vigo, whose home is on the bank above the rail tracks, told CNN how she heard a crash, then the deafening squeal of metal on concrete.
"She was under wreckage she said she wanted to get out and go home," he said.
The survivors looked like the walking dead, he said.
Another victim, speaking from a hospital bed with his arm in a sling, told CNN affiliate Atlas that it seemed like the train was going fast.
