(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy is off to a good start at the Scottish Open.
"Everything was pretty much on," McIlroy said.
Last year Phil Mickelson used the Scottish Open at Castle Stuart as the springboard to his British Open title and his 68 leaves him well within touching distance of McIlroy.
It was a good day."
