But a state investigation into the claims -- which date back to the 1950s and 1960s -- found insufficient evidence to prosecute any former workers at the Dozier School for Boys in Marianna, Florida.
The claims provided here are an example," he said.
The allegations against school workers were made by a group of men -- now in their 60s -- who call themselves "the white house boys" after a nondescript white concrete building on the school grounds where they say the beatings and torture were carried out, often with a thick leather strap.
The FDLE said its investigators interviewed six former staff members from Dozier and more than 100 former students and their relatives.
Most of the former students interviewed during the investigation agreed that a wooden paddle or leather strap was used for punishment, the report said, but there was disagreement about the number of spankings and the severity.
Some of the accusers said the graves -- marked only by white steel crosses, rusted with the passage of time -- contained the bodies of boys who were beaten to death by school workers.
He said he walked into the school's laundry room one day and saw a black teenager inside a large tumble dryer that was running.
Do it!
But the FDLE report said there were inconsistencies in the story and a lack of evidence.
About 300 of the former reform school students sued former school administrators.
One of the men named in the original lawsuit is Troy Tidwell, a former reform school administrator, who still lives near the school grounds in Marianna.
Colon says the FDLE's report about what happened at the school is wrong, and he wants to do his own investigation.
