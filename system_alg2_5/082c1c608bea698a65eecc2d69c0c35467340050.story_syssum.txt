"I want my son to know me as a victor, not a victim," Knight told host Dr. Phil McGraw.
Castro lured Knight into his vehicle from a Family Dollar store in Cleveland in 2002, promising to give her a ride.
Knight, Berry and the third woman, Gina DeJesus, have since been trying to readjust to life as free women.

"That's where I tried to get out," Knight said.
"He took a pipe and he held it ... over my head, and he said, 'If you scream, I'll ram this down your throat and I'll kill you,'" Knight recalled, describing what she said was Castro's response after she used a pair of pliers and a wire cutter to remove a chain around her neck.
At first, she said, they rarely saw each other.
And when she saw Berry, Knight said, she tried to comfort her.
In the interview with McGraw, Knight said she once watched Castro kill a beloved dog by breaking its neck.

In response, her mother, Barbara Knight, issued a statement to the "Dr. Phil" show.
I love my daughter.
I pray that someday she will heal enough to know that again."
