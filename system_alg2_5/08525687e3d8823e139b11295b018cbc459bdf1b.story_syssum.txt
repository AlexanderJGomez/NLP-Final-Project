The allegations were "fully vetted and rejected by independent authorities," Allen attorney Elkan Abramowitz said in a written statement.
When Mia Farrow's 12-year relationship with Allen ended two decades ago, the actress accused him of molesting Dylan, one of two children she had adopted with Allen.

Dylan Farrow's letter addressed this: "Woody Allen was never convicted of any crime.

"You are mistaken if you think there is a place for me, or any outsider, in this family's issue," he wrote.
