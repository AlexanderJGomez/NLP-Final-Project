WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Former Vice President Dick Cheney said Monday that he does not believe Saddam Hussein was involved in the planning or execution of the September 11, 2001, attacks.
Cheney restated his claim that "there was a relationship between al Qaeda and Iraq that stretched back 10 years.
That was the judgment of our [intelligence community] and State Department."
On Monday, though, Cheney identified former CIA Director George Tenet as the "prime source of information" on the relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda.
Among other things Monday, Cheney also called the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention center a "good facility ... if you are going to be engaged in a world conflict, such as we are, in terms of global war on terrorism.
...
Cheney said Monday that the memos previously released also were the subject of ongoing lawsuits.
On May 21, Cheney gave a full-throated defense of the Bush administration's enhanced interrogations of al Qaeda prisoners during an appearance at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.
