(CNN) -- Steve Jobs wasn't eager to disclose details of his health issues over the years.
"I don't think of my life as a career," he told Time in 2010.
James mentioned that his girlfriend had died of melanoma two years before.
"Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.

One of the first calls Bob Longo, a former sales chief for the failed computer company Jobs founded called NeXT Computer, made after getting diagnosed with cancer was to Jobs.
The pair kept in touch, Longo recalled to the Pittsburgh Business Times, and Longo received an exuberant e-mail from Jobs after telling him the news that Longo's surgery was successful.

If you're going to leave anything behind, it's going toÂ be your kids, a few friends and your work.
And it's what kept me going five years ago.
Jobs died 16 months later to a public outpouring of grief.
