Zlitan, Libya (CNN) -- Firefighters battled a blaze caused by NATO airstrikes at a food-storage complex Monday in Zlitan, increasingly a front-line city in the conflict between Libyan government troops and rebels fighting to oust longtime ruler Moammar Gadhafi.
And another attack two days ago demolished what he described as a military base several hundred yards up the road, killing at least two people, he said.
When Libyan government minders last brought CNN to Zlitan about a week and a half ago, it was to see a large pro-Gadhafi rally in the city's main square.
"People here call NATO the crazy one which lost its sanity," said Ramadan Mohamad Ramadan, an official from the local city government.
Ramadan was standing in front of the rubble of a health clinic that he said had been demolished by a pre-dawn attack on Monday.
NATO forces had hit a number of targets near Zlitan that were "military in nature" Monday, the representative said.
In the afternoon, government minders brought journalists to the ruins of a mosque and school located in an all-but-deserted residential neighborhood several kilometers to the east of Zlitan's city center.
A four-door sedan, caked with mud and carrying several men wearing camouflage and carrying Kalashnikov rifles, drove past, also headed away from the direction of the front lines as the cloud from a second apparent air strike billowed in the distance.
Monday's government tour of Zlitan was over, but the fighting there appeared to have barely begun.
