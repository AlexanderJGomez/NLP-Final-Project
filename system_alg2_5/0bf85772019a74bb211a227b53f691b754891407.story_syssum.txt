SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- The owner of Luscious Garage is wondering whether the electric wall outlet will be the "gas tank" of the future.
"The regular Prius is a gasoline dependent car; it doesn't get energy from anywhere but the gas tank," said Coquillette.
"Gas becomes optional," with this conversion, Coquillette said.
The garage itself strives to be green, with much of its power coming from solar panels.
But for hybrid owners who demonstrate exuberant efforts to find more energy efficiency, "we really appreciate the fact that the Prius is the vehicle of choice," said Jana Hartline, environmental communications manager for Toyota.
Hartline said the Prius was not designed with any conversion possibilities in mind, but she said the company welcomes any technology that pushes the envelope on plug-in batteries.
Also, as more drivers become interested in alternative energy, they will need to learn more about infrastructure.
People come to me and say, 'I want to do this right away,' " said Coquillette.
However, most U.S. electricity is created from burning fossil fuels -- about 70 percent, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency of the Department of Energy.
