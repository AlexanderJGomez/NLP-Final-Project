(CNN) -- First lady Michelle Obama is heading to Iowa next month to campaign in one of the closest Senate races of the 2014 midterms.
It might not come as a big surprise to Iowans that the first lady will be making a public appearance on the trail instead of her husband.
Other popular Democrats will appear in Iowa this weekend as well.
The Des Moines Register first reported Obama's plans.
