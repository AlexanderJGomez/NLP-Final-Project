They faced their fears when US Airways Flight 1549 hit a flock of geese and crash-landed in the Hudson River.
"The first time people meet you, they want to hear the sensational part" of the crash, says Ben, 39.
With the nation in the thick of recession, she scooped up bargains for herself.
Ben -- who was in New York for a quick business trip for Lending Tree -- caught a glimpse of the 5-foot, 10-inch knockout near the gate.
He was in 20A, a window seat on the left side of the plane.
About 90 seconds into the flight, the plane -- traveling at 250 mph and carrying 150 passengers and five crew -- struck a flock of geese.
"The whole back of the engine was pretty much engulfed in flames, just shooting out of the back," he says.

She'd jumped at the chance to take on a bigger role with Belk in Charlotte.
Her bird phobia was rooted in days on the farm, where her grandmother kept chickens.

As the plane glided silently through the air, Ben peeked out the window every once in a while.
Water lapped at Laura's leather boots.
I've been in a plane crash."
A flight attendant in first class waved passengers to the front.
In the media blitz that followed, Laura noticed Ben for the first time on television.
Six months after the crash, when about 20 survivors and their families gathered at a home near Charlotte, Ben and Laura met in person for the first time.
"We connected," Laura says.
"We were family," Ben says, "and we didn't want to ruin that aspect of it."
Ben never sits at a window seat.
"It put me back in that seat," she says, tears in her eyes.
Her relationship with Ben, she says, is another "positive outcome" from that day.
"Think about how you want to write today's page," Ben says.
