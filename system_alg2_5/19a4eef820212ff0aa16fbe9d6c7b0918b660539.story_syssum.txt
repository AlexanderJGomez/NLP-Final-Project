"Meticulous efforts must be paid to the tasks of reform, development and stability to (bolster) development and maintain perennial stability in Tibet," Hu said, according to a report in the state-run Xinhua news agency.
Yet, even as the Dalai Lama has said Tibet desires autonomy and cultural continuity but not necessarily full independence from Beijing, China's central government has viewed him as a troublemaker intent on destroying the nation's sovereignty.
Combating "anything that could sabotage stability" was a key theme Sunday for Zhang Qinli, the Beijing-backed Communist party chief of the Tibetan region, according to another Xinhua report.
Another official told the news agency that a new train line -- also to be built by 2015 -- would drastically cut travel time between the capitals of the provinces of ethnic Tibet and Xinjiang.
"The new railway line will play a significant role in boosting the economic development in the country's western regions and promoting exchanges among different ethnic groups," said Luo Yulin, vice governor of Qinghai.
