But it is that pursuit of peace, with all its contradictions and all its sacrifices, that remains the centerpiece of Memorial Day.
It's the Alfred Eisenstaedt photo of the sailor and the nurse embracing in Times Square.
One person who was in fact present during those last hours of World War II was Paul Tibbets.
During the many days and evenings I spent with him during the final years of his life, there were occasions when the conversation would turn to that photo of the sailor and the nurse.
What Paul Tibbets, navigator Dutch Van Kirk, bombardier Tom Ferebee and their crew were asked to do over the skies of Japan is something that is difficult for many people to think about; it's much more pleasant to smile at the sight of the kiss in New York.
Peace is the sun-dappled result, but getting there can be a path of darkness upon darkness.
All the lightness and all the shadows, all the wars waged at terrible costs, all in pursuit of peace.
