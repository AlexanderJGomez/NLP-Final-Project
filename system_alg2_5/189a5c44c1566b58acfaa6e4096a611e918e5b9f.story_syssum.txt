Aasta, Norway (CNN) -- Three rapid blasts echoed across the Norwegian countryside on Tuesday as police detonated explosives found at a farm owned by the suspect in last week's bloodbath in Oslo and the island of Utoya.
Lippestad said Breivik didn't expect to reach Utoya, where he is accused of shooting 68 people dead.
Norwegian police released the first few names of victims of the attacks Tuesday afternoon.
Lippestad said Breivik had told him he was in touch with two terror cells in Norway and in contact with other cells abroad, but that he acted alone in carrying out the attack on Utoya and the Oslo bombing.
Breivik is cooperating with police inquiries, "but he won't talk about the other cells," he said.
Other countries are involved in the Norwegian investigation into last week's attacks, police said in response to a question about Breivik's claim to have been in contact with terror cells abroad.
"In my darkest moments, I think that rather than killing all those people, he should have taken his own life," Jens Breivik said in an interview with Norway's TV2.
He must be," the father said in response to a reporter's question about whether he thought his son was mentally ill.
Lippestad said Breivik does not know what his father said.
"No.
It's been a summer camp for the Labour Party, now it's to be an island for everyone."
According to Heger, Breivik said he worked with two cells to launch the attacks, the deadliest onslaught in Norway since World War II.
Breivik is now "very tired" because of his circumstances, he said, but he was not injured when he was taken into police custody.

The author accuses the Labour Party of embracing those ideals and allowing the "Islamification of Europe."
Breivik asked to wear a uniform to the court hearing but was not allowed to, Heger said.
According to the Norwegian newspaper VG, which cited unidentified sources, Breivik told investigators during interviews that he belonged to a revived Knights Templar.
