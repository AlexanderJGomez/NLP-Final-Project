The manhunt for Eric Matthew Frein, accused of killing a Pennsylvania state trooper, is over.
"We just thought it was fitting," State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said.
The squad of 13 U.S. marshals -- armed like a military special operations squad -- found Frein at an abandoned airport near Tannersville, authorities said.
There was no struggle, Pike County District Attorney Raymond Tonkin said.
Frein was in good physical condition when he was captured, apart from a cut on his nose that he had before the marshals found him, according to Noonan.
His voice was strong as he answered, "Yes I do," to a Pike County judge's question if he understood the charges against him, which include first-degree murder and criminal homicide of a law enforcement officer.
Tom Corbett said he expects authorities to make sure Frein stays safe.
Tonkin declined to say what, if anything, Frein has revealed about the attack that left Dickson dead and Douglass critically wounded.
"Eric Frein had a mission that was to attack law enforcement," Noonan said.
There was no indication that anyone was helping Frein, who was "quite well-prepared," Noonan said.
We didn't go out of school for weeks for recess," resident Shannon Juirad told WNEP.
But with Frein in custody, the trick-or-treating will go on as normal, said Barrett Township Board Chairman Ralph Megliola.
We are so proud of our Pennsylvania State Police, their hard work," another said.
