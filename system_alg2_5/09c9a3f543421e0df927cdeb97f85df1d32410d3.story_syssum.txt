Ahmad Shah Massoud, center in white shirt, leads his men in his beloved Afghan mountains.
The man Junger met was Ahmad Shah Massoud, the "Lion of Panjshir."
Massoud had a reputation for integrity and strength, says Junger, who traveled to Afghanistan in 2000 to profile Massoud for his book, "Fire."
"All he wanted was to have Afghanistan for Afghanistan," Shorish-Shamley says.
Massoud became Afghanistan's most famous resistance leader after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979.
Shorish-Shamley, the women's rights activist, says Massoud was assassinated just before the 9/11 attacks because bin Laden feared Massoud.
After the Soviet army left Afghanistan, various Afghan resistance leaders cobbled together a coalition government to run the country.
But a civil war soon erupted as various factions fought for control of the country.
Marcela Grad, author of the book "Massoud," says he was the only Afghan resistance leader who never left the country to live abroad.
"If Massoud and the Afghans were not being a front against intolerance in that part of the world, we would have had al Qaeda everywhere -- it would have been much worse," Grad says.
"A lot of people who knew him felt that he was the best hope for that part of the world," says Junger.
"I want to follow in my father's footsteps," Ahmad said.
