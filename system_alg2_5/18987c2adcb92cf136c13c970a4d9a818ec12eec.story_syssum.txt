Larson produced many popular and cult favorite shows in the late 1970s and 1980s, including "Magnum, P.I.," "Knight Rider" (with its talking car), "Battlestar Galactica" (with its space-age hero Starbuck), "The Fall Guy," "Quincy, M.E."
Larson was also responsible for one of the best-known short-lived series, "Manimal," which was heavily promoted by NBC in 1983 but only lasted eight episodes.
Among them was Ronald D. Moore, who rebooted "Battlestar": "Goodbye Glen Larson and thank you for creating one of the shows from my childhood that changed my life.
Without him there'd be no KITT & Michael."
