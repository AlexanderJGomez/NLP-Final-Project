New York (CNN) -- A heroin processing location holding $8 million worth of the drug was busted in New York, along with drug paraphernalia stamped with brands such as "NFL" and "government shutdown," authorities said Friday.
They seized the heroin and drug paraphernalia, including 18 coffee grinders, rubber bands, baking soda, face masks, and "hundreds of thousands of individual 'glassine' bags stamped with numerous "brand names" including 'NFL,' 'Government Shutdown,' 'iPhone,' and 'Olympics 2012,'" the statement said.
