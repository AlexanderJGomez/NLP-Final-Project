(CNN) -- A self-professed Apple fanatic, Jonathan Zufi was looking for a book of photography profiling the company's products through the years.
"
Instead, he said he approached each shot by looking for an image that would "create that same emotional connection to that product, but maybe doesn't look like something you've seen before."
Zufi, who began sharing his images on the website Shrine of Apple, said he hasn't had any official communications with Apple about the book.
"Within these pages, Jonathan presents a thoughtful and artistic gift to Apple fans and employees alike; photographs of Apple products -- from hardware to packaging -- the likes of which I've never seen compiled before," he writes.
"Jonathan's passion for this project is reflected on every page, and each honors the hard work of every employee and collaborator that has passed through Apple's doors."
