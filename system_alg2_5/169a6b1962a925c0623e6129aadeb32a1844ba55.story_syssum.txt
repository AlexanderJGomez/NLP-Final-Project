Iniesta had only just returned to Josep Guardiola's team last week as a substitute for the second leg of the Champions League quarterfinal against Arsenal, and then also came on in the 2-0 win at Real Madrid, but has suffered another injury blow in training after tearing a calf muscle.
Valladolid remained second from bottom despite giving former Spain coach Javier Clemente victory in his first home match.
Clemente has earned four points from two games since taking over as Diego Costa headed the opening goal four minutes before halftime and fellow striker Manucho scored the second eight minutes after the break.
Tenerife stayed in the third relegation place, one point above Valladolid, despite registering a first away win this season, 2-0 at mid-table Sporting Gijon.
