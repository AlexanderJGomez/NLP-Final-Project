After months of dramatic testimony full of so many twists and turns that people lined up for seats in the Phoenix courtroom, jurors began deliberations Tuesday to decide whether Arias should get the death penalty or life in prison for murdering her ex-boyfriend.
Arias pleaded for her life to be spared, telling jurors Tuesday that she could teach people to read in prison and make a positive impact on inmates.
And she showed the jurors several pieces of her artwork.
Explaining her decision not to request the death penalty, Arias said Tuesday that her family -- to whom she pointed in the courtroom -- gave her the strength to continue living.
We're talking about whether or not to kill.
"It matters that she hadn't done anything wrong in her life befo re that."
He argued that jurors should sentence Arias to death.
The penalty phase of the trial took a sudden break Monday, when the judge said that proceedings could not continue and that Arias would make the statement to the jury.
Arias, who testified for 18 days during the trial, was not cross-examined after her Tuesday statement, which Stephens said was not under oath.
