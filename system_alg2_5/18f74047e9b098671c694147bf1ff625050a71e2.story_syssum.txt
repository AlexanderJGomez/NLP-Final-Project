The ruling GPC party said the president will be received by celebrations, but anti-government demonstrators throughout the country likely would not welcome his return.
Saleh will return strong and the will of the people will stand against any other will," he said.
Opposition leaders called news of Saleh's return false rumors.
In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said at the briefing Tuesday that she was not aware of reports that Saleh planned to return to Yemen Friday.
