(CNN)  -- E. Lynn Harris, the author who introduced millions of readers to the "invisible life" of black gay men, was a literary pioneer whose generosity was as huge as his courage, friends said Friday.
His books became staples in black beauty salons, bookstores and book clubs.
"It was hard to go on a subway in places in New York or D.C. and not see some black woman reading an E. Lynn Harris novel," Boykin said.
Tina McElroy Ansa, author of "Taking After Mudear," met Harris at the beginning of his literary career when he was selling his first book "Invisible Life."
"It was playful, loving, and it wasn't hidden."
''When I wrote "Invisible Life," it had to be the first book out of me -- it helped me to deal with my own sexuality,'' Harris said.
"You could get trampled at an E. Lynn Harris reading," Ansa said.
He was born in Flint, Michigan, and grew up in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Boykin said Harris received most of his criticism not from outraged straight critics, but people within the black community.
"He was hurt by some of the criticism from some black gay men who felt he wasn't portraying them accurately and others who thought he was telling too much," Boykin said.
Harris took a little of that pain away with his life and his books.
