Three British security guards board a helicopter to be transferred to a Royal Navy vessel.
Pirates continued to shoot at the three in the water, Davis said.
The vessel is believed to be on its way to an anchorage in Puntland, northeastern Somalia, Davis said.
So far this year, pirates have attacked almost 100 vessels off the coast of Somalia coast and successfully hijacked nearly 40, according to the International Maritime Bureau's Piracy Reporting Center.
In an interview provided to CNN this week, a pirate leader claimed attacks on shipping would continue as long as life in Somalia remained desperate.
The interview was conducted in August by journalists working for the Somali news organization, Garowe.
