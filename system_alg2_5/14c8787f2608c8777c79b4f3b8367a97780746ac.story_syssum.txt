The allegations stem from passages in Dunham's collection of personal essays, "Not That Kind of Girl," in which she describes sexually experimenting with her younger sister as a child.
Dunham, creator and star of the popular HBO show "Girls," said she was "dismayed" over the interpretation of events described in her book.
Dunham then apologized on Twitter for canceling book tour appearances scheduled for this week in Berlin and Antwerp, Belgium.
