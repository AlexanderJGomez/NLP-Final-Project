But in recent years, the fishing industry has come under severe threat as a result of the ongoing risk posed by Somali pirates roaming the waters off the Horn of Africa.
"It's a big problem," explains major Jean Attala, deputy operations officer of the Seychelles coast guard.
It's a small nation in terms of landmass, but with its oceans, it is nearly twice the size of France.
"There's no fish," explains local fisherman Patrick Pierre.
He says fish intake has fallen nearly 25% in the last five years.
Since 2006, the year the World Bank report takes as the starting point of piracy, exports of fish products from piracy-hit countries have declined by 23.8%.
"Five years ago, there was a lot of fish," says Pierre.
"We could go anywhere we wanted without the fear of piracy and everything."
