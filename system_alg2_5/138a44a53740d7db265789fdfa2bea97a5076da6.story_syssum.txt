On April 26, 1986, the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant's reactor No.
With 200 tons of lava-like radioactive material still below the reactor, and the  "New Safe Confinement" aimed at containing and protecting it not scheduled for completion till 2015 (already 15 years overdue) this story of nuclear disaster is in its early chapters.
These days, Ukraine's four other nuclear power plants also dispose of their spent fuel inside the Zone.
That story is partly embodied in an unlikely community of some 130 people, called "self-settlers" who, today, live inside the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.
Many villages were bulldozed after the accident, others remain -- silent vestiges to the tragedy, and home to the ubiquitous wild boar.
One self-settler, Hanna Zavorotnya, told me how she snuck through the bushes back to her village in the summer of 1986.
When I asked Hanna about radiation, she replied: "Radiation doesn't scare me.
When the Chernobyl accident happened a few decades into Soviet rule, they were simply unwilling to flee an enemy that was invisible.
"So what."
The World Health Organization predicts more than 4,000 deaths will eventually be linked to Chernobyl.
Of the old people who relocated, one Chernobyl medical technician, whose job is to give annual radiation exposure tests to zone workers  said: "Quite simply, they die of anguish."
How could this be?
Is the power of motherland, so fundamental to that part of the world, palliative?
Radiation or not, these women are at the end of their lives.
