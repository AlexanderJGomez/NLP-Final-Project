The 26-year-old will face European Ryder Cup teammate Luke Donald in Sunday's final at Dove Mountain's Ritz-Carlton course after the Englishman made light work of his matches against Americans Ryan Moore and Matt Kuchar.
"I was not thinking about the number one spot as I was sure I would get the opportunity again over the next few weeks, I just wanted to win the match.
Kaymer was pegged back three times by Watson -- who earlier beat compatriot J.B. Holmes at the first extra hole of their quarterfinal -- but won 15 and 16 before the left-hander birdied 17.
Donald then thrashed U.S. Ryder Cup player and 2010 PGA Tour money list champion Kuchar 6 & 5 in the first semifinal to be completed.
Yang, who beat U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell on Friday, was never ahead in the match and trailed by four holes after the eighth, then Kuchar matched his four consecutive pars to 17.
