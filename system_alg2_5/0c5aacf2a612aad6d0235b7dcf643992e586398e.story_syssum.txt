London (CNN) -- Global media tycoon Rupert Murdoch is "not a fit person" to run a major international company, British lawmakers investigating phone hacking at his tabloid News of the World reported Tuesday.
"Hard truths have emerged from the Select Committee Report: that there was serious wrongdoing at the News of the World; that our response to the wrongdoing was too slow and too defensive; and that some of our employees misled the Select Committee in 2009," it said in a statement.
Testifying last week before the Leveson Inquiry, Rupert Murdoch admitted that there had been a "cover-up" of phone hacking at News of the World, which ceased publication last July.
But Louise Mensch, a Conservative member of Parliament who is on the committee with Whittingdale and Watson, said the report had gone too far.
Committee chairman Whittingdale, a Conservative, did not vote.
The report did not accuse either Murdoch of misleading Parliament, but said three of their underlings had done so in testimony to the committee.
Mensch noted that Myler, the editor of the New York Daily News, "has misled a select committee of Parliament.
"It is effectively lying to Parliament," Whittingdale said.
Shares in News Corp., which is traded in New York, closed Tuesday up 2.64%.
He said he was "surprised" by the extent of the contact by the employee, Fred Michel, with the British government as it considered a bid by News Corp. to take full ownership of British Sky Broadcasting.
The scandal has also forced News Corp. to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds in compensation to the victims of phone hacking.
