Last year Garris reported a bumper crop of acorns, which scientists say may be one clue to this year's scarcity.
Virginia extension agent Adam Downing said acorn production runs in cycles, so a lean year is normal after a year with a big crop.

She suggested that residents leave whole (not crushed) corn, peanuts and sunflowers in the seed as backyard treats.
