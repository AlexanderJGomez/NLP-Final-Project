That's why March 14 -- 3-14 -- is Pi Day.
Even that many digits are more than most people would need for everyday use, but some folks have been inspired to memorize thousands of digits of pi, or even use the digits to create poetry or music.
Math may be scary, but pi is not -- as evidenced by the widespread revelry on Pi Day.
You could celebrate Pi Day in a casual way by grabbing a slice of pastry, or pizza.
Pi Day began as a small gathering with mostly museum staff.
The parade ends at the "pi shrine" -- a pi symbol with digits spiraling around it embedded in the sidewalk, which was unveiled last year.
The "brainiac town" residents "love this event because it's a way for them to celebrate how quirky they are," said Mimi Omiecinski, owner of the Princeton Tour Company, who started Princeton Pi Day in 2009.
Along with her fascination with Albert Einstein, Omiecinski was inspired to launch a town-wide Pi Day after she heard that the Princeton University mathematics department celebrates March 14 with pie-eating and pi-reciting (As a Princeton student, I got second place for most digits in 2005 and 2006).
The Museum of Science in Boston has educational Pi Day events, and the Seattle Children's Museum will celebrate too.
David Blatner, author of the comprehensive book "The Joy of Pi," is hosting a Pi Day competition in which students from three classrooms will square off to see who can recite the most digits of pi from memory.
