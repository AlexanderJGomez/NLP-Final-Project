Partial totals of what was spent so far show that between the candidate, his party and well-heeled outside groups, the "Red Team" spent more money on the effort to elect Republican Mitt Romney than the "Blue Team" did to re-elect President Barack Obama, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that monitors the influence of money on politics.
The liberal version of that combination of groups spent about $96 million less on the Obama re-election.
No matter who spent more, Allison worries that the amount of money involved in this election will dramatically change politics.
The Center for Responsive Politics estimates that outside groups spent some $1.3 billion and counting on the election.
One Senate race that saw record amounts of outside money was in Wisconsin.
After winning a bruising Republican primary, Thompson was seen as an early favorite -- partly because Wisconsin has recently leaned much more 'red.'
Thompson raised $7.36 million and spent $6.04 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
The groups spent $15.5 million against Baldwin, $1.2 million for her.
Mourdock ran a strong race, but took a hit in the polls when, at a debate, he made a controversial remark about rape and abortion.
Baldwin will become the first female Senator to represent Wisconsin and the nation's first openly gay person to win a Senate seat.
It looks like the money she spent on the race may have made a difference, too.
