Suzan Lakhan Baptiste's efforts have turned a beach from a leatherback turtle graveyard to a nesting colony.
It hasn't been an easy fight for Baptiste or the turtles.
"Turtles are in serious trouble," Baptiste said.
"Leatherbacks [are] very vulnerable," Baptiste said.
For years, Baptiste and her group patrolled the beaches every night of turtle nesting season.
"I wanted to show that a turtle is [worth] so much more to us alive than dead," Baptiste said.
"Here, turtle slaughter is a thing of the past," Baptiste proclaimed.

"When I got started, a lot of people thought I was crazy," Baptiste said, and she admits that she sometimes wondered if they were right.
