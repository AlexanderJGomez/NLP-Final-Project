The Mississippi River at St. Louis was 10.1 feet above flood stage Monday night, according to the U.S. Geological Survey website.
As authorities dealt with rising water in Missouri and Illinois, officials in Oklahoma wrapped up another day of looking for people who remained missing after last week's tornadoes and heavy rain.
At least 18 people died in the storm, authorities said Monday.
In eastern Oklahoma County, a 65-year-old man on his way to work was killed early Saturday when he drove off a washed out bridge and drowned in a creek.
No one was killed in that tornado, but three people drowned in Missouri, Nixon said.
But it was Oklahoma City and its surrounding areas that sustained most of the damage.
Though Friday's tornadoes were not as strong as the EF-5 twister that killed 24 people on May 20, fear drove some people to flee in cars, ignoring warnings not to drive.
"We saw flooding in areas that we don't see flooding," said police Lt. Jay Barnett.
