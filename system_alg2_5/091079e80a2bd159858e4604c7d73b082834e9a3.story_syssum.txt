While other kids his age spent their Saturday shopping at the mall or tossing around a football, Tolbert traveled from Shippensburg, Pennsylvania, to Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington dressed in a navy blue Civil War reenactment uniform and armed with a brass bugle.
Taps, traditionally played at military funerals and also known as "Butterfield's Lullaby" or "Day is Done," were born during the Civil War along the James River.
Others, like Tolbert, chose them for their significance.
"I don't think I want to be in the military one day, so the best I can do to serve our country is to honor those who are," Tolbert said.
Allison Cummings, a patrol officer from Hudson, New Hampshire, usually plays taps at law enforcement funerals and ceremonies in her home state, but said playing in Arlington was a unique experience.
"[Bugling is] just that final honor to someone who's served their country, and it's just such an honor to play that for them," Cummings said as she stood opposite the grave she was about to serenade, fingering a commemorative gold coin she would lay to rest on the white marble headstone after her performance.
