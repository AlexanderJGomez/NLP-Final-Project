(CNN) -- Waking up Tuesday to the news that my good friend and former team mate Phil Hughes was in a critical state in hospital after a blow to the head in a state cricket match made me instantly realize how fragile life can be.
Phil was the new young gun in Aussie cricket who had burst onto the scene.
We made an odd couple.
My thoughts tracked back to the life of Ayrton Senna, arguably the most naturally gifted racing driver of all-time.
Cricket is essentially a team sport but the life of a top order batsmen can be isolated and lonely.
Just you and your thoughts.
Being a batsmen is lonely, it takes drive and a courage to face your emotions and your fears.
I've always prided myself on the way I play short pitch stuff but that day the angle of delivery, coupled with some foggy processing, did for me.
So seeing Phil fall flat on his face like that was spine chilling.
Maybe even hit the next short ball for six.
Our thoughts are with Phil and his family.
