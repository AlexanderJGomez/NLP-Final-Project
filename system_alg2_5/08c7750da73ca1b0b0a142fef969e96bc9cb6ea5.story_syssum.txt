(CNN) -- You can't escape tango in Buenos Aires.
The men would practice together to perfect their dance -- and hopefully impress the women.
Boys would sneak out to the dance halls to see the older men (brothers and fathers) dancing.
Tango is a dance that stresses elegant walking and close attention to the music.
There are classy dinner shows that feature full stage productions for tourists, and then there are intimate tango venues that provide more authentic shows for enthusiasts and local patrons.
A number of "milongas" (dance halls dedicated to tango) offer late night shows with either live music and/or authentic exhibition dancing.
The most traditional milongas place men on one side of the room and women on the other.
However, a good teacher can get you on the dance floor, walking simply and in time to the music, within a few lessons.
Some milongas also provide lessons right before the official dance begins.
