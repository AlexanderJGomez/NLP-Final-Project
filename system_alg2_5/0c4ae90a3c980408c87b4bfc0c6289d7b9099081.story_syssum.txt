Experts on the region said Tuesday Abdullah's decision was aimed at warding off larger-scale demonstrations in the wake of the huge protests in Tunisia and Egypt.
There was a series of protests in Arab nations in the 1950s, but those were prompted by an ideology of Pan-Arabism in a post-colonial world, said Emile Hokayem, with the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
It's very different," said Hokayem.
Economic concerns have fueled the protests across the region.
When the Tunisia protests proved successful at first, many analysts still doubted a "domino theory" would play out through the Middle East, said Hokayem, because each nation has a different structure, population, and set of challenges.
In Gulf state monarchies, such as Jordan and Saudi Arabia, uprisings that threaten the government are "less likely," said Hounshell.
"If Saudi Arabia starts to see popular protests," said Hounshell, "then you're really going to see people in Washington freak out."
In Jordan, whether the king will regain support from protesters by dismissing his government is "a million dollar question," said Hounshell.
