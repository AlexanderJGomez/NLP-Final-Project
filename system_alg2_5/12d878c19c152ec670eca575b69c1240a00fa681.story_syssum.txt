Of the six universities where I have worked, the University of Virginia stands out among them for not only the frequency of rape allegations but also for the unresponsiveness of administrators.
Its most recent action is to suspend all fraternities through Jan. 9, some 45 days or so.
One week.
I also sat through sexual assault board hearings where clear cut cases of rape occurred and supported survivors when they found out that the perpetrator was found "not responsible."
And in fact, the Office of Civil Rights for the U.S. Department of Education ordered universities in 2011 to stop mediating rape cases.
Let's remember that while recent news makes the University of Virginia seems more egregious than most institutions, a lot of students there are making a big difference -- men in the One in Four chapter and women in the One Less organization.
We also need to remember that ultimately, we don't do a lot of good focusing on just one university.
