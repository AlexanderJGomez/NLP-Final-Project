The official says the virus infected the classified military computer systems that control the drones, but it has not "stopped the drones from flying worldwide."
They're not sure if it's a deliberate attack.
Schactman says the military has had a hard time wiping out the virus.
Lynn says even the National Defense University has been breached, and in a single intrusion this year 24,000 files were taken from a defense company.
Perhaps most alarming, Lynn admitted that up till now, the US military had not been able to secure its systems.
Officials have not determined whether the virus introduced into the drone program is benign, or doing actual harm.
He says the true danger of this virus comes not from an ability to "bring down a drone," which is unlikely.
There will eventually be a marriage of capability and intent, where those who mean us harm will gain the ability to launch damaging cyber attacks.
