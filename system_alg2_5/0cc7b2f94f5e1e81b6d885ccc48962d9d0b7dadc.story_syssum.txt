HOLLYWOOD, California (CNN) -- Director Antoine Fuqua, the force behind films such as "Training Day" and "Shooter," turned his focus to creating CNN's exclusive short film "From MLK to Today," which airs at 7 p.m.
Antoine Fuqua: Because it's Martin Luther King, and because it's Barack Obama's story.
So why wouldn't I be here?
Not in an angry or negative way -- just to know where we come from, so we get a better sense of where we're going, and how to get there, and what not to do.
I don't think you can ever forget Martin Luther King and many other people who sacrificed, whose names we don't even know.
I didn't really know what it meant.
Fuqua: I remember a lot of racism.
Fuqua: Not really.
CNN: Did you think there were certain things you couldn't accomplish because you were black?
I remember thinking, "Well, if it's just a matter of money to leave my neighborhood, then I have to make money."
It reminded me of my world -- in the sense of being a young kid on the streets, growing up, seeing a lot of provocative images that I was probably too young to see -- and I would express them, and I would do little illustrations or I would paint on a wall.
CNN: And now you're telling the story of Martin Luther King and Barack Obama.
You know, you need to have a white movie star in it."
So if Hollywood's not ready to embrace more stories about African-Americans -- and that's based on the money that the movies make -- then would the country really be ready to embrace a president?
He's like a movie star.
CNN: In the short film you're directing for us, you've drawn the parallel between Obama and Martin Luther King.
I think Barack Obama is the "dream."
But more than anything, I would love people to walk away feeling like we've just begun.
