ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Dressed head to toe in black, designer Isaac Mizrahi is wearing an outfit that seems to contradict his personality -- and his usual fashion flair.
It's just one more style tip you can pick up from Mizrahi's new book "How to Have Style" (Gotham).
CNN talked to Mizrahi about his love for theater, the most common fashion mistakes and why bad flowers are never OK.
And I think that these days, as a fashion designer, it's almost like you represent a political party or something.

CNN: What's your daily schedule like?
Mizrahi: It changes every day, and I really like that.
I feel like it really disrupts what I love doing most, which is this creation, you know what I mean?
I would say that's the most common style error I see is bad hair.
You know people have excuses for bad shoes -- because you know some people have back problems, it is the street and they're walking and walking and walking -- but I do think that people have no excuse for bad hair.
You'd think I had a chain of hair salons, but I don't.
Mizrahi: You know what it is with people?
No.
Like at a dinner party, I prefer no flowers usually to the flowers that people have on the table.
Mizrahi: I don't know.
Here's a good description of my personality: claustrophobic.
I am very claustrophobic.
