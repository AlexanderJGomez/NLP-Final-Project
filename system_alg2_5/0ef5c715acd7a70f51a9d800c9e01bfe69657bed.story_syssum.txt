Rahman's message to customers reports the following:
We're also fixing an issue with syncing related to the band hardware.
You can also set the band to give you "Activity Reminders" -- gentle vibrations on your wrist that compel you to get out of your seat and take a few steps.
Consumers experiencing hardware problems can also continue to receive replacement bands through Jawbone's existing warranty program.
In fact, someone can collect a full refund, as well as receive a replacement band as long as the band qualifies under warranty.
