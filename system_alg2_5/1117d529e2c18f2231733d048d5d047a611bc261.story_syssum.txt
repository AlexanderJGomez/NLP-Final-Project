Washington (CNN) -- Memorial crosses erected along Utah public roads to honor fallen state highway troopers have been found unconstitutional by a federal appeals court.
Although the suit went against the memorial project, the crosses were allowed to remain pending appeals in the case.
Other similar memorial crosses have been erected on public land such as Arlington National Cemetery to honor fallen war dead.
At the same time, government-sponsored school prayer is banned, and limits imposed on aid to parochial schools.
The justices last year decided on free-speech grounds a small religious group could not erect a granite monument in a Utah park next to an existing Ten Commandments display, which for the time being was allowed to stay.
The judges also disregarded suggestions that since most of the deceased troopers were Mormon, where the Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints does not uses the cross as a religious symbol, the highway memorials were merely symbols of death and did not promote a a particular faith.
The case is American Atheists v. Duncan (08-4061).
