Lawyers for McDonnell and his wife met with prosecutors in the city of Alexandria on Monday as the Justice Department sought clarity over previously undisclosed gifts given to the governor and his family by the chief executive of a troubled dietary supplement company.
It has been a stunning turn of events for McDonnell, a well mannered former star in Republican politics who rose from state legislator to Virginia attorney general to governor.
He was mentioned as a possible running mate for Mitt Romney.
Maureen McDonnell also bought stock in the company and promoted its products at a luncheon at the governor's mansion in Richmond.
He and his allies have cautiously defended the lack of disclosure as consistent with Virginia law, which does not require elected officials to report gifts provided to family members like McDonnell's wife and daughter.
Andrew McBride, a former U.S. attorney in Alexandria, told CNN this would be a very difficult case for prosecutors without clear evidence of a quid pro quo.
An ethics investigation of Cuccinelli's relationship with Williams cleared the attorney general of any wrongdoing but revealed that Cuccinelli put the executive in touch with an attorney who could help him win grants from a state agency.
