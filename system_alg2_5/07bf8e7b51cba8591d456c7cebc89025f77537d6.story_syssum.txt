But when the special guest finally materialized on the main stage, it wasn't Daft Punk, it was R. Kelly.
Kelly wasn't the only R&B artist to make a cameo at Coachella on Saturday.
Moby made his first appearance at Coachella since 1999, the festival's debut year.
Even though he's branched out as a musician in recent years, he returned to his DJ roots, playing the dance tent accompanied by visuals of outer space -- courtesy of his friends at NASA.
To close the festival Sunday night, the Red Hot Chili Peppers returned for their third time headlining Coachella.
