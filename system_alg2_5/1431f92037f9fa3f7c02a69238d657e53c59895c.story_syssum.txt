Microsoft and Sony, which makes the PlayStation, are working to bolster their Internet-video offerings before new challengers can usurp the home-entertainment market that they've been cultivating for many years with their systems.
People who subscribe to PlayStation Plus will be able to download a preview, and starting on October 11, all owners of the game console will be able to download the application from the home screen in the same way they can get Netflix.
Music Unlimited and Video Unlimited will live under the Sony Entertainment Network umbrella, and they may eventually be joined by the PlayStation Network, Aragon said.
Music Unlimited and the PlayStation Network Store will be redesigned later, Aragon said.
The Sony tablet, which is set to debut early next month, will have a version of Video Unlimited, and the iPhone app will eventually include the ability to watch videos offline, he said.
Microsoft, like Sony, feels the heat and continues to push the Xbox beyond gaming.
Microsoft plans to launch new video-on-demand and live TV services for Xbox in partnership with dozens of media companies, he said.
"Certainly we all know the frustrations of using guides and menus and controllers, and we think a better way to do all of this is simply to bring Bing and voice to Xbox," Ballmer said last month.
Sony favors a la carte over "the Netflix model," Aragon said, because it can offer new films close to when they are released on Blu-ray.
Microsoft and Sony would like to sell the media, not just the hardware that plays them.
But if their gaming consoles were truly home-entertainment Trojan horses, the clock is ticking for them to spring their surprise.
