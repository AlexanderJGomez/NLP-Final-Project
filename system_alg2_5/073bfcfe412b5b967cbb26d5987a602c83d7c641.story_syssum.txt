Los Angeles (CNN) -- A 24-year-old man was charged Monday with arson in connection with a rash of car and building fires across the Los Angeles area, authorities said.
Burkhart is believed to a foreign national from Germany, according to Los Angeles Police Department Chief Charlie Beck.
The van matched the description of a vehicle believed related to some of the suspicious fires and the driver resembled a man seen in a surveillance video near the scene of one fire, he said.
Cars were set on fire in Hollywood and Van Nuys, Moore said.
