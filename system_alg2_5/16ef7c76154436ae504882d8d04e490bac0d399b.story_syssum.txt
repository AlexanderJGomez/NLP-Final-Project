(CNN) -- In his September 4 op-ed, Jack Schlossberg presents his case that young Americans should cast their ballots for President Obama this fall.
Or, according to this analysis, that half of recent college graduates are jobless or underemployed Or that under Obama, the national debt has risen $5 trillion.
Or that Obama presided over the first credit downgrade in American history.
But the problem with that analysis is that it's four years out of date.
In 2008, Obama regaled us with promises of hope and change, but his time in office has exposed the emptiness of these promises.
Schlossberg's discussion of Obama's energy policy is equally selective.
But in this case, it's about coming to terms with the fact that Obama has had his chance to lead and his policies have failed.
We can reward truth-telling.
