(CNN)  -- Actor Wendell Pierce's biggest role today is running the Pontchartrain Park Community Development Corp., which is hard at work trying to rebuild the New Orleans neighborhood devastated by Hurricane Katrina.
Two hundred acres were given over to a golf course, with 1,000 homes around it, multidenominational churches, a university and schools.

I put out a call to action to people in my generation.
PIERCE: It's going great.
We have the properties, the homes; we have people qualified with the bank, and we are still trying to access the money.
That's because the state is hostile to the city and is trying to reappropriate the money to other parts of the state and not to the city of New Orleans.
Three billion dollars has been appropriated [to rebuild after Katrina] and hasn't been spent in five years and that's because there's an agenda supported by many that don't want people to move back.
Because it's a concerted effort to reappropriate the money and keep the poor and black people out.
We plan to do 550 [homes in the Park]; compare that with the fact there are 30,000 to 50,000 blighted properties here.
PIERCE: We have everyone imaginable; we have elderly, we have young couples trying to get in, we have 80-year-olds trying to get back into their properties.
CNN: The government's not rebuilding New Orleans.
What surprised me the most [when I began this] was the lack of skill and competence on the government's part to know how to put this together, and how strong the effort to stop people from moving back to New Orleans is.
PIERCE: It's no good to build one or two houses in a city that has 50,000 blighted properties.
CNN: You play a jazz musician in "Treme" and do lots of numbers.
PIERCE: Yes, I do play the trombone, but I play very poorly, so they turn my mic off, and my sound double plays.
