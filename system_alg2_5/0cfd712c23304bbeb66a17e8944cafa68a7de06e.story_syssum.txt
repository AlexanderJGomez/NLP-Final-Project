Then she poses for him naked, and things start looking up for ol' Jack.
Almost 20 years later, that stupid "French girls" line has become a bit of a catchphrase, and if you Google it you'll find countless images of people unintentionally, yet seductively, sprawled out like Kate Winslet.
But then, last week, it had a massive uptick in popularity when, for several hours, a collection of French Girls images somehow managed to climb to the very top of the front page of Reddit.
Now, the basic idea of French Girls is that users anonymously post selfies and then other users draw them from within the app.
When I first learned of French Girls and downloaded it, I immediately served up a selfie and eagerly awaited someone turning me into art.
So, I added another selfie - one where it looks like I'm grasping at the air -- and somebody actually did turn me into a nude.
Because of course it was.)
Because here's how the app works: When you want to start drawing, you are given a choice of nine different images.
So, I drew her.
Anyway, despite a severe lack of artistic ability, drawing my blue girl was a creative way to kill some time when I could've dangerously been interacting with other actual humans.
