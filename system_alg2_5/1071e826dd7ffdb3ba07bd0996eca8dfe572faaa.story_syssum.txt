Phnom Penh, Cambodia (CNN) -- The opposition party in Cambodia has rejected the results of the country's national election, which handed another win to long-serving Prime Minister Hun Sen.
More than 9 million people were eligible to vote.
The national election committee said it worked hard to ensure the election was far.
"In preparing for the election this year, we started in the middle of 2012," said Tep Nytha, the secretary general of the committee, ahead of the balloting.
