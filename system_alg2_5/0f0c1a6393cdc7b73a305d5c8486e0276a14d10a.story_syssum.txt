Boardwine's friend, Joyce Bruce, had used his sperm and a turkey baster to get pregnant.
"The plain meaning of the term 'medical technology' does not encompass a kitchen implement such as a turkey baster," the appeals court wrote in its decision.
They tried the turkey baster method a few times.
She and Boardwine tried a few more times, and in July, she learned she was going to have a baby.
The baby was born, and Boardwine says he learned about the baby's arrival from someone else.
Bruce argued that she used "noncoital reproductive technology" to get pregnant, and Boardwine was technically a sperm donor.
The appeals court affirmed the lower court's ruling, saying the turkey baster doesn't constitute reproductive technology.
