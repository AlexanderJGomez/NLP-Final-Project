How do you stand out as loyal to the people you are leading?
And what feels hard now -- doing the stuff you don't feel like -- makes everything easier in the long-term.
Self discipline doesn't have to be hard -- you just have to change the way you think about it.
The next time you feel yourself putting something off because you're afraid -- of uncertainty or failure -- just "do it scared."
We've all faced these moments in our careers -- when you know what has to be done, but your fear holds you back.
It's fine to be scared -- do it scared.
And by just doing something, you create movement and momentum that will lead to progress and results.
The best way to overcome this impulse is to put your self esteem into stellar work habits instead of results.
The difference between those who stand out in the careers and those who blend in lies in what you do when you reach these critical turning points.
Stop fixating on the here and now, and think about the big picture.
Having this perspective and faith will help you press forward at the moments when others turn back.
It's not about enjoying self discipline -- it's about adopting a few new ways of thinking that simply make discipline easier to endure.
