Rick Perry's decision to send up to 1,000 National Guard troops to the southern border is the latest move in a controversy over the influx of migrant youths from Central America, many unaccompanied, streaming into the United States.
Perry said those troops are needed to "combat" crime because the border patrol is busy dealing with the flow of immigrant kids crossing the border from Mexico.
So what will the border patrol do?
What won't they do?
How much will it cost and who will pay for it?
Aguilar said one thing that will help relieve the workload of border patrol agents is to relieve CBP from being the sole government agency to process and care for the unaccompanied youth in the immediate aftermath of their detention.
Perry is asking the federal government to hire and train an additional 3,000 border patrol agents to replace the National Guard.
Perry has some reconciling to do within a Republican Party that has used the current border crisis to move to the right on the issue.
Has the National Guard been sent to the border before?
About 1 million people have been caught crossing the border nearly every year between 1983 until 2006, but that number has dropped to about 400,000 in 2013.
And the amount spent on border security has more than doubled.
