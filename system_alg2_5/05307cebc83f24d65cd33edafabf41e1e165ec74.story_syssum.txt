Suraya Pakzad tells CNN any deal between the U.S. and Taliban moderates should consider women's concerns.
But Pakzad wants U.S. lawmakers to put women's rights at the forefront of any deal with Taliban moderates.
"It makes me scared and everybody has the fear that one day [the Taliban] will be back again," Pakzad said.
But even now, women are still targets of domestic violence, and Afghan girls have been attacked for attending school.
Pakzad expresses hope that Clinton and other members of the Obama administration will raise those concerns when moving forward with any policy of negotiating with the Taliban.
She said she hopes that one day, Afghan women will secure the same rights that American women have achieved.
