Simon Schaefer is the founder of Factory, a 16,000-square-meter co-working space in Berlin designed to cultivate entrepreneurship.
The big and important difference between other work spaces and us is that we're stage agnostic so we have later-stage companies or established companies like Mozilla, local heroes like Soundcloud or Wunderkinder, which are role models for younger founders to look up to.
SS: I think what you should do is look at the individual stages of development of the company.
I think it's always important to have that visually in front of you, to be aware of what it really means to be a small, flexible team.
There's a lot of interesting momentum in Berlin and we're trying to capture that in one place.
