The just-released "Amazing Spider-Man" #700 marks the end of one of the most popular comic book series of all time after 50 years.
When issue #700 was leaked early, fan reaction -- both positive and negative -- went into overdrive, with a few death threats directed at the issue's writer, Dan Slott.
CNN spoke separately to Slott and to Marvel editor Stephen Wacker about the controversial comic.
If Peter had never learned the lesson of "great power and great responsibility," there's every chance he would have become a supervillain.
So what if we flipped it?
It wasn't originally going to be in the 700th issue, but as the story grew, we realized maybe it was time to change up the makeup of Spider-Man for good, to make a permanent change.
Wacker: The fan reaction never really surprises me.
You find people of all stripes reacting -- people who have been reading it for 50 years and love it, and others who say they're quitting Marvel forever.
No one has a middling review.
I got an angry tweet saying, "I don't like seeing bad things happen to good people."
Slott: We have the most passionate fans in the world!
In the world of comics, thanks to (newspaper publisher) J. Jonah Jameson, everyone thinks he's a menace.
And going from everything I've seen on social media, I am so up for that challenge!
