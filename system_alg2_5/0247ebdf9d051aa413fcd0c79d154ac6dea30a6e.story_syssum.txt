It is said that Arab youth have faced tough challenges since the Arab Spring.
But unemployment in Jordan and the Middle East did not take us by surprise during the Arab Spring.
High unemployment was present in the Middle East, and in almost every country around the world, for many years before the uprising.
Unemployment is a major issue in the Middle East and North Africa region, especially in Jordan.
Many of the world's young are uncertain of their future and their ability to find meaningful employment.

Three years ago, the Arab Spring signified hope.
I do not believe the Arab Spring caused a "disrupted society."
