Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Thousands packed Havana's Revolution Square on Saturday for International Workers' Day, drawing hordes of Cuban demonstrators, spectators, and trade unionists from around the world -- including the United States and the United Kingdom.
Since then, neither Castro has made a major speech on May Day.
The women on occasion are detained briefly by police before being driven back to their homes.
Saturday marked the second International Workers' Day since U.S. President Obama took office.
