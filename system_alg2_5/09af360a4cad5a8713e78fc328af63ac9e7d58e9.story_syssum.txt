"I want them to know that these things do happen, but that doesn't mean that we have to be defined by it for the rest of your life.
"He said 'I have a knife at your neck, don't make a sound, get up and come with me,'" Smart told Cooper.
"I kept looking, I kept waiting for something to happen, for some way for me to get away," she said.
I wanted them to know what had happened to me."
"I remember he just looked back at me and said, 'Oh, I'm not going to rape and kill you yet.'
I mean, if hugs could speak this hug would have said, 'You're mine, you will do exactly what I tell you to do.'"
I mean, not just once, multiple times a day."
I mean, just every time I thought it couldn't get worse, something always happened."

What was to say that he wouldn't kill my family?"
The second half of Smart's interview with Cooper, in which she reveals details of how she was rescued, will air on CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360" Tuesday night.
