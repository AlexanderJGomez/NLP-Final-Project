Many of Goldwater's supporters were determined to push their party toward the right wing of the political spectrum.
The right wing of the Republican Party in the early 1960s inhabited a world that included extremist organizations, such as the John Birch Society, that railed against communism.
Since Miller, a New York congressman, was known for his close ties to the right, Democrats could charge that Republicans had not balanced their ticket.
The ads played on statements by the candidates and extremist organizations.
Always nervous about being tagged by Republicans in a conservative era as too close to socialism, Democrats in Congress and in the White House since the 1960s have tended to distance themselves from fringe elements of the left.
Some ugly elements of the Tea Party movement, which have been held in check since the original Washington protest in September, have returned to the  political debate.
In the short-term, the Tea Party movement has helped to revitalize the Republican Party.
Local Tea Party organizers have also stepped forward with words of condemnation.
They must also avoid contradictory messages, such as the statement of House Minority Whip Eric Cantor, who accused Democrats of "fanning the flames" by using the incidents as a "political weapon."
Now Republicans are facing the Goldwater threat once again.
