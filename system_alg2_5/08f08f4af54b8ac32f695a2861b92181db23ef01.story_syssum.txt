Martin, such reactions to "The Red Wedding" are nothing new.
I've said in many interviews that I like my fiction to be unpredictable.
I killed Ned because everybody thinks he's the hero and that, sure, he's going to get into trouble, but then he'll somehow get out of it.
Since Song of Ice and Fire so often subverts reader expectations and avoids traditional fantasy storytelling structures, should fans have any real hope that this tale will have a happy ending?
It's two-thirds of the way through the book, but I skipped over it when I came to it.
EW: Why do you think it has such a powerful reaction?
Robb wasn't one of your "viewpoint characters" in the books and Catelyn wasn't really a beloved personality.
It's at a wedding feast.
There's also secondary characters killed.
There's also her murdering the hostage.
And she does.
It's going to be hard for me to watch it [on the show].
What can you say to someone who says they'll never read your book again?
And some of my former readers have said their life is hard, their mother is sick, their dog died, and they read fiction to escape.
And you read that certain kind of fiction where the guy will always get the girl and the good guys win and it reaffirms to you that life is fair.
I think the best fiction captures life in all its light and darkness.
It's like you're smacking the reader upside the head for being so dense â€” "Of course they're not going to follow that silly rule ALL the time!"
The Red Wedding is based on a couple real events from Scottish history.
The king of Scotland was fighting the Black Douglas clan.
They brought out a covered plate and put it in front of the Earl and revealed it was the head of a black boar â€” the symbol of death.
No matter how much I make up, there's stuff in history that's just as bad, or worse.
