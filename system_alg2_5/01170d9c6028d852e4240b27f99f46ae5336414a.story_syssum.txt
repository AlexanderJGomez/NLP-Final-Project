Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Perhaps no one better understands what the family of U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords is going through like the widow and children of Punjab Governor Salmaan Taseer.
Taseer had been an outspoken critic of Pakistan's blasphemy laws, which make it a crime to insult Islam or the Prophet Mohammad.
Sara Taseer says, "The difference is in Pakistan, this is not a message just to my father or my family.
She says Giffords' shooting was an isolated incident, which has no chance of gaining popular support in the United States.
"It's because they fear for their lives," says Taseer's son Shehryar.
Shehryar says that was the real tragedy of his father's shooting: it's forcing liberals to stay quiet and hide.
It makes me sick to my stomach," says Taseer's youngest daughter Shehrbano.
"There were over 200 lawyers who went and put garlands and rose petals around my father's assassin's neck.
"They have a sorry record of convictions.
Now his family is looking back at the life of Salmaan Taseer, a businessman and governor of one of the most-populated provinces in the world.
But on top of it all I say one thing: that he was a great father and even better husband."
His daughter Shehrbano says, "I hope his passing doesn't mean that the room for debate is over.
Taseers are fighters.
This country needed people like him.
