"Sometimes I think I'm going crazy."
Jenkins cannot shake the feeling that these and other symptoms he has add up to CTE, but he will never be sure.
The study, published Wednesday in the journal Neurology, suggests that when CTE symptoms emerge at a young age, players more often exhibit behavioral and mood problems, whereas symptoms that begin later in life tend to show up as memory and thinking problems.
Three players did not display any symptoms before being diagnosed with CTE.
Symptoms could also be explained by other changes in the brain, associated with repetitive brain trauma, that have nothing to do with tau or CTE.
Stern and his colleagues know that their study sample is skewed: People who tend to donate a loved one's brain to be studied for CTE also tend to suspect a problem.
In the meantime, former players like Jenkins are left in a fight against time and the progression of whatever brain disease their concussions may have wrought.
Both Jenkins and Stern hope that for CTE, it will not be that long.
