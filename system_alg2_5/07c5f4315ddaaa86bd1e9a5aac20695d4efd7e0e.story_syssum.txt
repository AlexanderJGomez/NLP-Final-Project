Kang, who was vice principal at Ansan's Danwon High School, was rescued from the sinking Sewol ferry.
There were no pallbearers carrying the coffin -- only a quick walking procession of his family members and what appeared to be about a hundred others dressed in black following the car through the parking lot.
He had gone to Jindo with the school in an effort to support families, said one fellow educator.
Police have confirmed the contents of a note, which Kang left behind.
He also wrote that he wonders whether he could still be their teacher on the other side, in death.
During this period, several students from the high school came to the funeral home to pay their respects to Kang's family.
He really liked students a lot."
"The vice principal really liked students," she said.
"We are so sorry..." tweeted Kim Min Hyuk, a senior at the high school, who tweeted the name of the vice principal along with the names of other dead teachers from the ferry tragedy.
The hearse carrying his coffin traveled a few miles east and pulled into Danwon High School, circling the campus for one last time -- signifying Kang's last visit to his school.
