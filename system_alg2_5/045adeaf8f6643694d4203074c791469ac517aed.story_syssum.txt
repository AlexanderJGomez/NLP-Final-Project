Club members voted overwhelmingly to try to work things out with the day-care center, which accused some swim club members of making racist comments to black and Hispanic children contracted to use the pool, said Bernice Duesler, the club director's wife.
How can I take those children back there?"
Some children said white members of the club made racist comments to the children, asking why "black children were there" and raising concerns that "they might steal from us."
Club director John Duesler told CNN that he had underestimated the amount of children who would participate, and the club was unable to supervise that many kids.
But John Duesler said last week that the Valley Club also canceled contracts with two other day-care centers because of safety and overcrowding issues.
And Wright said she still has concerns about the issue.
