I'll spend hours just surfing the Web, searching for details about old high school acquaintances, co-workers and potential dates.
My friends make fun of me mercilessly, teasingly (I hope) calling me a creeper, and I've seen some sitcoms and movies lately that seem to indicate that Google stalking kills the mystery or whatever, but I'm just fascinated by people -- and the fact that our lives have become so public.
Well, Creeper(?
Are you a creeper?
Does your colleague have a website?

I love 'Born This Way,' too!"
"And I would love to take you out for a steak and my namesake sometime."
Are you a creeper?
It's totally fine to do an initial Google on someone you just met (especially somewhere like a bar or online) simply to make sure that s/he is, in fact, who they say they are.
If he sucks at his hobbies (or had an unhealthy fascination with the destroyer of bloodsuckers), at least give him a chance to charm you before you can write him off without his knowledge.
A story: Back in 2009, American Girl put out a doll named Rebecca Rubin -- a young Jewish girl from New York's Lower East Side.
Nowadays, when anyone can and will search for you online -- you're not the only one, Creeper(?)
That way, the minute an article about a head-collecting serial killer who shares your name hits the Web, you'll know why that guy you met at that bar never called you.
