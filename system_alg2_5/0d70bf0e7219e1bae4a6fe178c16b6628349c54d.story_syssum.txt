Low-wage workers have been the hardest hit since the onset of the financial crisis, and low-wage jobs remain a fixture of the new economy.
Congress should help low-wage workers gain access to predictable work schedules.
Hourly low-income workers endure significantly greater fluctuations in their hours and less predictability in how much they earn than full-time employees.
A University of Chicago study found that 41% of early career hourly workers and 47% who work part-time received a week or less of notice of their work schedules.
Nearly 50% of African-Americans and Latinos receive their hours with a week or less notice.
Child care is the primary casualty of just-in-time scheduling.
Real solutions exist.
Too many people work in states with little protection.
According to the National Women's Law Center, the bill would provide workers the right to request and receive predictable work schedules, receive compensation for sudden scheduling changes, and not fear retaliation if they request scheduling accommodations from their boss.
The bill protects families and allows them to attend to their many obligations, not just work.
Even with the weaker-than-expected jobs report we know our overall economy is improving, yet income-inequality is deepening.
They can start by passing legislation that better protects shift workers from arbitrary and unpredictable scheduling practices.
