Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- The man accused of killing 77 people in a bomb-and-gun rampage in Norway last summer said his actions were justified to save the country from multicultural forces as he went on trial Monday.
Breivik says his rampage was meant to save Norway from being taken over by multicultural forces and to prevent ethnic cleansing of Norwegians, said his lawyer, Geir Lippestad.
Breivik sat in court without restraints, behind a bulletproof glass barrier set up to protect him during the six hours of proceedings.
The police were so close," said Jorn Overby, who rescued some 15 people from the waters off Utoya during the massacre.
But Breivik's defense will try to prove he was sane at the time of the killings, Lippestad said Monday.
He also appeared to be overcome with emotion, fighting back tears, when part of his video manifesto "Knights Templar 2083" was played in court.
But lawyers for the victims said: "No one thought he was crying for the victims."
In a report released this month, two court-appointed psychiatric experts said Breivik was sane at the time of the killings.
"I think that one of the main messages from Norway after the tragedy ... was that we were going to protect our democracy.
"It's we who should decide what kind of a society we want; it's not the terrorists," he said.
