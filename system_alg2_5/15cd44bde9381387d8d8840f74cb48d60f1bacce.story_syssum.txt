Cuban rap duo "Doble Filo" say hip hop allows them to embrace social issues.
Formed in 1996, rap duo "Doble Filo" ("Double Edged") have been part of the Havana scene since the beginning and work with the Cuban Rap Agency.
Along with fellow Cuban rap duo "Los Aldeanos" ("The Villagers") "Doble Filo" work with U.S. hip hop audio/visual label, Emetrece Productions.
"Hip hop is an art form speaks the truth about how people are living," says Aldo Rodriguez, one half of Los Aldeanos.
Like most other Cuban rap groups, "Los Aldeanos" aren't yet in a position to make a living from their music.
Doble Filo's producer Edgaro explains that in the group's early days, he would make tracks by looping the last few bars of songs on cassette tapes.

As El B puts it, "I think one of the things people take from the music is the idea that we can do anything, we can change anything, we can be anything we want."
