Addressing an audience of about 150 people at an Asian-American and Pacific Islander Ready for Hillary event, Tanden -- president of the Center for American Progress -- said she was looking forward to seeing everyone in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada.
"She is really going to need all of us to step up, step in, be involved, fight for her, be a voice for her."
When Clinton ran for president, Tanden served as policy director and adviser.
"When you are making decisions, whether you are secretary of state, or senator, first lady, or future president, it matters who is at that table," Tanden said at the event.
Tanden has not said whether or not she would leave the think-tank and join the likely Clinton campaign.
