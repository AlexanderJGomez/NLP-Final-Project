Too many guns.
The first is to further develop and meaningfully consider high quality scientific research on violence prevention and mental health.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention once considered gun violence a public health issue.
But in 1996, the National Rifle Association pressured its many supporters in Congress to put the squeeze on the CDC by cutting funding that went to gun research, with the stipulation: "None of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control."
Science and engineering research can answer important questions.
Republicans and Democrats alike are warming up to the idea that adequate research can lead to more informed policy decisions.
Having an informed debate means relying on credible syntheses of expert studies.
When independent experts who are free from conflicts of interest come together in good faith to study an issue, they can have a profound and constructive influence on government policy.
Of course, the evidence can only take us so far.
But robust research can set the baseline for a discussion and help us make the best decisions for society.
One critical step the task force should embrace is to lift restrictions on the research public health scientists can do.
