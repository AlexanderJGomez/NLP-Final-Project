Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- The central business district of Bangkok dodged severe flooding Saturday afternoon, but surrounding areas of the bustling capital faced further inundation at the next high tide.
Massive runoff was flowing south to the sea through Bangkok, as high tides pushed the water in the opposite direction.
As floodwater entered homes, some Bangkok residents still in the city made plans to leave.
The Bangkok Post reported that government buses had evacuated a number of elderly residents from the northern and eastern suburbs, and would pick up residents of the capital on Saturday and take them out of Bangkok.
Another Bangkok resident said she was worried about abandoning her house, which has been flooded for five days, and would not leave.
In all, 1,356 people were under observation by health officials, the minister said, according to MCOT.

The government has called the flooding the worst to afflict the nation in half a century and said it might take more than a month before the waters recede from some areas.
