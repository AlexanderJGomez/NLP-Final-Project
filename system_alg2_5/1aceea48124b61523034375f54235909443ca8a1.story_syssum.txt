Schaffner is seen in a police mug shot after his arrest Saturday in Kingdom City, Missouri.
Lakey told CNN that after calling his old colleagues at the Missouri State Highway Patrol, he packed up his family from their room at the motel and watched the arrest from across the street.
Schaffner faces charges including bank robbery in Tennessee; burglary in Indiana; armed robbery in Illinois; and receiving stolen property in Ohio, Price said.
Schaffner was identified as a suspect last month after investigators posted surveillance photos from the robberies on electronic billboards throughout the South.
"This guy has made no effort to hide the gun," said FBI agent Kevin Keithley last month.
A woman in Morristown, Tennessee, also told authorities Schaffner hid in her apartment in August and threatened to kill her children if she revealed his whereabouts, according to documents filed in federal court.
The billboards began showing images from the robberies on August 24, and the next day, a man told the FBI that Schaffner was in the Morristown area at the time of the August 18 holdups.
He had threatened to kill the children if she told agents he was there, the woman said.
