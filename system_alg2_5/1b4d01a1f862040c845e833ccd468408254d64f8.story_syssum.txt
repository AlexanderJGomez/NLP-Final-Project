Matome Mbatha, market manager at Wines of South Africa, said that wine is becoming increasingly popular on the continent but the industry is still in its infancy outside South Africa.
A dry, oaked white wine blend of Semillon, Sauvignon Blanc and Muscat, the Charlevale has hints of fresh gooseberry and an acidic, lemony finish.
A light and tropical blend with a summery aroma, the Leleshwa Sauvignon Blanc is the Rift Valley Winery's flagship vintage.
A Leleshwa Sauvignon Blanc retails in local supermarkets for about $6 and the brand's red wine for $7.
The Dodoma region is home to a number of varieties including Chenin Blanc, Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon and Makutupora, a local dry red.
And at $7 dollars a bottle, Ifrikia competes on cost with many of its European counterparts.
Yibrehu added that sales of Tej wine are increasing internationally as social media and international wine competitions raise awareness of alternative African wines.
Tej costs between five to 15 Ethiopian birr (26 cents to 78 cents) locally.
