(CNN) -- While most people can appreciate the grace and athleticism of ballet, dressage -- the precision art of horse riding and training -- remains a puzzling spectacle to all but a few.

You need elegance," he said.
Dujardin, the World number one Dressage rider, who took the dressage crown in Lyon, has been labeled "the girl with the dancing horse," but was enthused to see her horse-less dancing counterparts in action.
