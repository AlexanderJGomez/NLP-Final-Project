She's a 12-time medalist who at the 2008 Games earned the title of oldest American swimmer to win an Olympic medal.
Jessica Hardy, 25, won the race in 24.50 seconds, while 26-year-old Kara Lynn Joyce finished second with a time of 24.73.
Last month, Torres told CNN's Piers Morgan that the road to the London Games for her would be a tough one.
She had undergone a state-of-the-art knee surgery after it deteriorated following the 2008 Games and spent two years recovering.
She then took a seven-year break before returning for the 2000 Sydney Games, where she would win two gold relay medals and first individual Olympic medals: three bronzes medals in the 50-meter freestyle, 100-meter freestyle and the 100-meter butterfly.
She made her last comeback at the Beijing Games in 2008, where she earned a silver medal in the 50-meter freestyle and the title of the oldest American woman to swim for the U.S. team.
