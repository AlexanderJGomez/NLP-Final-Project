Fossett was last seen in early September, flying a single-engine plane on a pleasure flight from a Nevada ranch.
He was carrying a single bottle of water and had no parachute, lawyers for Mrs. Fossett said in the court documents.
"No one involved in the search holds out any hope that Fossett is still alive," the petition said.
In the search for Fossett, wreckage from eight other crashes was discovered, one of them from the 1960s, the lawyers said.
