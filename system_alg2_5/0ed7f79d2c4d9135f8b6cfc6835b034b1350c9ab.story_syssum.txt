YANAGAWA, Japan (CNN) -- Wearing a Nashville School of Law T-shirt, Christopher Savoie walked into a second-floor police interrogation room.
There were so many rules: No recording devices.
They have charged Savoie, 38, a Tennessee native and naturalized Japanese citizen, with kidnapping his two children -- 8-year-old Isaac and 6-year-old Rebecca -- as his estranged wife, Noriko, was walking them to school Monday in Yanagawa, a rural town in southern Japan.
Christopher Savoie had visitation rights with his children, but after he returned from a short summer trip, his estranged wife fled to Japan with the children, according to court documents.
A United States court then granted sole custody to Savoie.
And, police said, the children are Japanese and have Japanese passports.
"In the States, my ex-wife is the one who's in the wrong."
In Yanagawa, those who have heard about the abduction case tend to side with the woman.
"He did it for the love of his children."
"I love you, Isaac, Rebecca," he said.
He was grateful be able to get the words out.
