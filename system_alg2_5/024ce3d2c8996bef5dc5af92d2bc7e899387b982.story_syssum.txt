New Delhi (CNN) -- Here's the best way to understand the new India in 30 seconds.
The story struck me because it weaves together some important trends and forces in India as the nation undertakes the biggest elections in world history.
Many of these mobile users are buying cheap smartphones and data packages to access the Internet.

Calling these elections too early could be embarrassing, too.
