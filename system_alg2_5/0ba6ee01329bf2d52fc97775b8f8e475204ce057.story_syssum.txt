"I know that maybe things could have been done differently," Lanzinger says wistfully.
The fact is I can't change my amputation.

But more important than that is the way to Sochi.
"I wanted to do my new life.
"After that first run, the feeling was back," he says.
Lanzinger has not watched his accident back, although he is slowly coming round to the idea that one day he will.
Guiding him to Sochi is his coach Manuel Hujara, who has worked with Lanzinger since his decision to return to competitive skiing.
He's a special guy, with coming back from that bad World Cup accident."
"I've not thought about it," he says of life after Sochi.
