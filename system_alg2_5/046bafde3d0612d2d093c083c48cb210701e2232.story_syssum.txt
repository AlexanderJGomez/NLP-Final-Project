Aides to Perry, who allowed Willingham's execution to go forward, started off with general questions about how things were going at the commission, a relatively new agency, Bassett said.
"As soon as we started discussing the Willingham investigation, the meeting got more confrontational and more difficult," Bassett said.
For Bassett, an Austin defense lawyer, it's the culmination of what he now calls a methodical campaign to shut down an investigation that might embarrass Perry.
"The case has been scrutinized and reviewed by a jury, state and federal courts, the news media, anti-death penalty activists and the Forensic Science Commission," Perry spokesman Mark Miner told CNN in an e-mail.
He said Perry's office called him just days before the commission was slated to hear from the expert it hired to review the evidence in the Willingham case.
Bassett said July's opinion from Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott "provides Governor Perry with the cover he probably needs to totally squash the investigation."
The state fire marshal's office has told the Forensic Science Commission it stands by the findings in his case.
In Willingham's case, Perry's office says the governor was briefed on a last-minute filing by Austin-based fire science expert Gerald Hurst that found the deadly blaze was likely not arson, but he refused to grant a stay of execution for further investigation.
The most recent review was conducted by Maryland arson expert Craig Beyler at the request of the Forensic Science Commission.
Stephen Saloom, the group's policy director, told CNN that the investigation should go forward for the sake of hundreds of other prisoners now serving time for arson, some of whom also may have been convicted based on outdated fire science.
