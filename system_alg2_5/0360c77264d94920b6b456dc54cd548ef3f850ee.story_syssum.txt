Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- The numbers tell a small part of the story: Eight dead in a bomb blast.
The whimpering of a woman near tears moments after the bomb blast.
And again.
And again.
People all over Norway sat in front of their televisions and cried when they heard the next day how many people had died, and they are still crying, Tandberg told CNN Thursday.
The resulting video shows central Oslo littered with street signs ripped out of the ground by the blast, insulation torn from buildings, and people wandering in shock.
And rings.
And rings.
