(CNN)Jami Smith Lane clearly remembers saying goodbye to her 14-year-old daughter, Sierra Wilder, for the last time.
And I said, 'I love you,'" Lane recalled.
At the same time, the family and the community in the small town of Nashville, Illinois, are still trying to come to terms with the loss of four beloved members.
"That's what all her friends are saying at school -- they thought they had so much time with her, just like we did.
"We're helping each other out and leaning on each other," Lane said.
The other family members who died in the plane crash were Sierra's uncle and aunt, Marty and Kimberly Gutzler, and Piper, their 9-year-old daughter.
Marty Gutzler, 48, owned a furniture store in Nashville and loved flying, boating and spending time with his family, his obituary said.
And everyone knew him," Collins told CNN affiliate KFVS.
"We're so saddened by the loss and are grieving the loss of Marty and Kim and Piper and Sierra."
