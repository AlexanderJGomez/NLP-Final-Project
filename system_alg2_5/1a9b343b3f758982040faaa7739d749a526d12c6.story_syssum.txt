Thanks to Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman, eagle-eyed visitors to London might just spot the three humps of an enormous hippo appearing from the Thames' murky depths.
"I was thinking about the history, but I also had to think about practicalities," Hofman says.
"'These pieces were inspired by children's toys or items picked up from flea markets I've visited -- mass-produced toys and animal ceramics," he says.
I have a love for these objects and the way they get circulated around the world."
"I love Sao Paulo," he says.
"I love the people.
"If people have less spare time they feel they should make full use of it.
"In Europe, people work hard but they have more spare time and there's a different pace.
Hofman says "HippopoThames" will be his final water-based project.
