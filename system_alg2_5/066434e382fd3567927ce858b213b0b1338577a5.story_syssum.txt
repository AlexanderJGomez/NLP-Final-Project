(CNN) -- Contradictory reports swirled around the case of an Iranian woman sentenced to be stoned to death for adultery, with one Iranian lawyer saying Monday that she had been whipped 99 times for another alleged offense but another casting doubt on it.
"The prison authorities know exactly what she looks like and therefore must have known that the photograph printed in The Times on August 28 was not of her."
Ashtiani asked the woman, who was released from prison, to tell her son she had been whipped, Kian said from Iran on Monday.
They said no punishment was carried out on her," he said later Monday.
"If it means going to Tehran, I will go to Tehran."
In July, Iran's judiciary said the case was under review.
