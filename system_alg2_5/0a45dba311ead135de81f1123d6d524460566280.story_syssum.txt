The teen idol is just the latest young star to run afoul of both the police and public relations folks.
In recent years, Lindsay Lohan, Chris Brown and Amanda Bynes have dominated headlines with legal issues and rehab stints.
From being accused of public urination to rumors of a visit to a Brazilian brothel and the run-ins with police (authorities recently swarmed his mansion is Calabasas, California, as part of a vandalism investigation), Bieber spent most of 2013 in the news for alleged bad behavior.
Former child star Danny Bonaduce said on his Seattle radio show on KZOK-FM Thursday that Bieber's recent arrest could be just what the embattled teen star needs right now.
"I think sometimes these stars think they have to live up to their own image to the point that they almost becomes fans of their own image," she said.
Other celebs have not bounced back as well as Spears.
Lindsay Lohan recently announced she will be starring in and producing a new film, and there's a six-episode documentary series on the way.
"Not 'I don't give a f***' to just be reckless and do whatever, but 'I don't give a f*** what they say," Bieber reportedly said.
