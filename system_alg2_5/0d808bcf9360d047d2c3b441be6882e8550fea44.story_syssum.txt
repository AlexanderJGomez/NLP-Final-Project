I'm going to look like a complete fool, she thought.
But she came back the next day.
"It's just crazy," the Arkansas City, Kansas, resident says.
"It really hit me hard, and I turned to food for comfort," she remembers.
"I knew I needed to lose weight, but I never knew where to start," she says.
Instructor Maria Venegas remembers when Tomsche first tried her Zumba class.
Venegas teaches seven Zumba classes a week in Arkansas City in addition to working as an office manager and professional photographer.
"Every class is always different," Tomsche says.
Tomsche does Zumba five to six times a week and tries to stay active the rest of the day.
I'm not out of breath when I walk up and down the halls at work, and even sleeping is easier since I don't have all that excess weight pressing down on me."
Tomsche is just happy she's gotten her smile back.
