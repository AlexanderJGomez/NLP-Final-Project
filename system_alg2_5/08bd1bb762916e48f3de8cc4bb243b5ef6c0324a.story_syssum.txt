(CNN) -- It's not easy taking over from one of the greatest managers in football history, but David Moyes has been assured that one trophy in his debut season at Manchester United will be considered a success.
The most important person in the club is the manager and that must always be sacrosanct.
Moyes, who did win the pre-season Community Shield match, was boosted ahead of the Southampton match when teen sensation Adnan Januzaj signed a new five-year contract.
"We should probably have put the game to bed earlier," Moyes said.
By contrast, Arsenal romped to a comprehensive 4-1 win at home to Norwich that put Arsene Wenger's team two points clear of Chelsea and Liverpool.

In the late match, Manchester City won away for the first time this season, beating West Ham 3-1 thanks to a double from Sergio Aguero to move above Southampton into fourth place.
