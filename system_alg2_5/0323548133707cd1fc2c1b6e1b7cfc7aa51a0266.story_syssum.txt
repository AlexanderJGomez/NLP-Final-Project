"Obama is saying consciously, 'I'm going to change the direction of what I'm talking about.
Really, here is my strongest argument -- I want people to hear that,'" said Robert Lehrman, who was a speechwriter for dozens of Democratic political figures including Vice President Al Gore and is author of "The Political Speechwriter's Companion."
Congressional Republicans pointed out that the president's call for the tax cuts extension is not new and accused the president of trying to steer the narrative away from last week's dismal jobs news.
Both Obama and Romney have had hits and misses when it comes to trying to change the subject, said Julian Zelizer, a CNN contributor and history and public affairs professor at Princeton University, who has written books on former presidents George W. Bush, Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter.
"There are subtle ways to (change the subject)," Zelizer said.
"When Obama did that private sector ad lib I'm sure right after he just about bit his tongue off," Lehrman said.
... You have to think not just how could he steer the conversation but what bad things did he avoid," Lehrman said, adding that the thorny issue of immigration was full of potential pitfalls that could have come back to haunt Romney.
