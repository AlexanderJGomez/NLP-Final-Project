But allegations of American spying have seriously injured German trust, Chancellor Angela Merkel has said.
"The U.S. Embassy has seen the reports that Germany has asked the U.S. Mission Germany's intelligence chief to leave the country.
Top German government officials have candidly spoken about the decision to expel the U.S. official as they poured their disappointment over alleged U.S. spying into microphones and cameras for days.
One of the new cases has landed on top of an existing investigation on federal prosecutors' desks into the possible spying on Merkel.
During the Cold War, high-level spy scandals stoked division between then divided democratic West Germany and communist East Germany.
Amid the new allegations, the top U.S. and German diplomats are expected to meet in Vienna, Austria, this weekend during multination negotiations about the future of Iran's nuclear program, a senior U.S. State Department official said.
While the official said U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and German Foreign Minister Frank Walter Steinmeier will touch on topics such as the Middle East and Ukraine, it'd be hard to imagine the two ignoring the spy issue.
