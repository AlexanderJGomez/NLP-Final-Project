London (CNN) -- Nearly four decades after he brought an invasion of mutant, flesh-eating rodents to London with his first novel, "The Rats," UK chiller writer James Herbert has died aged 69.
"It's a true testament to his writing and his enduring creativity that his books continued to be huge bestsellers right up until his death," said Trevathan.
"Sad news about James Herbert -- as a teen, I scared myself silly reading him.
(I read it 20 yrs ago!)"
In the same year, he was made the Grand Master of Horror by the World of Horror Convention.
