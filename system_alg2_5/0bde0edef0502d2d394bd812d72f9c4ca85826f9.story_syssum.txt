(CNN) -- Sudan ordered a number of international aid agencies to leave the country Wednesday after an arrest warrant was issued for the country's president, a United Nations source in the capital city of Khartoum said.
"He notes that this represents a serious setback to lifesaving operations in Darfur, and urges the government of Sudan to act urgently to restore these NGOs to their full operational status," spokeswoman Michelle Montas said.
Sudan's ambassador to the U.N. declined to confirm any details on the subject.
"If Oxfam's registration is revoked, it will affect more than 600,000 Sudanese people whom we provide with vital humanitarian and development aid, including clean water and sanitation on a daily basis," Penny Lawrence, Oxfam's International Director, said in a statement.
Oxfam does not have an opinion on the Court's activities, and our sole focus is meeting humanitarian and development needs in Sudan."
