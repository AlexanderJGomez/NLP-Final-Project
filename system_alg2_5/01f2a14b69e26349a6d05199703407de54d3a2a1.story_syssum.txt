In the meantime, consumers will feel the pain as devices potentially get more expensive and software changes begin to creep into their Android smartphones.
This would be driven by fundamental changes in the look and feel of non-Apple phone hardware, changes to the Android mobile operating system and potentially the emergence of a third popular mobile operating system.
Android phone makers will be scrambling to develop temporary workarounds to steer clear of any potentially infringing Apple patents.
Consumers who want to stay in the open and highly-customizable Android ecosystem could experience some temporary frustration.
Beyond that, every device manufacturer will be thinking outside of the "rectangular slab form-factor" box in an attempt to create the next big consumer trend.
Of course, Apple does have patent and design agreements with Microsoft and both companies have a mutual interest in slowing Android growth.
As wireless carriers and device manufacturers seek to diversify their product lineup in the wake of the ruling, Microsoft might finally have its day in mobile.
Today's constraints will define how the industry will innovate tomorrow.
