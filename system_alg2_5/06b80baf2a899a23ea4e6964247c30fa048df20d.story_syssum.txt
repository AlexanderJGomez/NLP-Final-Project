(CNN) -- Actress Angelina Jolie is missing the premiere of her own film Unbroken because she says she has been diagnosed with chickenpox.
The virus causes an itchy blister-like rash that can be dangerous, particularly for people who get it late in life.
For adults who get chickenpox, there can be more serious complications like pneumonia.
Typically, children get a first round of the vaccine when they are 12 to 15 months old.
If you haven't had it, and you haven't been vaccinated, it is not too late.
