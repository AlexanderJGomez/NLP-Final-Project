Whether mobile will kill digital advertising is not the most pressing question the industry faces.
If we focus on mobile phones - then it is our expectation that mobile media will take no more than 20% of digital revenues by 2016.
Yet if we include tablets within mobile media, we can predict that mobile advertising will surpass traditional digital spending by 2016.
The mobile landscape is fast-paced and will continue to evolve, meaning existing and new challenges will continue to provoke the industry.
To think that mobile could kill off another media format would completely miss the benefit of mobile devices.
Finally, mobile is more personal, more social and more local than any other media.
So back to the question, will mobile kill digital advertising?
