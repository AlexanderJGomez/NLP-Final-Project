O'Brien described a meeting between Bulger and a man who owed him money.
"What's that?"
O'Brien said had been working for the Italian mafia in Boston's North End but Bulger told him, "Forget the North End.
Bulger never personally took the money, which was always paid in cash.
Don't go to the FBI there."
On cross-examination Bulger attorney Hank Brennan questioned Foley about the integrity of Bulger's FBI informant file, which is likely to be introduced at trial, asking the retired investigator why he would accept the informant file as accurate when it was compiled by the same FBI agents Foley believed were lying to him.
Bulger's lawyers also are trying to establish that Bulger was never a paid informant for the FBI and that instead Bulger was the one paying rogue agents for information.
