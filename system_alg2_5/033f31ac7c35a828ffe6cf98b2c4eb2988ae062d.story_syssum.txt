Part road trip, part code jam, the annual competition plunges participants, known as "buspreneurs," into two days of frantic business development on the open road to the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas.
In fact, the StartupBus itself could be considered a meta startup: Organizers this year are developing an online game, the StartupBus Stock Exchange, in which players become virtual angel investors and invest in the companies as they're built on the buses.
When the buses arrive in Austin, development stops.
Because of the networking opportunities, the publicity from last year's contest and the sheer challenge of the undertaking, StartupBus founder Elias Bizannes was flooded with applications this year from prospective buspreneurs.
Two teams won last year: DormDorm, a startup designed to rent colleges' vacant dorm rooms to travelers during the summer, and DateBrowsr, a Hot or Not for dating profiles the service pulled from several sites.
Over the last year, the competition has grown from one bus to six.
But beer is an integral part of the startup lifestyle.
When the buses arrive in Austin, the buspreneuers will be rewarded with a tour of the local tech culture during the Startup Crawl, which promises "hot tech [and] cold beer."
