While the number of new infections is roughly equal among young women and young men, the health consequences of untreated STIs can be much more serious for young women, including losing the ability to have children.
Left untreated, common STIs such as chlamydia and gonorrhea can also cause chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy and increase HIV risk.
Infections among young people account for nearly half of that cost (approximately $7.8 billion ).
Annual gonorrhea screening is also recommended for sexually active women with new or multiple sex partners and women who live in communities with a high burden of the disease.
To increase the early diagnosis and treatment of STIs, CDC is reaching out to health care providers and young people at risk throughout the nation with messages about the importance of screening.
Sexually active Americans should talk with their doctor about STIs and which tests may be right for them.
The severe health and economic toll of STIs in America is entirely preventable.
