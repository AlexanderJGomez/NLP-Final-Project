It's one of four power stations on a UK government shortlist to trial the country's first commercial-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology.
The International Energy Agency estimates CCS could reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by more than 85 percent.
That's actually very common worldwide."
Professor Haszeldine estimates that if a new power plant costs $1.5 billion to build, it'll cost an extra $700,000 to fit the capture equipment on the first experimental plants.
Would you pay more for 'greener' power?
Energy companies will have to buy all their emissions permits, so from then on any company that stores some or all of its CO2 won't have to pay.
"The problem is that the price of maybe €35 ($54) or €40 ($62) per ton of carbon dioxide will not be enough to fund the gap in the extra estimated cost of these new power plants," explains Professor Haszeldine.
The theory is that as CCS techniques become more efficient, the cost of capturing carbon will come down so that from around 2020 it will become cheaper for companies to store carbon than to emit it.
Professor Haszeldine says the environmental cost of not doing it could be catastrophic.
