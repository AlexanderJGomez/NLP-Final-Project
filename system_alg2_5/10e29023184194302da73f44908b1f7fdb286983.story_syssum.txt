(CNN) -- The astounding discovery that our universe apparently is expanding at an accelerating rate some 14 billion years after the Big Bang has earned three scientists the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced Tuesday.
"I am delighted, excited, and deeply honored," Perlmutter said in a written statement.
"Today, we know that 74 percent of the universe consists of this dark energy," Riess wrote on his website before the award was announced.
The Nobel Prize in Physics is the second of six Nobel prizes to be announced this month.
Bragg is not only the youngest physics laureate, he is also the youngest laureate in any Nobel prize area.
On Monday, the Nobel committee named Ralph Steinman, a biologist with Rockefeller University, and scientists Bruce A. Beutler and Jules A. Hoffmann the winners of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.
