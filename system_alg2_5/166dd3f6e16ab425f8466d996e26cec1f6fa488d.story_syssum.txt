"I left Iran with the hope of maybe one day creating music that can connect with the entire world, music that can show another dimension of my culture, and my history," Nazeri says.
"To be number one, this means the world is now listening," Nazeri says.
Nazeri's father Shahram Nazeri, who also performs on the album with his son, is one of Iran's most beloved and famous classical singers, and Nazeri says, one of his greatest teachers.
And for Nazeri, like his father before him, that love finds a perfect home in musical expression.
And I would love for that message to be the sound of us in this modern time."
