John Couey had been sentenced to death for killing 9-year-old Jessica Lunsford in Florida in 2005.
He said he was sad when he heard the news of Couey's death.
"To me, death is sad," he said.
The girl was snatched from her bed in her family's Homosassa, Florida, home the evening of February 23, 2005, by Couey, a registered sex offender.
"
"I'm sorry I won't get to look him in the eyes as he died, but I'm relieved to know he'll never hurt another child again."
In sentencing Couey, Judge Ric Howard noted Couey became fearful of police dogs being used in the area in the search for the girl.
He told Lunsford he was planning to take her home, but did not want her to be seen, and so persuaded her to get into a trash bag.
Although Lunsford's death was one of several that contributed to the passage of a federal child-protection law dealing with sex offender registration and other matters related to child sex offenses, Mark Lunsford said at the time of Couey's sentencing the law does not go far enough.

"I have bad news," Mark Lunsford said.
He called on Couey to drop his appeals.
