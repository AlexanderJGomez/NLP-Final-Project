The case concerns the torture of Ogoni leaders in Nigeria, but at stake is the future of the law under which this case was brought, the Alien Tort Statute.
In the 1990s, Royal Dutch Petroleum (Shell) had extensive oil drilling operations in the Niger Delta in Nigeria, a region long plagued with poverty, human rights violations and environmental disaster.
The Supreme Court court accepted Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum last fall after a federal appeals court ruled that the statute could not be used to sue corporations.
The case has been brought in the United States because of our nation's historical role in promoting the idea of universal rights and in the development of international human rights law.
On this grim and morally and legally compromised horizon, the Alien Tort Statute is still one bright spot for human rights advocacy.
It is this legacy that is at stake in the Kiobel case before the Supreme Court.
If, on the other hand, the Supreme Court upholds the Alien Tort Statute, it will signal to the world that we do still believe that people everywhere are entitled to certain fundamental rights and that we will help enforce those rights.
