(CNN) -- The deportations of thousands of Mexicans who have served time in U.S. jails into Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, are adding a deadly ingredient to an already volatile state of security, Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz said.
"We know they were deported from the U.S.
About 85,400 "criminal aliens" were deported from the United States to their homelands in 2008, according to ICE.
Of those deported through El Paso, about 6,800 were criminal aliens, Zamarripa said.
In a recent conversation, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the United States would work to give Juarez more details about who is being dropped off on its doorstep, Reyes Ferriz said.
According to a report released last week by a Mexican watchdog group, Juarez, population 1.5 million, was the homicide capital of the world.
