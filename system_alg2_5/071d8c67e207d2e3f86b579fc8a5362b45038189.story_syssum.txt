Richard and Mayumi Heene had met in a Hollywood acting school and pursued fame for their family in the world of reality TV, Larimer County Sheriff Jim Alderden said.
"You guys said we did this for the show," Falcon said in the interview, when his father asked him why he had not come out from hiding when his parents were looking for him.
The plan included misleading the media on Friday when Alderden said authorities still believed the incident was not a hoax.
Alderden said that under Colorado law, authorities cannot announce whether polygraph tests were taken -- only that authorities pursued them.
Since authorities aren't required to share evidence until charges are actually filed, Lane said he could not lay out the Heenes' defense.
Authorities spoke with Mayumi Heene about domestic violence and the children's safety, Alderden said.
On Friday, Alderden said it had been determined that the boy was hiding in an attic in the garage.
Alderden said the boy may not have even been in the home.
The sheriff said investigators also want to interview 25-year-old researcher Robert Thomas who worked with Heene for about two months last spring.
