Time is running out: ISIS put out a video Tuesday giving the Japanese government 72 hours to pay $200 million, or else Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa -- like other ISIS captives before them -- will be killed.
Suga said his government will do its utmost to communicate with ISIS on the fate of Goto and Yukawa through a third party, such as another nation's government or a local tribe.
"We strongly urge them not to harm the two Japanese nationals and immediately release them."
Goto gave Yukawa insights on how to survive there, Kimoto said.
"I felt a chill when he said, after returning home, (that) he felt in Syria he was really living a life," Kimoto said.
Alaaeddin Al Zaim worked as a fixer for Goto.
I'm Japanese.
Another fixer agreed to take Goto to ISIS, Al Zaim said.
After one week, if I don't hear any news of them or any connection, I have to call them," said Al Zaim, who remembers seeing Goto for the last time on October 25.
Anytime he want to do his job very well ...
I have to do that.'"
Those beheaded hostages were American and British, both from countries involved in a military campaign against ISIS.
"Although you are more than 8,500 kilometers away from the Islamic State, you willingly volunteered to take part in this crusade," said the masked man who stood over Goto and Yukawa in Tuesday's video, addressing his comments to Abe.
