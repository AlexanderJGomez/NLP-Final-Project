All told, The Hunger Games has earned $337.1 million after 24 days and seems headed for a final domestic total of about $375 million.
The film is nearing the $200 million mark overseas, and as of Sunday, its worldwide total stands at $531 million.
After three years on the shelf following MGM's demise, Joss Whedon's horror/comedy The Cabin in the Woods finally got its release, and over its debut weekend, the film scared up $14.9 million — a respectable result.
Encouragingly, the film, which Lionsgate acquired for slightly less than $20 million, ticked up from $5.5 million on Friday to $5.7 million on Saturday — a rare increase for frontloaded horror films and fanboy flicks (Cabin is both of these things).
In fourth place, Titanic 3D sank by only 33 percent to $11.6 million in its second weekend.
The action film earned a "B-" CinemaScore grade.
The film, which stars The Rock, has earned over $315 million worldwide.
