Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said he doubts there would be a doctor that would think three consecutive life sentences "is not a deterrent," but admitted that there might be criticism that Gosnell didn't get death.
Judge Jeffrey Minehart, who rendered the decision, also sentenced Gosnell on Wednesday to 2Â½ to 5 years in the case of 41-year-old Karnamaya Mongar, who died of an anesthetic overdose during an abortion at Gosnell's West Philadelphia clinic.
Gosnell also was sentenced to 10 to 20 years each on two counts of conspiracy to commit murder.
McMahon said Gosnell knows that "some of his methodology was wrong" and that it was "wrong to perform abortion past 24 weeks.
O'Neill, a medical school graduate, was not charged with performing illegal abortions.
Eight people involved in Gosnell's clinic, called the Women's Medical Society, earlier pleaded guilty to various charges.
McMahon argued that Gosnell offered access to health care for people who were poor and without health insurance.
