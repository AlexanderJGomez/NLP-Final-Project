The round-ups began May 28, days after the two main political parties said they would not cooperate with the military-backed caretaker government on organizing the elections.
The Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said hundreds of their party members had been taken into custody.
The two women who head the parties -- Sheikh Hasina of the Awami League and Khaleda Zia of the BNP -- are in police custody on corruption-related charges.
The current political crisis in the Muslim-majority South Asian country of 150 million can be traced, in large part, to the lingering animosity between the two women, political observers say.
Hasina accused Zia of stocking it with BNP backers.
It also postponed elections until it said it could clean up the country's graft-ridden politics.
Among those arrested were more than 150 top politicians, including Hasina and Zia -- leading to the current political stalemate.
"The government is conducting political dialogue with small parties.
A similar release for Zia was also expected.
In addition to political party members, the crackdown has also swept up several journalists.
