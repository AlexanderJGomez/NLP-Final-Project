U.N. Security Council members on Wednesday unanimously approved a resolution to address the "growing threat" posed by foreign terrorist fighters, a measure that U.S. President Barack Obama applauded while insisting it "must be matched and translated into action" to have any effect.
But it will take more than corralling groups like ISIS militarily to permanently address the threat, Obama said.
"We must work to address ... the oppression, the lack of opportunity, too often the hopelessness that can make some individuals susceptible to appeals of extremism and violence," he said.
In fact, officials from China and Russia -- two (of the five) Security Council permanent members who often stymy U.S. efforts at the United Nations, including those related to the Middle East -- assertively staked out anti-terrorist positions on Wednesday.
He also said any efforts must "address longstanding conflicts" like those between Palestinians and Israel.
"I can promise you that the United States of America will not be distracted or deterred from what must be done," he said.
But, Obama said, America cannot do it alone.
If Russia rolls back its involvement, the United States "will lift our sanctions and welcome Russia's role in addressing common challenges," Obama said.
Climate change:  The United States will work on the issue within its own borders, but "we can only succeed in combating climate change if we are joined in this effort by every major power," Obama said.
"That's how we can protect this planet for our children and grandchildren."
