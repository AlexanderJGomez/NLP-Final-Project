"No doubt the Ebola virus is a national health problem," Sirleaf said.
As of July 20, the World Health Organization had confirmed 224 cases of Ebola in Liberia, including 127 deaths.
Patrick Sawyer arrived at Lagos' airport on July 20 and was isolated at a local hospital after exhibiting common Ebola symptoms.
Lagos State Health Commissioner Dr. Jide Idris said authorities are working to identify people who may have come in contact with the man on his flights.
It is unlikely the virus would spread on a plane unless a passenger were to come into contact with a sick person's bodily fluids, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
"When the Ebola outbreak hit, he took on responsibilities with our Ebola direct clinical treatment response, but he was serving in a missionary hospital in Liberia prior to his work with Ebola patients," said Melissa Strickland, a spokeswoman for the organization.
Another American working with Samaritan's Purse has also been infected.
She had teamed up with the staff from Samaritan's Purse to help fight the Ebola outbreak in Monrovia when she got sick.
It can also spread through contact with an object contaminated by an infected person's bodily fluids.
While the World Health Organization has mobilized to fight the epidemic, it can be a difficult one to stop.
The hope is that such measures will stop the spread of the virus.
"This is because people generally transmit the infection when they are very sick, have a high fever and a lot of symptoms -- and in these situations, they don't travel.
Stephan Monroe, CDC's deputy director of the National Center for Emerging & Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, said the CDC is working with American health care providers to educate them about Ebola.
