(Financial Times) -- "It's very important that Apple not become the developer for the world," Tim Cook, Apple chief executive, told analysts last month.
"I don't know if the parties will settle; this case is just one part of a very complex ecosystem, and putting CEOs in the room together is always a roll of the dice," says Mark Lemley, a professor at Stanford Law School.
"Samsung has vaulted into first place in worldwide sales of smartphones, with massive sales of its copycat products," alleged a recent Apple filing.
The battle with Samsung began in Northern California in April 2011, with Apple filing a 373-page complaint of patent and trademark infringement.
Samsung hit back with its own list of alleged patent infringements by Apple -- backed by its 6,000-strong US telecoms patent portfolio and its claim to have first introduced a smartphone as far back as 1999.
Florian Mueller, an independent patent analyst, says that Samsung could land itself in more trouble by going to war with patents that are essential to standards such as 3G.
Apple did not respond to a request for comment on its litigation.
