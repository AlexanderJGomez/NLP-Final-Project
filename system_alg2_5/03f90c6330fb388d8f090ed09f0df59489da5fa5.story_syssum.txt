Rome (CNN)A row has erupted over allegations by representatives of Rome's Jewish community that they were locked into the former Nazi Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland and treated "like real criminals" after filming a TV interview.
"
They started to interrogate us and they treated us like real criminals," he said.
Pawel Sawicki said the Italian TV crew had permission to film at the site until 11.30 p.m., when they had agreed that they would exit and security guards would come to the gate to let them out.
The police then arrived and took over the matter, he said.
He said the group could also have gone to another exit 150 meters (nearly 500 feet) away where the security guards were based if they wanted to leave earlier -- and could then have been let out of that gate.
