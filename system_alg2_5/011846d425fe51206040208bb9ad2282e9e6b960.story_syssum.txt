"The gender gap has been closed in education in many Arab countries, which is a big achievement of recent years," said Dima Dabbous-Sensenig, Director of the Institute for Women's Studies in the Arab World at the Lebanese American University.
In Lebanon, for example, women make up 54% of university students, but only 26% of the labor force and 8% of legislators, senior officials and managers, according to the United Nations Statistics Division.
The factors driving young women to seek a university education are not also driving them into the workplace, Dabbous-Sensenig said.
"Some men can't go to higher education because they need to make money as soon as they leave school," said Dabbous-Sensenig.
"Therefore, for many girls school is their only opportunity to make friends and socialize outside the family, so it is something they look forward to.
"The more women are highly educated, some of them will become motivated, independent young women who will get good jobs.
Al-Hassan Golley added: "I think it will take a long time before women break through these cultural and societal expectations.
