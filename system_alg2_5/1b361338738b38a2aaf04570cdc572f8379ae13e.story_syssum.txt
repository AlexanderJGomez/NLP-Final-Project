But that's how many Mac users are feeling after the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Orbitz was steering Mac users toward higher-priced hotels than PC users, based on spending habits discovered by one of the site's algorithms.
In the Wall Street Journal story, Orbitz engineers said they were experimenting with predictive analytics based on users' computers, which resulted in Mac users being served up a different set of results -- often with a bigger price tag.
Meanwhile, rival travel sites Expedia, Priceline and Travelocity capitalized on the furor to insist that they don't use similar algorithms based on what type of computer their customers employ.
Orbitz data show that Mac users are likely to spend $20 more a night on a hotel than PC users, on average, Harford said.
We are really excited about the potential to use this wisdom ... to make travel better for consumers," he said.
