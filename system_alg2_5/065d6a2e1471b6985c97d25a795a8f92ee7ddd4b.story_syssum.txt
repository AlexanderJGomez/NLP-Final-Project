The game's creators are partnering with Zynga, maker of such popular social games as "Farmville," "Cityville" and "Words With Friends," to produce Zynga Slingo.
"Slingo" is played by more than 55 million people through online, mobile and casino games.
The new game comes on the heels of the release of Zynga's 2011 financial report showing the company earned $1.14 billion but still ended up with a net loss of more than $400 million.
The company also had the top five most-played games on Facebook.
