Meanwhile, an official with the system stood by the decision to shut off cell phone service ahead of a protest last week.
The decision Thursday to "temporarily interrupt ... service at select BART stations as one of many tactics to ensure the safety of everyone on the platform" drew widespread criticism and stirred the well-known hacking group Anonymous to stage an "operation" Sunday.
"All over the world people are using mobile devices to organize protests against repressive regimes, and we rightly criticize governments that respond by shutting down cell service, calling their actions anti-democratic and a violation of the rights to free expression and assembly," Rebecca Farmer from the ACLU's northern California office wrote on the advocacy group's website.
Several related items and documents were posted, including one claiming to be "the User Info Database of MyBart.gov."
"We made a gut-wrenching decision that was forced upon us by the protesters," Johnson said.
