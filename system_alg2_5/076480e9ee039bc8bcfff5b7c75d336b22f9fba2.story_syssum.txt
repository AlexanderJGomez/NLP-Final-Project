In literacy class, Victor and Dulce are both in level seven.
The move to do away with grade levels throughout the Adams County School District began three years ago.
"Every single student is getting an individualized education," said Hodgkins Principal Sarah Gould, who helped usher in the reform at her school two years ago.
Unlike traditional schools, students at Hodgkins can move up a learning level anytime they're ready, not just at the end of the year.
"The time is right for a system that focuses on individual students and lets them progress at their own pace," said education researcher Robert Marzano, who is helping the district develop standards-based learning, a system that was first introduced in the 1960s.
In the last decade, as demographics began to change, standardized test scores fell, leading the district to be placed on an academic watch list.
That's just not going to happen," she said.
Standards-based learning in the Adams County School District is currently in place in kindergarten through ninth grade, and will be integrated through all high schools by 2014.
And since school board members are are limited to two four-year term limits, the unanimous support may wane if standardized test scores don't improve.
School Board President Vicky Marshall explained that it would take three to five years for any type of major reform to show results.
Principal Gould is quick to point out that the initial drop in test scores was expected, since many kids were placed in lower levels to make up for gaps in their educations.
