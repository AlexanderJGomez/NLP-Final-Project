EW: How much did you know that you were getting evicted?
McGuire: Yeah, I mean it's a small house and word gets around quick, so I mean, I knew at the beginning of the week.
EW: Yeah, it's true.
I mean, I knew I was going with or without her vote.
I feel like there was a lot of high emotions, and that house is a pressure cooker, so I think it just made everything a little bit worse.
McGuire: I don't know.
I mean, everybody told her that she would either have to use it or she'd be going home because everyone would vote her out for keeping me here.
McGuire: Yeah, I was warned a little bit about some of the things.
I've just been watching the show, but there have been a lot of people that have been watching the feeds, and they've been reporting things that several the contestants â€” among you â€” have said and there have been some homophobic and racist and sexist things that you've said.
McGuire: Yeah, I'm not racist, sexist, or homophobic, so I mean, I guess everything can be taken out of context.
EW: When we talked to Nick after he got voted out, he said that on some level when you're playing a game you don't want to rock the boat, but then you don't want to be that person who just stands by idly while someone is making such racial slurs and just saying some really unfathomable things.
McGuire: Yeah, yeah.
McGuire: [Laughs] I don't know because I don't know what you're talking about.
McGuire: Yeah, I'm going back to the boat.
I don't know 'bout all that, but we'll see.
How so?
McGuire: [Laughs] I am a champion through and through, and that's why I couldn't throw anything and I had to win 'em all.
EW: Yeah.
I feel the same way.
