London (CNN) -- Spain faces a test of unity over the coming months as regional elections in Catalonia and Galicia threaten to destabilize the debt-ridden nation.
According to Barroso, the ruling political party in Catalonia, Convergence and Union (CiU) led by Catalan President Artur Mas, has used the eurozone debt crisis and regional elections set for November 25 to openly call for sovereignty.
Even as Catalonia -- with its own language and culture -- strives for autonomy, in August, the CiU requested a 5 billion euro ($6.3 billion) bailout from the Spanish government.
Instead Spain's leader is focusing on regional elections in Galicia in October -- a region in North-western Spain -- where his party is likely to win and where the policies could create a model for the rest of Spain.
He added: "For Rajoy, he has said 'only if market pressure increases' and you see how yields are going up again.
