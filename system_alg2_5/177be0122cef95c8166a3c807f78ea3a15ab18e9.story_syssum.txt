Washington (CNN) -- Republicans are committing political suicide and putting the support of an entire generation on the line by opposing an overhaul of U.S. immigration laws, President Barack Obama said Thursday night.
The President repeated his vow to sign an executive order making changes to the immigration system after the November 4 midterm elections.
"It's shocking that the White House now openly admits that President Obama is delaying his unilateral actions on immigration until after the November elections simply because of raw politics," the two said.
"By taking unilateral action on immigration, President Obama will inject serious constitutional questions into an already heated debate," the two said.
