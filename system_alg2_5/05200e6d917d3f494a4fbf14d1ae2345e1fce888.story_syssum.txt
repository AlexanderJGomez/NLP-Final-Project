(CNN) -- The search will continue until at least Friday night for 16 people missing since Thursday morning when a helicopter carrying them to an offshore oil platform ditched in the Atlantic Ocean off Newfoundland, Canadian officials said.
"All we've got is the debris field," McGuire said.
"They declared their mayday and then they hit the water or landed in the water approximately eight minutes later," he said.
At that time, based on water temperature and the size of the search area, officials will decide whether to continue the effort, he said.
The helicopter had been heading to the Hibernia offshore oil platform when it went down in what Grychowski called a controlled emergency crash landing.
