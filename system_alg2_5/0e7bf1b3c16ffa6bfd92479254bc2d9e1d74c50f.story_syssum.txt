London (CNN) -- Does part of social media's future lie in the past?
One of those people is Phil Libin, CEO of Evernote, a service that allows users to archive images, documents and other data.
But Libin believes that he can encourage even more people to park their data with Evernote if he can remove any question of doubt about his company's long-term destiny.
"We want people to have to believe that Evernote will be around for 100 years," Libin told CNN.
Delicious still exists today and may continue to thrive long into the future.
"There's no magical technology solution -- it's not like we have a file format that someone will be able to read in 100 years," he added.
Libin says his company is taking cues from the Long Now Foundation, a private organization that is examining ways to preserve data for centuries as part of its broader efforts to promote debate over humankind's distant legacy.
