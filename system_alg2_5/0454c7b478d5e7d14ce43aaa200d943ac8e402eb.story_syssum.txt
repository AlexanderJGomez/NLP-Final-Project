PARIS, France (CNN) -- The backstage gossip at recent fashion shows wouldn't be complete without rampant speculation about who is likely to replace esteemed American Vogue Editor in Chief Anna Wintour.
Do you want to go to Hollywood or do you want to stay here in Paris and do the cinema I like to do?," Roitfeld said.
Roitfeld is anxious not to create any friction between her and her U.S. counterpart, telling CNN "I think Anna does a great job...
At Vogue Paris, Roitfeld knows her readers.
There's no imperative to make any clothes they feature wearable.
With just 25 staff, Roitfeld describes the team at French Vogue as like a family.
I think it's not for me."
