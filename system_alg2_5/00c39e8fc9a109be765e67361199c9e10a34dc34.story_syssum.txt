Crew and passengers subdued Osbon as he screamed and banged on the door so hard the first officer thought Osbon would come through, according to a federal criminal complaint filed Wednesday against Osbon.
Osbon turned off the radios in the aircraft, dimmed his monitors and sternly admonished the FO (first officer) for trying to talk on the radio," the U.S. attorney's office in the Northern District of Texas said in a written statement.
About 3Â½ hours into the planned five-hour flight from New York's Kennedy International Airport to Las Vegas, the pilot left the cockpit to use the lavatory, but he failed to follow security protocol, alarming the crew, according to an affidavit filed in support of an arrest warrant.
By that time, the first officer had summoned another JetBlue pilot who had been traveling as a passenger to enter the cockpit and the two locked themselves inside, the affidavit states.
Osbon, who was been charged with interfering with a flight crew, has not made a public statement.
He just did what he was paid to do," Jean Beatrice Dowd said of Jason Dowd.
The incident "has been earthshaking for us, too," she said.
He was in New York, speaking with officials about the incident, his mother said.
I've only known Clayton to be a cheerful, conscientious and caring person."
