Clinton aides say the event was tied to her family's foundation  -- the Clinton Global Initiative -- and the fact that its annual meeting will be held in Denver later this month.
Instead of surrounding herself with the regular PR flacks and publicists in preparation to sell her book, Clinton has brought on seasoned campaign veterans and political communicators.
"It gives them a sense of what a political campaign feels like," he said.
In Portland, she shrugged when asked about 2016 and walked off stage to a chorus of laughs.
It has also tapped Kiki McLean, a former Clinton senior adviser and veteran of five presidential campaigns, to coordinate the surrogate operation around the book.
It is safe to say that Clinton's book roll out is one of the first to use phrases like war room and surrogate operation.
The first book excerpts came out in early May, when in honor of Mother's Day Vogue published a passage of Clinton's book that was dedicated to her mother.
The speculation was that Clinton's staff wanted to get the news out of the way early so that it wouldn't shadow the rest of the book.
And as is evident with Clinton's stepped up presence and the slow trickle of news about her campaign, Clinton's book tour appears to be as much a memoir roll out as it is political tune up.
