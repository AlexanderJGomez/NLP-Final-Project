"Many girls were abducted by the rampaging gunmen who stormed the school in a convoy of vehicles," said Emmanuel Sam, an education official in Chibok.
Sam could not say exactly how many girls were kidnapped, but one student who managed to get away said at least 200 students were taken.
They left with us in a convoy into the bush," said the student, who declined to be named for security reasons.
In early March, Borno state government closed all of its 85 secondary schools and sent more than 120,000 students home following increasing Boko Haram attacks on schools.
