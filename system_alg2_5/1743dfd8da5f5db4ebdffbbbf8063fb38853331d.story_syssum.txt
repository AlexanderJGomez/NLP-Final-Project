(CNN) -- What do you get when you combine a hotel and a boat?
Now the oldest ferry boat in the country has a permanent home moored on the Hudson River -- and a psychedelic new interior.
The renovated 14-meter boat includes a double bedroom, dining room and two-person wooden bath.
History buffs can experience life as a World War II sailor -- without the combat -- aboard the historic USS Silversides submarine.
Guests can also take part in a Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) design class, including lessons on building their own underwater robot.
The building is based on the Roi des Belges, the riverboat that author Joseph Conrad sailed up the Congo in 1889, and later used as the inspiration behind his famous book Heart of Darkness.
