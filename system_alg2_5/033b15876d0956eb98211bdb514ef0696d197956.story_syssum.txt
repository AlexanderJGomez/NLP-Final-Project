(CNN) -- You knew Tony Soprano from the small things.
James Gandolfini was a master of the small things.
Before "The Sopranos," Gandolfini -- a one-time truck driver and bartender who didn't turn to acting until he was in his mid-20s -- was a well-regarded character actor on stage and screen.
Tony Soprano.
He was chosen because, Chase said, "the show I envisioned is the show that's got Jimmy in it.
"
And with Gandolfini, Edie Falco, Michael Imperioli, Lorraine Bracco and so many more, "The Sopranos" gave life to the scripts.
Here, Gandolfini drops Tony's New Jersey accent and with it, his tough-guy veneer.
It's easy to confuse actors with their most famous roles; with this one episode, Gandolfini showed that he was no more Tony Soprano than he was Kevin Finnerty, but that he was playing them.
"The Sopranos" gave Gandolfini fame and wealth; he got in a contract dispute before the fifth season, eventually winning a contract worth around $13 million, according to a Variety report at the time.
In it, Gandolfini plays another New Jersey sad sack, this one a 1960s grocer failing to connect with his rock 'n' roll-besotted son.
Gandolfini will almost certainly be best remembered for Tony Soprano, his role of a lifetime.
