Jason Segel and Paul Rudd star in "I Love You, Man," which opens Friday.
But don't call the film a "bromance" in the presence of Rudd and Segel.
Segel has also been in Apatow projects -- including last year's "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" -- and he stars in the TV series "How I Met Your Mother," which finds plenty of humor in male bonding.

"Just less fart jokes."
