Kabul (CNN) -- When 18-year-old Mumtaz walks into a room, the first thing you notice about her is the patchwork of painful puffy red scars that stretch across her face.
They beat up her family, and finally two armed men held her, pulled her head back and let the man who had wanted to marry her pour acid all over her face.
The shelter where Mumtaz now lives is a haven for women who have been abused.
My life was in a great danger, " Mumtaz said.
Sahar Gul had been beaten, burned, scalded with water and had her fingernails ripped out after being married off to a man more than twice her age when she was just 13 years old.
Gul said that when she didn't conceive a child, her husband and his family started complaining she was eating too much.
They used to say that they want to make money and wanted to buy a car," Gul said.
Human rights groups say overall conditions for women in the country have improved since the U.S.-led war, but there are still too many cases where women are treated as subhuman.
But I still think the overall picture is less than people really hoped for," Heather Barr of Human Right's Watch in Afghanistan said.
Kofi, along with human rights advocates, worries about what will happen to women if international aid for services halts along with the pullout of NATO troops and the threat of the Taliban in government.
