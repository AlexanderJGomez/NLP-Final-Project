(CNN) -- Veteran striker Miroslav Klose equaled the World Cup scoring record of Brazilian great Ronaldo to rescue a point for Germany in a pulsating 2-2 draw with Ghana in Fortaleza Saturday.
It was his fifth goal in World Cup finals, equaling the African record held by the great Roger Milla of Cameroon.
Muller scored 68 in just 62 games, his final goal for his country being the winner in the 1974 World Cup final against the Netherlands.
"It went backwards and forwards, Germany could have won it, we could have won it -- the point was fair," said Boateng, who plays for German club Schalke and represented the country's under-21 team before choosing the nation of his father.
