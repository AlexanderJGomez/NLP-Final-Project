In another matter relating to Loughner, Burns said he would not make a ruling on a defense request to withhold two new mug shots of Loughner taken by the U.S.
The marshals service attempt to release the two mug shots was based on a 6th Circuit Court ruling, and the judge said he would let media outlets in the 6th Circuit Court region -- Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennesse -- seek the release of the two mug shots.
But the judge commented that the mug shots of Loughner don't appear to jeopardize his right to a fair trial.
But David Bodney, an attorney for two Arizona media outlets seeking the search warrant results, said federal officials have already released selective details of the search and added that the First Amendment and federal law provide "a strong presumptive right of public access" to the records.
Loughner is accused of shooting Giffords in the head at a "Congress on Your Corner" event on January 8 at a Tucson grocery store and then shooting 18 other people, six of them fatally.
Friday's hearing was held in San Diego because presiding Judge Burns and Loughner's federal public defender, Judy Clarke, are based in the city.
A trial also could be held in Arizona outside Tucson, those sources said.
Federal sources said Silver -- if asked to move the trial -- would consult with officials of the 9th Circuit, the federal judicial region that comprises nine Western states.
