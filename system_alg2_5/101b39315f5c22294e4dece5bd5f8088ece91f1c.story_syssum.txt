"We are going to Aleppo," one said with a smile.
Mohammed Wahid al Akad, Aleppo's provincial governor, was on hand to greet us, eager to show us the gains that Syrian forces had made in and around the city -- and also talk about the ongoing negotiations in Switzerland between representatives of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government and various opposition factions.
Three buses picked us up for a tour of areas the military had recently taken back from rebels.
For a long time it appeared opposition forces might take full control of Syria's largest city.
They are Islamists, they see us as infidels and they want to kill us," one soldier said.
The city has the same remarkable dynamic as many other Syrian cities during the civil war, including Homs and Damascus.
But in many government-controlled parts of the city, just a few blocks from the fighting, the streets are full of people and the shops are well stocked.
Aleppo offered many surprises before we climbed back into our rickety old YAK-40 jet at the end of the day.
