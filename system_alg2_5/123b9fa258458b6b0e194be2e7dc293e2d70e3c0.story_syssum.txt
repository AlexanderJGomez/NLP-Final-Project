(CNN) -- The U.S. Navy has started a force to battle pirates attacking ships in and near the Gulf of Aden off Somalia's coast, the U.S. Fifth Fleet said Thursday.
The United States anticipates other nations joining the force "in the near future."
At least one major company pulled its ships from the Gulf of Aden region in 2008, meaning cargo bound for Europe had to round the African continent rather than use the Suez Canal.
Pirates attacked nearly 100 vessels and hijacked as many as 40 in the waters off the coast of Somalia in 2008, according to the International Maritime Bureau.
Boyah said.
"We went into the deep ocean and hijacked the unarmed cargo ships," Boyah said.
The task forces are part of the Combined Maritime Forces, which includes naval ships and other assets from more than 20 nations.
He welcomed the establishment of the task force.
