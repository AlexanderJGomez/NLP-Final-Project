Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN)  -- High in the hills above the Haitian capital, artist Levoy Exil paints at his terrace studio.
The Musee d'Art Nader, which housed more than 12,000 pieces from the largest private collection in Haiti, collapsed.
"There is no art museum run by the government of Haiti," said Georges Nader Jr., who runs a gallery near the Nader museum opened by his father.
"They're painting their lives.
One key figure who's been weighing in on the need to save what can be saved is Gerald Alexis, a leading Haitian art historian, critic and curator.
Haiti's art "will tell future generations who they are and where they come from," Alexis said.
Our cultural heritage is our pride."
Nader pulled out an oil-on-cardboard floral still-life painted by Hyppolite in 1945 that now looks more like a jigsaw puzzle with pieces missing.
"This?
The cultural loss can hardly compare.
On the second floor of his gallery, he and his staff have been collecting damaged pieces, their vibrant colors dulled by the dust.
And, perhaps it will fuel a new wave of art that reveals the resilience of people here.
High above the misery, Exil, too, said he will paint again.
"It's a great loss for all of us," Exil said of the earthquake.
For the future of Haiti.
