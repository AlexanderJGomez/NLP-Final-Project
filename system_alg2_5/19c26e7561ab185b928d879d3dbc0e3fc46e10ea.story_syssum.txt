NEW YORK (CNN) -- Russia invades Georgia and President Bush goes on vacation.
Sen. John McCain takes weekends off and limits his campaign events to one a day.
When asked what his Christian faith means to him, his answer was a one-liner.

?
And it shows over and over again whenever McCain is called upon to think on his feet.
George Bush's record as a student, military man, businessman and leader of the free world is one of constant failure.
I fear to the depth of my being that John McCain is just like him.
