D'Artagnan gets its foie gras from Hudson Valley Foie Gras, two hours north of New York City, which produces about 375,000 pounds of the delicacy a year.
Each duck will yield a liver that weighs about 1.5 pounds.

"There cannot be an agreement because for vegetarian activists, no farm is a good farm," Daguin says.

"What they should be interested in is making sure that the farming practices in the world are sound," she said.
