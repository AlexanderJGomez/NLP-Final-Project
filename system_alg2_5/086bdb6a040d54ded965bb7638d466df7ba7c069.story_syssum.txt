On Thursday, French president Francois Hollande told a delegation of professional French football club leaders he wouldn't abandon the government's plan for a 75% tax on salaries reaching more than a $1.35 million.
If it goes ahead it would France's first football "strike" since 1972.
While the average Ligue 1 player's salary is estimated at just under $800,000, Ibrahimovic reportedly takes home $17.5 million a year.
"French teams will be at a disadvantage with regard to English clubs who only pay 40% tax," former Monaco chief executive Tor-Kristian Karlsen told CNN.
"Monaco and PSG have raised the popularity and exposure of French football outside France," added Karlsen.
A survey by pollster OpinionWay in October suggested 85% of voters did not think football clubs should be exempted from the high tax rate, which requires approval from the French parliament.
And given France's economic problems -- it has only just emerged from recession -- some members of the French football community remain uneasy about the proposed strike.
