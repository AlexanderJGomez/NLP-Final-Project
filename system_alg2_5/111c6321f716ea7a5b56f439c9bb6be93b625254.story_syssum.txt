Shank suffered severe brain damage after a traffic accident nearly eight years ago that robbed her of much of her short-term memory and left her in a wheelchair and living in a nursing home.
After legal fees were paid, $417,000 was placed in a trust to pay for Debbie Shank's long-term care.
The Shanks didn't notice in the fine print of Wal-Mart's health plan policy that the company has the right to recoup medical expenses if an employee collects damages in a lawsuit.
"We assumed after three years, they [Wal-Mart] had made a decision to let Debbie Shank use this money for what it was intended to," Graham said.
Legal or not, CNN asked Wal-Mart why the company pursued the money.
Jim Shank said he believes Wal-Mart should make an exception.
"The recovery that Debbie Shank made was recovery for future lost earnings, for her pain and suffering," Graham said.
The damage she recovered was for much more than just medical expenses."
But just last week, the high court said it would not hear the case.
