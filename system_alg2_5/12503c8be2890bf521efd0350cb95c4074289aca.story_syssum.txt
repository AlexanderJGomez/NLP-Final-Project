"The defeat of the U.S. is imminent, inshallah," Shahzad said during the sentencing.
White House spokesman Nick Shapiro noted the trial held in a civilian court effectively handled the case.
He pointed to the ceiling and said "Allahu akbar," or God is great, and he said he didn't care about the sentence.
"The Quran gives us the right to defend ourselves," he said.
"Let this be a warning to others who would attempt to attack us: You will be caught; you will be held to account; and justice will be brought down upon you," Schumer said.
Shahzad is accused of attempting to set off a vehicle bomb in Times Square on May 1, according to documents filed in federal court.
At a June court appearance, Shahzad admitted to receiving five days of weapons training in Waziristan, in Pakistan.
The roughly 40-minute video, according to its description in the memo, features Shahzad quoting from the Quran while the other side of the screen is filled with images of Times Square after the botched bombing.
