French police union spokesman Christophe Crepin said tensions were high at the protest, which some 15,000 people attended.
Kurdish activists have pointed the finger at possible Turkish involvement, while political leaders in Turkey have nodded to a possible feud within the PKK.
"How can France hold talks with these people who are members of PKK that was also declared terrorist organization by the EU?"
Erdogan had previously suggested the deaths "could be an internal settling of scores, or it could be an initiative that was taken to create an obstacle in the way of the new honest steps we are taking," according to the Anatolian news agency.
A Kurdish lawmaker told CNN that the bodies of all three Kurdish activists were expected to be sent from France to Turkey for funerals.
But, she added, "we should not suspend a possible peace process."
