WASHINGTON (CNN) -- House Democrats on Thursday failed to override President Bush's veto of a children's health insurance bill that opponents said was too expensive.
Bush proposes increasing the program by $5 billion.
"What we've been working towards is trying to find a way to say that we ought to insure poor children first," said the Ohio Republican.
"The American people support this issue because kids do not need to suffer for what is basically a broken health care system, and this provides those children  with that health care," Emanuel said.
The bill the House and Senate passed in September would extend eligibility for the program to about 4 million more, paying for the expansion with a 61-cent-per-pack increase in the federal tax on cigarettes.
"I made clear that, if putting poor children first requires more than the 20 percent increase in funding I proposed, we'll work with Congress to find the money we need," said the president.
House Republican leaders have complained that Democrats postponed the override attempt for two weeks to use the issue for political advantage.
Meanwhile, of the eight Democrats who voted against the bill in September, only one has said he will reverse his vote and support an override.
Democratic Rep. Diane Watson of California, who declined to vote on the original bill, has agreed to vote for the override, House Democratic Whip Rep. Jim Clyburn said.
