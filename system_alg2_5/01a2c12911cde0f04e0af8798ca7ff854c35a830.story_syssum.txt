Here, watchmakers such as A. Lange & Söhne and Nomos Glashütte among others have thrived since the fall of the Wall and have since exported their high-end watches to the rest of the world.
It is companies like these which put their personal, unique stamp on a timeless piece which isn't assembled overnight, explained A. Lange & Söhne.
I think that combination is what drives people and what makes them our customers," said Wilhelm Schmid, CEO of A. Lange & Söhne.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall, much of the watch industry was able to get back on its feet, explained Schmid.
Fortunately for those companies, Glashütte has revived as Germany's capital of watchmaking once again, employing more people than it ever has.
"We have brought great and unique design to Glashütte," said Uwe Ahrendt, CEO of Nomos Glashütte.
