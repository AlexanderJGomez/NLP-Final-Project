(CNN) -- The fight to block construction of the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline through east Texas stepped up Monday as protesters locked themselves to machinery.
Two others were arrested when they tried to block a cherry picker crane to remove the protesters from the trees, Nuss said.
"Today's Day of Action is in solidarity with local landowners struggling to protect their water and land from TransCanada's toxic tar sands pipeline," the protest group said in a written statement Monday.
