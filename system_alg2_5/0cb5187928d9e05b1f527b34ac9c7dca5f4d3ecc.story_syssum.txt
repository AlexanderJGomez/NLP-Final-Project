Cairo (CNN) -- Hundreds of demonstrators extended their sit-in outside Egypt's defense ministry to a sixth day Thursday, as organizers called for mass protests following violence that killed at least 11 people.
The presidential election commission said it had referred leading independent candidate Abdel Monein Aboul Fettouh, Mohamed Mursi, of the Islamist Freedom and Justice Party, and Amr Moussa to the prosecutor for breaking the law by holding meetings on college campuses.
Egypt's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces said on its Facebook page Thursday that the clashes in Abaseya were aimed at delaying the presidential elections and stalling the formation of a constituent assembly.
Two of the presidential candidates referred to the general prosecutor for investigation, Mursi and Fettouh, had announced Wednesday that they were temporarily suspending campaign activities because of the violence.
"The right to peaceful freedom of expression and assembly is integral to Egypt's transition to democracy, and it is crucial at this stage of the presidential election process that it is not threatened by the return of such violence," he said in a statement.
Assailants targeted the protesters in Cairo early Wednesday, medical sources said.
A day before the clashes, state TV broadcast videos showing protesters chanting against the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which has ruled Egypt since Mubarak was forced from power last year.
"There were no riot police or military that tried to evict the sit-in by force," said Gen. Marwan Mustapha, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry.
The military blocked some highways leading to the ministry and did not interfere in the fighting between protesters and the unidentified attackers.
