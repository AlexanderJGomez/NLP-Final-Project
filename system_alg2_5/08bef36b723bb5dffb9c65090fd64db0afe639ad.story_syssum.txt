"But they do not have the right to decide the sovereignty dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom."
For more than a year, renewed rhetoric between Argentina and the United Kingdom over the islands has escalated to a fever pitch, with both sides accusing each other of colonialism.
British officials have rejected Fernandez's call for negotiations, saying the people of the Falkland Islands have chosen to be British and "have a right to self-determination as enshrined in the U.N.
About 1,600 voters from the Falkland Islands were eligible to vote in the referendum, officials said.
Before results were announced, Halford said she didn't think the vote would put an end to Argentina's renewed bid for control of the islands.
