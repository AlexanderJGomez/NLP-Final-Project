(CNN) -- As a child, I thought growing up in a slum near a dumpsite in the Philippines was as normal a life as an ordinary kid can have -- until I mingled with people from different social classes.
I thought of joining a gang to strike back at the bullies.
That mentor guided me and helped me change my perspective about a lot of things.
During those moments, I discovered my responsibility to other people and I slowly developed a heart that has a desire to help and reach out to those who are being bullied and discriminated against.
Our main purpose is the exact opposite of that of the bullies and gang groups -- to care, show love and acceptance by making a small yet significant difference in school, in our family, toward our friends and the people around us, and to use our time, skills, talents, strength and energy in more productive activities.
And, even though we may feel helpless sometimes, there are a lot of things we and others can do to help stop bullying and gang violence.
Education and learning is not the sole responsibility of the school, but a concern of the family and society as well.
