In July 2010, a state law was enacted prohibiting the NYPD from keeping a computer database of the names and personal information of people who were unjustly stopped, questioned or frisked by police officers and were neither arrested nor issued a summons.
"It is a relief to know that my personal information will be cleared from the stop-and-frisk database," said Lino.
"New Yorkers who are the victims of unjustified police stops will no longer suffer the further injustice of having their personal information stored indefinitely in an NYPD database," said NYCLU Executive Director Donna Lieberman.
It also seeks to reform stop-and-frisk under the supervision of a court-appointed monitor.
