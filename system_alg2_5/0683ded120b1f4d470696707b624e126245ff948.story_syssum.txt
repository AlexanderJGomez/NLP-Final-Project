Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- The alleys and archways along Rashid Street in central Tripoli were plunged in darkness this weekend, as the Libyan capital struggled to cope with widespread shortages of electricity.
My father's neighborhood hasn't had electricity for five straight days," said one Libyan man who asked not to be named, for fear of attracting the ire of government authorities.
"Surely a large country like Libya doesn't depend on one power station," the Libyan man said.
Kaim responded by accusing NATO warplanes and Libyan rebels of attacking power stations, high-voltage lines and pipelines.
Since then, oil exports have slowed to a trickle.
Hopes for a reprieve in the fuel shortages were dashed this week when the regime in Tripoli announced rebels somehow seized control of the fuel tanker ship Cartagena off the coast of Malta.
NATO concluded that the ship could proceed to its next port of call Benghazi.
Abdullah said the power outages began within the last two weeks.
"The government is lying and the rebels will be in Tripoli soon," one man said nervously, before quickly walking away.
"Gadhafi not good," said another young man, who smiled at a reporter before he climbed into a car and drove away.
