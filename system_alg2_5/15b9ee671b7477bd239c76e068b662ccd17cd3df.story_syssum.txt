Judge Sonia Sotomayor would be the first Hispanic person to serve on the Supreme Court.
In a sense, she is the Hispanic community's answer to Obama's narrative -- a sign that, as Lopez said, anything is possible in America if a person works hard enough, no matter their race or economic situation.
Her story of battling past obstacles is an inspiration for all Hispanic people, said Roberto Ramirez, president-elect of the Puerto Rican Bar Association.
Ramirez said Latino people have been waiting a long time for a person of Latino descent to be nominated to the court.
"It's here!
The nomination also makes the court a more accurate reflection of America's racial demographics, Ramirez said.
Sotomayor's nomination "helps to create a tapestry of this country that is very reflective of the people who live in it," Ramirez said.
Lopez, the college student in Texas, said she always thought her dream of becoming a prominent Latina attorney was possible.
But Sotomayor's nomination serves as proof, she said.
