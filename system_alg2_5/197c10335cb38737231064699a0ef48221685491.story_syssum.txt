Police are "still actively searching" for Brittany, and believe she and the suspect may be camping in the region, Roanoke County Police Chief Ray Lavinder told reporters.
"As to what relationship Jeff Easley and Brittany may have between them is irrelevant," Lavinder said.
Easley and Brittany are believed to have bought several other items at a Salem, Virginia, Walmart before they disappeared.
Authorities launched a search for the seventh-grader Monday after officers found the body of Brittany's mother, Tina Smith, 41, inside the family's Salem home.
A friend of Brittany Smith told the Roanoke Times that the missing girl called her several weeks ago.
Police are "confident" that the girl is with Easley, Lavinder said.
After finding Tina Smith's body, police soon got information that Brittany Smith's whereabouts were unknown, leading them to issue the statewide alert.
They have asked anyone with information to call 911 or Roanoke County police at 540-777-8641.
