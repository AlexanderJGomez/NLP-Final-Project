The native of Germany who owns a real estate company in the Mexican beach resort says he immediately fell in love with the place.
Temperatures in the mid to upper 80s Fahrenheit (about 30 Celsius), sunny skies, and cool breezes are among the main reasons why countless foreigners have made Acapulco their paradise for decades.
Acapulco, with a population of 1.2 million, had 1,010 violent deaths last year, according to the Acapulco morgue, marking a steady increase from previous years.
Natalie Farmer, a Canadian who owns a time-share condominium and has spent weeks here every year since she was a little girl, has kept coming with her family in children in spite of the violence.
And I think it's safe," says Farmer.
I come every year and it's the best vacation I have," says Dewale.
She says she's concerned about the violence, but is not about to pack her bags anytime soon.
