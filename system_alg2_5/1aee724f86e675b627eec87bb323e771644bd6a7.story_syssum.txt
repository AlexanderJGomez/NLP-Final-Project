Marco Rubio, R-Florida, and Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey.
The good news is that there was bipartisan support; the last time it was put to a vote, in December 2010, a slew of Senate Democrats voted for it, but so did three Senate Republicans -- Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Richard Lugar of Indiana and Bob Bennett of Utah.
The idea was originally shared with me about five months ago by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, who, along with her colleague, Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, was eager to find a way to break the stalemate over the DREAM Act and help get these young people out of legal limbo and on with their lives.
You know who does want to give these students automatic citizenship?
Democrats may think these kids are adorable, but they don't want to adopt them and become known as the "illegal immigrant party."
So what?
There are no good guys and bad guys, just both parties pushing their own interests without caring about what happens to a bunch of undocumented students.
What Rubio has in mind might not be perfect, but it's the only entree on the menu.
A Republican like Rubio has a cultural connection to Democrats like Gutierrez, Menendez and Gonzales.
