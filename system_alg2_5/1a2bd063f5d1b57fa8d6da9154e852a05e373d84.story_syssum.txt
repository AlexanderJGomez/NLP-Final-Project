(CNN) -- The Seattle artist Moxie makes sculptures out of felted wool that are, like her, desperately playful and mad.
Their work is featured in magazines like "Make" and "Craft" and the documentary "Handmade Nation."
Turning airy tresses of bright wool into a flat sheet of felt came easy to her and evoked her sense of play.
"Each poke, you are deciding what the piece will be and mean," she said.
In the last five years I lost both my parents, which is not exactly a tsunami tragedy, but it's powerful stuff when you've had a complicated relationship.
You never stop missing your parents.
What was that about?
That's when I know my piece is working.
...
Moxie: Wool, like every animal hair, has scales up and down each fiber.
Everyone has a context, a history that no one can know like you know your own.
I just believe in the potential of people.
Moxie: More than anything else, I've mastered the ability to ignore the voice in my head that tells me I don't know how to do anything.
Moxie: I can't watch films that are important to me, like any cinematography.
I also love "WTF," because I'm an old-school stand-up comedy nerd and Marc Maron, the host, is really smart and complicatedly broken.
