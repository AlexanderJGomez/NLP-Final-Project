(CNN) -- As many as 100 homes could be affected by flood waters in Wisconsin due to the failure of a 120-year-old sand levee along the Wisconsin River.
Authorities in Portage worked to evacuate residents as the levee approached imminent failure after heavy rainfall soaked the Midwest last week.
"Emergency vehicles including police, fire and EMS will not be able to reach residents," the statement said.
The river at Portage is now expected to stay above flood stage -- 17 feet -- through Wednesday, Beghin said.
But the levee system, built in the 1890s, was constructed from locally available materials -- mostly sand -- "without any engineering design or adherence to any standards," the Natural Resources department said in a statement last week.
"I have never seen the water rage down like it is," CNN iReporter Jason Asselin said.
"Even though some of these rivers have crested ... keep in mind that they're still in flood, so this is going to be a problem for a couple of days," Jeras said.
