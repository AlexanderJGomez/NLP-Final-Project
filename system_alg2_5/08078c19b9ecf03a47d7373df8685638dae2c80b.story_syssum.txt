Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- We had not been in Port-au-Prince in a month, not since those horrible days following the earthquake when the city looked like wreckage.
Then, just after 4:30 a.m. Monday, an aftershock of magnitude 4.75 shook and shook and finally gave a last forceful jerk before stopping.
"When is it going to end?"
Women ran up to the staff asking for food, new tarps and clean water for their children.
That day, women from the ravine had come escorting children who'd been washed with soap and rain water.
No one had eaten fresh food in a week, and the Maison staff brought baby formula and rice.
A missionary worried aloud about a newborn wrapped in plastic whose parents had no formula for the baby's first five days.
No immediate reports of damage were made, but the aftershock sent frightened people once again out into the bug-filled night.
People sleeping outside now feel threatened by the rains, but sleeping inside carries the threat of the seemingly never-ending aftershocks.
Not much to say when a step forward is followed by a big leap back.
