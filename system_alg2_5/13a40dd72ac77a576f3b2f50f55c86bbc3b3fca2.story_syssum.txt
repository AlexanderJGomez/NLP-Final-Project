His comments were just the latest in years of criticism of U.S. gun policies by Mexican officials, who blame weapons trafficking from the United States and the 2004 expiration of the U.S. assault weapons ban for fueling brutal drug violence south of the border.
Mexico will keep pushing for better U.S. gun regulation, he said, noting that an assault weapons ban is one constitutional option.
Most of the weapons used in drug-related violence in Mexico can be traced back to the United States, the group said, citing U.S. government statistics.
That issue surged to the fore in Washington last year, amid a U.S. congressional inquiry into "Operation Fast and Furious," an operation run by U.S. federal agents.
Americans on the other side of the border were the intended audience for the English-language sign, then-President Felipe Calderon said at the time, saying an increase in violence in Mexico was directly connected with the 2004 expiration of the U.S. assault weapons ban.
