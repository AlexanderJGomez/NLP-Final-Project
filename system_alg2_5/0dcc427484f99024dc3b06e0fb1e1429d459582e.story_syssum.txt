Babylon, Iraq (CNN)ISIS has smashed priceless ancient statues in Mosul, bulldozed the ruins of Nineveh and Hatra, and dynamited centuries-old churches, mosques and shrines.
"This wasn't Saddam's," said Adnan Abu Fatima.
Why?"
Why did you do that?"
Baghdad's museum was plundered, during a lapse in U.S. security, and the priceless artifacts were smuggled around the world.
Iraq will defend its heritage against ISIS, said Mohamed Hattab from Iraq's Antiquities Department.
It's a soul under assault by latter day barbarians, who have destroyed much of it in the North, which has been out of the defensive reach of Iraqi soldiers.
It was a piece of history they were glad to part with.
