(CNN) -- "You've got to save your best leadership for home."
I'm on my way home," she said after school was dismissed early, and parents were rushing to get their children.
We stayed in constant contact as she inched along the 6-mile stretch of state highway leading her home.
Midnight approached and my wife told me she hadn't been able to move the car at all since 10 p.m.
I called Georgia State Patrol and explained to them that my wife and kids were stranded in a vehicle among hundreds of other vehicles.
I called local authorities and was told the same thing.
On Facebook, I posted: "More than 14 and a half hours, my wife and kids remain stranded in car stuck in traffic because of snow.
It was so, so cold and she couldn't keep the engine running all night for fear of running out of gas.
I felt so guilty about it all.
I told them if police couldn't get my family , it was time for me to try.
She said she didn't think I could get to her.
Against advice of the local and state authorities, I'm going to try."
I moved my wife's car into the median and left it there not knowing or caring when the traffic would start to move.
I was leading my family home.
