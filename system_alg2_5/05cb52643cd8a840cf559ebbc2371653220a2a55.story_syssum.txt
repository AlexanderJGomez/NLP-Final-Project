"I wanted to prove that I was whole, and one of the ways to do that was to learn to surf," Cummings said.
The nonprofit, volunteer-run organization is dedicated to teaching people with disabilities, most of them veterans, how to surf -- for free.
"We want to inspire them to move on and just be active and live full lives," said Cummings, 40.
Seventy percent of participants are veterans.
But the clinics aren't just about surfing, Cummings said.
Doctors told Davis he had a 99 percent chance of never walking again and a 60 percent chance he'd never get out of his wheelchair.
"Surfing makes me feel like I'm flying," Davis said.
"I'm missing my leg and there are days I don't want to get out of bed," Cummings said.
For Cummings, AmpSurf will always be about more than just surfing; it's about happiness, not just for the participants, but for him and his volunteers.
