President Obama's decision to target militants from ISIS -- which is now calling itself the "Islamic State" or "IS" -- operating in Iraq comes as a huge relief to the Iranians.
At first, there was nothing but silence in Tehran as U.S. F-18s on Friday began to target ISIS militants.
This was the first time since the U.S .airstrikes began that a senior Iranian official has spoken in such terms.
Tehran and Washington don't just agree on the need for airstrikes against ISIS.
They are also in agreement that Iraq above all needs a new political leadership and that Prime Minister Maliki has to go.
For Shia Iran, the fight against the extremists from the Islamic State is a critical threat.
There are reports the Iranian military is engaged in supporting Kurdish Peshmerga forces against ISIS militants.
As far as the U.S. role in combating the Islamic State is concerned, the Iranian debate is likely to remain split between the moderates and the hawks.
But all the recent trends suggest that the moderate viewpoint in Tehran has the upper hand on the policy question of Iraq and how Iran can best serve its interests.
