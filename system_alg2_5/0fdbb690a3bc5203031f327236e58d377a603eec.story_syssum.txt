OP to RS: Angel please don't say a thing to anyone.
RS to OP: There are a lot of things that could make us both feel like s**t.
OP to RS: I do appreciate it.
RS to OP: I certainly have never been a prude and I've had fun but all innocent and without harmful repercussions.
I feel sick that you suggested that and that you made a scene at the table and made us leave early.
You really have dated a lot of people yet you get upset if I mention ONE funny story with a long term boyfriend.
SO upset.
I am the girl who let go with u even when I was scared out of my mind to.
Do this don't do that.
Be happy and make someone SO happy.
OP to RS: I want to talk to you.
I was upset that you just left me after we got food to go talk to a guy and I was standing right behind you watching you touch his arm and ignore me.
I'm sorry I asked you to stop tapping my neck yesterday, I know you were just trying to show me love.
I also knew people there tonight and whilst you were having one or two pics taken I was saying goodbye to the people in my industry and Fitz wanted a photo with me.
I thought it would make a difference in us getting out without you getting harassed anymore.
I'm a person too and I appreciate that you invited me out tonight and I realize that you get harassed but I am trying my best to make you happy and I feel as though you sometimes never are, no matter the effort I put in.
