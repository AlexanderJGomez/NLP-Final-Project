More than 400 years later, astronomers have in a sense dwarfed that discovery with a similar first.
But this is the first one astronomers have observed outside of our solar system, they said.
The rings of planet J1407b eclipse its light.
Like its system of rings, planet J1407b is also much larger than Saturn, said astrophysicist Eric Mamajek, whose team at the University of Rochester discovered the object.
It is called a brown dwarf, a size classification somewhere between a planet and a star, according to the California Institute of Technology.
