Washington (CNN) -- A Salvadoran national recently added to the FBI's 10 Most Wanted Fugitives list for allegedly committing a 2011 murder in Colorado is under arrest, the FBI announced Wednesday.
Rivera Gracias was in the United States allegedly illegally at the time of the Limon murder.
Rivera Gracias was added to the FBI's Top 10 list on March 14 and at that time law enforcement officials said they believed he had fled to his native country.
In Wednesday's announcement the FBI said "further reward information will not be made public."
Alleged Boston mob figure James "Whitey" Bulger spent more than a decade on the list and ultimately was captured in June 2011 in Santa Monica, California.
