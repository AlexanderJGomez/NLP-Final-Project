Radar data from air traffic control can provide tracking data that will indicate the flight path, altitude and direction the A320-200 followed.
With Malaysia 370, radar data was sketchy; satellite data has been the primary source in determining the track and thus the search area.
On occasion, deviating around storm activity becomes a matter of determining the path that has a lower probability of turbulence encounters.
And let's not be misled by the reported request of Flight 8501 asking air traffic control for a higher altitude.
But there may be other contributing factors to the possible loss of AirAsia Flight 8501.
Perhaps a high altitude stall occurred and the airplane never recovered.
Regardless of any speculation, it is much too early for theories.
