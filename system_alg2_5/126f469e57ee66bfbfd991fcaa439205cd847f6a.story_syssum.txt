"It was a nightmare," said Joseph, who was then 23 years old and later found it nearly impossible to find where her daughter's remains were buried.
"For years and years, I didn't even know where to look," she said.
"For 33 years, I've been trying to find where my child is," said Joseph, who said her baby's official burial records were missing.
Hunt suspected Joseph's child was buried on Hart Island despite the incomplete records.
She is also founder of The Hart Island Project, a nonprofit organization largely dedicated to informing the public of the island's inhabitants.
But in Gotham, where some 50,000 deaths are reported each year, about 1,200 unknowns are buried on Hart Island, according to New York's Department of Correction.
But until that happens, those like Joseph and New Jersey resident Lisa-Michele Russo have turned to Hunt and her website for help.
"It wasn't something that my parents liked to talk about," said the now 38-year-old Blairstown resident.
Using Anthony's death certificate, Hunt again petitioned city officials to arrange a visit to the island for the baby's now-adult sister.
"We do our best to accommodate every legitimate request," said Department of Correction spokeswoman Sharman Stein, who noted that in most cases, family members must first provide documentation proving that their loved ones are buried on the island before they visit.
"She is helping so many people and she doesn't know any of us," Russo said of Hunt.
Hunt, who sustains the Hart Island Project largely through donations and sales of her documentary and artwork, says she's recently received a grant from the state's Council on the Arts to create a "posthumous Wiki" -- a user-generated database of stories, photos and information about those on Hart Island.
