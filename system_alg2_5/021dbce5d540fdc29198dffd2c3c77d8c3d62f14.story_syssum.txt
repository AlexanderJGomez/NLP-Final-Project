Though it sounds like behavior at one of the health care town hall meetings last month, it was how some Republicans reacted to President Obama's speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday night.
The most memorable moment came from Rep. Joe Wilson, R-South Carolina, who shouted "You lie" after the president said that a Democratic-sponsored health care bill would not cover illegal immigrants.
"I think a lot of those Republican members went home to their district and were met with very angry reaction from their constituents.
"I think he feels the way a lot of people in South Carolina feel about [health care reform].
"Rep. Wilson, however, held a town hall meeting in Columbia where, for the most part, there was a pretty reasoned debate," he added.
Unlikely, according to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Pelosi said Thursday that there is a procedure that could have been implemented to strike Wilson's "lie" comment from the record.
It's time for us to talk about health care and not Mr. Wilson," she said.
During the 2008 election, when support for Democrats and Obama was high, Wilson faced a tough slog against Miller.
Ornstein added that Wilson's comment was an "incredibly dumb thing to do" for the broader picture of the Republican Party.
