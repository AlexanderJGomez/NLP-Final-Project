There's the surveillance photo that the FBI says shows him carrying a backpack among the people who thronged the finish line of last year's Boston Marathon -- a backpack that federal agents say held one of the bombs that killed three people and maimed more than 200, severing limbs from many of them.
As the dignitaries and the survivors and the rescuers gathered in Boston on Tuesday afternoon to mark the anniversary of the bombing, Tsarnaev was sitting in a cell on a former Army installation about 35 miles away.
Even if the defense can convince the jury that most of the blame lies with Tsarnaev's dead brother, "They still have to deal with several people being killed and many other people being injured for no reason that would make sense to just about anybody, other than someone who was mentally ill or believed in terrorism," Tabak said.
Investigators say the Tsarnaev brothers tried to bolt from Boston after the FBI released their pictures on April 18, killing a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer in the process.
The government responded last week that it has no evidence agents ever tried to recruit Tamerlan.
FBI agents checked out the tip, found no information linking Tamerlan to terrorism and asked the Russians to let them know if they had anything else to support their claims, according to an inspector general's report released last week.
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's lawyers might be able to spare their client's life if they can show jurors that Tamerlan held "an unusual sway" over his brother, Tabak said.
And in Boston, a grim anniversary will soon give way to another year's marathon.
