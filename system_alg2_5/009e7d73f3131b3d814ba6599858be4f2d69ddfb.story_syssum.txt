(CNN) -- Investigators probably will have to use dental records to identify some of the eight people who were killed in a wreck involving a church bus and two other vehicles in eastern Tennessee, a Tennessee Highway Patrol official said Thursday.
Eight people were killed: Six on the eastbound bus; one of three occupants of the SUV, and the tractor-trailer driver, the Tennessee Highway Patrol said.
Twelve of the hospitalized victims -- including the two in critical condition -- are church members, Cruz said Thursday morning.
Miller said it wasn't clear exactly what happened to the bus tire, other than it malfunctioned or failed in some way.
