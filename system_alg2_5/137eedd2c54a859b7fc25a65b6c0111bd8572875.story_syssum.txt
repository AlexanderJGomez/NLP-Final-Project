The New Zealand-based Fonterra Group said Saturday that three batches of its whey protein tested positive for the Clostridium botulinum bacteria.
But in an update on its website, the New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries clarified that Chinese authorities had suspended imports of Fonterra-produced Whey Powder and Dairy Base powder, while also increasing inspection and supervision of New Zealand dairy products.
The infection can result in paralysis and respiratory failure, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health.
The company involved, Sanlu Group, was partially owned by Fonterra.
