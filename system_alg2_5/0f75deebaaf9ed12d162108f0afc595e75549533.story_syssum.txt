Russia maximized its deliveries of men and arms to East Ukraine in August and September to coincide with one peak of the crisis in Iraq.
Ukrainian President Poroshenko's speech to Congress in September was interrupted by applause 40 times, but his barbed remark that Ukraine "cannot win a war with blankets" only produced $53 million in non-lethal aid.
And Russia's entire modus operandi, of which its current actions in Ukraine are only the most visible part, is not only a challenge to the European order, but a challenge that is dangerously exploiting the many existing problems within the EU.
Russia also wants Ukraine to fail.
And if Ukraine does fail to transform itself, it will be only one in a string of dysfunctional states ringing the EU.
All of Russia's neighbors, friend and foe, are worried.
Ukraine also has a humanitarian crisis; the official estimate for IDPs by the UNHCR was already 445,000 by 10 November.
Russia has been causing problems within the EU for years.
Russia did not create anti-EU parties of the left and right, or nationalist movements against EU nation-states, or the post-modern cynicism common among European youth.
Specific propaganda messages about Russia or Ukraine are then buried in the post-modern melange.
