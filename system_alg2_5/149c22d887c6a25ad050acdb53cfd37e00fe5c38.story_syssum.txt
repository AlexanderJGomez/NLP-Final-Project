It apparently stems from Lohan's 2007 convictions for drunken driving, police said Friday.
Lohan "has the right to appear" at the hearing, said Alan Parachini, Los Angeles Superior Court spokesman.
The first arrest, in May 2007, came after Lohan lost control of her Mercedes-Benz convertible and struck a curb in Beverly Hills.
A judge sentenced Lohan to three years probation after she entered guilty and no contest pleas to the charges.
