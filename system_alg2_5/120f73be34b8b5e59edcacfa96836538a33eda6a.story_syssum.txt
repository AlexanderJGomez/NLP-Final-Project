BAE said Thursday it is working with American Airlines to put laser systems on the planes, which will be flying between New York and California.
Homeland Security officials say there is no specific threat of these weapons -- also known as MANPADS, for Man-Portable Air Defense Systems --  being fired at planes.
Taliban forces, however, successfully used MANPADS against Soviet helicopters in Afghanistan.
The airline believes protection is best accomplished by preventing terrorists from getting shoulder-fired missiles, or by using ground-based systems, spokesman John Hotard said.
