In the Hackney area of east London, gangs attacked a police car and shops.
In Lewisham in south London, a car was set afire.
There was no obvious sign of violence at the station but a policewoman told CNN it was not safe for people to go near the station.
The commission divulged neither who shot Duggan nor why police had stopped the cab, with the incident still under investigation.

Looting also occurred in pockets of Enfield, next to Tottenham, in north London.
"This is not about the black community and the police, it's about young people and the police," said Shaun Bailey, a youth worker, in a statement circulated by the mayor's office.

Police say they have evidence that some of the rioting was coordinated using social media, including Twitter.
Like the current violence, a protest outside Tottenham Police Station sparked the 1985 conflict.
