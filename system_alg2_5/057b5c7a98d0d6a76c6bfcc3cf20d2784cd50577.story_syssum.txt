But instead of doing all of that for basketball, these same students should say the heck with the games and put their energy, zeal and passion into two fundamental issues posing the most dramatic barriers to their college education: the rising cost of tuition and the lack of financial aid.
But marching and demanding a rollback of student tuition is just one front of the battle that students in college and high school should be waging.
Reining in this perk for the banks won't lower the cost of college, but it will make it easier for many students or parents to pay for it.
There are some grass-roots organizations fighting the banks, such as the United States Students Association, but they are going up against entrenched interests, and some of those are university officials.
Four students at North Carolina A&T decided they'd had enough of the segregated lunch counters in downtown Greensboro.
And back.
If these banks are fighting against your best interests, they don't deserve your account.
Instead of talking about the latest celebrity news, use online media to galvanize and build a national movement.
If they are still in session, come up with a list of legislators not fighting rising tuition or who are in the pockets of Sallie Mae and the banks.
But if tuition keeps going up and less money is available in the form of financial aid, you'll be cheering from afar because you won't be able to keep going to that school.
The time for action is now.
