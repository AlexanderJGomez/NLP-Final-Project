The mass killing near Santa Barbara, California, has prompted a proposal to create a "gun violence restraining order" that would temporarily bar a mentally unstable person from buying and possessing firearms after family, partners or friends call police.
"It is not intrusive if the judge still has discretion over the matter at the end of the day," Williams said of the proposed law.
Williams was apparently referring to how a mental health agency had been concerned about Elliot Rodger, 22, the suspected killer in the weekend killings.
The legislation has a chance of being approved in California, Robbins said.
