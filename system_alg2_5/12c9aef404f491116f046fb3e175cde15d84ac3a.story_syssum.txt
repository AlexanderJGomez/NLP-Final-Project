Supporting Small Trades also means supporting factory owner Gary Pleam, whose great-great grandfather built a water wheel in 1873 to power the hat factory that became Mohnton Mills in 1906.
Today, Deysher is the sewing floor supervisor who "makes everything work," Pleam said.
Small Trades is just one brand that will be featured on Zady, a shopping site launching this week dedicated to fashion transparency.
"People care about where their clothes come from, and they want to know the story behind the label."
A series of deadly incidents in the past year in overseas garment factories prompted widespread outrage and calls for companies to improve conditions and oversight.
Co-founders Darabi and Maxine Bédat say they are targeting people like themselves, style-conscious and socially aware shoppers who have outgrown their trendy wardrobe of cheaply made goods.
"We've seen through the whole farm-to-table movement that people care about where their food comes from," she said.
Zady is just one brand that's trying to tell the stories of where clothes come from.
Everlane founder Michael Preysman said "radical transparency" was the company's philosophy from the start, and it established a pattern of transparent pricing, listing costs and markups for each of Everlane's bags, shirts and belts.
Some call it slow fashion, ethical fashion or conscious consumerism.
This month, Bédat and Darabi piled into a car with Small Trades founder Robin Weiss to visit Mohnton Knitting Mills.
Dressed in clothing and jewelry from Zady's partner brands, including Small Trades shirts, they greeted owner Gary Pleam outside the main office, where a 1950 black-and-white picture of the mill's staff hangs.
The last good year was 1998, Pleam said.
If Pleam could do it again, he'd do it all the same, he said, because business was good most of the time, and they've had a lot of laughs at work, staff picnics and Friday hot dog lunches.
"It just gives us our drive and motivation to make Zady work."
