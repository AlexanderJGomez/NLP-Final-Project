(CNN) -- Explorer Dennis Schmitt found an island nearly two years ago near Greenland.
"One [was] that this was going to be significant because it was going to be an example of climate change."
Many climatologists and scientists say arctic ice melt and other changes in the Earth's climate are the result of an increase in the world's temperature, a trend widely called global warming.
The average surface temperature has warmed one degree Fahrenheit (0.6 degrees Celsius) during the last century, according to the National Research Council.
There are several possible reasons for the warming, scientists say.
"For the last 30 years, there's no way there's anything natural that can explain it," Stephen Schneider, a professor of environmental studies at Stanford University in California, said.
Many scientific organizations share Schneider's view, ranging from the national academies of the countries that comprise the G8 to the National Research Council, the American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union.
Since then, there's been a few tenths of global warming, so we're proclaiming global warming."
Asked about glacial melt, which many observers point to as evidence of global warming, Lindzen said the way glaciers change and move are phenomena largely unexplained.
"We don't know what's going on up there.
"Exactly how much it's going to warm up, we don't know," Schneider said.
