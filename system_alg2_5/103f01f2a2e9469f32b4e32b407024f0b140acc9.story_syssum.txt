Edward Snowden's father expressed satisfaction Wednesday with the way his son, the former National Security Agency contractor, has been treated since being granted asylum in August.
Though Russia granted Edward Snowden a one-year asylum, "that could easily be extended," said his father, who described Moscow as modern and sophisticated.
He added that he did not know where his son was living.
Snowden's father: 'I know my son.
"So many people are so determined in the media to continue to refer to him as a leaker," Lon Snowden said.
The reunion came after times when Lon Snowden said he had not expected to see his son ever again.
"Nobody questions the decision that he has made, because he would be locked in a dark hole at this point, which certain people would love."
