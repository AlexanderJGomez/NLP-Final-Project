(CNN) -- American Airlines will cancel more flights from its daily schedule through mid-November.
Some American customers are starting to book flights on other airlines.
Carl Jackson, a representative of the Allied Pilots Association, told CNN on Thursday as several dozen American pilots conducted an informational picket at Washington's Reagan National Airport.
Although American management and pilots resumed negotiations last week, the three major American employee unions have already reached conditional agreement with US Airways, should a merger of the two airlines take place.
