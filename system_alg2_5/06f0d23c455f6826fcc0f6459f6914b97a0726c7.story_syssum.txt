Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A judge has delayed the preliminary hearing for Dr. Conrad Murray, charged in Michael Jackson's death, until early next year because more investigation is being done and some prosecution witnesses won't be available until then.
Murray is charged with involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death, which the Los Angeles County coroner ruled was from an overdose of propofol, a powerful anesthesia used to put surgical patients to sleep.
"This is bulls--t."
Jackson fans have organized protests at each hearing, taunting Murray as he enters and departs the courthouse.
