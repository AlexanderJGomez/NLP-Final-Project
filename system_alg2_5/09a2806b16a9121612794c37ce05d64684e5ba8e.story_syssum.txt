I said it was economic, but political in the sense that you have a political party -- the GOP -- entrenched with the wealthy and Wall Street while doing nothing to protect middle-class America.
It is personal.
Did our CEOs really get 5 times better than they were in 1980 and our workers remain just ho-hum average?
When there is this kind of disparity while these same CEOs are paying taxes at a rate lower than their secretaries, their receptionists, and the people who clean their offices, it is personal.
This week, we see banks tacking on extra fees -- which, contrary to what they argue, would lead them to 13% more in profits than they were making before the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act went into effect.
It is personal.
Are Republicans really advocating that the greed of Wall Street be put before the needs of the American people?
They do.
Critics scream "class warfare," and decry the attacks on the "job creators," and cry "socialism" as they continue to preserve this unjust system that is giving rise to what could be a powerful and sustained movement.
Class warfare?
Who are they?
With all this taken together, is it any wonder that our masses could be giving rise to our own "spring"?
Not economic, not political, but personal.
