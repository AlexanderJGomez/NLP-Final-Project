Most of the injured are being transported to San Antonio's Brooke Army Medical Center and University Hospital, Cavazos said.
Although it was not immediately clear whether others were taken elsewhere, Wiley said that University Health System and Brooke Army Medical Center are the two trauma centers in San Antonio and would receive patients in situations such as Tuesday's crash.
Maureen Richmond, a spokeswoman for Greyhound, said that 40 people were on board the bus, which left San Antonio shortly before 9 a.m. for Matamoros, Mexico.
