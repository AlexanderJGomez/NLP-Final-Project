(CNN) -- Myanmar announced Tuesday it will grant amnesty to 6,300 prisoners on Wednesday, one in a series of recent moves that could help the isolated nation normalize relations with Western nations including the United States.
"What's very clear is that (President) Thein Sein is willing to make more concessions in order to get sanctions lifted and get more international legitimacy," Farmaner said.
Since Myanmar's elections in November 2010 -- the first in two decades -- its leaders have been gingerly reaching out to critics.
Tint Swe, the head of Myanmar's state censorship, called Friday for greater press freedoms, saying his own office should be shuttered as part of government reforms, reported Radio Free Asia.
Myanmar and Western nations have been at odds for years because of Myanmar rulers' ongoing clampdown on their political foes, most notably Suu Kyi.
Farmaner of Burma Campaign UK said the government's talks with Suu Kyi are also about self-preservation.
"It's important to them," Kurlantzick said.
Until they are included in dialogue, he said, Myanmar cannot make progress.
Lift some sanctions if you want to send a message of encouragement, he said.
