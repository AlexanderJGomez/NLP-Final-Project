Patriotic members of the Canadian Parliament stood up to political correctness last week by declaring that Canada will not tolerate an influx of zombies.
Canada's zombie preparedness means one thing for us: Zombies will be driven out of Canada and into the United States.
Why?
!
Sorry, Max and Hollywood: Zombies don't need a hug; they need a swift kick out of our country.
Plus, keep in mind that if even only a few zombies make it over the border, these "anchor zombies" will create more and more zombies.
How long after that do you think it will be until these people argue that zombies should be covered under Obamacare?!
Brooks and I did agree that we need the federal government to respond to the dangers posed by an influx of zombies.
I see these zombies for what they truly are: un-American.
If not, then I hope the Rosetta Stone starts teaching us how to speak zombie, because we are all going to need it.
