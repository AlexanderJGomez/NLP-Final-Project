(CNN) -- The recently renewed violence in the Mideast claimed more lives Sunday as Israeli strikes killed at least 16 people in Gaza and a Hamas attack on a border crossing wounded four Israeli civilians.
One civilian was moderately wounded and three were injured, the IDF said, without elaborating on their conditions.
At least 117 rockets were fired at Israel on Sunday, the IDF said via its Twitter account.

The United Nations, which runs many schools in Gaza, said 500,000 children were unable to begin classes on Sunday.
Also Sunday, the Israeli military said rockets from Syria hit various locations through the Golan Heights.
Israel has waged an offensive in Gaza against the militant Palestinian group Hamas and the stream of rockets fired into Israel from Gaza.
Hamas is urging Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to go before the International Criminal Court to prosecute Israeli leaders for war crimes.
Hamas' announcement comes a day after one of the group's leaders admitted that its militants were responsible for the abduction of three Israeli teens in the West Bank in June.
