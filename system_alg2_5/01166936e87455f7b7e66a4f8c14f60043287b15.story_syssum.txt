"Yes, it is for sure, the promoter will not get a permit to hold the concert," National Police spokesman Saud Usman Nasution said Tuesday.
Newspaper reports said more than 25,000 tickets were sold in the first two hours after the concert went on sale in March.
Police said the promoter should not have started selling tickets before getting a permit.
He also advocated a boycott of the show's sponsor, Hyundai Card, in addition to Hyundai Motor Co., Korea's largest automaker.
