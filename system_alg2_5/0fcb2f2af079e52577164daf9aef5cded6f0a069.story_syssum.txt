Now that the government has shut down, the institute can still use existing resources to continue Hubble operations for as long as possible.
Safe mode means orienting the delicate instruments away from the sun while keeping the solar panels illuminated, to make sure no instrument loses power and is ruined.
That means each week the government is shut down could cost dozens to hundreds of critical astronomical observations.
If the shutdown lasts more than a few weeks, the JWST instrument module will have to be warmed up, probably pushing the launch date forward by a few months and raising the cost commensurately (about $1 million per day).
To check on the number of satellites that might be affected by the shutdown, this author tried to access a NASA website, only to see the following message: "Due to the lapse in federal government funding, this website is not available.
But as for Hubble, if there is any kind of glitch, federal civil servants will be essential to the recovery of rover operations.
The government shutdown means they are forbidden to do any work.
For the past few weeks, we've had intensive discussions with colleagues around the world about the science this telescope will be able to do.
We are all waiting.
