(CNN) -- A Pennsylvania Methodist minister who was defrocked this week for performing a same-sex wedding said Friday he felt compelled to break church doctrine because it was an "act of love" for his son.
So he was upfront with church officials.
On Thursday, the minister at Zion United Methodist Church of Iona in the small town of Lebanon was found guilty in a church trial for officiating his son's same-sex wedding, church officials said.
The church asked Schaefer to decide whether his advocacy on behalf of the gay community would prevent him from fully complying with church law, according to a statement from Bishop Peggy Johnson of the United Methodist Church.
He refused again, forcing church officials to defrock him.
I never thought this would ever come back after that long of a time, so I went on ministering.
This really had nothing to do with you.'
The minister said that his views on homosexuality have evolved over the years.
"By the time my son came out, I would describe myself as tolerant," he said.
He said he has already filed an appeal and hopes to become reinstated to the Methodist clergy.
