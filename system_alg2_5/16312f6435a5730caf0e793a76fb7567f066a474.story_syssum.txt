London (CNN)British Prime Minister David Cameron formally asked Queen Elizabeth II to dissolve his country's Parliament on Monday, opening the way for campaigning ahead of the May 7 general election.
"The next Prime Minister walking through that door will be me or (Labour Party leader) Ed Miliband," he said.
Cameron and his Conservative Party won the last election in 2010, but not by enough to go into government alone.
For five years, Cameron has been governing in coalition with the UK's third party, the Liberal Democrats.
It is unclear how UKIP will perform in the May 7 UK general election.
"The general election on May 7 is a fantastic opportunity for Scotland to make Westminster sit up and take notice," Sturgeon said Monday.
