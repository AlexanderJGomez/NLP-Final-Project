In a country where bleaching creams are frequently used to chemically lighten skin tone, one savvy entrepreneur is fighting against the disfiguring practice.
Alhaji Mustapha Oti Boateng: I started with Chocho cream -- the natural skin restorer and beauty soap.
AB: My father was a herbalist and my grandfather was a herbalist I tried to recall all those things that when I was young they sent me to the bush to collect.
CNN: Then after the printing press, came a stint in Japan...
I came back with about five buses and started a transport business, but unfortunately for me it was all accidents, one after the other.
So I decided that this work, I can't do it for long because if age caught up with me I can't go to the bush to carry those food stuffs, so I decided to try another thing.
Has it been an easy ride?
AB: I'm not educated but I'm always happy when I see children in school.
You know here in Africa, it's not all people who get [the] opportunity to go to school.
We can always educate ourselves wherever we go.
