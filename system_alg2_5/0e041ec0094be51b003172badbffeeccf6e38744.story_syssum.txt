While the administration has made some efforts to respond to humanitarian crises elsewhere in the world -- the U.S. joined NATO in its successful mission to assist Libyan rebels, military advisers have been sent to Uganda to combat the Lord's Resistance Army and to Jordan to help Syrian rebels -- full-scale military intervention in Syria does not appear to be on the table.
We analyzed public opinion polls and congressional votes during four episodes of humanitarian intervention -- Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia and Kosovo -- and found, as recent debates seems to suggest, humanitarian intervention is mired in the mundane world of politics.
The public is generally supportive of humanitarian missions.
Humanitarian intervention is most likely when the U.S. president enjoys a majority in Congress.
This does not mean, however, that humanitarian intervention will only occur when a president enjoys a majority in Congress.
Congress was similarly bypassed in October 2011 when the administration deployed military advisers to Uganda.
