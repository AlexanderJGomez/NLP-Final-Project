Thirty-six officers from the Tucson, Arizona, Police Department are in Pittsburgh as part of the G-20 security force.
"There's a standardization in training," Tucson Lt. Paul Sayre said.
"We're excited to be here.
The additional help protecting downtown locations "gives Pittsburgh the flexibility to send its officers where needed," Sayre said.
