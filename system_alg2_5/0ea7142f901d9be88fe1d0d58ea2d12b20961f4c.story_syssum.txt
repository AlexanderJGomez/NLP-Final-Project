GARDINER, Montana (CNN)  -- More than half of Yellowstone National Park's bison herd has died since last fall, forcing the government to suspend its annual slaughter program.
Government officials say the slaughter prevents the spread of the disease brucellosis from the Yellowstone bison to cattle on land near the park.
"The plan requires all of us to do two things: protect a viable wild bison population and reduce the risk of transmission of brucellosis from bison to cattle.
There is no documented case of the disease passing from bison to cattle, they said.
Yellowstone is the only place in the lower 48 states where a bison population has persisted since prehistoric times, according to the Park Service.
"Bison are bison.
Bison are looking for food.
Control of the bison population is essential, Davis said.

"It becomes a private property issue," said Davis, who has never had a bison encroach on his ranch.
Federal and state officials said last week they will lease private land bordering the park where up to 100 bison eventually will be allowed to graze during the winter.
"The reality of the situation is that whether you have 4,000 bison or whether you have 200 bison, bison are a nomadic species and they will always be looking out to the horizon and expanding their boundaries," said Tim Reid, chief deputy ranger at Yellowstone.
"The Yellowstone bison population is healthy, it's strong, it's vibrant.
