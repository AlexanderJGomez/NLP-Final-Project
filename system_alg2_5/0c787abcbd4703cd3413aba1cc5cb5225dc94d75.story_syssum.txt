MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- Mexico's tourism director on Wednesday downplayed the risk of violence facing tourists, despite warnings for travelers to think twice about visiting the country.
"Much more significant is the reduction [in travel to Mexico] because of the financial crisis."
"The situation in Ciudad Juarez is of special concern," the alert said.
"I think that, if there is a big problem in Mexico, they [students] should go somewhere else, because you never know what is going to happen," said Nereida Solis, a student.
I can't comment much, but if people want to go, people are going to go."
