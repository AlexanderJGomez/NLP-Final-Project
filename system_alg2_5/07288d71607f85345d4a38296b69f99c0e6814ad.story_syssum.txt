"22 Jump Street" was the big winner, grossing an estimated $60 million its opening frameâ€”a massive 65% higher than the original's $36.3 million in 2012.
It even topped last weekend's two debuts, outgrossing the Tom Cruise-starrer "Edge of Tomorrow," which lost only 44% of its traffic in its sophomore session, coming in at an estimated $16 million.
It earned an estimated $15.7 million for a 10-day total of $81.7 million.
