"I had this chair brought up from my condo in Florida," says Bricker.
What brought Bricker here was a job with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the second politically-appointed position the onetime homemaker says she accepted.

General Manager Bobby Bellinger was the first person Bricker saw when she awoke in her hospital bed.
"If I've set a goal, I'm going to reach it, she says."
I'm not a sitter."
