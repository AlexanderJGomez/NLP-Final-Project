Jos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Tensions ran high in the central Nigerian city of Jos on Sunday in the aftermath of an explosion outside a Catholic church that left six people dead, according to hospital and government officials.
After the explosion, youths took over a roadblock on the street leading to the church, and an agitated crowd of residents upset with the violence gathered nearby to talk with Jang.
"We all must be calm and we all must leave things in the hands of God who knows why he has allowed this to happen."
In a statement issued by his spokesman, Jonathan urged residents to refrain from reprisal attacks.
