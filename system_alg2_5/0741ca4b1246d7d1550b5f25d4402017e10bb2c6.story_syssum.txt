For a company that hasn't attended CES since 1992, Apple dominates the show.
The biggest reason for this is, of course, Apple's dominating presence in the consumer electronic space.
"We know that Apple is doing well," said Howard Cheng, Just Mobile's director of operations.
"Apple owners have a demonstrated willingness to spend for accessories, cases, and other customizations," Govin said.
In the three years since the iLounge Pavilion launched, the space has quadrupled to 120,000 square feet, all but taking over an entire hall and pushing the automotive industry into another space.
Meng said that it doesn't matter that Apple isn't at CES with a booth or keynote, because CES is already the most successful and popular show for companies like his.
Just Mobile already has eight products in the Apple Store and uses CES to expand into the international market and meet clients.
With Microsoft dropping out, CES is losing even more of its sizzle.
But the fact remains that Apple and its products are the widely seen, and discussed, at CES.
