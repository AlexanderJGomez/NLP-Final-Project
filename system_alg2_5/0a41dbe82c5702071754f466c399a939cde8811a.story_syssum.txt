(CNN)  -- Manchester City crushed Aston Villa 4-0 with Mario Balotelli scoring a hat-trick to go temporarily top of the English Premier League ahead of city rivals Manchester United's 1-1 draw at Birmingham later Tuesday.
Balotelli scored his second from close range before the break and completed his hat-trick in the second half with his second successful penalty after Johnson was fouled by Marc Alrighton.
Kalinic blotted his copybook by being sent off for a wild challenge in the second half, but it was the first win for new manager Steve Kean, who took over from the sacked Sam Allardyce.
In Tuesday's evening kickoff, West Ham missed the chance to move out of the bottom three when they were held 1-1 at home by Everton.
