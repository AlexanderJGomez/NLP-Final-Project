Sergio Aguero's second half strike was enough to give Manchester City a closely fought 1-0 victory over a Manchester United side that played the majority of this tense match with ten men after Chris Smalling was sent off late in the first period.
"It's a special moment to win against Manchester United."
City's recent dominance in this fixture now makes the big spending "noisy neighbors" accusation once leveled by former United manager Alex Ferguson seem a long time ago.
When Smalling was sent off, after picking up a second booking for a lunging tackle on James Milner that Van Gaal later described as "not very smart," it looked like the lively Argentine would find more space against United's depleted back line.
City still created chances of their own, however.
Jesus Navas cracked the upright after a clever through ball from Toure while Stevan Jovetic made De Gea work after shooting from the edge of the box.
