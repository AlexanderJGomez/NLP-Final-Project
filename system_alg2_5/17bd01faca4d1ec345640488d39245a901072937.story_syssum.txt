(CNN)A St. Louis man has filed a lawsuit alleging excessive force in a case that involves an officer turning off a dashcam that was recording the man's arrest.
They did.
Bufford was also ordered to exit the vehicle, but he refused and became increasingly agitated, according to the report.
An attorney representing the city and the police department defended the officers' actions in the arrest, while condemning the officer who turned off the dashcam, which is against department policy.
The officer who shut off the dashcam video was referred to an internal affairs department, Calvert said.
When we saw that an officer had violated that policy, it was very disappointing," he said.
According to a statement from St. Louis prosecutor Jennifer M. Joyce, the "action of turning off the dash camera video diminished the evidentiary merits of the case."
