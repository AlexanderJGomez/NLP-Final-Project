Rick Perry and others are lashing out at President Barack Obama's decision not to tour border facilities overwhelmed by a flood of undocumented children, saying the U.S. leader needs to see with his own eyes what both sides agree is a humanitarian crisis.
Both Republicans and the White House have described the crush of Central American children as a humanitarian crisis, but Obama said Wednesday that visiting facilities where the children are processed and detained would be little more than a photo opportunity.
Bush opted instead to fly over the coast in Air Force One, resulting in a famous picture of the President peering down at the devastation from his jet.
U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, said on CNN's "New Day" that it's important for Obama to see what the children are going through.
"I'm interested in him looking at the kids.
he said.
U.S. authorities estimate that 60,000 to 80,000 undocumented children will cross the border without their parents this year.
Republicans have called for the repeal of a 2008 law signed by President George W. Bush that requires deportation hearings before sending back children from countries that do not border the United States.
"While we intend to do the right thing by these children, their parents need to know that this is an incredibly dangerous situation and it is unlikely that their children will be able to stay," Obama said.
Perry said lawmakers aren't going to back Obama's funding request if the government doesn't act to stop policies they see as encouraging children to show up at the border.
And so why wouldn't we go ahead and pass the permanent solution, or at least a longer-term solution?"
The bill, Cuellar said, will include protections for children who come to the United States because of concerns about drug or sex trafficking.
