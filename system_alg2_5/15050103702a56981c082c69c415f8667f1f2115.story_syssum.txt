On Sunday, the Yankees will play their last game before the stadium is torn down.
Jim Bouton was photographed as a rookie in 1962 at Yankee Stadium, before the renovation of the ballpark.

"Your locker is right here by the door," said Pete.
He pointed to a locker across the room where he used to bring "a bi-carb and coffee" each day to the Babe.

My big chance came on May 7, 1962, in the second game of a double-header against the Washington Senators, in front of a real crowd that included my Mom and Dad, my brothers and a whole bunch of neighbors from New Jersey.
My next pitch was a little bit high and manager Ralph Houk stepped out of the dugout - either to calm me down or remove me from the premises.
After the game Houk said to me, "any more shutouts like that and we're going to need a new bullpen."
That's the year I kept a diary that became Ball Four -- a book that also mentioned Mantle hitting a home run with a hangover -- which got me banned from Old Timers Day at Yankee Stadium for 28 years.
My eventual return to Yankee Stadium came after my son Michael wrote a letter to the New York Times, saying the Yankees should let bygones be bygones and invite me back.
Raze the clubhouse where Pete Sheehy made coffee for Ruth.
Bulldoze the field where Mantle roamed and level the mound where Larsen pitched the only perfect World Series game.
