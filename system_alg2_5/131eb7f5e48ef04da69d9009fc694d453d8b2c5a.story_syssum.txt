"Roberto did a great job, it's not easy to win the title after 43, 44 years," Pellegrini said.
"He shares the club's approach to football and our ambition to achieve onfield success, coordinating with the wider football support teams to ensure natural progression from the Academy to senior level," said Manchester City chief executive Ferran Soriano.
Defending its league title last season, City finished a distant second after failing to sign striker Robin van Persie, who went to Manchester United from Arsenal.
Pellegrini led Villarreal to a second-place finish in La Liga and the Champions League semifinals, while in his one season with Real Madrid, in 2009-2010, it amassed a then club record 96 points without winning any trophies.
His hiring completes managerial changes at the top three teams in the Premier League, after David Moyes replaced the retiring Alex Ferguson at Manchester United and Mourinho took over from Rafael Benitez at Chelsea.
