Boeing and EADS got their bids into the office with time to spare.
Because of the late arrival of the bid, the Defense Department will not consider US Aerospace's proposal, according to Pentagon chief spokesman Geoff Morrell.
We cannot review it," Morrell said.
Chuck Arnold, a spokesman for US Aerospace, said the bid proposal was on time.
US Aerospace is fighting that decision and asking that its bid proposal, which it said will save U.S. taxpayers millions of dollars and produce a better tanker plane, be considered.
Morrell said he is confident that the dispute with US Aerospace will not slow the process again.
