Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel approved Wednesday the construction of a settlement in East Jerusalem just before U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is to visit the country on a peace mission.
The approval by an Israeli planning committee was part of a "very long process" and now means that construction can start at any time, Margalit said.
This means that Israel has no serious intentions to restart the peace process," Margalit said.
Brachie Sprung, an advisor to the Jerusalem mayor, said construction permission was granted by local planning and building committee.
"New building in Jerusalem is necessary for the development of the city and gives the opportunity for youngsters and students to live and buy," Sprung added.
