But as neural devices become more complicated, and go wireless, some scientists say the risks of "brain hacking" should be taken seriously.
"Neural devices are innovating at an extremely rapid rate and hold tremendous promise for the future," said computer security expert Tadayoshi Kohno of the University of Washington.
Some might question why anyone would want to hack into someone else's brain, but the researchers say there's a precedent for using computers to cause neurological harm.
In some cases, patients might even want to hack into their own neural device.
Despite the risks, Kohno said, most new devices aren't created with security in mind.
But the paper gives a very compelling argument that this is important, and that this is the time to have neural engineers collaborate with security developers."
"These kinds of security issues have to proceed in lockstep with the technology," Williams said.
Kohno said.
