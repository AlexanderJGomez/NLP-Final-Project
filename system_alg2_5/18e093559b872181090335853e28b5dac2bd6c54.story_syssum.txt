Liberia has reported 16 new cases with nine deaths.
WHO says there has been a reduction in the number of new cases reported in Guinea.
"It's time for concrete action to put an end to the suffering and deaths caused by Ebola virus disease and prevent its further spread," he said.
The disease's spread "is in great extent associated with some cultural practices and traditional beliefs" that run counter to preventive health measures, he said.
"These are very high-risk practices leading to extensive exposures to Ebola virus in the community," the statement said.
As a result, patients often suffer internal and external hemorrhaging.
A patient isn't contagious -- meaning they can't spread the virus to other people -- until he or she is showing symptoms.
"One, (this is) the first time in West Africa that we have such an outbreak," he said.
There is no cure for Ebola, but in theory, the disease should be easy to fight since close contact is needed to become infected, Piot said.
