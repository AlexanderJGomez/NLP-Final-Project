(CNN) -- When "La Bamba" hit movie screens in 1987, audiences flocked to see the true story of singer Ritchie Valens, who died as a teen in an airplane crash almost three decades earlier.
"La Bamba" is part of the Latino Images in Film festival, which begins Tuesday and runs through May on Turner Classic Movies.
Chon Noriega: I decided I was going to focus specifically on Hollywood films that look substantively at either Latino characters or the Latino community.
We have an idea of what the stereotypes have been in terms of the kind of expendable characters that emerge within Westerns or action films, background characters like maids.
Noriega: If I'm watching a science-fiction film and there happens to be a Latino character, I know that that character is going to be the first one to die.
Noriega: I don't know that we see a single trajectory of going from either one thing to another or from bad to better.
I think you see little shifts in terms of when they're being made and who is making them.
In the history of Hollywood, we're maybe able to identify 70 films that really focus on Latino characters, family or community, and a third of those have white actors playing the Latinos.
I've done focus groups with Latino actors in the Screen Actors Guild, and they continually talk about that there are these expectations of what a Latino character is going to look like and more often than not, Latino actors don't look like that.
When you look at the statistics in terms of the overall presence of Latinos in film and television, the numbers really haven't changed that much.
