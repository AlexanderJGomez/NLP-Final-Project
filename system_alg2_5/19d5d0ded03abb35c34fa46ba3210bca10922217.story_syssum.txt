Last week, the Ukrainian military even captured 10 Russian paratroopers inside Ukraine.
President Vladimir Putin continues his support of the rebels in Ukraine, even increasing it, according to Western officials.
There's talk of further "costs and consequences" -- the words of President Obama -- but there's division on what further sanctions can achieve.
President Putin himself summed it up in a speech to a pro-Kremlin youth camp outside Moscow last week, voicing what many of his Western counterparts may well be thinking.
The good news is that the Russian and Ukrainian presidents met last week for the first time since June.
That deadlock will simply have to be broken if this Ukraine crisis is going to end without further bloodshed or territorial losses.
