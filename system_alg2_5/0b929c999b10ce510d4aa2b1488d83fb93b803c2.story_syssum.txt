Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- North and South Korean officials started talks Saturday on reopening the Kaesong industrial complex, a suspended joint factory that marked a symbol of cooperation between the two rivals.
In April, North Korea restricted South Korean workers' access to the zone.
On Wednesday, North Korea also restored the Panmunjom communication hotline with the South, which had been cut off repeatedly over the past four months.
North Korea already had barred South Korean workers from entering the complex before May.
The average wage for North Korean workers in Kaesong Industrial Complex is $134 per month, according to the South Korean ministry.
