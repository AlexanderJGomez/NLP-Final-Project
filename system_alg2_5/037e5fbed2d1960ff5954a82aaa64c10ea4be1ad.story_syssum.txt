The former Navy SEAL was on the Bin Laden raid, according to Pentagon officials.
U.S. Special Operations Command has not reviewed the book or approved it, a Defense Department official said.
About two dozen U.S. Special Operations members and two helicopters were involved in the raid early May 2, 2011, in Abbottabad, Pakistan, that killed bin Laden.
The first man killed in the mission -- which the U.S. official said was code-named Operation Neptune Spear -- was the Kuwaiti courier who had worked for bin Laden.
The U.S. official said that the team then entered the third-floor room where bin Laden was, along with his Yemeni wife and several young children.
The al Qaeda leader was moving, possibly toward one of the weapons that were in the room, when he was shot, first in the chest and then in the head.
Oscar-winning director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal are working on a movie about the raid.
The new movie was said to be set for release just before the election, but after Republicans complained that it was a pro-Obama ad, it was pushed back until December.
Some of what those investigations found did show collaboration between the administration and the filmmakers, but Defense Department and White House officials have said it's no different than what they give many filmmakers and news reporters on a regular basis.
