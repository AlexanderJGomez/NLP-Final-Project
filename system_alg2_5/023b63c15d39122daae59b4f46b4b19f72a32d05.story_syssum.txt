My job is to ask tough questions, but when it comes to faith, God, and religion, the more questions I ask in my quest for truth and understanding, the more complex the answers become.
That same rebellious spirit also led to things that definitely were not good for me, like hanging with the wrong crowd and getting into the type of trouble that I would rather not put in print.
I started off at Westmont, a beautiful Christian college nestled in the heart of Santa Barbara, California.
As glorious and fulfilling as all that appeared, two years into college, the world became much larger to me.
It became the world of church, religion and faith versus the world of ideas, cultures, and philosophies.
I needed to make a change.
I discovered I had too many questions about faith to pursue a life of ministry, but I felt good about this transition.
In the days when I thought I was going to pursue a life of ministry, I experienced and felt many things that were unexplainable.
What was that?
He doesn't believe in a God with a long white beard and flowing robes who sits upon a cloud guiding our daily lives.
He and I definitely agree that the concept of God should not be dismissed as having no meaning.
I guess I just love my exhilarating and torturous life.
