Meriam Yehya Ibrahim, 27, was convicted by a Khartoum court this week of apostasy, or the renunciation of faith, Amnesty International said Wednesday, a day before the expected ruling.
She was born to a Sudanese Muslim father and an Ethiopian Orthodox mother.
However, because her father was Muslim, she was considered by the courts to be the same, which would mean her marriage to a non-Muslim man is void.
