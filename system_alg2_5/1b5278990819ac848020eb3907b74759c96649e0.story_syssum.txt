It seemed even more certain in 2006, when the PRI came in a distant third in the presidential election among the three major parties, behind both the conservative PAN and the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party, known as PRD.
As expected, the top vote getter in Mexico's presidential election on Sunday was PRI candidate Enrique Pe単a Nieto.
When he was criticized for the flub by the country's intelligentsia, his daughter poured gasoline on the fire by insisting, on Twitter, that the story was driven by class envy.
But Mexico's version of Big Media, led by the gargantuan multimedia company Grupo Televisa, has been a big fan of Pe単a Nieto.
Even former President Vicente Fox crossed party lines and endorsed Pe単a Nieto, against the PAN's own candidate, Vazquez Mota.
As many Mexicans see it, the PRI was always plotting its retaking of the presidency, even as it overhauled its brand and tried to overcome a legacy of corruption.
But the more common view seems to be that, despite the makeover, the party is as corrupt as ever -- a fact that voters seem willing to overlook if it can steer the country to safer and more tranquil waters.
What started nearly six years ago as an offensive by the government against the drug cartels has now morphed into a messy turf war between rival gangs eager to gobble up the country one city at a time.
Meanwhile, we'll have to wait and see whether the election of Pe単a Nieto turns out to be good news for Mexico.
