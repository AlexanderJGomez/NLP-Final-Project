Most of our creditors get little or nothing back.
They choose to stop paying, one way or another.
How do they choose to default?
From Argentina to Russia to North Korea, countries have stopped paying the interest or principle on domestic or international obligations.
In Russia's case, it was able to pay back creditors within a few years, thanks to the rise of energy prices.
They want their money back.
After all, it means a country can get a handle on its obligations.
New creditors stepped in, instead of walking away.
We know them as the troika -- made up of the European Central Bank, European Union and International Monetary Fund.
If not, that would be a default.
