Lorna Irungu, 35, had to travel from Kenya to India to receive her third kidney transplant.
Irungu says what she couldn't find was a doctor who would do the tricky third transplant in her own country of Kenya.
"When we looked at the price of getting things done in South Africa.
It's $45,000.
"When she called me from Kenya, she was very sick," Kher said.
Doctors had to remove one of the previously transplanted kidneys to make room for the new kidney, Kher said.
Irungu said.
After three months in India, Irungu is leaving with four kidneys inside her.
