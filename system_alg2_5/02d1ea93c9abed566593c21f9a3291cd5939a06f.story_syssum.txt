(CNN)  -- Actress Natasha Richardson was hospitalized after she fell on a ski slope at a Quebec resort, a resort spokeswoman said in a statement Tuesday.
At the time, Richardson was accompanied by a veteran female ski instructor, who called the ski patrol, the statement said.
Accompanied by the instructor, Richardson went to her hotel, where she was again advised to see a doctor, the resort said.
She won a Tony award in 1998 for her performance as Sally Bowles in "Cabaret."
