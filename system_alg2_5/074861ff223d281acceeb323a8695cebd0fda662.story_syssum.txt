(CNN) -- For years, Republican presidents and presidential candidates have strip-mined Clint Eastwood movies for rhetorical nuggets.
But to many, the political nuggets Eastwood delivered this time were more like fool's gold.
As a surprise guest on the Tampa stage he had too many words (I say as a friend)," tweeted newsman Tom Brokaw of the actor's apparently improvised act, where he addressed an empty chair meant to represent President Barack Obama.

During the Nixon years liberals branded Eastwood movies like "Dirty Harry" as "fascist."
The first half of Eastwood's career he played men who shot first and thought about it later.
Is that Democrat?
