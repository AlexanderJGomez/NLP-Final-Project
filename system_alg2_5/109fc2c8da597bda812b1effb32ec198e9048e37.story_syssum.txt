Spanish National Police said Friday they have seized hundreds of kilograms of cocaine in an operation that they said thwarted an attempt by Mexican drug dealers allied with the Sinaloa drug cartel to establish a foothold in Europe.
"Thanks to the exchange of information with the FBI, one knew that the suspects planned to initiate important shipments of cocaine by ship, hidden in containers with legal, declared cargo," it said.
"They adopted great measures of security to ensure the success of the operations, and sent various containers without any type of drug.
If indeed "Chapo" Guzman's cousin was among the men arrested, "that is a big deal," said Beith, whose books "The Last Narco" and "Hasta El Ultimo Dia," focus on the Mexican drug war.
Beith said Friday's announcement was a testament to the improvement in intelligence sharing by international agencies.
