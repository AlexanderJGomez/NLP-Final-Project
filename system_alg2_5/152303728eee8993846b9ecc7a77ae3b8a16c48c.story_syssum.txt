They all had been in the Chardon High School cafeteria on Monday morning, when two witnesses saw another student they later identified as T.J. Lane walk up to a table and start firing.
One of Lane's friends, Haley Kovacik, said she was in "complete shock" that Lane -- whom she described as a "a very normal, just teenage boy" -- could be responsible for the mayhem.
A student at Chardon High, Evan Erasmus, said the victims were students who attended a nearby vocational school, and were waiting for a bus to take them there.
The student killed in Monday's shooting was identified by his family as Daniel Parmertor.
I don't think it's real," said student Danny Komertz, who witnessed the shooting.
Komertz said he started to run when he saw the gun, but heard a total of five shots.
Around that time, student Evan Erasmus said, he had just arrived for his English class when an administrator "yelled 'lockdown!'"
Neil Thomas, who was in his Spanish class at the time of the shooting, said the actions of teacher Frank Hall, the assistant football coach who is thought to have chased the gunman from the school, were very much in character.
As investigators took over the school, students were evacuated to nearby Maple Elementary School, said Lt. John Hiscox of the sheriff's office.
Hours after calling off school Monday, Chardon school superintendent Joseph Bergant said there would be no class on Tuesday -- though counselors will be on hand at Chardon Middle School and St. Mary Chardon School, which is alongside the church in which a candlelight vigil is set for 7 p.m. Tuesday, according to the superintendent.
