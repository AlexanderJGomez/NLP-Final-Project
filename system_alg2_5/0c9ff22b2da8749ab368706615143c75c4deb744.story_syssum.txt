(CNN) -- Police are investigating reports that Zahra Baker, the 10-year-old disabled girl who was killed in North Carolina, may have been raped prior to her death, according to police search warrants that were unsealed Tuesday.
The tipster also told police that Zahra had been raped by both men and that she had blood on her private area and legs, the search warrant said.
Police were also told by an attorney for Elisa Baker that the girl was dismembered.
Elisa Baker has been arrested on an obstruction charge after police said she admitted to writing a fake ransom note found at the family's home in Hickory.
