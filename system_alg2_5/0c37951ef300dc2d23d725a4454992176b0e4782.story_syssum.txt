"On a fundamental level, the policy appears to invade consumer privacy by automatically sharing personal information consumers input into one Google product with all Google products," reads the letter sent to Google CEO Larry Page and signed by 36 state attorneys general.
In Wednesday's letter, the state attorneys called the policy "troubling for a number of reasons," saying that users should be able to use one product without having its information shared with others.
"Our updated Privacy Policy will make our privacy practices easier to understand, and it reflects our desire to create a seamless experience for our signed-in users," a Google spokesman said in a written statement.
A later post from Google Public Policy Director Pablo Chavez said that the company's privacy policies, but not its privacy controls, are changing.
"No doubt many of these consumers bought an Android-powered phone in reliance on Google's existing privacy policy, which touted to these consumers that 'We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent,' " the letter said.
