Women in their 60s are about twice as likely to develop Alzheimer's as breast cancer.
It's time to get serious.
Why women?
And more than 60% of caregivers for people with Alzheimer's and dementia are women, with many having to reduce their own workload or even drop out of the workforce altogether to care for loved ones.

We're asking women to put together their own "brain trusts" in their communities -- groups that will go out and do some muscular fund-raising.
They'll reach out to help and encourage women whose loved ones have Alzheimer's.

Wipe Out Alzheimer's is creating a global community of women activists, agitators and agents of change to do just that.
"Still Alice" shows us that's just not true.
