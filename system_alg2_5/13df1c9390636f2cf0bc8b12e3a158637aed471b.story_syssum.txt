Maduro called on CNN to rectify its reporting.

He who does not respect the laws will not be on Venezuelan airwaves."

Hours later, government officials notified seven journalists for CNN International and CNN en Español that their press accreditation had been denied or revoked.

Meanwhile, we will continue reporting on Venezuela in the fair, accurate and balanced manner we are known for."
Venezuela also expelled three U.S. diplomats this week, accusing them of conspiring to bring down the government -- an accusation that the State Department has repeatedly denied.
