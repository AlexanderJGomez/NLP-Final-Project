Jackson Irungu is quitting Kenya after being targeted for being gay.
There is no way to corroborate such incidents with the police because homosexual Kenyans are just too afraid to report them.
"They have a weapon to which they defend themselves," says Pauline Kimani, a leader of an umbrella organization for gays in Kenya.
A few people defend gay rights on the streets of Nairobi.
"Amongst traditional Kenyan people, it was unheard of," says Pastor Kuchio.
"They say, 'look, you are evil, the law also disagrees with you,'" says Kimani, "You are not supposed to exist within our community."
But for an openly gay man Kenyan like Irungu, progress is too slow in Kenya.
