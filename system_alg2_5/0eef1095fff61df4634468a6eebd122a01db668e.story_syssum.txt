"You can't call yourself a progressive country or nation if you still have people going blind from cataracts today," says Ndume, who also runs eye camps across the southwest African country where she treats those who do not have the means to pay for a simple surgical procedure.
"You're changing the life of so many people, you make it easier for them and it is also productive for the country -- you help people who are taking care of their grandchildren, contributing to the economy of the country, this is very, very good," she adds.
"In an independent Namibia we need medical doctors, not fashion designers," Ndume remembers being told at the time by Nahas Angula, who is currently Namibia's prime minister.
"There was that few operations, people who came really blind with visual acuity who could only see light perception -- they went back seeing again and that's how the message spread like wildfire," says Ndume.
And while Ndume had to give up her teenage dream of forging a career in fashion, she says she has no regrets -- she has been able to serve her people and make a profound difference in thousands of lives.
