Real, with revenue of more than â‚¬400 million ($530 million) last year, will seek to notch a record 200th win in the competition in the first leg in Nicosia.
Santiago Solari was a midfielder who enjoyed a glittering career which saw him win the Champions League with Real in 2002 and Spanish league titles in 2001 and 2003.
But while Santiago played alongside "Galacticos" such as Zinedine Zidane, Luis Figo and Brazilian World Cup winner Ronaldo, his younger brother Esteban Solari was beginning his career with Buenos Aires club Defensa y Justice.
APOEL, who have played just 49 Champions League matches compared to Real's record total of 343, have already upset the odds to make it this far in the competition.
Real will be motivated by the prospect of an "El Clasico" final against archrivals and Champions League holders Barcelona, after the two teams were kept apart in the quarterfinal and semifinal draw earlier this month.
Tuesday's other quarterfinal tie pits 2008 runners-up Chelsea -- who have enjoyed an upturn in domestic form since sacking manager Andre Villas-Boas earlier this month -- against Portugal's Benfica, who lifted the European Cup twice in the 1960s.
