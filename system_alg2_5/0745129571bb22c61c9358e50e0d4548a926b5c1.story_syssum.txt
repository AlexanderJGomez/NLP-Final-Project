(CNN) -- By the time police officers reached the swimmer floating off a New Zealand beach, it was already too late: a large shark was biting the lifeless body.
Following the death, police closed the beach and several others nearby.
Shark attacks kill about 25 people a year worldwide, according to the New Zealand Department of Conservation.
