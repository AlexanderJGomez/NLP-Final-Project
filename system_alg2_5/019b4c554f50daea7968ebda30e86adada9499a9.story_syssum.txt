Fish canning factory Conserveira do Sul, is in many ways, an example of Portugal's economic successes and failures.
As I get a tour of the factory, one of its co-owners, Jorge Ferreira, tells me the company has been in "pre-alert crisis since the 1970s"-- a time when the canned fish sector went into a deep crisis and many factories closed.
To secure these key distribution deals, Jorge tells me he shows off the factory -- the canning process, the sterilization of the product and the fresh fish itself, which arrives at the port just outside the factory door -- to Chinese distributors.
Inside the factory she cannot feel the crisis; outside however, it's a different matter.
The coalition government may have known that it was too early to call this a turnaround, because they did little to play off these numbers.
As a result the government is expected to reveal a new batch of austerity measures when it announces its budget on October 15.
There are reasons to be optimistic.
