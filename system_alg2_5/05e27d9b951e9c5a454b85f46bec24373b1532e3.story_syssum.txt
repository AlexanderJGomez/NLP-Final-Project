-- It's possible Apple will unveil not one -- but TWO iPhones.
This is the first product announcement for Apple -- the world's most valuable company -- under the direction of its new CEO, Tim Cook.
It wouldn't be the first time Cook helped with an Apple presentation -- he appeared onstage in January when the company unveiled an iPhone on Verizon's network -- but it would be his first time as headliner.
