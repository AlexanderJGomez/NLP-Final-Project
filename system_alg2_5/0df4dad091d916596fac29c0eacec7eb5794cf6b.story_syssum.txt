Jamie Hein has asked the commission to reverse its initial ruling that found she violated the Ohio Civil Rights Act by putting up a sign that read "Public Swimming Pool, White Only" at her Cincinnati duplex.
"Days later, the owner posted a sign on the gate to the pool which read, 'Public Swimming Pool, White Only.'"
It's a historical sign," she told ABC.
He said he never confronted Hein about the matter, but has no doubt that the sign was intended for his daughter.
