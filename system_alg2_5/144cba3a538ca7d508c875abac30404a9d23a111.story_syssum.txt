(CNN) -- An uproar over treatment delays at the Department of Veterans Affairs is triggering a heated debate over whether it is too difficult to fire federal workers, with the House approving legislation on Wednesday that would make it easier to remove senior executives at the agency.
How many has the VA fired?
CNN analysis of OPM data found the VA fired two senior executives last year.
But, the trend over the past five years shows a substantial difference at the VA. From 2008-2013, the VA fired executives at a rate one-fourth the firing rate for government overall, according to the OPM data.
But just as some conservatives cry for removing red tape and speeding up the firing process for government executives, others insist the idea could easily harm good employees at the VA.
She did, and was not fired.
"It's really important in a political system to maintain a third party review of personnel actions," said Max Stier, president of the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service which focuses on strengthening civil service.
Stier believes the system needs to change, that there may be too much red tape.
Miller insists that as it is now, the VA is not a meritocracy.
Nor has he said if he is in the process of firing any VA employees as a result of the scandal.
"I will do everything I can," Shinseki demurred.
"That's not the question," replied Begich.
