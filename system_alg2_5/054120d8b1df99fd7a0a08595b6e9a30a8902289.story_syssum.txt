The 36-year-old from Atlanta, Georgia, said he tried to convert his analog TV to digital but was turned down for a government coupon.
People with cable TV or satellite service will not be affected.
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration offered a program to help people buy converter boxes that make old TVs work in the new era.
"I live here by myself, so it will be a big deal for me," said Monica Lawson, a 42-year-old from rural Alto, Georgia.
Lawson said she got a coupon to buy the digital converter box for her analog television as soon as they became available.
Some remote areas of the country could lose reception when analog signals stop in June, said Shermaze Ingram, spokesperson for the National Association of Broadcasters, an advocacy group that has been trying to inform people about the switch since 2006.
On the whole, studies show more people will get TV signals than will lose them in the switch to digital, Ingram said.
Like Touchine, more than 12 percent of New Mexico households in the Santa Fe and Albuquerque TV market are not ready for the switch, making the area the least prepared in the nation, according to Nielsen.
Richter said he left a bad job as a local truck driver four years ago and hasn't been able to find steady work since.
"I do have a radio and I also have a cell phone.
If Richter eventually gets a free converter box, he'll consider joining the digital TV world.
