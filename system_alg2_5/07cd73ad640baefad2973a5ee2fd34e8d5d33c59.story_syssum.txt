Save the Children, World Vision and a unit of the British Red Cross said the focus first must be on tracing any family members that children may still have and reuniting them.
Save the Children Chief Executive Jasmine Whitbread said the "vast majority" of children on their own in Haiti are not orphans, but were simply separated from their families in the chaos.
Allowing a flood of new adoptions also could open the door to traffickers, said World Vision Chief Executive Justin Byworth.
For those who want to help Haitian children, Whitbread said, they should donate to aid agencies who are working on reuniting those children with their families.
