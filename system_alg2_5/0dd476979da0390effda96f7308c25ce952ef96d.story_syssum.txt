Haley Barbour has said he didn't know that retired IRS investigator Harry Bostick had been arrested for a DUI months after the state's parole board recommended that Barbour grant him a full pardon.
The e-mails show that Amanda Jones, the governor's chief counsel, and Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann were told about the October car crash that killed Linda Smith's 18-year-old daughter, Charity Smith, just days after it happened.
Barbour granted Bostick a full pardon in January for a felony drunken driving offense in March 2009.
A week later, on October 7, Bostick was driving under the influence again, according to the Mississippi Highway Patrol.
A police investigation found that Bostick was under the influence of alcohol while driving but has determined that he was not at fault for the accident, according to the Mississippi Highway Patrol.
High-profile friends of the former federal investigator's, including lawyers and former U.S. attorneys, wrote letters to Barbour touting what they called Bostick's genuine lifestyle change.
"Bostick is a friend.
Whitwell, an attorney in the firm that has represented Bostick in his DUI cases, said he called Hosemann, his old law school friend, to help with the pardon, even though the secretary of state's office has no official authority to issue pardons.
"You asked me if he was straight and I gave you my word yes.
It's not known whether Jones spoke to Barbour about this before he issued Bostick's pardon.
Whitwell said the October e-mail was the last communication he had about Bostick's pardon.
"Haley Barbour had to have known.
"How do you do that?"
