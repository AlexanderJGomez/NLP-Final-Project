Paris, France (CNN) -- French lawmakers Tuesday recommended a partial ban on any veils that cover the face -- including the burqa, the full-body covering worn by some Muslim women.
Such a resolution, if passed, would not make the wearing of a full veil or burqa illegal, but it would give public officials support when asking people to remove it.
By recommending a ban on full veils in public places such as hospitals and schools and by anyone receiving public services, the commission members said they wanted to assist those working with members of the public when asking that full veils be removed.
That's despite government estimates that less than 2,000 women in the country actually wear the full Islamic veil.
"You are going to isolate these women and then you can't say that it is Islam that has denied them freedom, but that the law has," said Mabrouka Boujnah, a language teacher of Tunisian origin.
She said she believes a law against full veils would take away fundamental rights of Muslim women.
France already has a law against Muslim girls wearing headscarves in state schools.
France is not the only European Union country to consider banning the burqa.
