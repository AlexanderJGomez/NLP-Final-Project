Dr. Mitra Roses of the Pan American Health Organization said some hospitals were performing between 30 and 100 amputations a day after the earthquake.
Amputations in Haiti are especially difficult for patients because so many people get around on foot or by bicycle.
"What I fear is that if I can't walk, I can't go to school and I can't go to church," said a boy who lost his foot in the earthquake.
Like the boy who lost his foot, they may not be able to go to school, putting them at risk of losing education.
Stuart said.
It survived the earthquake but will not be able to meet current needs, Doubt said.
Anticipating the need, the group Physicians for Peace has begun to collect prosthetics, crutches, canes, walkers and wheelchairs.
Used prosthetics will be particularly beneficial in Haiti, where manufacturing artificial limbs is likely to be difficult, said Heather Mills, a U.N. Association goodwill ambassador.
"I'm fully aware that they're not going to need the limbs for weeks, but it takes weeks to coordinate," Mills said.
"Prosthetics need to be fitted -- they're not off the shelf -- so you need technicians there," Stuart said.
