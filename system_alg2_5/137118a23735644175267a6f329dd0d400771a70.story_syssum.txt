(CNN)Forty-three people who came into contact with Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan are now officially cleared after not demonstrating any symptoms during a 21-day monitoring period, Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said Monday.
Jenkins told CNN that in addition to the 48 people whose quarantine was ending Monday, there were 75 health workers being monitored.
"We are so happy this is coming to an end, and we are so grateful that none of us has shown any sign of illness," Troh said in a statement Sunday.
While there are signs of hope in the United States and at least one more country in West Africa -- Nigeria was declared Ebola-free Monday, following an announcement that Senegal is now rid of the virus -- Ebola is still spreading rapidly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, health officials report.
Ron Klain, the former chief of staff to two vice U.S. presidents who has been tapped as the Obama administration's "Ebola czar," will begin his new duties Wednesday, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.
He's very tough," said CNN political analyst David Gergen.
The World Health Organization said an aggressive government response and effective contact tracing helped keep the virus in check.
And unlike in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- the combined epicenter of the outbreak -- all identified contacts in Nigeria were physically monitored every day for 21 days, the agency said.
A worker with the international organization Doctors Without Borders announced Monday that a staffer in Norway who contracted Ebola in West Africa and was treated in Europe is now free of the virus.
Teresa Romero Ramos, who had contracted Ebola after caring for a patient with the deadly disease, is now free of the virus, Spain's Special Ebola Committee said Sunday.
The staffer worked for the organization in Sierra Leone, and the worker's spouse is receiving treatment for the virus, according to Dujarric.
