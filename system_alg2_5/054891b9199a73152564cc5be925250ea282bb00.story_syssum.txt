(CNN) -- One of the telephone numbers used to report claims of abuse at a polygamist sect's Texas ranch was previously associated with a Colorado woman whom authorities have named a "person of interest," a court document says.
Authorities have not clearly said that they think Swinton made the March phone calls that prompted the raid.
Calls were made to a Texas family shelter March 29 and 30 from a female identifying herself as Sarah Barlow, the affidavit says.
The woman identifying herself as Sarah Barlow also called a battered women's shelter in Snohomish County, Washington, using another phone number, the affidavit says.
The phone number used in the Washington call was traced to the Colorado Springs apartment where Swinton lives, the affidavit says.
On Wednesday, workers in Eldorado continued to take voluntary DNA samples from adults who live on the YFZ Ranch, Rolfe said.
Judge Barbara Walther, who last week ordered the DNA testing of the children and ordered that they remain in state custody, signed an order this week authorizing the children's move to foster care, officials said.
The remaining children, 2 to 18 years old, will be split up into available homes.
The site, captivefldschildren.com, contains photos and videos taken inside the ranch during the raid.
