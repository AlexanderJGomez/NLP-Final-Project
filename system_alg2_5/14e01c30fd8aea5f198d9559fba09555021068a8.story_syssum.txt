(CNN) -- A leading tennis player believes he has been "treated like a criminal" after being hit with an 18-month ban for flouting doping regulations and plans to take his case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
"She dictated the letter to me and let me go without giving blood.
I am clean and will always be clean throughout my career.
It feels like the world that I help building day-by-day has let me down.
He is the third tennis player to be hit with a ban for drug violations in 2013.
Each player will have an individual electronic biological profile and be tested more regularly to monitor their levels and alert the authorities to possible drug use.
But this was a clear mistake from the on-site doping control officer who was also a doctor and the person in charge to decide," added the Serbian.
I hope this nightmare will come to a good end.
I really want to continue playing.
