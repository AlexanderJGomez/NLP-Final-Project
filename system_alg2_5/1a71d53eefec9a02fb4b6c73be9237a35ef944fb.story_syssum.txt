KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN)  -- Little Banafsha wakes up in her small mud home, has a cup of tea and braces herself for the day ahead.
Every day, she heads far from her home, trekking up and down steep hills to the wealthier parts of the Afghan capital, where she can but hope richer people will take pity on her.
"Sir, do you have some bread?"
This time of the year, the sun begins to set at 4:30 p.m. in Kabul.

By June 2008, Aschiana had eight centers catering to 7,600 children in the capital city of Kabul alone.
Four centers had to be closed in June, sending 4,000 children back to the streets without their three-hour reprieve.
On a good day, Banafsha will trek back across the steep hills to the home she helped her mother build, with some bread in her bag and maybe 50 cents.
But tomorrow, Banafsha will walk down into the crowded city streets again, among the estimated 60,000 other street kids in Kabul, dreaming of a better life.
