Washington (CNN) -- As the Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial was officially dedicated Sunday, speakers called for carrying on King's ideals and values and confronting issues including bullying and social and economic justice for all Americans.
"Let us not be trapped by what is," Obama said.

"I feel strongly that the whole thing should've been done here in America," Dwight said.

Say that I was a drum major for peace.
Because he was not.
Ambassador, former Atlanta mayor and civil rights leader Andrew Young said King was sensitive about his small stature, as he stood only 5 feet 7 inches.
"Now he's 30 feet tall, looking down on everybody," Young said.
