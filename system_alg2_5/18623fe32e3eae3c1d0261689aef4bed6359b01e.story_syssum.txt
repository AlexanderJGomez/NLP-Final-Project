He used to teach the "Queen of Pop" Madonna how to ride a horse, while his first wife left him for his arch-rival on the three-day eventing circuit, Andrew Nicholson.
But if you're doing something you love, it's worth the risk.
It is 23 years since Fox-Pitt thought about walking away from the sport altogether.
For all the bravado required for such a dangerous sport, Fox-Pitt talks of that moment as though the emotional wounds are still raw.
This is not the rider nor family man brushing off the obvious repercussions of a fall, but rather the elite athlete in him knowing that he cannot spend too much time dwelling on the what ifs of his sport.
"I think there has to be an element of risk, otherwise no one would want to do it," he explains.
It's the excitement, the anticipation and the nerves.
But that modest beginner has managed to become the golden boy of eventing, something which seemed to catch the attention of Madonna when she was married to Guy Ritchie and living in the UK.
"Horses are great releases for people and I think the riding was just that for her.
"I can see people like to make a lot of the rivalry and that's good for the sport.
I guess it's fun for most people."
"I really had to do London -- if I hadn't that would have been devastating -- and in many ways everything else is a bonus," Fox-Pitt adds.
I'm still having fun."
