Guy Heinze Jr. faces eight counts of first-degree murder in last month's killings in a Georgia mobile home.
Police said all of the victims died from "blunt force trauma," but they did not provide any further details.
The elder Heinze told relatives about the award days before his death, family members said.
Harrison said he last saw his client on Friday, as he was not required to appear with him to hear the charges read.
An arrest warrant said he provided police "with false and misleading information about his whereabouts and involvement in the circumstances leading to him calling 911 to report the deaths of his family members" and that he removed a shotgun from the mobile home and hid it in his car.
A police chaplain called relatives to tell them of the arrest, family members said.
"We want to know what really happened," he said.
Brunswick is about 300 miles southeast of Atlanta on Georgia's Atlantic coast.
