Less often remembered, though, is an eerie interlude that can easily be taken as a mirror of our own times: Scrooge's appalled encounter with the two fearful children, a boy and a girl, "yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish," who emerge from the robes of the Ghost of Christmas Present.
These fearful apparitions were products of Britain's "Hungry Forties," when there was widespread economic distress and great fear of social breakdown, but it is part of Dickens' genius that he was recognizing here a theme that plays out everywhere, in every time and in every culture.
For Dickens, building a system of national education (something frustrated in his day by bitter disputes between the different religious denominations) and reforming sanitary (or public health) laws were the two things needing urgent attention from the nation's lawmakers.
Dickens dropped Ignorance and Want from his hugely popular public reading version of the "Carol" (performed from 1858 onward), though he never stopped calling attention to the national scandal of the scavenging hordes of starving, uncared-for street children in London and Britain's other great cities (the first Education Act, which brought in compulsory state education at the elementary level for all working-class children, was passed in the year of his death).
Disney brilliantly demonstrates that the urgent social warning Dickens sought to convey in the "Carol" in 1843 is quite as relevant to us today as is the story's more personal message about the need for us to open our "shut-up hearts" to our fellow men and give generously to those less well off than ourselves.
