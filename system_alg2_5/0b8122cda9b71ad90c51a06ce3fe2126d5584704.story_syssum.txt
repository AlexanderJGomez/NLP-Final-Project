He recalls with fondness those childhood days when he used to race go-karts -- the precursor to his enormous success on the Formula One circuit -- free of any pressure.
"My father was the one to introduce the adrenaline and the passion for racing into the family," Alonso says.
Basically my father was walking alongside me to control the steering wheel or if I was doing any funny things.
"I felt that this was a good moment and I would keep this trophy all my life because you never think that you will continue," says Alonso, a cycling enthusiast, too, who hopes to have his own team.
You never know.
Alonso made his Formula One debut with Minardi in 2001 but wasn't thinking of winning that day in Melbourne.
"It was just ready for the first race.
"You arrive in Formula One, you win the world championship -- that's it.
"When I was 10 years old to 15 years old, in my room when I opened the door to get clothes, I had a photo of Ayrton with a car.
This season Alonso is joined at the Italian team's Maranello headquarters by Kimi Raikkonen -- the last driver to win the championship for the Scuderia back in 2007.
I will tell you that two championships are more than I could dream of -- I never thought I'd become a Formula One driver, I never thought I'd win one grand prix.
I'm extremely proud and extremely happy with my career," Alonso says.
