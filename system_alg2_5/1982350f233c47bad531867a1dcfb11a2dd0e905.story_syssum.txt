Mayor Bill de Blasio had asked for the demonstrations to stop until after funerals for two police officers who were slain over the weekend in Brooklyn.
The protest came hours after a moment of silence at New York's City Hall at 2:47 p.m., three days to the minute since a gunman ambushed New York Police Department Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu.
"Please embrace those around you as a symbol of our belief that we will move forward together," he said after marking the moment when two officers were shot in an ambush.
Protesters have been pushing for a peaceful response, she said.
"Not all cops are bad," she said.
"I don't want anybody to die.
The head of New York's police union said de Blasio had "blood on his hands."
"Representatives of police unions are taking advantage of and seizing upon the actions of a lone, troubled individual who shot his ex-girlfriend and then killed two police officers in Brooklyn to smear, discredit and end the broad social movement that has demanded accountability, an end to police misconduct and police violence."
Police Commissioner William Bratton told reporters that investigators believe the gunman acted alone, but he said that police still need a full understanding of Brinsley's actions.
