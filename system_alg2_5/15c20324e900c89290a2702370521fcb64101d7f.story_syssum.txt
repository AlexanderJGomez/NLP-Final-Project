A California artist is turning people into paintings.
Meade's work comes together in four steps -- painting, photography, art installations and performance art.
When you look at a photo of one of my installations, you see the painted thing but then you actually see the person coming through it," said the 27-year-old, who lives in Los Angeles.
"A lot of people ask me where I went to art school, but I didn't study art.
She started painting on people by chance.
...
"The art show on the subway turned out to be one of my most iconic pieces of work."
Meade got her big break when a post about her work went viral.
"When I first started out, it was impossible to get people to model for me," she said.
"But now I have a waiting list of over a thousand people."
And I chose to risk the ridiculous."
