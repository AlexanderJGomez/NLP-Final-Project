Obsidian -- a type of volcanic glass -- can produce cutting edges many times finer than even the best steel scalpels.
When you consider that most household razor blades are 300-600 angstroms, obsidian can still cut it with the sharpest materials nano-technology can produce.
"It wasn't hard to tell the difference at all -- as soon as he turned around everyone in the studio was like 'Ohhh'," Dr. Green said.
"The feel is very different because obsidian has no 'bite,'" he said.
And Dr. Green believes incisions made with these blades heal faster.
"For studies where trace metals from ordinary scalpel blades cannot be tolerated, these very special obsidian scalpels may provide the answer," the company says.
"It's very fragile and it's very easy to break pieces off."
