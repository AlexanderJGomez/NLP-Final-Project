The caller was a ramp agent who fell asleep in the plane's cargo hold.
The ramp agent who took the untimely nap and caused all the fuss is an employee of Menzies Aviation, a contractor for Alaska Airlines that handles loading the luggage.
Flight 448, which was on its way to Los Angeles, only spent 14 minutes in the air.
"We just took off for L.A. regular and then ... about five minutes into the flight the captain came on and said we were going back and we'd land within five to seven minutes, and we did," passenger Marty Collins told affiliate KOMO.
The team lead called into the cargo hold for the employee and called and texted the employee's cell phone, but did not receive an answer.
It's believed he was hidden by luggage, making it difficult for the rest of his team to see him, the source said.
