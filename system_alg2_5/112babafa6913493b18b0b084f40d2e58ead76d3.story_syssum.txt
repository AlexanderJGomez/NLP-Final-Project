Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League, asked CNN's Chris Cuomo, in an interview on "New Day" that became a spirited discussion of marriage.
"You didn't need the law," Cuomo said.
"I think, if people say, 'Listen, I don't want to sanction polygamy or gay marriage or anything other than traditional marriage,' I think we need to respect that," he said.
Donohue then moved on from the Arizona law to take aim at same-sex marriage in general.
"You need love," responded Cuomo.
Donohue said gays and lesbians have individual rights, but contended that "the institution of marriage is best set when we have kids raised by a father and a mother."
he asked.
And nature ordaining marriage?
"Marriage is about family -- it's not about love," Donohue said.
"Marriage is not about love?"
"If they love each other, that's great," said Donohue.
Donohue said he did not want to discriminate against gays as individuals, only as part of married couples.
"But that's the same thing," said Cuomo.
Cuomo then drew a distinction between the Arizona law and Pope Francis, the leader of the Catholic Church, who has refused to judge gays.
"I do believe that people ought to love gays as we would straights," Donahue said.
I think, sociologically, that's not correct."
