Bamako, Mali (CNN) -- Islamists in control of northern Mali said they forced a man and a woman into two holes and stoned them to death for committing adultery in the lawless region.
"They were stoned to death, the punishment for infidelity, according to Sharia, Islamic law."
Ethnic Tuareg rebels and Islamist militants have taken advantage of the chaos to seize control of the northern portion of the country.
Islamists have since imposed a harsh form of Sharia law that bans drinking, music and sports on television.
In addition to the killing, Islamist militants have gone on a rampage for months, destroying sacred tombs in the region and vowing to target more.
Sufism is a mystical dimension of Islam considered offbeat and frowned upon by Islamic hardliners.
