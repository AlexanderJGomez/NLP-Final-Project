The parallels of staging a drama about an epic family power struggle in Pyongyang, where the country's young leader Kim Jong Un had his uncle, Jang Song Thaek executed has raised a few eyebrows -- especially from human rights groups.
In every country, we are going for one single and simple purpose: to play Hamlet there," a statement released by the London-based theater said.
The theater group is not the first to get blasted by human rights groups for performing in North Korea.
"Kim Jong Un is no Hamlet.
Sadly he shows no sign of wrestling with his conscience."
