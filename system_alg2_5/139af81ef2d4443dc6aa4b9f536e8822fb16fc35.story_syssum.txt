Yet, on Christmas Day, at the downtown Alamo Drafthouse Cinema at the corner of East Sixth and Trinity, vintage Austin weirdness came roaring back courtesy of the banned-in-Pyongyang film comedy, "The Interview," starring Seth Rogen and James Franco.
Determined to put the weird back into Austin's civic spirit, League spoofed North Korea's damaging cyberattack against Sony with Comedy Central aplomb.
Calling 13 audience members to the stage as pre-showtime chorus leaders, handing out free cans of Budweiser and candy, League, in tongue-and-cheek fashion, introduced a video of Lee Greenwood crooning "God Bless the USA."
"The song is the most over-the-top patriotic song I know," League later told me.
In the days before Christmas, League networked with fellow members of Art House Convergence, an association of independent theater owners.
What impressed League about his stoked audience was the palpable unity of purpose.
"I'm no stranger to wearing costumes or being patriotic," League says.
Just before "The Interview" began, a Woodstock Nation nostalgia swelled in the old-style theater.
In its own weird way, Austin did America proud.
