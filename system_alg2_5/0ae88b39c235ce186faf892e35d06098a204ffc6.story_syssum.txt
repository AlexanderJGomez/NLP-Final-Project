Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- In 1998, Kevin Warwick became what some people call "the world's first cyborg."
To be exact, Warwick, a professor of cybernetics at Reading University, had a radio frequency ID chip implanted in his arm.
Warwick doesn't want to turn into a robot: He wants to be a better human.
Today, the argument for cybernetics may seem more imperative than ever.
"Technology, directly integrated with the brain, can help overcome some problems people have," says Warwick.
