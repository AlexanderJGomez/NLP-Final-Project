Gene Seymour says we want to relive Michael Jackson's youth, not the sad and bizarre aspects of his later life.
As with most things you neither expected nor wanted to hear, you thought that there had to be more to it than what was being said.
We wanted the loop of performances and hit singles.
Let us see that transfiguring moment 15 years later at the Motown Anniversary TV special when Jackson seized dominion over the pop firmament with his shattering, moon-walking recital of "Billie Jean."
As surely as he was the King of Pop, Jackson was also a high priest of wish fulfillment.
But it's when that promise expands to shatter boundaries and expand possibilities beyond Top-40 parameters that pop music becomes pop phenomena.
Even the eccentricities, at the peak of his influence, seemed calculated to promote, if not perpetuate, his product.
We seek those dreams even more urgently now that we know, for certain, that we'll never again see him on stage -- the one place where he was happiest and most assured.
However divided (or worse) we may have felt about Michael Jackson at the end, we cherish how he brought out the best in us at the beginning.
