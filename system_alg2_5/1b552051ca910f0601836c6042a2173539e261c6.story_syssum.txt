May 22: A car with a 1-year-old girl inside is stolen near a Georgia day care.
The child is rescued.
Between the program's inception in 1996 and July of this year, at least 656 children have been rescued because citizens saw or heard an Amber Alert, according to the center, which works with law enforcement, broadcasters and federal authorities on the nationwide program.
It could be that a case, once investigated, is determined to be falsely reported to police.
The alert announced that authorities in Southern California were looking for 16-year-old Hannah Anderson and her 8-year-old brother Ethan.
When authorities heard that DiMaggio might be heading into Nevada, the alerts were expanded to that state, Hoever said.
"The wireless program was also used in five states at one time," Hoever said.
The Idaho horseback riders who spotted Hannah and DiMaggio in rugged terrain sensed something was wrong.
Hannah was rescued.
Amber stands for "America's Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response," but its namesake was Amber Hagerman, a 9-year-old Texas girl who was last seen alive riding her bike in a parking lot in January 1996, according to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.
Hoever said.
The police tracked down the vehicle and rescued the baby.
