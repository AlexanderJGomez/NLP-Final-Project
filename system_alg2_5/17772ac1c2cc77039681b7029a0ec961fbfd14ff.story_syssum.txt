(CNN) -- The agreement between President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping of China to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is the most important advance in the several decades-long history of international climate negotiations.
One is that the agreement doesn't do enough to solve the problem of global warming.
The new U.S.-China agreement alone is indeed very unlikely to keep future warming below 2C.
Further, while we need goals, and 2C is an important one, we have to understand that we don't get to give up if we miss them.
Emissions reductions that don't get us where we want to be are still a lot better than none at all.
It will take real political capital for Obama, or any future U.S. president, to fight off the attacks of the deniers and fossil fuel industry shills.
Unfortunately, the currently available alternatives to fossil fuels are not as ready to take over our energy systems now as the CFC substitutes were ready to take over our refrigeration systems in 1987.
If the United States and China had reached an agreement now that everyone could agree was definitely enough to keep us below 2C -- despite the political challenges, the technical challenges and the possibility of a more rather than less sensitive climate -- it would have been at best highly aspirational, at worst simply unrealistic.
