India's police have largely failed to evolve from the repressive forces they were designed to be under Britain's colonial regime, according to a new report by the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch.
The Federal Home Ministry will study the report before responding, said R.K. Sharma, its deputy secretary dealing with human rights issues, but some former police officers agreed that the force had yet to modernize.
The legal basis for much of India's state and federal police services is a law dating back to 1861, which was drafted in the wake of an 1857 uprising against British rule.
Successive governments for decades have failed to deliver on promises to hold the police accountable for abuses and to build professional, rights-respecting police forces, HRW said.
The 118-page report, "Broken System: Dysfunction, Abuse and Impunity in the Indian Police," is based on interviews with more than 80 police officers of varying ranks, 60 people who said they were victims of police abuse, and numerous discussions with experts and civil society activists.
"It's time for the government to stop talking about reform and fix the system," said Brad Adams, HRW's Asia director, in a statement.
