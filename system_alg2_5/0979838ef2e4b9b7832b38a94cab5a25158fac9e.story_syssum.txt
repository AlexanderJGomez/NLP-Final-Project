The school's board of trustees announced Friday that it'll offer the president's job to Tressel, who has worked as an administrator at the University of Akron since departing as head football coach at Ohio State University under a cloud of controversy.
This success catapulted Tressel to the top job at Ohio State, which historically boasts one of the top football programs in the country.
In addition, the NCAA issued a five-year order for Tressel that limited his athletics-related duties and applies to any NCAA school that wants to hire him as a coach.
Michael Slavens, the president of student government at Youngstown State for 2014-2015, says reaction to the Tressel's apparent hiring has been mixed on social media.
"The fact that Tressel is coming back and it's getting people excited, I hope it helps in a meaningful way," said Slavens.
But, at the same time, things could quickly turn south -- just like Tressel's time at Ohio State.
Yes."
