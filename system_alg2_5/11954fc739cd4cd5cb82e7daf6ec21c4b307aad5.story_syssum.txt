LONDON, England (CNN) -- London police said Thursday they are planning one of the largest and most complex operations in their history as the city gears up to host the G-20 summit next week.
The summit takes place April 2.
O'Brien would not say how many police officers would be on duty, but he said there were 10,500 police shifts being scheduled between March 24 and April 2.
Police expect some 20,000 people to turn out, O'Brien said.
April 1, the day before the summit, will see various smaller demonstrations in central London.
"We will not tolerate any people breaking the law, attacking buildings, people, or our officers," he said.
The London Chamber of Commerce said many firms are advising their staff to take precautionary measures, including wearing more casual clothing, hiding any company logos, canceling unnecessary meetings, and keeping movement in and out of the building to a minimum.
"We're up for it and we're up to it."
