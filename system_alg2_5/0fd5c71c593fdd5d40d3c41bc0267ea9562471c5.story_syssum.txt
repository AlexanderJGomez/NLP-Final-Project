In his second debate with Mitt Romney, the president delivered a comeback performance that will stand as a model for future debaters of how to right a listing ship.
But by the end of the debate, he had checked off pretty much every item on his list of "Things I Should Have Done in Denver."
Clearly this was not the role Romney intended to play.
The town hall debate was a particularly inappropriate setting for Romney to display this side of himself.
Staring daggers at his opponent, the president said it was "offensive" for Romney to suggest that the White House had sought political gain from the murder of an American ambassador and three others.
"It's not as big as yours," came the answer, "so I don't look at it that often."
The governor's response might have been written by the staff of "Saturday Night Live:" "President Bush and I are different people and these are different times," he said.
Turns out he didn't need to.
