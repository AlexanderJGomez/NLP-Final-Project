House Republican sources told CNN on Monday that several options are under consideration for votes this week -- probably Thursday -- to exert some congressional control over the Libya mission.
Obama has pledged no ground forces will be sent to the mission, and the House Republican sources said the proposal would be intended to prevent any possible escalation in the mission and give legislators a chance to express their disapproval.
In addition, House members were further angered by news of strong disagreement within the Obama administration over the president's analysis of whether the Libya mission came under the War Powers Resolution.
Gates also backed the Libyan mission, saying Obama was right to limit the scope of U.S. involvement and that he believes the president has complied with the War Powers Resolution.
Obama responded with a report to Congress last week that argued the limited role of U.S. forces in the NATO-led Libya mission failed to constitute engaging in hostilities as defined by the War Power Resolution.
Passed in 1973, the War Powers Resolution gives the president 60 days to get congressional approval for sending U.S. forces to war, followed by a 30-day extension to end the hostilities.
If adopted by Congress, the resolution would serve as congressional authorization under the War Powers Resolution, they say.
Even though the Senate in March unanimously passed a nonbinding resolution supporting a no-fly zone over Libya, some Republicans now express total opposition to the U.S. support for that effort.
