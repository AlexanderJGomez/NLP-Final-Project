The election of 2004 was seen as a referendum on the Iraq war.
Aznar's replacement, Jose Luis Zapatero, ended the Spanish commitment to Iraq and sundered the close relationship with the United States.
Indeed for a long time, Zapatero seemed not to comprehend that Spain faced any economic challenges at all.
Spain created nearly half of all the net new jobs created across the whole continent of Europe in the years between 2000 and 2005.
The German economy is much more productive than the Spanish economy.
Instead, the price of German goods and services steadily declined inside Spain.
If the price of German goods and services declined inside Spain, then logically the price of Spanish goods and services (including vacations) must have risen to Germans.
And all of it was financed by debt: Spanish households accumulated debt equal to 90% of GDP (only slightly less than U.S. households at the top of the housing bubble), and Spanish businesses had accumulated debt equal to 205% of GDP (vastly more than U.S. business has ever borrowed).
One day, the market loses faith that housing values must endlessly rise.
The government must cut to balance its books if it is to remain within the euro, but government cutbacks only make it that much more difficult for households and business to service their debts.
It will take a grand rethink of the whole euro currency project, a rethink that either emancipates Spain to quit the euro and export enough to repay its debts or else reduces the debt enough that Spain can sustain its expensive new currency.
