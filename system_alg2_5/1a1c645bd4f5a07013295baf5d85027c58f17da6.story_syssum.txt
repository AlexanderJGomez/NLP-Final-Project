Katherine Jackson has proposed she or one of her children be added as an executor to Michael's will.
Questions surrounding Michael Jackson's death and AEG Live's role in his last days are an "obvious source of tension" as Katherine Jackson objects to the agreement, Jackson attorney Burt Levitch said.
"There's an obvious link between AEG and concerns that we have about the decedent's demise," Levitch said.
Beckloff delayed a decision until Friday on Katherine Jackson's objection to the agreement made by Branca and McClain, who are serving for now as special administrators of the estate, to allow AEG Live to produce a Michael Jackson exhibition.
The judge has approved a merchandising agreement and the movie deal, both of which were adjustments to the contract Jackson signed with AEG Live earlier this year for a string of 50 comeback concerts that were to start last month in London, England.
Estate lawyer Howard Weitzman said canceling the exhibition deal could cost the Jackson estate $5 million.
