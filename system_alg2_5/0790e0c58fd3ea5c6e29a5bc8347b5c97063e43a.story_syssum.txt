(CNN) -- On July 13, 2013, a Florida jury found George Zimmerman not guilty in the death of Trayvon Martin.
His wife, Shellie, filed for divorce in September, citing irreconcilable differences -- and in November, Zimmerman was arrested and charged with felony aggravated assault for a domestic dispute with his girlfriend.
She had taken the Zimmerman case near the end of her one-year rotation in the criminal courts.
As of July 1, Nelson is back for another turn in criminal courts.

The ousted former Sanford, Florida, police chief, who took the brunt of criticism about how the initial investigation in the shooting was conducted, is now working as a special agent with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's Orlando Regional Operations Center Public Integrity Squad.
Jeantel says she's interested in pursuing a postsecondary degree and is weighing whether she wants to attend college or go to fashion school.
