As McCartney was awarded this year's prestigious Women's Leadership Award from the Lincoln Center Corporate Fund, CNN spoke to the mother-of-four about sustainability in a notoriously "unaccountable" fashion industry.
McCartney: It certainly opened a lot of doors and certainly closed some minds.
Obviously there have been great women from Britain in design, but actually there are fewer than I thought.
I've had people say to me: "You'll never sell handbags, you don't work with leather and leather is luxury."
The fashion industry, is not really as accountable for some reason.
CNN: You get very steely when you talk about people telling you you can't do something.
I'll always admit that it was easier for me to question people telling me I couldn't do something because I had a pretty nice place to fall back on.
I guess I got here for a reason, it wasn't because I was a woman.
