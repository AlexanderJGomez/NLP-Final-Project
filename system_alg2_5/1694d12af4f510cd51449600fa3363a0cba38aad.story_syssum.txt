But folks in Mingo County are about to get a whole lot closer to Crum, who was appointed sheriff Thursday by the county's commissioners.
"She's a good person," Crawford said about Crum.
Crum has prior no law enforcement experience, but she will have "plenty of help," Baisden said.
Crum was sworn in as sheriff on Thursday night at the county courthouse, just blocks from where her husband was shot.
She lost her husband, and would have lost a paycheck," he said.
Justin Marcum, an assistant prosecutor in Mingo County, said having Crum step into her husband's shoes should help in the healing process.
