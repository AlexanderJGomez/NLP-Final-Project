I was sitting with the first lady and Jay Leno at the head table for Saturday night's White House Correspondents Association Dinner because I'm a member of the association's board, a front-row seat to the slew of celebrities who walked up to gawk at Mrs. Obama and the president, who was a few seats from me.
Noting that Gibbs was sitting at the other end of the head table, I stood and told the first lady I'd ask him.
I assured the first lady I would not tell her a fib, which prompted Leno to jump to his feet to say he'd go get Gibbs to sort this out once and for all.
Gibbs, who was looking over our shoulders, suggested that I type it out, so I told Mrs. Obama to start dictating the note.
She asked Gibbs for his opinion on what she had dictated, and he said the proper way to say it was that it was her first tweet.
Some of my followers were particularly amused that Mrs. Obama referred to her husband as "the potus" -- as in the president of the United States -- and started re-tweeting it.
So let me take this opportunity to encourage the first lady to set up her own Twitter account.
Besides, I'm hoping Mrs. Obama will follow me, and not Velshi, since I hooked her up with her first tweet.
