The former Barcelona striker signed with Anzhi, who hail from the war-torn Dagestan region of Russia, on Wednesday from Italian outfit Inter Milan.
"I'm impatient to play the first home game, but most important to take this project from the base and make it big," he said.
"It was always important for me to be happy -- and now I am happy.
The Togo striker spent part of last season at Real Madrid, where he scored eight times in 22 games.
