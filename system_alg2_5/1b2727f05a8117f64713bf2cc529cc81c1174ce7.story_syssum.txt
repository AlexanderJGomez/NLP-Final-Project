Take for example the story of how a simple father-and-son chat led to a prototype spacecraft for landing on other planets.
Engineering, he believed, wasn't being used to contribute to NASA's future.
Monday morning at his office, Altemus made his pitch to his NASA leadership team.
What could we do together?'
They were in.

At first, "a whole lot of political fallout came trying to squash the project," Altemus said.
"It was nothing like what NASA was used to."
It's the first NASA prototype spacecraft to be propelled using liquid oxygen and liquid methane.
"The technologies demonstrated on Morpheus are directly applicable to future robotic, and eventually human missions," Morpheus Project Manager Jon Olansen told CNN via e-mail.
Today, the latest version of the Morpheus lander "is a centerpiece for the agency to show what a fantastic team it is, and what incredible things can be done with just sheer willpower to imagine," said Altemus, who in 2013 ended a 25-year career at NASA to start an engineering products business based on space technology.
In fact, during the next decade, NASA plans an unprecedented mission to send astronauts to an asteroid.
It's possible that Morpheus' fuel -- liquid oxygen and methane -- could be found on Mars or other planets.
The fuel-making spacecraft would then harvest methane from the atmosphere, said Altemus.
Human space exploration is "part of our DNA," said Altemus.
