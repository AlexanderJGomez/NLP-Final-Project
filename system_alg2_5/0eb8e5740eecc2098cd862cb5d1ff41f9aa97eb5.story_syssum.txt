And while the actor is set to play Wu-Tang Clan member Ol' Dirty Bastard in a forthcoming film about the rapper, Williams is most excited about his new role as an executive producer.
From there, Williams reached out the director, asked to be an executive producer and offered to do what he could to promote the film and tell Snow's story, which he got to know more of when they met in tha Bluff.
"He didn't make excuses for who and what he was, and it kind of reminded me in a weird sense of Omar."
"Everybody loved Omar.
Williams said he also dealt with his own "racism" with "The Wire," especially when the first season with a predominantly black cast was followed with a second season with more white characters.

From there, Williams knew he wanted to tell more stories like those in and around West Baltimore, where the "The Wire" was filmed.
Like the man himself, the movie about Ol' Dirty Bastard's life has been fodder for debate over everything from the title to the subject matter.
It was just a very unfortunate accident how he lost his life," said Williams, who did most of his research for the role by spending time with the late rapper's mother.
From Snow to Omar to Ol' Dirty Bastard, Williams believes he has found his calling.
