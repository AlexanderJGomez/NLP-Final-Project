Aberdeen, Maryland (CNN) -- The man who abducted the mother of Baltimore Orioles legend Cal Ripken Jr. from her Maryland home restrained her and appeared to have used her credit cards, a law enforcement official said Wednesday.
He also said police don't know of any relationship between the suspect and the Ripken family.
The official said the suspect made no mention of Cal Ripken, an indication that he might not have known she is the mother of a famous former baseball player.
"This has been a very trying time for our family, but we are grateful and relieved that mom is back with us, safe and healthy," the statement said.
He died in 1999.
