Blair, West Virginia (CNN) -- We're at the peak of Blair Mountain in the middle of southern West Virginia.
The 50-mile march is re-creating the 1921 March on Blair that led to a bloody battle between thousands of coal miners and coal company supporters.
Coal companies own most of the land rights on Blair Mountain now, and they have fought national historic landmark status for the site, which would protect it from being destroyed.
"If you stand for preserving our cultural heritage instead of destroying it, you stand for Blair Mountain," Chuck Keeney said to his followers before he led marchers out of Marmet, West Virginia, last week.
"Why don't they get a job, instead of taking ours," one young coal miner watching from his porch asks.
She is surprised when told that her environmental stance against coal is interpreted by local miners as attempt to take away their jobs.
He lost his job when the coal company near his home was denied a mountaintop removal mining permit by the Environmental Protection Agency.
"Welcome to Coal Country" says a sign greeting the marchers as they cross the Logan County line.
We find Diann Kish, the wife of a retired miner, at the counter-protest.
We have met with Kish before and visited a mountaintop removal site with her.
One of the speakers is Robert Kennedy Jr., an environmental activist and son of the late Sen. Robert Kennedy.
Smutko is the son of a miner.
The new "March on Blair Mountain" ends in song and celebration at the top of the mountain.
March organizer Chuck Keeney sums up the march as a success for raising awareness, but wants to do more to make sure there is no mountaintop mining of Blair.
