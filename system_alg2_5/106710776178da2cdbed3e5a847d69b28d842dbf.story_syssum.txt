Why do they see beheadings as a fitting punishment?
King Abdullah, as the protector of Islam's most sacred religious sites and leader of Saudi Arabia, is widely considered an important role model for Muslims around the world.
There is so much shock and outrage about ISIS propaganda videotapes showing its beheadings of journalists in Iraq and Syria -- and most recently, the reported beheadings of two Tunisian journalists in Libya.
The 82 executions in 2014 make Saudi Arabia a world leader in capital punishment.
If Saudi Arabia thinks publicly beheading people comports with Islamic religious teachings and deters those who also might want to criticize them or question their religion, why shouldn't ISIS?
There is probably little governments and policymakers can do to influence the ideology of extremist armed groups.
