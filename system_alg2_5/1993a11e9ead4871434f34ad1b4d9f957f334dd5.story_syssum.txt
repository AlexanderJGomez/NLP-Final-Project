Some Republican lawmakers and a handful of Democrats are calling for a travel ban on people from the West African countries most affected by the disease.
"I believe it is the right policy to ban air travel from countries that have been hit hardest by the Ebola outbreak."
But President Ronald Reagan in 1987 did ban anyone infected with HIV/AIDS from entering in the United States.
No.
No, no, no.
And the United States never banned travel from China, the epicenter of the 2003 SARS outbreak, which tallied roughly the same number of cases -- over 8,000 -- in the same seven-month period as the Ebola epidemic.
Rep. Tim Murphy, who led the house panel that sharply questioned top health officials over Ebola on Thursday, insisted airport screenings aren't enough to keep people out of the country -- especially since infected people can carry  the disease for up to 21 days without showing any symptoms.
But a ban might actually make things worse, he said, because it could encourage people to lie about their travel to West Africa.
And without that crucial information, Frieden said people infected with Ebola could slip into the United States without the CDC being able to track and monitor them for symptoms.
In fact, there are no direct flights to the United States from either Libera, Sierra Leone or Guinea, the three most affected countries.
Preventing the disease from spreading further in West Africa is crucial to keep Ebola from continuing to spread.
