Former Rep. Joe Kennedy may try to launch a political comeback amid all the Kennedy nostalgia.
Kennedy won his Senate seat in 1962; John Kerry won his in 1984.
Massachusetts law requires a special election for Kennedy's seat to be held within 160 days.
Rep. Ed Markey, a 17-term congressman from north of Boston, ran for Kerry's Senate seat in 1984.
Why?
Rep. Mike Capuano, now in his sixth term from Somerville, currently has the seat once held by President Kennedy and House Speaker Tip O'Neill.
Massachusetts Democrats might, however, decide it's time to turn the political page by sending a woman to the U.S. Senate.
Former Rep. Joe Kennedy, who held Capuano's seat from 1987 to 1999, may also try to launch a political comeback on the strength of the current wave of emotion and nostalgia.
Massachusetts may be headed for its most hotly contested Senate race in at least a quarter century.
