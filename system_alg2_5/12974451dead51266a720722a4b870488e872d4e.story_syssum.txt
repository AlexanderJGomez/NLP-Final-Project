But when Escobar learned that the baby's teenage mother had not been able to raise the money for treatment that would've saved his life, she was crushed.
"It was agony," said Escobar.
In the last 10 years, her Juan Felipe Gomez Escobar Foundation -- named for her late son -- has brought health care to tens of thousands of children in Cartagena and provided more than 2,000 teenage mothers with counseling, education and job training.
She built a state-of-the-art neo-natal unit, brought in experts to train the clinic's staff and established a program to cover the medical costs for babies born to impoverished mothers.
... Next year, she's going to be pregnant again," Escobar said.
With the opening of her foundation's new center last year, 400 pregnant teens and young mothers now enroll every year.
It's light years away from the impoverished world of these teen mothers.
For the first year, young mothers come to the center every weekday, leaving their babies at the daycare while they attend classes.
"Girls tell me they don't understand how they got pregnant.
While the program aims to prevent future pregnancies, Escobar also wants to give these young mothers the tools they need to change their lives.
"I want my girls to be empowered," she said.
"I feel great, since I was able to accomplish a goal that I had wanted," Bautista said.
...
"These teen mothers are my own daughters," Escobar said.
In 2005, she established a medical clinic that has provided health care to more than 84,000 low-income residents of the community -- mostly young mothers and their children.
