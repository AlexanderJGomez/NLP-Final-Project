(CNN) -- Hostilities were resumed in the oldest international rivalry in football Wednesday and although billed as a friendly England and Scotland served up a fiercely competitive encounter at Wembley settled by a dream winner from debutant Rickie Lambert.
The thousands of fanatical Scottish fans, who drowned out the home support at times, were celebrating first when James Morrison put them ahead with a dipping shot which deceived England goalkeeper Joe Hart.
Lambert might have added to his tally as a later effort thumped the post, but it sent the England fans home happy ahead of crucial World Cup qualification matches next month.

Portugal were playing to a 1-1 friendly draw against the Netherlands with Cristiano Ronaldo grabbing a late equalizer.
