Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- The detained captain of a Chinese trawler was released by Japan and returned to his home country, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported, citing the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
The captain was arrested off the disputed Diaoyu Islands, in the East China Sea, after his vessel crashed into two Japanese patrol boats.
Word of his release quickly followed the arrest of four Japanese nationals in China.
Japan's foreign ministry officials said Friday that China had informed them of the arrests, but they had no information about any charges or why the Japanese nationals had been detained.
Japan "illegally arrested" him and his crew of 14, China said.
China's Foreign Ministry said that Japan had "seriously damaged Sino-Japan bilateral relations" with the arrest of the captain and his crew.
