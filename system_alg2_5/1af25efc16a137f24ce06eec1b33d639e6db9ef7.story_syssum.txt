CNN's Jessica Yellin appears live as a hologram before anchor Wolf Blitzer Tuesday night in New York.
said Yellin, waving to Blitzer as she stood a few feet in front of him in the network's New York City studios.
Jay Leno has poked fun at the hologram, and mash-up spoofs that replace Yellin's voice with Carrie Fisher's lines from the movie already are making their way around the Internet.
"About a dozen years, I've been trying to do it," David Bohrman, CNN's senior vice president and Washington bureau chief, said to Blitzer on "The Situation Room" on Wednesday.

On Tuesday night, Blitzer could only see Yellin on a TV monitor across the studio.
Instead, for the past three months, the company has been perfecting it for CNN's election coverage, Oz said.

For all the preparation that went into the tent and green room in Chicago -- a location CNN staffers dubbed "Casper" after the friendly cartoon ghost -- there was an equally elaborate setup in Phoenix, Arizona, site of John McCain's election night rally.
Hurley and Oz both said they couldn't put a price tag on the total cost of such technology.
The day after her virtual appearance in New York, Yellin said this kind of new technology is what keeps television news entertaining, even when it's presenting important political stories.
Now, in hindsight, Yellin only wishes she could have come up with a better "Star Wars" joke.
