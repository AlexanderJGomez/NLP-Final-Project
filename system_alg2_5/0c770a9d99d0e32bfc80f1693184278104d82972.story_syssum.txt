Sony Pictures Television, the studio behind the original series, is said to be shopping a pitch for a spinoff series centered on David Faustino's girl-crazy Bud Bundy.
Faustino, at least, doesn't seem opposed to the idea.
Katey Sagal has gone on to lead roles in TV hits such as "Futurama" and "8 Simple Rules," and currently stars in the FX drama "Sons Of Anarchy," which kicked off its seventh and final season earlier this month, to record ratings.
And last month, TV Guide reported that a "Full House" reboot is in the works with some of the original actors reprising their roles.
