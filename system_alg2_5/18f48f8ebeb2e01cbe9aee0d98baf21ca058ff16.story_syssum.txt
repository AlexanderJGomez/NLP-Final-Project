(CNN) -- It was like a scene from a big-budget Hollywood disaster movie -- a Godzilla of a fire roaring down the mountain, straight toward Brandon Hanson's Colorado Springs neighborhood.
"It's a lot worse than we thought," he ran in and told Maria.
The Hansons scoured through photos posted on online news sites trying see their house.
The fire has forced about 36,000 people to evacuate their homes.
One of them, Mindy Levinson, was forced to leave her apartment Tuesday, accompanied by her young son.
"This flag is my son's.
I want to make sure I take that down," he told CNN affiliate KCNC.
The family fled the Peregrine neighborhood in northwest Colorado Springs on a two-lane road that quickly turned into a parking lot.
But none like this.
"That is Colorado Springs, the city I was born and raised in, the city that is at war with nature," Sobecki said.
But she couldn't take everything.
For Russ Wolfe, it's going to take a long time for it to be OK.
"With much sadness we have to report that the Flying W Ranch as well as several homes in the Mountain Shadows area has in fact been burned to the ground," the website said.
"It was like nothing we have ever seen before in our life," she told CNN.
Everything looked like it was on fire, smoke everywhere."
Keffer was someone who marveled at the visual, in awe of the images of the angry fire.
The flames were among the people, in their city.
