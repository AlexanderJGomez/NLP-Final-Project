Abdel Hadi earned her PhD exploring the use of crayfish as chicken feed.
"The group of chickens [that we raised] on crayfish have stronger bones, have a higher optical density of meat.
As a result, Abdel Hadi says, her experiments show that chickens raised on a crayfish feed diet lay more, stronger, higher-protein eggs.
Scientists like Dr. Madgy Khalil, who also works at Ain Shams University, say there are unprecedented numbers of crayfish thriving in the Nile with no natural predator, from the Mediterranean Sea or from the south of Egypt.
However, it could be better for a niche market," he says.
