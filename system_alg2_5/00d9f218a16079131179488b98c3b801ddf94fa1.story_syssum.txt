And they made it through South Korean air defenses.
Scientists found a "smoking gun that all three were sent from North Korea and are programmed to return to North Korea," South Korean defense spokesman Kim Min-soek said.
The planes were not capable of transmitting images back to North Korea in real time, and the photos themselves were no better than what one might see on a service akin to Google Earth, Kim said in a previous briefing.
There is little danger the drones could have made it far into South Korea.
The Korean drones are nowhere near as sophisticated as those used by the United States in Pakistan, Yemen and Afghanistan, he said.
Annual U.S.-South Korean joint military drills, that ended on April 7, drew criticism from North Korea, which views the exercises as "dress rehearsals for invasion," according to analyst James Person from the Woodrow Wilson Center.
Days later, the two sides fired hundreds of shells across the Northern Limit Line, their disputed maritime border.
Kim said Seoul will send a warning via the United Nations to Pyongyang and tighten air defenses as a response to the drones.
