NEW YORK (CNN) -- Lawyers for former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn urged a judge on Wednesday to dismiss a civil suit brought against him by the New York hotel housekeeper who accused him of assaulting her last year.
The arrest of such a high-profile international political figure who was preparing a presidential run in his native France sparked worldwide media interest.
Strauss-Kahn's lawyers did not invoke his immunity from prosecution during the criminal case.
Wigdor ridiculed the fact that they would invoke it in the civil case, but not the criminal case as "piecemeal immunity."
Strauss-Kahn has been formally warned by French authorities that he is under investigation for "aggravated pimping," and has been released on 100,000-euro bail.
