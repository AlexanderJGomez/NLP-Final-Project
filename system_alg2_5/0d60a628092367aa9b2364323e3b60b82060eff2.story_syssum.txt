(CNN) -- Hey Mars!
A car salesman would have a ball selling this beauty.
Who will pay for the first manned mission to Mars?
Could manned space missions be replaced by robotic exploration?
"Later, in 2004, when the Spirit and Opportunity rovers landed, it became one of the largest worldwide Internet sensations," said Bell, who also worked on that mission.
Curiosity "is just another box with wheels on Mars," says CNN commenter It_could_always_be_worse.
After the initial excitement of Monday's landing, even the Curiosity team jokingly acknowledged the first dusty black and white photos from the rover have already lost their luster.
Seriously, no matter how successful unmanned missions might be, robots will never replace the need for human space exploration, says Bell.
Putting a monetary value on space exploration is impossible, experts say, because there are too many unanswered questions, such as whether Mars, the moon or asteroids hold precious minerals, water and cheap energy resources that could be mined and brought back to Earth.
That knowledge, experts say, could help solve difficult environmental problems on Earth.
These stories become part of part of our culture, part of our heritage, part of our shared need to explore the worlds around us.
In 2017, NASA plans to launch Orion with a new heavy-lift rocket NASA calls the Space Launch System.
However, the budget also calls for more money for manned deep space programs, including almost $3 billion for Orion and the Space Launch System.
"Humans are going to live on Mars in the president's expected lifetime," says commercial space consultant Charles Miller, a former NASA executive.
Do you think astronauts will set foot on Mars within your lifetime?
