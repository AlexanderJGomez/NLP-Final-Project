(CNN) -- Comprehensive immigration reform.
Obama often talks about reform without even mentioning it.
Many Americans think reform is about the 11 million unauthorized immigrants already living in the United States.
And they are sure to be the most contentious issue when the immigration debate resumes in months to come.
The root cause: For less-skilled foreigners who want to come to work legally in the United States, there is no "line" -- no available visas.
But we do.
We're becoming better educated and aspiring to the kinds of jobs for which our better educations prepare us.
Today, less than 10% of the native-born men in the labor force are high school dropouts.
No, we don't need as many immigrant workers in a down economy -- and far fewer want to come to the U.S. when jobs are scarce.
What's needed is to end illegal immigration by creating ways for needed workers to come legally -- creating worker visas and establishing a system that allows employers who can't find enough willing and able Americans to connect easily and quickly with lawful immigrants.
Unless we create ways for the immigrants of the future to enter legally, we're going to find ourselves in exactly the same predicament a decade or two down the road -- wondering what to do about 10 or 20 million unauthorized immigrants living among us but beyond the rule of law.
Now if only Obama would mention it.
