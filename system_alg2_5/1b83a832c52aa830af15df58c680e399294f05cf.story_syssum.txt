"Levinson traveled to Kish Island, Iran, on March 8, 2007, working on behalf of several large corporations, and his whereabouts, well-being and the circumstances surrounding his disappearance have been unknown since that time," it said in a statement.
"We remain committed to the safe return of Mr. Levinson to his family and appreciate the support and assistance from our international partners.
Iran's government repeatedly has said it is not holding Levinson and does not know his whereabouts.
Whoever his captors are, in 2010 they sent a "proof of life" videotape and photographs of Levinson to his family.
