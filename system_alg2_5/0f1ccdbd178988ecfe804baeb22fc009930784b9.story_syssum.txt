(CNN) -- A top Mexican drug trafficker has been arrested by Mexican police, authorities said Wednesday.
While Mexican authorities said Wednesday that Rodriguez was associated with the Sinaloa cartel, U.S. officials offered a slightly different biography of the trafficker.
Last week, Mexican army special forces arrested a top lieutenant for El Chapo.
Cabrera, who was responsible for the activities of the Sinaloa cartel in Durango and the southern part of the state of Chihuahua, was detained after fleeing from Durango, officials said.
