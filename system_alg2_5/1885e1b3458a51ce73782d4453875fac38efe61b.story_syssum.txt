While official state media has given cursory coverage to the trial, Chinese netizens fed an online frenzy of commentary about the case, which was the top trending topic Thursday on Sina.com's Weibo, a Chinese Twitter-like microblogging site.
Followers of the Jinan court's Weibo account jumped from less than 10,000 on Wednesday to more than 330,000 by Friday morning as the court fed updates of the bribery case against Bo, whose downfall last year was laced with tales of murder and corruption, creating the Communist Party's biggest political crisis in decades.
According to posts by the court, Bo contested the claim that he had taken bribes from Tang Xiaolin, a businessman in the northeastern industrial city of Dalian, where Bo used to be mayor.
While official state media offered little commentary on the proceedings, Chinese netizens weren't afraid to wade in.
"You (referring to Bo) will always remain a great secretary in the eyes of Chongqing people!"
"I never care about politics but I think it's worth following right now because of Bo Xilai, but I can tell the result has been scripted, now is only a process to make people think that our country is fair and transparent," wrote Xiao Kui Kui-Cindy.
