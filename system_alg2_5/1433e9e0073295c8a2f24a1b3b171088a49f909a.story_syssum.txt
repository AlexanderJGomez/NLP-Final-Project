The National Weather Service has issued beach hazard and high surf warnings from more than 100 miles north of L.A. down to the border of Mexico.
And how.
"You gotta have your respect for the ocean," Hamilton said.
One person died in the water Tuesday night, Los Angeles County Fire Department spokesman Scott Miller said, but it was unclear whether the death was directly related to the tumultuous surf.
"Very strong rip currents and long shore currents will likely create extremely dangerous and life threatening conditions for anyone," the Weather Service says.
"But the real threat is the surfboards," said Bo Bridges, a surfer who cut short a vacation in Colorado to catch these "epic" waves.
But even at that distance, Marie's counterclockwise swirl is still washing waves up the California coastline.
Surfers will be looking for "select focal points," as Surfline, a website for surfing enthusiasts, calls them, where its forecasters predict some waves cresting at well over 18 feet.
Surf forecasters have broken down the height of the surf by time of day and particular beach.
