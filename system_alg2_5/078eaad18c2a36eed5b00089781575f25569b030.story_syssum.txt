"I think people tend to think of this as more of a nuisance," said Dr. John Klippel, president and CEO of the Arthritis Foundation.
Researchers don't know the exact cause of arthritis, but they do know what puts people at risk.
"It's annoying -- it's certainly not good for the joints, but on the other hand, it doesn't cause arthritis," Klippel said.
"If you live in a warmer climate, you're simply more active for more months of the year and that's probably why people feel better," Klippel said.
"For people with arthritis, it hurts to exercise," he said.
Klippel worries about arthritis patients who don't seek medical help because they don't think anything can be done about the pain.
She also exercises at least three days a week; the workouts help her strengthen her muscles.
