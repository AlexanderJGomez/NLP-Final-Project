Beijing (CNN) -- Xi Jinping is a mystery.
He's risen to the top of the Chinese system by being very careful not to disclose what he really thinks," Chinoy said.
The modern Chinese Communist Party is run by a small collective, the nine members of Politburo Standing Committee of which Xi is expected to be the next leader.
The 18th Communist Party Congress will come together on November 8 to chart a new course for the country, say farewell to the old leadership and usher in a new generation.
Every ten years it selects the new leadership.
It could be seen as a mark of shame in Communist Party history," said Zhang Ming, an analyst from China's Renmin University.
The purge of party power broker, Bo Xilai, sparked China's biggest political scandal in decades.
To some China watchers, Xi is going to need to be a traitor to his own class if he is to succeed.
"He is part of a consensus to keep the Communist Party as the only ruling party.
Meanwhile, the U.S. is pivoting its geo-strategic policy away from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to east Asia, strengthening key alliances and even boosting its military presence in the region -- much to the consternation of Beijing.
Kevin Rudd, a former Australian Prime Minister and once a diplomat in Beijing, has met Xi and says he is a man "you can do business with."
