John Terry, so solid for Chelsea this season, gave Palace a valuable three points with an own goal in the 52nd minute.
Elsewhere, English trio Rickie Lambert, Jay Rodriguez and Adam Lallana shone for Southampton again in a 4-0 home win against Newcastle; and relegation contenders West Bromwich Albion and Cardiff City played to a 3-3 draw after both scored deep in injury time.
