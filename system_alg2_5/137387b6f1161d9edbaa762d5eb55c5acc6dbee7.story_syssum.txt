(CNN) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Il was visiting China on Friday, a South Korean official said, according to state-run Yonhap news agency.
Open Radio for North Korea, a South Korean non-governmental organization, said Kim was visiting China.
"According to that military officer, it was Kim Jong Il who is going -- not his son."
"Kim Jong Il wants to get something from South Korea or the U.S. or China -- economic aid or security assurances -- but at the moment he is not getting anything and China is preventing North Korea from further provocations," said Choi Jin-wook of Seoul's Korea Institute of National Unification.
Last week, however, Lee invited Kim to visit South Korea.
The last two inter-Korean presidential summits took place in Pyongyang.
