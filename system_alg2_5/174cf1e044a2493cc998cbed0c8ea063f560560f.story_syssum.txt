Sri Lankan army chief Sarath Fonseka says a key Tamil town has been taken in a national TV broadcast Sunday.
The rebels gained control over Mullaittivu in 1996 and established a military garrison there, according to the government.
Earlier this month, troops regained control of the northern town of Elephant Pass, the point at which mainland Sri Lanka links to the northern Jaffna peninsula.
"They lost... about 90 percent of what they had."
"They (Sri Lankan authorities) are also directly responsible for subjecting journalists to harassment and interrogation," she said.
Others have been driven from the country by death threats, or in fear of detention and torture by government authorities, it said.
