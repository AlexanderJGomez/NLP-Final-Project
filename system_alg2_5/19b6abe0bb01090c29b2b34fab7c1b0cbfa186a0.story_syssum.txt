(CNN) -- As a professor who sees firsthand how tough it is to get into college, I expected to hear widespread howls of protests from high school seniors and their parents when, this fall, a Kaplan Test Prep survey showed that an increasing number of college admissions officers were discovering information on Facebook and Google that hurt a student's acceptance chances.
With Harvard's 5.9% acceptance rate and six of the eight Ivy League schools taking in fewer than 10% of their applicants, competition is certainly tough for ambitious students.
Why should material not submitted by applicants to a college be used to judge them?
Debra Shaver, the dean of admissions at Smith College, had this to say of student writing on the Internet: "I do think that students can be held accountable.
At the same time, they are not about to turn a blind eye to facts about their applicants -- even if they come across the facts by happenstance.
On their websites and application forms, colleges should explicitly tell all prospective students that anything they write online can be held against them.
That's the least they can do for applicants who may be dangerously naÃ¯ve about the consequences of their Facebook or Google posts.
