Henning, a big-hearted taxi driver from Bolton, northern England, was part of a team of volunteers traveling from Britain to Syria to deliver aid to people in need.
Henning was kidnapped by ISIS a day after the video was made.
As the clock ticks down, those who made the trip with him are pleading with the leaders of the militant group -- which has declared an independent Islamic state across parts of Syria and Iraq -- to let Henning go.
"John, we as Muslims are here to preserve lives," Field told CNN.
"We beg you to tread the path of justice and show him the compassion in the heart of believers and in your heart," Abu Abdullah said.
"Young British Muslims are sick and tired of the hate-filled propaganda the terrorists ISIS and their supporters churn out on social media," Qadir said.
