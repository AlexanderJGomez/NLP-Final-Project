The fighting came to an end in 2003 and five years later Jones decided to pay a visit to Liberia.
"It just wasn't the Liberia which I remembered as a young child -- things like basic necessities were non-existent: access to clean water, access to health care, access to basic education were non-existent and the challenges just seemed so enormous for the government."
"I decided to focus specifically on water because the issue of water really crosses all aspects of development," says Jones, 30.
As well as saving lives, Jones says that access to safe drinking water can also encourage economic growth and improve the educational development of children, especially girls.
In recent months, FACE Africa has embarked on a  major initiative that's aiming to solve the water crisis in River Cess, one of Liberia's most underserved areas, where only one fifth of its 80,000 population has access to adequate drinking water.
She says her long-term goal is to bring access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene to as many regions of Liberia as possible, as well as other post-conflict countries that face similar problems.
