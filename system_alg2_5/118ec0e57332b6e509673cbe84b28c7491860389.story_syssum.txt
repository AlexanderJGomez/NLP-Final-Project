Somali and African Union troops exchanged heavy gunfire with the militants and thwarted the attack, a senior Somali security official said.
Al-Shabaab said it was behind the raid, one of several recent Mogadishu attacks for which the al Qaeda-linked group has claimed responsibility as it presses its campaign to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state.
The incident comes after several high-profile attacks in the capital, including a car bombing -- claimed by al-Shabaab -- that killed at least six people at the Parliament building on Saturday.
It allegedly carried out a mall attack in Nairobi, Kenya, in September that left at 67 people dead.
