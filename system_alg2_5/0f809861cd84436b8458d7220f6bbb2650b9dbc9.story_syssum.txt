The father, Justin Ross Harris, has pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and second-degree child cruelty.
Police in Cobb County, just outside Atlanta, have been tight-lipped and haven't said whether what they found on the computer is one of the reasons they arrested Harris.
The funding of the funeral from the Home Depot charity, the Homer Fund, is a "standard approach," she said.
"The chain of events that occurred in this case does not point toward simple negligence, and evidence will be presented to support this allegation," said Cobb County Police Chief John House.
But that day, police said, Harris left him in the car seat.
After work, around 4:16 p.m., the 33-year-old father got in his car and drove away.
The organization says its tally is likely incomplete and much lower than the real toll.
Another, set up at YouCaring.com, has raised more than $22,000 for the Harris family.
As Harris sits in jail, his wife, Leanna, would not discuss the case with the media.
The Cobb County medical examiner's office found the child's cause of death "consistent with hyperthermia and the investigative information suggests the manner of death is homicide," according to a Cobb County Department of Public Safety statement issued Wednesday.
