(CNN) -- Air travelers across the country are breathing a sigh of relief that they might get to their destinations on time after Congress took action to roll back a part of the automatic spending cuts that forced furloughs on air traffic controllers.
On Friday morning, just hours before many in Congress would head to the airport to catch flights home for a weeklong district work period, the House of Representatives voted to end the furloughs of air traffic controllers.
And yet Republicans seemed to be shocked, shocked, to find flight delays ripple through airports across the country.
Just as we should not expect that we can cut 4 million meals to seniors, as the White House reports, and not hurt them.
