But, he said, Spector "did not kill Lana Clarkson, that's what the evidence shows."
An unnamed court official told CNN at the time that a majority of jurors voted for conviction on the second-degree murder charge, and jurors said two holdouts believed the defense's assertion that Clarkson's death could have been a suicide.
But Weinberg said everything prosecutors have done since 2003 is aimed at proving Spector killed Clarkson, and there was no "independent investigation" of the evidence.
In the 2007 trial, Spector's attorneys argued that Clarkson, who starred in 1985's "Barbarian Queen" and the 1987 spoof "Amazon Women on the Moon,"  was depressed over a recent breakup and grabbed a .38-caliber pistol to kill herself.
But prosecution witnesses painted Spector as a gun-toting menace.
Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler ruled on Friday that jurors can consider the lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter against Spector.
He later produced the Beatles' "Let It Be" album, John Lennon's "Imagine" and the Ramones' "End of the Century."
