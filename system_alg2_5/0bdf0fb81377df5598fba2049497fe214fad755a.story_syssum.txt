A desalination plant.
Even in the United States, demand for water in drought-ravaged California and the desert Southwest is outpacing supply.
Most desalination technology follows one of two methods: distillation through thermal energy or the use of membranes to filter salt from water.
Officials at the Carlsbad plant say they can covert two gallons of seawater into one gallon of freshwater by filtering out 99.9% of the salt.
In the United States, desalination projects are concentrated in coastal states such as California, Florida and Texas.
Within the United States, the water crisis is especially severe in California, which has been stricken by drought over the last three years.
But if the planet continues to grow warmer, snow will increasingly fall as rain and will be harder to collect because it will swell creeks faster and create more flooding, said Bowles of the Water Education Foundation.
"The cost for this water will be about double what it costs us to import water into San Diego," Yamada said.
"However, over time we expect that the cost of desalinated water will equal, and be less than, the cost of imported water.
It's dependent on water to sustain that economy.
