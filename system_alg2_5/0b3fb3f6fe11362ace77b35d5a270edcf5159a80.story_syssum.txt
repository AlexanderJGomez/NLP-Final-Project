(CNN) -- A week after students seized Taiwan's legislative building over a controversial trade deal with China, Taiwan's president Ma Ying-jeou agreed to meet with protest leaders to help end the standoff and allow the legislature to get back on track, a spokesperson for the president's office said.
The president's office confirmed to CNN that the students had not yet accepted the invitation.
Protesters, who claimed negotiations over the deal were opaque and undemocratic, broke into the legislative building in Taipei the next day, demanding that the pact be scrapped.
Student leader Lin Fei-fan,speaking to CNN by phone from inside the legislature building Monday, criticized the pact.
The protests have garnered widespread support among Taiwanese living abroad.
Rallies are being held in at least 10 countries, including Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States.
