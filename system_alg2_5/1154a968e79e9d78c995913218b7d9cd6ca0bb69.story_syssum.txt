ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- More than 80 years after his family was ordered from the country, the grandson of one of the last Ottoman sultans was buried Saturday as hundreds of admirers looked on.
"His death marks the passing of an era," wrote Jason Goodwin, author of "Lords of the Horizons," which tells the history of the Ottoman Empire, in an e-mail to CNN.
In 1922, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the modern Turkish Republic, sent the last Ottoman sultan packing aboard a British warship.
Friends say that, prior to getting a Turkish passport in 2004, he traveled using documents identifying him as an Ottoman citizen.
The hundreds of mourners at Saturday's funeral stunned other surviving members of the Ottoman royal family.
It is the first time I have seen such an outpouring."
Osman's death serves as a reminder of Turkey's recent, yet often forgotten Ottoman history, said historian Jason Goodwin.
