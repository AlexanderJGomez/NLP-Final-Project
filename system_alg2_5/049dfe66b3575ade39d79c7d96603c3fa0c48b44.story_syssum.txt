The English language Buenos Aires Herald said Argentina's government had been silent on the death of Thatcher, who led Britain into the 1982 war over the Falkland Islands, a territory Argentina claims and refers to as Las Malvinas.
In its article on Thatcher's death, the English-language Santiago Times in Chile recalled the Iron Lady's support for the country's former dictator Augusto Pinochet, whose regime it said had supplied Britain with intelligence during the Falklands War.
The Shanghai Daily carried a photo of Thatcher meeting with China's then leader Deng Xiaoping in 1982, reminding its readers that Thatcher had signed the 1987 agreement to hand Hong Kong back to China.
The South China Morning Post carried a poll on whether Thatcher signed away Hong Kong too easily.
South Africa's Times said the "divisive effect" of Thatcher's foreign policies were still felt in the country.
"But Mrs. Thatcher knew how to stand up to Ronald Reagan when she needed to â€” for example, over the ill-considered United States invasion of Grenada," the newspaper said.
Thatcher's legacy continued with Blair's "third way" and Clinton's policies, it said in its editorial.
Some newspapers had highlighted her forceful personality while "some conclude, however, that her policies were too radical, and that Thatcherism no longer offers the answers to the economic problems of today," David Crossland wrote.
In the United Kingdom, the Daily Mail called for a state funeral for "The woman who saved Britain."
