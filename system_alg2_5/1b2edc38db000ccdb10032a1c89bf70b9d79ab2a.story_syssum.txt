The Kastrinos moved into this tiny home from an 1,800-square-foot place.
"I don't think bigger is better," he says.
Now, they live in a place so small, he and his wife use a ladder to climb into their bed every night.
"It's a very simple lifestyle," he says.
The couple now live on property owned by their daughter in California wine country, where the average home in 2007 cost $725,000.
The change to their shed-like home has been so dramatic that Bill Kastrinos is now building the tiny homes to sell.
His smallest home has 65 square feet; his biggest (a three-bedroom place) has 774 square feet.
"I look around and I do see a lot of people who seem they're slaves to their homes," he says.
"Living in a small house has allowed me to do what I love doing, which is designing more small houses," he says.
He's designing her a nearby place that's about triple the size of his: 280 square feet.
"I don't think I have anything to worry about," he says.
