Say "robot," and you've got them excited.
Was Leonardo da Vinci the first celebrity to put the concept of a human-like, mechanical companion into the public consciousness?
When his notes were discovered in the 1950s, researchers re-created the "robot," suggesting that his idea would have really worked.
"R.U.R."
The first movie robot wasn't far behind.
A half-century after "Metropolis," the appearance of "Star Wars" droid C-3PO would be largely inspired by the robotic Maria.
Many of Asimov's stories, and the stories and films that his laws inspired, focus on trouble that arises when robots have trouble knowing how to obey the laws in tricky real-world situations.
Robby made his first appearance in the 1956 movie "Forbidden Planet."
Instead of obeying Asimov's Laws, HAL, first and foremost, is devoted to making sure his ship's mission is a success.
It's hard to argue anyone did more to propel robots from hardcore science fiction into the wider public consciousness than these two when they hit the screen in 1977.
The idea of a friendly robot with a ton of personality was well established by the time "Wall-E" came along in 2008.
Like much great science fiction, "Wall-E" also tackles larger societal issues like rampant consumerism and environmental waste, while still offering up a robot who connected with millions of viewers, young and old, on a personal level.
