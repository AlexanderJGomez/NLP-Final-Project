Iranian filmmaker Bahman Ghobadi, director of "No One Knows About Persian Cats," which was co-written by Roxana Saberi.
"In there, what did they do with her?
After much to-ing and fro-ing by the Iranian authorities, Ghobadi says he couldn't believe it when he found out Saberi had finally been freed, before the end of her sentence.
He said it felt as if the the authorities were playing games with himself and other supporters of Saberi as they gave different timescales for her release -- "two weeks, four years, eight years."
His 2008 film "Half Moon" was banned and says he was left feeling depressed and suicidal after spending three years unsuccessfully trying to get permission from the Iranian authorities for another previous film.
Shame on me!
Now, Ghobadi says, he is planning to go to New York this week to be with Saberi, who is currently staying in Vienna with her family.
Ghobadi says he wants to start a family and get married to Saberi as soon as they can.
