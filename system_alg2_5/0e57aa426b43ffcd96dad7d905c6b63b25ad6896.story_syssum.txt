(CNN) -- Virender Sehwag plundered the second-fastest Test double hundred as India piled on an incredible 443-1 off just 79 overs on the second day of the deciding third match against Sri Lanka in Mumbai.
The explosive Sehwag, who made 131 in India's innings victory in Kanpur, then found another solid partner in Rahul Dravid, who calmly fed him the strike in his patient 62 off 121 balls.
I thought I would bide my time, see off the new ball and then take my chances."
The 37-year-old, who has taken 788 Test wickets, conceded 119 runs off his 20 overs.
Imran Farhat and Salman Butt put on 60 for the first wicket but then fell in quick succession along with captain Mohammad Yousuf as Vettori snared two wickets in three balls.
