(CNN) -- Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin, known to many people more as an aggrieved movie character or perceived tax dodger than as an actual person, has finally spoken out.
But despite well-documented friction over the years, Saverin says he bears no ill will toward Zuckerberg.
Many saw it as a dodge -- a way to avoid paying U.S. taxes on his share of the company, valued somewhere around $2 billion.
"The decision was strictly based on my interest of living and working in Singapore," he said.
"It was hard for me, because of the life I built in the U.S., hearing from Eduardo that he had to give up on his citizenship," he said.
As for Facebook itself?
