Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli authorities are investigating whether the attack that left an American woman dead and her friend injured was "nationalistic," a police spokesman said Monday, using a term for crimes in which a victim is targeted based on an Arab or Israeli background.
"He took it off like a gentleman and then turned me around and stabbed in the place where the Star of David had been," Haaretz quoted her as saying.
Luken and Wilson both worked for CMJ UK, a Christian ministry based in England.
Luken had worked for CMJ UK for one year, having previously been a government employee, according to Aldridge.
