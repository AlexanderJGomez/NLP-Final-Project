(CNN) -- It was Taylor Anderson's dream come true to be living in Japan.
As a student at Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, Virginia, she constantly sought ways to share all things Japan with the community.
Her parents last heard from her two days before the March 11 earthquake, which triggered a massive tsunami that devastated parts of northeast Japan, including the town where Anderson lived.
"It is with deep regret that we inform you that earlier this morning we received a call from the U.S. Embassy in Japan that they had found our beloved Taylor's body," her family said in a statement.
"She was just so happy to be alive.
She always cared about other people more than herself.
She'll always be with us."
