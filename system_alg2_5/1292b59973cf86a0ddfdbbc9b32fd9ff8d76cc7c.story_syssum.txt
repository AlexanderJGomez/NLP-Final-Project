He died Thursday surrounded by relatives at his Los Angeles area home, his son Chris Owens said.
The veteran radio personality had been part of the entertainment industry since his teenage years, and will be remembered for his deep baritone and nuanced comedic timing.
"He always said he was one of the luckiest men because ... he got to achieve everything he dreamed of," Chris Owens said.
Owens is survived by his wife,  Arleta Owens, and one other son, Scott Owens.
