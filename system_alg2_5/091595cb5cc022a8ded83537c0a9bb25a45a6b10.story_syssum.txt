After all, who doesn't want to run away with the circus?
But for Joe Putignano, it wasn't as simple as running away -- it took a lifetime of dedication and a battle against addiction to get where he is today: dangling from the 40-foot-high catwalk above the Cirque du Soleil big top.
And for Joe, it's not just high-flying acrobatics that cause him pain.
"I need to have surgery," he says matter-of-factly.
His left shoulder has just the one injury -- another SLAP tear.
"I suppose there's always a risk that when they do fix it, that it will destroy my flexibility," Joe says.
"Opiates made me feel like I was the greatest human being possible.
He's determined to not let it become his reality, both for his own benefit, and to show other addicts they don't have to fear a day where they need surgery.
Most of these nearly 17 million Americans will need surgery someday, and many of them will be prescribed opioid painkillers to combat post-operative pain.
During step four, Joe will see a psychologist the day after surgery and regularly after that to ensure he stays on the right mental path.
"In my head, it's like -- OK, we're going to go and visit hell, not just once, but twice," he said.
"But I think Joe has an incredibly good psychological framework going on.
"I can tell you what I'm going to do, how I'm going to think -- all of it's untrue, because I won't know until I'm there.
When you're met with pain, only then you'll know how you'll react to it."
