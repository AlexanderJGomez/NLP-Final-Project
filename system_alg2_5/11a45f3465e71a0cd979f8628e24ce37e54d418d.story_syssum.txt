Developed by the Oeschger Center for Climate Change Research at the University of Bern in Switzerland and Swiss software company, Texetera, the Jungfrau Climate Guide is an interactive guide to glaciers and climate change.
"There are many different levels to the application.
"Everyone who tries it is quite fascinated by it," Meuli said.
In the future, Meuli says the University hopes to produce features that can be used by teachers in preparation for taking classes to the glaciers.
