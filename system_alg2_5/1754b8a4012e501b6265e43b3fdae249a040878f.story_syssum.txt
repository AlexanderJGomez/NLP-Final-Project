LONDON, England (CNN) -- British union leaders will recommend Thursday ending an unofficial strike that has dragged on more than a week at the country's third-largest oil refinery, the arbitrator in the dispute announced Wednesday.
Local union leaders had earlier told demonstrators they were near their goal of being offered half the jobs involved in one of the latest subcontracts connected to the construction project -- 102 new jobs for a minimum of nine weeks.
Union leaders accuse Total of discriminating against British workers by subcontracting with IREM, which has hired workers from Italy and Portugal.
"It has never been, and never will be, the policy of Total to discriminate against British companies or British workers.
Hundreds of workers at British power plants and refineries have been walking off the job in unofficial "wildcat" strikes since the Lindsey workers put down their tools last Wednesday.
Union leaders say the strike there is only a reflection of problems with the way Britain implements European Union employment directives.
The problem is that employers are excluding UK workers from even applying for work on these contracts," Unite General Secretary Derek Simpson said Tuesday.
Brown retorted in the House of Commons.
