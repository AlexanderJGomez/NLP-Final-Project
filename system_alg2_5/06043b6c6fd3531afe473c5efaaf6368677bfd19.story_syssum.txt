(CNN) -- It takes a special person to join Mensa.
But a new partnership between American Mensa and online dating giant Match.com offers a new, enticing reason to join the society of geniuses: true love.
Sereg found she does not connect with people who are athletes or sports nuts, for example.
A Harvard graduate, Binazir said highly intellectual people can frequently feel "entitled" to love.
There's no way to say if this person interacts well with others," he said.
The new Mensa partnership will give Match.com users a new way to find common ground, said Helen Fisher, a professor at the University of Indiana and Match.com's chief scientific adviser.
"If you're proud of being in Mensa, if someone (else) is also proud of being in Mensa, then you're already in the same clan," she said.
Binazir does not believe Mensa members are better at relationships than anyone else.
Anne Sereg hopes he is right, but she won't get too excited just yet.
But you can't go anywhere if you don't have hope."
