(CNN) -- Police in Albuquerque, New Mexico, released a composite image Tuesday of a young boy found buried beneath the sand of a local playground.
Before the composite image was created, police weren't able to release a photo of the boy because his body was so disfigured by the sand's heat.
Walsh said there were no obvious signs of bruising on the boy.
Though police have received numerous tips from the public, Walsh said nothing has come from them.
"He doesn't have a family," Lesperance told KOAT-TV.
