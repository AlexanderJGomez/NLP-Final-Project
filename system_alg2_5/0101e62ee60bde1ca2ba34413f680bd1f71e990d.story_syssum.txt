(CNN) -- A British report issued Thursday called for "decisive action" to contain the growing problem of piracy off the coast of Somalia.
Though some ships have begun taking "more robust" measures to defend themselves, pirates still face few repercussions for their actions, it said.
Once they have got on to the ship, they will proceed to the bridge and take it over."
Though most hostages are released unharmed, 15 died last year, it said.
In a statement, Foreign Secretary William Hague said the report will be discussed next month at a meeting in London.
