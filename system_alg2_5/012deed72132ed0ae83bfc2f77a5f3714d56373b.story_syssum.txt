(CNN) -- Marin Cilic made a winning return to the ATP circuit Monday after serving a reduced doping ban.
"I would definitely say it was the worst time of my life as a player," he told AFP.
"One thing I can say is I'm happy to see Marin back on tour.
That's all.
"The last tournament of the year is important," he told the official ATP Tour website.
I hope this year I can change that situation.
