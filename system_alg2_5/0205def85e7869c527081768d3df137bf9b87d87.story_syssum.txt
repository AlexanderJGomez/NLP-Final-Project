But one thing I, and I'm sure many of you, think we understand is obesity.
We know how people gain weight, and we think we know how to lose it.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that obesity-related medical costs were almost $150 billion in 2008, and the cost in health related expensed for an average person who was obese was more than $1,400.
I know I've told people that making small, sustained lifestyle changes is the best way to lose weight over time.
So imagine my shock to discover that what evidence exists in this new study hints towards ambitious goals being a good thing, and that quicker weight loss isn't less likely to be kept off in the long-term.
People will say that eating more fruits and vegetables is a great way to lose weight.
People will say that snacking in between meals can lead to weight gain.
They show that significant physical activity can help with weight loss, and that it has the added bonus of making you healthier in general.
Over the past five years, my wife and I have lost quite a bit of weight.
Each time, I had ambitious goals of 15 pounds or more in two to three months, and each time I really restricted my caloric intake.
I tell you this because more and more, I think that the journey to sustained weight loss is a very personal and individual path.
But one thing I doubt will ever be proved false is that it's much easier not to gain the weight in the first place than to take it off later.
