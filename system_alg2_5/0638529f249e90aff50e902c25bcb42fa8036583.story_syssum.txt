SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN) -- Opponents of California's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriages launched a new court challenge Wednesday, led by lawyers who were on opposite sides of the case that settled the 2000 presidential race.
"Our Constitution guarantees every American the right to be treated equally under the law," Boies said.
California's Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the marriage ban Tuesday, but left intact about 18,000 same-sex marriages conducted before voters approved the ban in November.
But a coalition of groups that fought the ban in California courts -- including the American Civil Liberties Union, the Human Rights Campaign and the Lambda Legal Foundation -- urged supporters Wednesday to turn their energy toward winning in the political arena rather than the courts.
"Right now, Californians support traditional, natural marriage 49 percent compared to 43 percent for same-sex marriage," said Garlow, who supported Proposition 8.
As people get more familiar with the reality, the sanctity of marriage, how special marriage is, why a child should have a mom and dad, they shift to the traditional marriage view."
"We're going to court because people shouldn't have to surrender their fundamental rights to a popular plebiscite," Olson said.
