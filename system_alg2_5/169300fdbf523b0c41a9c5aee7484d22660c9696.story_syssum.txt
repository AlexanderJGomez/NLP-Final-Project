New Delhi, India (CNN) -- India and Pakistan traded bitter accusations Wednesday after New Delhi said Pakistani troops had killed two of its soldiers in the disputed territory of Kashmir, a flash point between the two nations since their creation.
The Pakistani foreign ministry rejected the allegations that its troops had crossed the Line of Control and killed Indian soldiers.
Pakistani army troops repulsed the attack, but one Pakistani soldier was killed and another critically injured, Pakistan said.
The Pakistani army filed a formal complaint over Sunday's incident with United Nations military observers, said Kieran Dwyer, spokesman for the agency's peacekeeping operations.
The two South Asian neighbors have had a cease-fire along the de facto border since November 2003.
The conflict over Kashmir dates back to 1947, after Britain relinquished control of the Indian subcontinent, giving birth to modern India and Pakistan.
Islamabad has always said that majority-Muslim Kashmir should have been a part of Pakistan.
