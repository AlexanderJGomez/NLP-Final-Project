Los Angeles (CNN)Conrad Hilton, the younger brother of celebrity heiress Paris Hilton, has reached a plea deal: He would admit guilt to misdemeanor assault against flight attendants in exchange for a federal felony charge being dropped, court papers says.
Hilton signed court papers last week that state he "repeatedly entered the bathroom to smoke marijuana and tobacco" during Flight 269 from London to Los Angeles, court papers said.
Hilton also "punched at, but missed" another flight attendant, the court documents said.
Hilton's father is Rick Hilton, the grandson of the Hilton Hotel empire's founder, Conrad Nicholson Hilton.
Another flight attendant said Hilton rose from his seat at least 20 times during the 10Â½-hour flight, court documents said.
Hilton also accused the flight attendants of "taking the peasants' side" and then said he was angry because he had just broken up with a girlfriend, court papers said.
"As Hilton was being restrained, he told the flight attendants he was a model and that they were 'going to ruin my career,' " according to an affidavit by FBI agent David Gates filed in court in early February.
Hilton admitted to calling people "peasants" on the flight, but he "denied having a confrontation with a flight attendant near the start of the flight but acknowledged having other issues with flight attendants," the affidavit said.
