Sheridan, 48, returns to the stand Friday after testifying all day Thursday in her legal battle with Cherry and ABC over the TV killing of a character she played on the hit comedy series for five seasons.
The hit was just "a light tap on the head" intended to demonstrate "a piece of physical humor" Cherry wanted Sheridan to perform, the defense said in opening statements Wednesday.
The actress finally agreed to show jurors the hit in full force, sending a loud thump across the courtroom and turning Maloney's head.
The next day, she told show producer George Perkins she wanted a second apology and flowers from Cherry.
Sheridan lawyers Mark Baute, in his opening statement Wednesday, challenge the authenticity of those writers notes, accusing Cherry's defense of an "effort to backdate the decision" with a fake story that the character's death was planned months before the hitting incident.
Britt is "a very colorful character, sassy, overt, audacious," Sheridan said.
The demise of Sheridan's character was first considered at the end of the third season, which ended with Britt's head in a hangman's noose, but a senior executive decided it was too soon for her to go, Levin said.
Cherry assured her that her character would "be saved" in the next episode at the start of season four, she said.
The human resources investigator never interviewed Cherry or Sheridan about the incident, only three people who worked for Cherry, Baute said.
Contracts introduced during Sheridan's testimony revealed that she is still getting royalties from the show, even for the last three seasons after her termination.
