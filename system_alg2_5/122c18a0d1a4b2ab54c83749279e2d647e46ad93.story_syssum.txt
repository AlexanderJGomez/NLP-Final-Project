Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Hurling rocks and brandishing daggers and sticks, supporters of longtime President Ali Abdullah Saleh plunged into a crowd calling for his ouster in Sanaa on Friday as rising momentum in Yemen sprouted similar protests in other towns.
After midday prayers concluded, they marched from the gates of Sanaa University to the streets, where security forces and riot police tried to stay between rival demonstrators Friday.
The day before, at least 20 people were injured in Sanaa.
In Taiz, more than 10,000 anti-government demonstrators, including 4,000 women, gathered Friday in Freedom Square in a seventh straight day of protests, witnesses said.
Aref al-Qubati, a participant whose friend was one of the victims, said police fired to disperse protesters.
The council "stressed all should practice their rights according to the constitution, in a peaceful way and without violence, chaos, sabotage and lawbreaking," Saba said.
In an attempt to quell growing discontent, Saleh, a U.S. ally in the fight against an offshoot of al Qaeda in Yemen, has announced he won't seek another term in 2013.
Yemen's situation is compounded by the fight against al Qaeda, the southern separatist movement in its once-independent south, a Shiite uprising and a looming shortage of water.
