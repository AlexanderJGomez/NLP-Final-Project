Sarah Palin's hometown required women to pay for their own rape examinations while she was mayor, a practice her police chief fought to keep as late as 2000.
Alaska's Legislature in 2000 banned the practice of charging women for rape exam kits -- which experts said could cost up to $1,000.
For years, Alaska has had the worst record of any state in rape and in murder of women by men.
During the time Palin was mayor of Wasilla, her city was not the only one in Alaska charging rape victims.
"Several municipal law enforcement agencies in the state did have trouble budgeting and paying for the evidence collection for sexual assault victims,"  Henry said.
"What I recall is that the chief of police in the Wasilla police department seemed to be the most vocal about how it was going to affect their budget."
He does not recall discussing the issue with then-Mayor Palin.
The bill passed unanimously with the support of the Alaska Department of Public Safety, the Alaska Peace Officers Association and more than two dozen co-sponsors.
After it became law, Wasilla's police chief told the local paper, The Frontiersman, that it would cost the city $5,000 to $14,000 a year -- money that he'd have to find.
Patrick was also a member of Wasilla City Council, and she doesn't recall the issue coming before council members, nor does she remember discussing the issue with Palin.
Before Palin came to City Hall, the Wasilla Police Department paid for rape kits out of a fund for miscellaneous costs, according to the police chief who preceded Fannon and was fired by Palin.
"She does not, nor has she ever believed that rape victims should have to pay for an evidence gathering test."
Victims' advocates say that services are lacking and that Palin cut funding for a number of programs that treat female victims of violence.
As governor, Palin approved a funding increase for domestic violence shelters -- $266,200 over two years.
And she reauthorized a Council on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault.
