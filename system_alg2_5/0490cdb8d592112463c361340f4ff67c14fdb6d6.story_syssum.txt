(CNN) -- This week, just over 250 days since the U.S. Senate passed a bipartisan and inclusive bill to extend the landmark Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives allowed the clock to run out on protections that bill would have provided to millions of women across our country.
Included in that bill were new protections granted to women who had been left out of previous versions of the bill.
But for the leadership in the House of Representatives, passing a bill with life-saving protections to these new communities of women was simply not politically acceptable.
So just weeks after the Senate passed our bill, in a purely ideological move, House Republicans passed a bill that specifically stripped the new protections for immigrants, the LGBT community and tribal women, and even removed protections that exist under current law.
And most recently, every Democratic woman in the Senate wrote to the Republican women of the House of Representatives to appeal for their help in passing our bill.
These members of Congress made clear that if House leadership would only bring up the bill for a vote it would pass the House and be sent to the president to become law.
In the next Congress one of our absolute first priorities must be passing an inclusive and bipartisan bill to extend protections to the millions of new women included in the Senate bill.
