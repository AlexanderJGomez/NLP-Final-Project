The FCC had imposed a $550,000 fine against CBS and its affiliates for airing the "wardrobe malfunction" incident involving Jackson and Justin Timberlake during the professional football championship game's halftime show.
But Roberts nevertheless agreed with his colleagues to dismiss the government's appeal, in light of the FCC's newly clarified policy allowing for no exceptions to fleeting expletives or images.
In addition to CBS Inc., 20 of its affiliates also were fined.
The television networks say their scripted shows no longer air nudity, racy images or expletives, even after 10 p.m., when some potentially vulgar words may be permitted.
The "wardrobe malfunction" case is FCC v. CBS Corp. (11-1240).
