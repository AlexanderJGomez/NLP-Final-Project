Clearwater, Florida (CNN) -- Jury selection in the Casey Anthony murder trial continued Saturday afternoon following the rejection of nine potential jurors, including one man who posted to his Facebook account that he had a "title, cover and all" ready for a book about the case.
Assistant State's Attorney Jeff Ashton questioned whether the man would be able to bear the grim details of the case.
"No, sir," the man replied.
Perry later approved the dismissal of a man who posted on his Facebook page what the potential juror said was a joking reference to a "book coming soon" after announcing he had been called for potential jury duty on a big trial.
The two other jurors who will be contenders for the final jury pool are a woman in her 60s who doesn't own a computer, and a 43-year-old man who said that while he's occasionally seen newspaper headlines that suggest Anthony is guilty, he said he is able to set that aside.
Perry said he would begin swearing in jurors once the number of unrejected candidates reaches 15.
Perry said Friday that it is imperative to seat a jury as quickly as possible before more potential jurors are swayed by the media coverage.
