"I already feel like I spend too much time online.
That's how I fell into tweeting: it lets me have a (pseudo) social life during the hours of the day when I'm actually available to chat.
Inspired by my conversation with Leda, I sorted my Twitter buddies so that the people I loved most were in a special group.
As soon as I reorganized Twitter to focus my attention on my most valued relationships, I noticed how many of my dearest pals weren't on Twitter at all: They were on Facebook.
Focusing my phone time on my oldest and dearest friend means that when we talk, we can actually have a meaningful conversation about the latest chapter in our lives, rather than using an hour to catch up on news highlights.
Make that "friends," not friends.
Whether you move every year or plan on living in one place your whole life, an imaginary move is a great way of focusing your email, chat and Facebook time on the people who you love most.
As we compared notes on our jobs, kids and sex lives (like I said, close friends), I found myself looking wistfully at the table next to hours, where four women made up a "Sex and the City" quartet huddled in an intimate conversation.
For those times when you know what kind of social life you want, but budget, time or logistics make it impossible, the Web can be a great pinch hitter.
Maybe you'd like to spend more time with your BFF, but your husband finds her husband dead boring.
