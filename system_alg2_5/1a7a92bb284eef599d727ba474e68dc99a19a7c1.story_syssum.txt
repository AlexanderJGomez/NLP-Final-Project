Washington (CNN) -- A federal appeals court ruled Friday the Transportation Security Administration can still use full-body scanners at airports, but said the agency erred in how it deployed the controversial machines.
But another, more likely scenario is that TSA, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, will go through the public comment and rule-making process.
TSA plans to have more than 1,000 machines in use at airports nationwide by the end of this year.
But the court said the government must weigh "the degree to which (the search) intrudes upon an individual's privacy and... the degree to which it is needed for the promotion of legitimate governmental interests."
"I think the court would have had a very different conclusion" had body scans been mandatory, Rotenberg said.
