Italy is releasing 500 million euros ($720 million) "to give further support to our Libyan friends," Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said.

Debates are set to include the freeing of Libyan assets and what a United Nations mission to Libya would entail, U.S. and Western diplomats said Wednesday.
