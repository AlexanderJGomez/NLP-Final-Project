Sarah Palin's charisma is such that she doesn't need to hold an office to wield influence, Matthew Continetti says.
Before the day she joined the 2008 Republican presidential ticket, Alaskans saw Sarah Palin as a champion of ethics in government who had twice defeated oil interests, governed with Democrats in a bipartisan manner and brought down powerful members of her own party.
Knowing almost nothing of the feisty hockey mom turned political dragon-slayer, some in the media turned rumors -- had Palin supported Patrick Buchanan?
-- into established facts.
Something about Sarah Palin riles people up.
The Palin family's personal legal liability is around half a million dollars.
Meanwhile, the father of her grandchild went on a publicity tour flacking "intimate" details about her family, and David Letterman joked on national television about Alex Rodriguez impregnating her underage daughter Willow.
On July 26, Palin will be a free woman.
She can pick her battles without being hemmed in by the state legislature and bureaucracy.
Two of these three dizzying moves ended up in victory, and one did not.
Speculation about her presidential ambitions is premature, though it will be much easier for her to build a national organization now that she has no professional ties to Alaska.
We will be hearing from Palin, and from the Palin-haters, for a long while to come.
