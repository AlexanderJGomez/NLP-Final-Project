"Although I should've gone to bed this morning, my masters discovered something abnormal with my mechanical control system," said the Xinhua report, in the voice of the Jade Rabbit.
During a lunar night, which lasts about 14 Earth days, the moon's surface temperature can plunge to minus-180 Celsius.
"[Chang'e] doesn't know about my problems yet," said the voice of Yutu in the Xinhua report.
"If I can't be fixed, everyone please comfort her."
Despite the setbacks, even the little Rabbit seemed aware of the odds it had overcome.
"Goodnight, Earth," it said.
