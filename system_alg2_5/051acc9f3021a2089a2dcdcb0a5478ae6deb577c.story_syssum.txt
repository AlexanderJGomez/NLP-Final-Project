(CNN) -- The Miami Heat went cold after 27 consecutive winning games and failed to match the 1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers' winning streak of 33.
It came close to the longest win streak on record of 13 trading sessions in 1987.
After the game, Rose, still 12 games away from Joe DiMaggio's major-league record, fumed that Garber didn't throw fastballs to strike him out.
-The Detroit Lions made a run during the 2008-2009 season at the record for most consecutive games lost.
