Swierczynski is the author of several acclaimed crime thrillers, a regular contributor to Marvel Comics and has collaborated with Anthony E. Zuiker, the Hollywood mastermind behind TV's "CSI" on the series of best-selling, Level 26 "digi-novels."
While Swierczynski hails from Philadelphia, this book is set in Hollywood and takes advantage of a sunny locale loaded with shady people.
(Or am I?
Swierczynski: I love books and movies about hit men.
Swierczynski: Whoever said that is very kind, and I owe them money.
Secret Dead Blog started as a way to share cool stuff with friends, then turned into a place where I can hang with readers and show them cool stuff.
Swierczynski: Absolutely.
CNN: Philadelphia features prominently in much of your writing, but "Fun & Games" switches coasts.
This is how the L.A.-set "Fun & Games" came about; the story just refused to take place anywhere else.
October brings "Hell & Gone," the sequel to "Fun & Games."
And then in late December: "Dark Revelations," my third Level 26 thriller with Anthony E. Zuiker.
