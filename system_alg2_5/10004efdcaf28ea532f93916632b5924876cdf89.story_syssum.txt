Davids, who has been embroiled in a racism row with his country's soccer icon Johan Cruyff, told CNN that the problem is not being addressed despite all the recent publicity surrounding controversial remarks made by FIFA president Sepp Blatter.
Something like that also happened in Holland when Johan Cruyff made a racist comment.
When someone makes a racist remark that doesn't make him a racist, but you have to say, 'This the line, you've crossed it and you have to apologize' -- not only to the person who has been hurt but also the people who live with that racial abuse almost all their lives.
I think that's lacking a bit," said 1995 Champions League winner Davids, who played for AC Milan, Inter Milan, Barcelona, Ajax and Tottenham during his illustrious career.
