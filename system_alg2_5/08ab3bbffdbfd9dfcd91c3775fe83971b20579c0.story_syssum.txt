Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Reports of at least 150 Muslims killed in recent religious clashes in Nigeria should be investigated, a human rights group urged Saturday.
Those interviewed by the group said they thought the attackers were Christian, Human Rights Watch said.
Officials are still tallying death figures in the latest round of violence, said H.A.
On Thursday, Jonathan declared in a televised address that the attackers in the state of Plateau would be held accountable, according to Human Rights Watch.
Hundreds have died in clashes between Christians and Muslims in central Plateau state in the past decade.
