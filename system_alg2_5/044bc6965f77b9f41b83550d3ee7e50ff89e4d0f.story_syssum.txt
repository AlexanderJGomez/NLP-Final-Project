The sweat-stained sheets of Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, still on her bed, a woman quarantined in a Dallas apartment said Thursday that she desperately wants her family's nightmare to end.
Louise told CNN's Cooper by phone that she is checking her temperature every hour, and based on that and everything else, isn't sick.
She said no one brought food Thursday to four people who can't leave to get it themselves, at least until later in the day.
And Louise, her son and her nephews must wait 21 days from when Duncan first showed symptoms before they can leave the apartment.
Judge Clay Jenkins, also director of the county's Homeland Security and Emergency Management, said officials are working on that relocation after Duncan's partner told CNN of being forced to live with distressing living conditions.
"We have some hygiene issues that we are addressing in that apartment," Jenkins said earlier in the day.
"We are working to get the response, which has been a good response, strengthened every hour of the day," the judge said.
On September 25, she took him to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital where, Louise said, hospital staff were told twice that Duncan had come from Liberia.
But Wayne doesn't want his 13-year-old son, who is the youngest person quarantined in the apartment of his mother, Louise -- to know that what he's feeling.
He said that Duncan had come to Texas to "help his son" and visit his family.
Still, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta said the continuing presence of the sheets, on which Duncan may have transmitted the virus through sweating, are disturbing.
One Ebola expert, Dr. Alexander van Tulleken, also said the federal response to the first Ebola case on U.S. soil seemed troubling.
