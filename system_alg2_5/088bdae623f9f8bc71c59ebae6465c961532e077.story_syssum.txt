Coach Nicola Vaughan-Ellis with athletes from Great Britain's powerlifting team.
Our responsibility as coaches is to be the best we can be," Vaughan-Ellis told CNN.
In the run up to the 2012 Olympic Games in London, the desire to develop high caliber coaches is ramping up in the UK, said John Neal of Ashridge Business School, where Vaughan-Ellis took the coaching course.
"We prepare our athletes to be the best in the world.
The program is flexible so coaches can focus on the skills they want to improve.
One measure of its success: Many coaches, like Vaughan-Ellis, participate more than once.
But in return, the business school gets a unique perspective on decision making that is fed back into its executive education programs, Neal said.
She says one of the advantages of the program is that it helps coaches deal with pressure by teaching them how to cope with and embrace change.
