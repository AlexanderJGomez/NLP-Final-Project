(CNN) -- Japan's parliament elected Yoshihiko Noda as the country's new prime minister Tuesday, making him the country's sixth new leader in five years.
"Running Japan's government is like pushing a giant snowball up a snowy, slippery hill," he said Sunday.
On Friday, Prime Minister Kan announced that he would resign.
"Until they see an iceberg, they're not going to do it."
