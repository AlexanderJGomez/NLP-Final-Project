Anton Caluori, 31, was arrested Tuesday at his home in Federal Way, a Seattle, Washington, suburb, Agent Bryan Molnar said in an affidavit.
Molnar said he and Federal Way police officer Andy Hensing went to the apartment complex at the address, where an employee told them Caluori was a "hothead" with a "temper" who lived with his mother.
The third time, a man later identified as Caluori opened the door, Molnar said.
Caluori continued to struggle and would not comply with our commands," Molnar said in the affidavit.
Molnar said one of them asked Caluori if there was anything in the apartment that "would hurt" law officers and he replied, "There are things inside that go boom."
The pistol on his ankle was loaded with "five hollow point .38 special caliber rounds," it said, and about 50 12-gauge shotgun rounds were recovered from the shotgun and the bandoleer.
After reading Caluori his Miranda rights, Molnar asked him if he knew why the police were at the scene.
Call the CIA or run it up the chain of command," Molnar said.
This situation is indicative of how a routine investigation can very easily turn violent," said James Helminski, special agent in charge of U.S. Secret Service in Seattle.
His attorney, Kyana Stephens, would not comment on the case or the charges.
