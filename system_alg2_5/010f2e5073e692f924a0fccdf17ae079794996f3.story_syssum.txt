More than 300,000 customers remained without electricity Monday across Ontario, including 200,000 in Toronto, officials reported, in the wake of what Mayor Rob Ford called one of the worst ice storms to hit the city.
Ford said 100 trucks from other cities were on their way to Toronto to help restore power to more people.
Dangerously cold wind chills were on tap in parts of Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri and Illinois.
New York City set a record high Sunday at 71 degrees, National Weather Service meteorologist Ashley Sears said.
And in northern New England, another round of snow and ice is set for Monday, the National Weather Service said.
Coastal and valley rain as well as mountain snow is in the forecast through Tuesday, the service said.
