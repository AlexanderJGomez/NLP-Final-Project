Kapikoy, Turkey (CNN) -- Hamide Yeni is a woman on the hunt.
The man Yeni is looking for is Faruk Platin, one of the 600 residents of Kapikoy.
But barely two months later, a local criminal court asked that Sidika and her children be handed back to Faruk Platin.
On a snowy day last December, local women's rights activists like Hamide Yeni could do little more then watch helplessly, as Faruk Platin led his mutilated wife away from the courtyard, back to the village where they lived.
Meanwhile, one in ten Turkish women were injured by such violence while pregnant.
Domestic violence against women is not confined to economically-depressed, rural regions of eastern Turkey.
"The law prohibits violence against women, including spousal abuse, but the government did not effectively enforce it," the U.S. State Department said in its 2009 human rights report on Turkey.
Despite widespread violence against women, in 2009 the Turkish government reported there were only 52 state-run shelters for women in the entire country.
Niyazi Yakin, a member of the Kapikoy village council and a relative of Faruk Platin, says he personally asked Sidika if she was being abused, and she said no.
On July 15, Faruk Platin brought his wife to the hospital in Van.
"It looked as if she had been tortured," one Van hospital doctor told CNN, on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to give an interview.
Meral Demirbas, the district governor of Saray, told CNN an arrest warrant has been issued for Faruk Platin, who is on the loose.
In village of Kapikoy, where many residents eke out a living herding sheep, Yeni goes house to house, dressed in a long skirt and loose headscarf, asking locals why they did not speak up about the violence that had been taking place in their community.
"You can still make a call and inform that this woman is being beaten."
