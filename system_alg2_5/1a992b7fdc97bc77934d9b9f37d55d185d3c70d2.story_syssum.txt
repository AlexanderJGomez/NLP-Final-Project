"The talent and knowledge John has acquired in more than two decades of service with the FBI will make him a valuable asset to our administration's efforts to strengthen the security and screening measures at our airports," Obama said in a written statement in May when he announced the nomination.
"John's national security and counterterrorism expertise will be a great asset to the Department in our efforts to enhance the security of our vital transportation systems," Napolitano said in a statement.
His two previous nominees, Los Angeles Airport police department official Erroll Southers and retired Maj. Gen. Robert Harding both removed themselves from consideration for the post.
"Since the last two nominees withdrew, we re-emphasized to Secretary Napolitano the need to select someone who combines a national law enforcement background with credible intel(ligence) experience," Adler said in an e-mail to CNN in May.
