It is still unclear what exactly happened when Sainz, from the Mexican network TV Azteca, entered the Jets locker room last Saturday after practice but Sainz told CNN's Rick Sanchez on Monday that from the moment she entered, she felt all eyes were on her.
"I feel [a] little uncomfortable because evidently it is not easy to be in the locker room and hear and notice that everybody is speaking about you," Sainz said.
"If Jets players, coaches and staff allegedly involved in the incident are found to have acted in unprofessional and harassing behavior toward Ms. Sainz, we expect and demand reprimand and punishment by the NFL and Jets," the association said in a statement.
"Everyone knows that a woman or a man deserves the same treatment in the locker room."
