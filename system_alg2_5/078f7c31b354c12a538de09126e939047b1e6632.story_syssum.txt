The District of Columbia coin honoring Duke Ellington was introduced Tuesday in Washington.
Members of Ellington's family were present at the ceremony, and the jazz band of Duke Ellington High School performed.
Ellington was born in the district in 1899 and composed more than 3,000 songs, including "Satin Doll," "Perdido" and "Don't Get Around Much Any More."
He died in 1974 at the age of 75.
Educator Booker T. Washington, botanist George Washington Carver and the first Revolutionary War casualty, Crispus Attucks, all of whom were black, have also appeared on commemorative coins, according to the U.S. Mint.
