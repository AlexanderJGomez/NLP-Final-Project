"You are going to be on national news," Witherspoon allegedly told a Georgia state trooper as he handcuffed her on Atlanta's Peachtree Road early Friday morning.
The actress canceled plans to do interviews in New York to promote her new film "Mud" on Monday, her publicist said.
"Mrs. Witherspoon began to hang out the window and say that she did not believe that I was a real police officer," Pyland wrote.
"I put my hands on Mrs. Witherspoon's arms to arrest her," Pyland wrote.
"You're about to find out who I am," she replied, the arrest report said.
Their car was impounded, and Witherspoon and Toth were taken to the Atlanta city jail, the report said.
"But I do want to say, I clearly had one drink too many and I am deeply embarrassed about the things I said," the actress said in a statement.
