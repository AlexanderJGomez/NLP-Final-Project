(CNN) -- The king of the South Pacific nation of Tonga died "peacefully" Sunday at a hospital in Hong Kong, a Tongan government official said Monday.
"This king brought in things like mobile phones and other advances that we couldn't dream would come to Tonga, and his push for democracy made a big impact on the people here," Fonua said.
George V ascended to the throne after the death of his father in September 2006 and quickly promised to speed up government reforms demanded by the people.
