But Gen. Rookmangud Katawal has refused to accept his dismissal, and Nepalese President Ram Baran Yadav -- the constitutional commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces -- has told Katawal to remain in office, a presidential spokesman said.
Despite sporadic clashes between the two factions, there were no serious injuries reported.
Pokharel said his party urged the Maoists not to fire Katawal without a consensus in the country's parliament.
The Maoists could continue to hold power with the support of smaller parties, but Pokharel said his party is working to form a new ruling coalition.
