"It's worst at night where there are large lights, but they seem to be everywhere.
"There are always a few crickets around in the summertime, but never a swarm like this," he said.
McBee's own video became popular on CNN iReport.
"I suppose if you have 10,000 dead crickets staring at you, they might seem like a plague," he said.
Similar patterns were observed in Dallas and the southern Great Plains.
While the crickets are not considered an agricultural pest, Grantham said they are definitely a problem when they swarm, especially in commercial areas with bright security lights.
The chirping bugs may have appeared a few weeks earlier this year than last, said Brian Jervis, Tulsa County Extension Horticulturalist.
"With all the lights around, people were having to dodge them," he said.
Grantham said crickets will eat just about anything, including plant material and each other.
Grantham said to give it another week, but some Oklahomans would say the sooner, the better.
