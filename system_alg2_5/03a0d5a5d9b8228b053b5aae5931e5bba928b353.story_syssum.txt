Today, Germany is the world's fourth largest economy, and the most important market in the European Union.
What West Germans found when they entered East Germany was a society marked by high unemployment rate, low productivity and a lot of poverty.
They found opportunities -- not only in the eastern part of their reunified nation, but also in many other former Soviet-bloc countries, like the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia.
Germany turned into one of the world's largest exporters by going even further east to the emerging Asian markets, especially China and India, according to Irwin Collier, professor of economics at Free University Berlin.
"The high Chinese growth rates meant there was enormous demand for German goods."
"The apprenticeship scheme is very important in particular for manufacturing companies because they train people at mid-level skills in a very specific way," said Hassel.
During the 2008-09 financial crisis, the loss of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Germany experienced was large compare to other countries, and even today fluctuations in the world economy are immediately felt in the German economy.
In the quarter of a century that has passed since the Berliners tore down that wall, Germany has, no doubt, become an economic superpower.
