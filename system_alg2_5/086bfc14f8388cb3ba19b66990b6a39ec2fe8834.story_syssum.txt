During the trial, Brancato said there was not a break-in.
Brancato said he knew the owner of the home, and that he and friend Steven Armento, 51, were drinking at a strip club when they decided to go hunt for valium.
The jury in that trial took less than six hours to convict Armento.
As a teen, Brancato starred alongside actor Robert De Niro in "A Bronx Tale."
