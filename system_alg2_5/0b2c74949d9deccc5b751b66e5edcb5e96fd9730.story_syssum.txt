Correa said Ecuador would be cautious about processing any asylum request from Snowden.
We shouldn't make any false assumptions," Correa said.
Assange fears ultimately being transferred to the United States, he said.
Correa said neither he nor officials in Quito authorized travel documents that diplomats in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London issued to Snowden.
Ecuador is turning down trade benefits given by the United States as part of the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act, Ecuadorian officials said.
Snowden worked as a security guard at the U.S. National Security Agency, then in a computer security job with the CIA, and then as an NSA analyst with government contractor Booz Allen Hamilton in Hawaii.
