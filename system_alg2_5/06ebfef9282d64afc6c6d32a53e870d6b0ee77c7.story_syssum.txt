The Legion of Christ order and its lay Regnum Christi Movement asked for forgiveness Thursday for "the reprehensible actions of our founder," the Rev.
The Vatican started an investigation into Maciel's actions in 2004 and concluded in May 2006 that he was guilty of sexual abuse, the group said.
Although leaders at the Legion of Christ knew of the abuse since May 2006, they kept it quiet until this week.

According to the order, the Legion of Christ has a presence in 24 countries.
In the 1980s, the order expanded into more countries in South America and Central Europe.
