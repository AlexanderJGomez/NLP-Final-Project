Cleveland police have slammed Cleveland Browns player Andrew Hawkins for wearing a T-shirt calling for justice in the police shooting of Tamir Rice during a warm-up before Sunday's NFL game against the Cincinnati Bengals.
"The Cleveland Police protect and serve Browns stadium," he said.
Tamir was pointing a pellet gun at people outside a recreation center before he was shot, police said.
The Cleveland Browns' vice president of communications, Peter John-Baptiste, said the NFL team has "great respect" for the work of the Cleveland police.
Crawford was shot and killed by police at a Walmart in Beavercreek on August 5 while carrying an air rifle through the store.
The St. Louis Police Officers Association said it was "profoundly disappointed" after five Rams players raised their hands before a November 30 game in solidarity with protesters upset about Brown's death.
