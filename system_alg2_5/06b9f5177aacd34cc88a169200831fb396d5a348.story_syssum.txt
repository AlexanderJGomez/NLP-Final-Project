(CNN) -- Ten years ago, President Putin of Russia faced an embarrassing foreign policy defeat.
Within a few years, self-destructive squabbling among Ukraine's new democratic leaders, as the economy stagnated, had discredited the "Orange Revolution."
This time the protesters demand he sign an association agreement with the EU that Putin has opposed.
Is Putin-2014 the same person as Putin-2004?
By contrast, Russian troops in Crimea was the one thing certain to unite Kiev's factions, mobilize Ukraine's population and prompt rapid Western action on economic aid.
Even more perverse, invasion would throw away in one day two years' worth of reputational capital, accumulated from a string of unexpected foreign policy successes.
What to make, then, of Putin-2000 who, when asked whether Russia might one day join NATO replied: "Why not?
Over the years, Putin acquiesced to U.S. bases in Central Asia after 9/11, shared intelligence with Washington, agreed to cut nuclear arsenals by two thirds, and defied his own Communist protesters to establish a route through Russia for U.S. military supplies to Afghanistan.
The costs of the Crimean intervention, in reduced investment and international isolation, will last longer than the immediate rally behind the flag.
That after 14 years the leader of an increasingly authoritarian state should start to make mistakes is not surprising.
The result is a distorted view of events that is self-serving and black and white.
Other authoritarian leaders, such as Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, have lost power after calling elections that they were sure they would win.
Yet, the information filter around Putin will make it hard for him to evaluate what is going on.
