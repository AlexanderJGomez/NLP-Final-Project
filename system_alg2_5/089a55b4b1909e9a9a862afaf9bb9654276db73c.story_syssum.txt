(CNN) -- The publication of a report into child abuse in the northern town of Rotherham, England has shocked Britain to the core.
A journalist's investigation into the wider scale of abuse prompted the local council to conduct its own report -- and it's the staggering numbers revealed in Jay's findings that have caught the public's attention.
But a focus on political correctness should not distract from the wider, institutional betrayal of children by police, social services and local politicians.
These crimes were often reported.
When crimes were reported, cases were gathered and reports filed to the council's staff and elected officials.
When the scandal first went public in 2010, the leader of Rotherham's children's services resigned.
He won the election and there are now demands -- including from Labour -- for him to resign.
The report does not name names and it's likely that the social workers and council staff who were so obviously negligent have moved on to jobs in other areas, spreading their incompetence across the country.
Professor Jay did indicate that services have improved at the council but added that it remains understaffed and the long-term victim support inadequate.
But it also employs, even provides cover for, individuals who are negligent.
That is the only effective way to expose those responsible, and to shed light on the Dickensian nightmare playing out in modern Britain.
