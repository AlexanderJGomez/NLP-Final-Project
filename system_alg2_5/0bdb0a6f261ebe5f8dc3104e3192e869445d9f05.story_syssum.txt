(CNN) -- Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf came to power in a bloodless military coup in 1999 when he was chief of Pakistan's army.
But despite early family life in civil service, Musharraf decided on a different career path -- in 1964 he was commissioned second lieutenant in an artillery regiment in the Pakistani Army.
In 2001 Musharraf appointed himself president of Pakistan while remaining the head of the army.
Four months later, Musharraf implemented 29 amendments to the constitution, granting himself the power to dissolve parliament and remove the prime minister.
He brought women into the parliament," said Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, director of the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency.
In October of that year, Musharraf was re-elected president by a parliament critics said was stacked with his supporters.
He allowed Sharif, the prime minister he deposed, to return from exile.
In 2010, further criticism of Musharraf emerged after the United Nations ruled that Bhutto's death could have been prevented had Musharraf's government taken adequate measures to protect her.
Six months later, the coalition moved to impeach Musharraf, who then resigned as president, though he said the allegations of misconduct were false.
In May 2010 Musharraf announced on CNN that he planned to re-enter Pakistan politics and launched a new political party in October of that year.
Chaudhry Zulfiqar Ali, a special public prosecutor in the assassination case, said a Rawalpindi court has already issued an arrest warrant for Musharraf.
Musharraf said that he will return even at the risk of his life.
