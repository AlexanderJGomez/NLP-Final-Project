Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- More than 30 people have been shot dead in Nigeria, the head of Amnesty International said Friday, only a day after the rights group accused Nigerian security forces of committing serious abuses in their efforts to crack down on the militant Islamist group Boko Haram in the region.
"We cannot improve human rights by taking people's lives and for security forces to be themselves beyond the pale of the law is just simply unacceptable."
In its report Thursday, Amnesty International condemned the increasingly brutal attacks carried out by Boko Haram since 2009, but said Nigeria's security forces "have perpetrated serious human rights violations" in their response.
A spokesman for the Nigerian military, Col. Mohammed Yerima, rejected the allegations made in Thursday's report.
He also dismissed allegations made in the report that the military participated in extrajudicial killings of suspects or used torture during interrogations.
There have been fewer attacks by Christian militant groups.
Boko Haram and other Muslim groups claim the north has been starved of resources and marginalized by the government of President Goodluck Jonathan, a Christian.
