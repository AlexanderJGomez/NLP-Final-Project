At their last meeting, on July 13, Rosenbaum said he had been arranging kidney sales for 10 years, the complaint says.
The person, a New Jersey-area resident identified in the complaint as Recipient 2, had paid cash for the kidney a little more than a year before the February 2009 call.
"I prefer you do it with cash," the complaint quotes Rosenbaum as saying.
