(CNN) -- Canadian explorer Adam Shoalts knew he was heading into uncharted territory when he set out on a solo expedition to explore northeastern Canada's remote Again River.
Even Google Earth's low-resolution satellite imagery, all that's available for this remote part of Canada, is deficient for detecting waterfalls.
The first waterfall Shoalts found -- before it was too late to go around it -- was 20-feet high.
"My first thought when I realized I was being swept over a waterfall was, 'Wow!
He resurfaced, out of breath, and spotted his canoe upside down in an eddy near the riverbank.
This week, Shoalts is heading back to the Again River to continue his work for the Royal Canadian Geographical Society (RCGS).
Technology is helping explorers make discoveries in an era when significant finds are incredibly rare.
"The age of exploration will never be truly over -- the oceans, caves, Antarctica, so much of northern Canada -- it will take a long time to explore," he says.
