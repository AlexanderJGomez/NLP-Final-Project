Melissa Goduti of Wallingford, Connecticut, boarded the ship about three hours before it ran aground Friday night, killing at least 11 passengers.
Nancy Lofaro of New Rochelle, New York, said the crew tried to do what they could, "but when we asked them, they said they had no information.
They just didn't have any information to give us."
Fleser said the lifeboat ride to the Tuscan island of Giglio was the last she saw of Costa Cruises employees until she, her husband and daughter reached a hotel in Rome on Saturday.
"The people of the island were wonderful," Fleser said.
The family then boarded a bus to Rome, where they were dropped off at a hotel.
There were two Costa cruise representatives at the hotel, "but every time we asked them if they could do something for us, they said they had no authority," she said.
Before Fleser and her family could make the journey home, they needed new passports to replace those lost on the sinking ship.
A hotel shuttle took Fleser and other Americans to the embassy, she said.
They received a voicemail from Costa saying the family would be reimbursed for the cruise and articles lost on the ship, she said, but the message didn't offer details of how those amounts would be determined.
