President Barack Obama responded on Monday to House Speaker John Boehner's offer to compromise on tax rate increases with his own compromise on both tax increases and spending cuts, according to a source familiar with the discussions.
Hours before news of the president's latest offer emerged, White House spokesman Jay Carney made it clear that more work needed to be done.
"Any movement away from the unrealistic offers the president has made previously is a step in the right direction, but a proposal that includes $1.3 trillion in revenue for only $930 billion in spending cuts cannot be considered balanced," Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said.
Obama's plan, Republican aides said, does not include a 1-1 ratio of spending cuts and revenue.
Obama's proposal includes $130 billion in spending savings due to changes in the CPI.
They are particularly opposed to higher tax rates because history shows that once rates go up, it is difficult to later reduce government revenue by lowering them again.
An aide to Boehner said earlier any such increase would have to be offset by spending cuts and reforms.
