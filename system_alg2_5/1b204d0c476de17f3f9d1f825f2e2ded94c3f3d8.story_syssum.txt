Prosecutor Gerrie Nel has accused the athlete of hiding the truth about the death of Steenkamp, whom he shot last year through a closed toilet door in his home in Pretoria, South Africa.
Pistorius said he thought he heard the toilet door opening before he fired.
Nel then hammered Pistorius on whether he had known Steenkamp was in the toilet when he fired.
Pistorius earlier denied being "ready to shoot" as he made his way to the bathroom where he says he heard what he thought was an intruder.
"I wanted to put myself between the perceived danger and Reeva," he said.
Nel also argued that it was "not possible" that Steenkamp would not have responded when Pistorius screamed to her about what he thought was an intruder in the house, as he has said happened.
Pistorius said he did not.
Nel repeatedly asked him why he hadn't at that point asked Steenkamp whether she too had heard the noise.
More than once, Nel suggested that Pistorius had difficulty remembering what happened because he had made things up.
Nel has previously accused Pistorius of becoming emotional when the questions get difficult.
Pistorius, becoming emotional, replied, "I don't need time.
...
Nel also sought to paint him as selfish and demanded to know why the athlete did not respond to his girlfriend's declaration of love.
"Because it was all about Mr. Pistorius," Nel said.
The trial has gripped South Africa, where Pistorius is considered a symbol of triumph over physical adversity.
South Africa does not have jury trials.
