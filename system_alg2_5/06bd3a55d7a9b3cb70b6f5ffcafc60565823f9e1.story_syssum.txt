New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Seventy-two police officers were killed in an attack early Tuesday by suspected Maoists in eastern India, authorities said.
In February, India's home minister P. Chidambaram acknowledged that more than 900 people, including almost 600 civilians, were killed in Maoist-related incidents in 2009.
Some 200 suspected rebels were also slain as forces moved into areas under insurgent control, he said.
In 2008, 1,591 Maoist rebel attacks killed 721 people, according to government officials.
