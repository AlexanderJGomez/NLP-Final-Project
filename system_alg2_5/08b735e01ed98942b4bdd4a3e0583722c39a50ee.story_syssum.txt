(CNN) -- Even after his debilitating stroke eight years ago, even after all the subsequent public appearances and New Year's Eves when his speech was slurred and his once-impeccable timing seemed to have checked out for eternity, Dick Clark still appeared somehow above and beyond normal physical laws.
Acknowledging them is like sealing a door to youthful paradise when what's now old and obsolete is forever sexy, frisky and fun.
You're likely among those who knew Clark only as somebody your parents and grandparents watched on TV, hovering in a booth over Times Square every New Year's Eve, interrupting some pop music acts to tell people the Ball Was About to Drop on whatever the last calendar year was.
And we kept marking time with "American Bandstand," even as it moved from weekdays to Saturday afternoons and then to California, losing much of the funky charm of its Philadelphia days.
It didn't last long, but Clark, as noted, was unstoppable.
Even as his entertainment empire grew to include radio shows ("Rock, Roll & Remember") and restaurants ("Dick Clark's American Bandstand Grill"), he remained the personable young man keeping the party from getting out of hand.
Another myth, a grail of durability, drifts away, leaving us all feeling a tad more vulnerable -- and, maybe, much emptier -- than we did last New Year's.
