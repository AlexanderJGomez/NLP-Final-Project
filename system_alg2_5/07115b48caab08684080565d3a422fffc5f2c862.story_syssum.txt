(CNN) -- On a cold morning in February, 10 days after undergoing in vitro fertilization, Carolyn Savage lay in bed at her Ohio home waiting for the results of her pregnancy test.
In a tragic mix-up, the Savages say the fertility clinic where Carolyn underwent in vitro fertilization implanted another couple's embryos into Carolyn's uterus.
"He told me, and I think he repeated himself two or three times, and I kept saying 'You're joking.'
At the time, Carolyn was 39 and her chances of having a child naturally after this one were waning.
"That was a scary time for us," said Carolyn.
Eventually, Carolyn became pregnant with the couple's third child, resulting in another difficult pregnancy and premature birth.
February 6 was when they thought they had three of their own embryos implanted by the fertility clinic.
"They didn't choose this path either," Carolyn Savage said of the DNA parents, who declined to speak with media.
They have met with the baby's DNA parents, and according to Carolyn the DNA-related mother of the child has come along for one doctor's appointment.
The Savages say the five embryos they originally had cryogenically preserved at the clinic in Ohio are still unused and have been moved to another clinic in Atlanta, Georgia.
Still, even if a surrogate can eventually help them expand their family, the Savages say that the memory of the child they gave up will always linger.
