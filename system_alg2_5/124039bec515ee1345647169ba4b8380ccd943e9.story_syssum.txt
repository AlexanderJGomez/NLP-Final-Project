Solar panels similar to these are bringing renewable and regular power to two clinics in Iraq.
Only two other clinics in all of Iraq have been given access to the same technology.
Before we visited, someone tampered with a key circuit board and that's preventing the clinic from using electricity still being stored in the batteries.
He fully expects the solar panels will be powering the clinic again within a few days.
