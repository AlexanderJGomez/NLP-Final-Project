"I do not want him with Nicolas Cage," Fulton said.
Weston Cage, in a statement delivered through his father's lawyer Friday afternoon, said that he did not want his mother to be involved in his care.
"My son is under a spell, he's under a trance," Fulton said.
A member of that team of caregivers was Kevin Villegas, whom Fulton hired as her son's personal wrestling coach when he was in high school.
She said she fired Villegas three years ago, but Nicolas Cage rehired him.
"For 18 years, I raised Weston so Nicolas could go be Nicolas Cage, and go be a superstar, and he did," she said.
"My son right now has been under the care of Nicolas," she said.
"Ms. Fulton comments about Mr. Cage are absurd and it's very unfortunate that she would lash out like this because her son does not want to have anything to do with her," Singer said.
"I'd like my son to be with his mom, where it worked," Fulton said.
Why would you mess with that?
