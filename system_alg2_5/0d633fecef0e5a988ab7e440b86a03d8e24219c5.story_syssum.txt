(CNN) -- For Dr. Lisa Newman, a 16-hour trip over two days from Michigan to Ghana in Africa is just part of the journey in uncovering clues about a rare form of breast cancer.
Triple negative breast cancer represents approximately 15 percent of breast cancer cases in the United States.
But statistics show that black women are twice as likely as white women to get it.
Sixty percent of Ghanaian women who have breast cancer have triple negative breast cancer, according to Newman.
Newman is convinced there's a profound link between Ghanaian women and African-American women afflicted with TNBC.
"And our colleagues from Ghana have opportunities to visit with us at the University of Michigan, and to learn more about westernized practices in terms of multidisciplinary care of breast cancer patients.

Back in the United States, Newman gathers samples at a local Detroit, Michigan, hospital and at events held by the Sisters Network, an organization for black breast cancer survivors.
