Washington (CNN) -- Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan received critical cover from moderate Republicans on Thursday on two issues likely to dominate her upcoming confirmation hearings: gays in the military and judicial experience.
Massachusetts GOP Sen. Scott Brown -- who broke the Democrats' 60-member filibuster-proof majority by winning the late Ted Kennedy's seat in January -- said after meeting with Kagan that he is satisfied she supports members of the military.
Earlier in the day, Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins said she doesn't have any concerns about Kagan's experience.
Specter said Kagan may be open to the idea of allowing television coverage of Supreme Court hearings.
"She said it'd be helpful to the public and to the court," he said.
Specter has not said how he will vote on her Supreme Court nomination.
Obama nominated Kagan on Monday to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens.
