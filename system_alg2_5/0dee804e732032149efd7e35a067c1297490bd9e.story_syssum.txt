Climate change is driven by emissions of a range of heat-trapping gases, especially the total emissions of carbon dioxide, which have been pumping out since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.
In 2012, carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. were 19.4 tons per person or about 750 pounds per person per week.
With every passing year, the pool of total carbon dioxide emissions grows bigger, causing more warming -- and more warming leads to greater damages from climate, weather extremes like heat waves, heavy rainfall, and coastal storm surge, as well as altered crop yields, threats to human health, and increased risks of wildfire.
The global energy system producing most of the carbon dioxide emissions is massive, and includes thousands of power plants and more than a billion vehicles.
As things stand now, these realities commit us to continuing emissions into the future.
Why is U.S. leadership so important?
Second, the U.S. is the only nation that can truly focus the world's attention on the climate problem.
