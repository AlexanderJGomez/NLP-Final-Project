(CNN) -- Brian Flynn, brother of a victim aboard downed Pan Am Flight 103, said Thursday that the killing of former Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi is a moment of justice.
Flynn's brother, John Patrick, was one of 35 university students killed in the tragedy.
"Today is an example that after 22 years, finally justice is done.
"Part of me thinks this story had to end this way," Flynn added, referring to the former Libyan leader's being killed rather than captured.
But a Libyan envoy said the new government is not likely to send him back.
In 2006, the scope of the archives was expanded to include items pertaining to all 270 victims.
