(CNN) -- A graduate student is suing a Georgia university, alleging that professors are requiring her to change her "biblical views" on homosexuality or be expelled from the counseling program there.
No student is asked to change their religious beliefs or views in order to participate in any program."
"Talking to others -- espousing ideas about homosexuality or other beliefs is a behavior," Martz said.
French said the remediation program itself seeks to change Keeton's beliefs.
French said the counseling department has imposed its own set of values to "cleanse" Christianity from students' belief system, violating its own ethics code.
Nevins said Keeton's or anyone's belief system had to be "pushed to one side."
