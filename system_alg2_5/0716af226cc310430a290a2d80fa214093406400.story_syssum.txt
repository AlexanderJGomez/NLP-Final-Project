The Scottish accent is like no other.
All of this got us talking this week about which accents we like most.
So we decided to hold a vote of our own -- a Facebook poll to ask which accents you prefer.
You know which one we're talking about.
With its own pronunciation of Spanish letters ("ll" sounds like "shh") and its own words ("you" is "vos"), this is a dialect that's hard to get.
With five tones comprising their native speech, the traffickers of this often fragile accent turn any language into a song of seduction.
Perhaps owing to its freedom from French influence, the Brazilian Portuguese accent has a more colorful, puerile flair than its coarser European counterpart.
