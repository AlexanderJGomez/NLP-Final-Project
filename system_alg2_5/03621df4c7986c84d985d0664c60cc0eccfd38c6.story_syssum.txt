The terrorist attacks in Volgograd on December 29 and 30 are an ominous sign that the decision to hold the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi may lead to one of the greatest catastrophes in the history of the Olympics.
In Volgograd, the local police are being flooded with reports about supposed new explosions and a number of factories have requisitioned buses to transport their employees to and from work.
At the same time, the Islamist insurrection was growing in the North Caucasus, directly adjacent to the proposed Olympic sites.
After the killing by Russian forces in 2005 of the Chechen separatist leader Aslan Maskhadov, power passed to Doku Umarov, a Chechen field commander who announced that he was beginning a holy war to create an Islamic state from the Black Sea to the Caspian.
Visitors to the Sochi Olympics now face several dangers that would have been avoided had the Olympic committee chosen a different location.
In addition to the danger from terrorists, however, there is also a danger from the Russian forces.
Because of the irresponsibility of the Olympic Committee in indulging Putin's desire for a propaganda spectacular, the stage may now be set for there to be many more.
