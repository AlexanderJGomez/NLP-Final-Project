From fighting terrorism to processing payments in the blink of an eye, facial recognition is set to change our ideas on privacy.
A professor at the University of Kent, Solomon has created an "electronic sketch artist" system that has changed how UK police identify criminals.
But facial recognition technology isn't always so straightforward.
Identifying faces from closed-circuit-television (CCTV) footage can be challenging -- as demonstrated after the Boston Marathon bombings earlier this year.
UK-based company NEC IT Solutions, which also specializes in identification of terrorists and criminals, has created a system that analyzes the faces of potential customers as they enter shops.
A Finnish company, meanwhile, aims to streamline sales by using facial recognition technology for payments.
Facial recognition is secure by nature and is fundamentally a biometric technology since you need to be in the store to use the technology."
Amie Stepanovich, the director of the domestic surveillance project at the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington D.C. argues that Facebook has the largest biometric database in the world, which could eventually compromise its users.
