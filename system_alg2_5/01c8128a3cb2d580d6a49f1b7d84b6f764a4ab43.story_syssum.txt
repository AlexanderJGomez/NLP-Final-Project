Those of us who know Newt Gingrich tend to describe him as not only intelligent but also charming.
He wanted to know, "How many of you earned some money doing something before you were 10 years old, whether it was cutting grass or babysitting or something?"
Talk to hugely successful people, Gingrich said, and most of them will say that they got an early start learning about jobs and responsibility and earning money for their labor.
Or you can say that many of these teenagers are unemployable because no one ever taught them the skills necessary to hold down a job.
This isn't just a problem for black Americans; it's a problem for all Americans.
Upper-middle class kids can be harder to motivate, especially if they've never been taught to work by their parents.
Whenever I write about young people and the jobs they won't do, I hear from dozens of employers with stories of their own.
Today, parents find it easier to skip the chores and buy their kids what they want, which is no good for anyone and no good for society.
Newt Gingrich had the courage to mention the problem of America's vanishing work ethic, and emphasize the need to restore it.
