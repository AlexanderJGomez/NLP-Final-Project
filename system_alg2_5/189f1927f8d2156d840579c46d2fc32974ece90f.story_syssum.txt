Now it's seeking public help to keep Hong Kong's neon heritage ablaze.
"It was a no-brainer for us to collect neon signs," he says.
"Neon signage is a highly under-researched topic," says Chen.
One reason is a government crackdown on illegal and unsafe structures that in 2009 led to the removal of about 5,000 signboards, many of them neon.
Yau, a curator for Hong Kong's Heritage Museum before taking up post at the URA, is sorry to see the cow go, but says: "Life has to move on.
The lights are tricky and expensive to make, requiring a neon tube-bending technician and, for something like the neon cow, a budget of HK$250,000 ($32,225).
"Many cities in China no longer support neon signage and this inevitably affects Hong Kong's businesses," says Tam.
In terms of quantity, neon will recede.
