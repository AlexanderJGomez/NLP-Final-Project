(CNN)  -- I am Shane Stanford.
A race against time.
Certainly, the race has never been easy.
And, oddly enough, I would not trade it with anyone.
Real meaning is discovered through the composition of life's diversity.
I run to make life matter, seeking more than the right way to go, but actually going there and watching the race mean something.
