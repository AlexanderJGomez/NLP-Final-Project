"I'm not suggesting a failed state," Jalal Yaqoub said.
Yemen has become a major new battleground for al Qaeda, but Yaqoub denied it could become a "failed state" with no effective central government, like Somalia.
Yaqoub said it "would not surprise" him if the United States increased its covert activities in his country in the wake of the foiled bomb plot, but that "as a Yemeni citizen"  he did not like the idea of unmanned U.S. drones.
A U.S. official said Monday the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency continues to expand its intelligence operations in Yemen with more operatives and analysts working closely with the Yemen government and other U.S. partners inside the country.
Regarding the threat of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula compared to al Qaeda Pakistan, the official said "this is not a zero sum game."
Al Qaeda in Pakistan encourages AQAP to carry out attacks.
Both officials said it is still unclear the intent of the cargo plot, this is whether the bombs were to explode in the planes or at the synagogues or had another purpose.
