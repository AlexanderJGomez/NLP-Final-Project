Atlanta (CNN) -- More than two dozen college players on three major Division I football teams staged an unauthorized protest of the NCAA during their games Saturday.
CNN caught up with two other players who wore APU on their gear after the Georgia Tech game.
Huma, the NCPA president, later told CNN that he hadn't heard of any players being disciplined for wearing the gear.
"This is big business.
Dent said he's particularly troubled by the fact that the NCAA can cut short a player's education if they get hurt.
A former UCLA linebacker, Huma told CNN he started the NCPA in 2001 after he watched a teammate get suspended by the NCAA for accepting groceries -- a violation of the rule that athletes can't accept gifts.
"We feel like we're on the right side of the argument and we're going to succeed."
