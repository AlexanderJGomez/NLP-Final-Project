Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Seven female workers were killed Saturday afternoon in yet another fire at a clothing factory in Bangladesh's capital, police said.
The Smart Fashions Limited factory employed more than 300 workers and did not have proper fire safety measures, according to a fire service and civil defense official.
Bangladeshi-made garments make up 80% of the nation's $24 billion in annual exports.
The sector earned $19 billion in the last financial year, which ended in June 2012.
