NEW YORK (CNN) -- I think I am developing a crush on America's first lady.
It's the people's house, and Michelle Obama totally gets it.
Watch her when she visits a local school and you see the warmth and affection she instantly triggers in people.
New to the Washington neighborhood, Michelle Obama has taken it upon herself to go around and introduce herself to the people in the various agencies of government.
She was raised on the south side of Chicago by blue-collar parents.
She knows exactly who she is.
And the reviews were rave.
The first lady has bare arms in Congress in February at night!"
