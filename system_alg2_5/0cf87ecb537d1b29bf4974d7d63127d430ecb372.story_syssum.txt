(CNN) -- For many families, the school year just started, but for Karen Suffern, it's not too early to start planning for Christmas.
Suffern felt tears fill her eyes as she read her son's letter asking Santa to help stop the bullying his overweight sister was experiencing at school.
"I try to build up my daughter's self-esteem and tell her she is beautiful, but people say hurtful things to me, because I also have a weight problem, and that hurts me," she said.
"Every day when she goes to school, she says, 'Mommy, can I just stay at home?'
And now every time I send her to school, I feel like I am not protecting her and I am letting her down," Suffern said.
A study released Monday in the journal Pediatrics says there is an association between being bullied and psychosomatic problems, meaning children who are bullied run the risk of higher mental problems that can cause them physical distress.
"
And Suffern says she is glad to have a selfless son like Ryan -- plus Santa -- watching out for Amber, too.
We are saddened that this has taken place within our school family, and we can assure all of our parents, scholars and community that we will continue to do everything possible to provide them with a positive and safe learning environment."
