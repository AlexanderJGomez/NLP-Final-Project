So who could resist the touching story of the New York policeman who, seeing a homeless man sitting barefoot in the cold, walked into a shoe store and bought him a new pair of all-weather boots?
Hillman, who became much less famous than his benefactor, is barefoot once again.
New York City officials say Hillman has had an apartment but, for some reason, returns to the streets.
He has shoes now.
The explanation is not important.
What matters is that Hillman, like thousands of others, in the street, in a country that, despite all its economic challenges, remains the richest nation the world has seen.
But they are also about the soul of the nation.
The U.K.-based Charities Aid Foundation, says Americans are the most generous people on earth.
In Atlanta, just down the street from CNN's headquarters, drivers can spot homeless camps under highway overpasses.
An estimate of homelessness in Paris about a decade ago put the number there at 12,000.
According to those figures, New York has one homeless person for every 2,506 people, compared with one for every 259 in San Francisco.
In Sweden, a determined government effort brought the number of people living in the streets to just 280, with thousands receiving help in alternative housing.
The Christmas Miracle story of the police officer and the homeless man faded in an Internet minute.
Not for any of the homeless people in the streets of New York or Paris, Stockholm or Atlanta, whom we glimpse briefly as we move on with our lives.
But the more effective act of generosity, the real miracle, would come if the millions looking at the picture of the generous police officer trying to help a man in need wrote the perfect Chapter 3, pushing for better mental health services, more affordable housing, more job training.
