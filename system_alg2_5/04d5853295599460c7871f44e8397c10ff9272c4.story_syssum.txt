The flags are already out across the United Kingdom and CNN will be at the heart of action as the country gears up for a long weekend of revelry from June 2-5.
Later, the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall, The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry will join the queen and Prince Philip for a Diamond Jubilee lunch provided at Westminster Hall.
Following their meal, a carriage procession will convey the royal party to Buckingham palace.
During the central Diamond Jubilee weekend itself we will see most of the royal family in attendance as well as political heads like British Prime Minister David Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.
During the Diamond Jubilee year, the queen has embarked on a tour of the United Kingdom traveling as widely as possible.
Other members of the royal family to undertake trips to Commonwealth countries, Crown Dependencies and British Overseas Territories will include Prince Charles and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall; Prince William and his wife Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge; Prince Andrew, the Duke of York; The Earl and Countess of Wessex; the Duke of Gloucester and the Duke of Kent.
