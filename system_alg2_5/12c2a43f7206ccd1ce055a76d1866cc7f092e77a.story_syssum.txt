ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Four prominent neurologists say they cannot see how Sen. Pete Domenici can continue his work as a U.S. senator given his diagnosis with frontotemporal lobar degeneration, a type of dementia.
"They would be prone to have poor judgment and make mistakes," Knopman said.

A stockbroker wouldn't be able to make the best investments for their clients," he said.
"Someone who's usually very adept and in touch with people might suddenly make inappropriate or caustic comments, like they might refer to someone who's overweight as 'fatty,'" Knopman says.
He added patients often don't want to leave work.
