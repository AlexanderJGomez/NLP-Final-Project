Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- Sitting down with the protesters in Gezi Park, the message to the government from demonstrators, young and old, seems simple enough: Don't try to control us.
But for many Turks now massing in the park and on Taksim Square, a new mall is more than just another eyesore; it is a symbol of autocratic rule from a government that, in their view, is harking back to bygone days when this city -- once considered a gateway to Asia -- was ruled by emperors.
Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted party Justice and Development Party further infuriated demonstrators by labelling them "a few looters," adding that the protests in Istanbul and Turkey's capital, Ankara, are the work of opposition extremists trying to challenge the government.
Metehan, 19, a university student studying English literature, believes the government's latest policy initiatives and the "brutal" measures taken by police are a true reflection of the state of Turkish democracy.
"He [Erdogan] is starting to define people as alcoholics if they drink," she said in a reference to the recent enactment of stricter alcohol controls.
The government is turning Turkey into a police state and this worries me."
