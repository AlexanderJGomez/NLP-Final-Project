Reeves had been held in the Pasco County jail without bond since he shot and killed 43-year-old Navy veteran Chad Oulson after a confrontation over Oulson's text messaging inside a movie theater in the Tampa suburb of Wesley Chapel.
"He ripped her family apart and now he can be home, be in his own bed, and see his children and grandchildren," said T.J. Grimaldi, Nicole Oulson's attorney.
Soon after that, a "very agitated" Reeves left the theater, then returned a few minutes later.
But Grimaldi warned Friday that with Reeves back on the street, it could happen again.
