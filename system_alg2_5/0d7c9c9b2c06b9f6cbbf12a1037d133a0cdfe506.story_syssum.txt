Instead all Americans -- no matter what income level they have and no matter what neighborhood they live in -- are getting bigger because food is cheaper than ever before, the study authors say.
That means Americans aren't just eating more high-calorie food, they are eating more of a variety of foods.
And Americans have more access to fruits and vegetables," said Roland Sturm who is a senior economist at the RAND Corporation.
"What this article reinforces is that we need to continue our research to find what combination of strategies will be most effective long term in helping all of us live healthier lives," said Colleen Doyle, director of nutrition and physical activity for the American Cancer Society.
"No one thing is the solution to this problem we are having," Doyle said.
Agriculture policy "has a huge impact on what people eat," said study co-author An Ruopeng.
"The markets were successful in solving a really old problem" of food scarcity.
It will take more than public policy to end the obesity epidemic, the study authors say.
But maybe in the future we will look at that behavior like we do about public smoking."
