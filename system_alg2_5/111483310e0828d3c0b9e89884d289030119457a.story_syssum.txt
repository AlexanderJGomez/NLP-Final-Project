If she succeeds, she will have gone one better than the great Zenyatta, who faltered at the 20th attempt.
The Black Caviar phenomenon has gripped a sports-mad Australian public.
In June, Black Caviar will get the chance to test herself against the best in the world when she travels to England for the Diamond Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot.
The only horse in the world with a higher rating than Black Caviar, the inevitable clamor for a showdown between the two best horses in the world is likely to reach deafening pitch should Black Caviar win again on Sunday.
Both horses are huge (Black Caviar stands at 16.2 HH while Zenyatta stood at a carthorse-like 17.2 HH), and their hulking frames meant they were each only lightly raced in their early years (larger horses usually take longer to develop).
Black Caviar was named by one of her owners, Pam Hawkes, who has a taste for the delicacy.
