Sonia Sotomayor is virtually sure to be confirmed by the Democratic-dominated Senate, analysts say.
A senior White House official told CNN that Sotomayor was "nominated by George [H.W.]
Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will first consider Sotomayor's nomination, called her record exemplary for a candidate to succeed retiring Justice David Souter -- a liberal voice on the high court.
However, CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin noted that he hasn't heard any Republicans come out and say they will vote against her, noting that in past nominations, some have come out of the gate outright against the nominees.
Because we don't 'make law'...
"And so it's kind of interesting because in a way, I think they intend to use more of her speeches and her appearances than lots of her court decisions."
Republicans also must be careful about whether unfair scrutiny or personal attacks could backfire, Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele told CNN when asked about possibly harming his party's Hispanic outreach by opposing Sotomayor.
Obama has said he wants Sotomayor confirmed before the Senate goes on its August break to ensure that Sotomayor, if confirmed, can be seated with the Supreme Court when it begins its new session in October.
Senate Republicans, however, want to allow time for an upcoming Supreme Court decision on an appellate ruling by Sotomayor in an affirmative action case involving New Haven, Connecticut, firefighters.
In the New Haven case, a three-judge appellate panel that included Sotomayor upheld a lower court ruling that supported the decision of New Haven officials to throw out results of promotional exams that they said left too few minorities qualified.
