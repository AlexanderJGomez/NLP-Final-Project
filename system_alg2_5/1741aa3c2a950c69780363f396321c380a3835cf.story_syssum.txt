Health officials are looking for the cause of a neurologic illness that's affected 10 children in Colorado.
Most of the children experienced a respiratory illness before being admitted to the hospital, although only two had a history of asthma.
The CDC is investigating the cause of these symptoms.
Of those six, four tested positive for enterovirus D68, which has been sending children across North America to the hospital with severe respiratory illnesses.
Samples from two of the children tested positive for enterovirus D68.
These can cause hand, foot and mouth disease; viral meningitis; encephalitis (inflammation of the brain); an infection of the heart; and paralysis in some patients.
Children's Hospital Colorado has treated over 4,000 children with severe respiratory illness since August 18, said Dr. Chris Nyquist, medical director for Infection Prevention and Control.
CNN affiliate WCBS reported Friday that a New Jersey toddler died last week from a severe respiratory illness and that the CDC will be testing samples to see whether he had enterovirus D68.
