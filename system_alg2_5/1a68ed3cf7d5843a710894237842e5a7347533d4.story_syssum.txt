Beach volleyball players, particularly Olympians, are known all around the world for their incredible skill with the ball.
With its Olympic popularity, athletic trainers say you can bet you will see a lot more of the tape at your local gym or on the playing field this year.
Because the tape is thin and pliable, it's different from athletic tape used on ankles or wrists, he says.
He thought the standard taping methods of the time were too restrictive and may even extend injuries, because they inhibited the flow of inflammatory fluids beneath the skin.
The company has trained more than 100,000 practitioners around the world on how to use the tape, Halpern says.
"A lot of athletes like it because there are no chemicals and it is a natural healing mechanism that tells different receptors to deactivate a little bit if the muscle gets too tight," Halpern says.
When people see athletes who are doing so well, they think, 'Maybe this could work for me,'" he says.
Rogers says he hasn't used the tape in any races yet.
"I have hamstring issues and I kept trying it, but the stuff just wouldn't stick to me," she says.
It's pretty-colored cotton tape."
