Vardzia, Georgia (CNN) -- In an isolated mountain valley on the southern edge of the former Soviet Union stands a cliff honey-combed with caves.
One of the monks who lives in the cliff is Father Lazar.
"In the winter this is a quiet place.
In fact, Father Lazar says aside from the monks, the only other people who live in this valley, are the nuns who inhabit a small convent beyond a bend in the river.
"For the priests, it is not very good because they make a lot of noise," Father Lazar says.
And we are going to build a 4-star hotel and villas also."
"During the Soviet era, Georgia was the number one tourist attraction for almost all the Soviet Union," said Nika Gilauri, the prime minister of Georgia, in an interview with CNN.
"It's a bad idea to build a big hotel right there, directly across from Vardzia," he says.
"If there's going to be a bar or a night club there, then that's also not good."
