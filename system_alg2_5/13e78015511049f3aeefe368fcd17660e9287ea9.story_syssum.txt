Facing skeptical legislators from both parties, Kerry tried to assure them that he shares their mistrust of Iran while asking that they halt the drive for new sanctions for now to give negotiations, which also involve the other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany, a chance to succeed.
A bipartisan group of Senators is working on new sanctions legislation and the House may consider a similar measure, prompted by concern that the interim agreement eased some sanctions without achieving the goal of ridding Iran of its centrifuges and other technology needed to build a nuclear bomb.
"They know that if they fail, sanctions will be increased," Kerry said of Iran.
Israel opposes that deal because it allows Iran -- a longtime enemy of  the Jewish state -- to continue enriching uranium needed to develop nuclear weapons.
Others used more graphic language, with GOP Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama comparing Iran's threats against Israel to Nazi Germany.
Obama said over the weekend that he would accept a peaceful nuclear program in Iran, including modest uranium enrichment.
"Unfortunately, the interim agreement raises some questions about this," he said.
Under the agreement, they can't have highly enriched uranium."
