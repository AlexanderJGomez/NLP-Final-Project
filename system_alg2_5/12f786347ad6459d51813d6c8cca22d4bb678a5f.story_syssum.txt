Gina, the owner of a busy graphic design firm, started giving herself -- and her employees -- four-day workweeks after she had knee surgery and found it tough to get around.
"They were using the extra day off to spend time with their families, do errands and take long weekends away, but also to schedule appointments they might otherwise have taken an afternoon off to attend," Gina said.
By most accounts, the American workweek is now at its most saturated: Nearly 86% of American men and 67% of women work more than 40 hours in any given week, in the name of productivity, financial necessity and, according to at least one study, happiness.
Much was made of the rumor, which Facebook would neither confirm nor deny, despite the fact that many working mothers around the country routinely, and increasingly, negotiate four-day workweeks.
When Utah introduced four-day workweeks for many of its state employees in 2008, it boosted productivity and worker satisfaction.
Though unlikely to affect higher-ups like Mendelsohn, the four-day week tends to work best when the entire office is involved.
One reason many employees may feel reluctant to take on a four-day week is because of the fear of "missing out" on access to the boss or to the flow of ideas and information.
Instead of providing some relief, the flexible hours that were Mary's, and Mary's alone, only made her that much more anxious.
Three years later, Gina's knee is healed but the four-day workweek remains.
Now I joke that blowing out my knee was the best career move I ever made."
