(CNN) -- The puppeteer who gave Sesame Street's Elmo his voice allegedly threw a crystal meth sex party for a teenage boy in 2004, according to a federal lawsuit filed this week.
Three other men soon emerged with federal lawsuits, filed last November and December, accusing Clash of befriending them as teenager then engaging in sex with them.
While the allegations in the newest suit mirror what the other men contend, Stephens' complaint is the only one to allege drug use by Clash.
"Clash smoked crystal meth while engaging in sexual activity with Sheldon," the lawsuit said.
Clash resigned from his job on "Sesame Street" after the first lawsuit was filed in November.
