When Beckham announced his decision to retire from football Thursday, there was one man who had already anticipated such an event.
"I think that being away from his family, them being in London and him being in Paris, was difficult for him.
I just had a feeling he might retire."
"The kids have moved across the world and I think he wanted them to have some stability," added Clement.
"It was great to have him around and talk, but I've got my family here and that's been so good for me.
"He's just a normal guy," said Clement.
"It was great to have him around.
But he might have been a bit-part player next season or had to move to another club and I think he wanted to go out at the very top.
"It's nice to work with good players," said Clement.
"But it's more important to work with good people."
