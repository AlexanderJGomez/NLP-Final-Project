District Court Judge Jackie Glass sentenced four O.J.
Before announcing the suspended sentences Tuesday, Glass said the actions of Cashmore, Erlich, McClinton and Alexander were "stupid but also criminal" when they accompanied the former football star to the Palace Station Hotel and Casino on September 13, 2007.
The four apologized to the state and the victims in the case before their sentences were read in court Tuesday.
Glass ordered Fromong removed from the courtroom Tuesday after he made a comment during the sentencing of McClinton, who admitted brandishing a gun in the hotel room.
He'll remain jailed while an appeal is pending.
