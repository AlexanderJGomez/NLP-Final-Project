New York (CNN) -- New York City's Board of Health voted Thursday to ban the sale of sugary drinks in containers larger than 16 ounces in restaurants and other venues, in a move meant to combat obesity and encourage residents to live healthier lifestyles.
New York City spends an estimated $4 billion each year on medical care for overweight people, the mayor said in an earlier statement.
