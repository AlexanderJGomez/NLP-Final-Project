Bush has said he is aware that the opening of his presidential library would reopen debates over the Iraq War and the policies he pursued after the September 11 terrorist attacks.
History will show, he said at the dedication, that he always stuck by his convictions.
The last time the five living presidents were together was right before President Obama took office.
"That's what President George W. Bush chose to do," Obama said.
In an interview with CNN's John King, the former president said he knows that the center's dedication will rekindle the debate about his presidency, and he conceded the library is in part an effort by him and supporters to influence history's verdict.
"I know this: that Laura and I gave the presidency eight years of our life.
As the son of another former president, Bush said he wouldn't mind seeing his brother Jeb Bush run for the highest office.
But in an interview Thursday on NBC's "Today," former first lady Barbara Bush said that while Jeb Bush is able to do the job, she would like to see other families in the White House.
