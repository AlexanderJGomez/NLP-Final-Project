U.S. President Barack Obama's proposal to raise the federal minimum wage from the current $7.25 to $10 per hour seems blocked by Congress, but individual states and cities are raising minimum wages within their jurisdictions -- Seattle's mayor, for example, proposes a new $15 minimum.
The main argument against the minimum wage is that it destroys jobs, harming those it sets out to help.
But this does not happen at the current levels of minimum wages in many countries.
So yes, the minimum wage does help low-paid workers -- it raises their earnings without harming their job prospects.
And many poor households do not contain minimum wage workers.
In some places, these political pressures seem likely to lead to minimum wages much higher than we have seen in recent experience, perhaps around 60% of median earnings.
