KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai said Sunday that his country would join the strategic review of the U.S.-led war on terrorism.
"President Obama and Secretary Clinton and the United States government were very gratified to hear President Karzai reaffirm his support of the August 20 decision," Holbrooke said.
At the same time, Karzai said the actions of troops currently in Afghanistan have turned some of the public against them.
It's the question of home searches," he said.
"We have traveled many years on.
Speaking via satellite from Kabul, Karzai called former President George Bush "a great person," but said he can work with Obama -- despite the president's comments as a candidate that Karzai had "not gotten out of the bunker" to improve security and infrastructure in Afghanistan.
"Sure, corruption in the Afghan government is as much there as in any other third world country," he said.
Suddenly there were projects -- suddenly there were this poverty that turned into some sort form of prosperity for this country," he said.
