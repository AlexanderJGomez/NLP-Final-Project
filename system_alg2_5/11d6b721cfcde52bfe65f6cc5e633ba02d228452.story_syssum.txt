She was terrified that someone would find her boys acting suspiciously and one of them would end up being killed.
But based on my experience defending young black men in the criminal justice system for 30 years, I know her fears are not without foundation.
Here's what we do know: A police officer and a black man interacted, multiple shots were fired, and Michael Brown was 35 feet away from the police car when struck by the shots that killed him.
If Brown was shot from far away, or if he was shot in the back, it would provide strong evidence that he was retreating -- that the officer was not in imminent fear -- and that the shooting was not justified.
For many in the black community the reality of the criminal justice system doesn't measure up to the ideal.
Many believe that the criminal justice system, from first police interaction to verdict, is infected with a racial bias that taints the possibility of justice as it should be defined.
Consider the very first interactions: A cop and young black male interact on the street, and both give the other a bit of attitude.
And if you want to say the young man is at fault for disrespect or mistrust of a cop's authority, you are right.
To break this cycle, police must recognize there is bias in the system, and they make an effort to treat the people they serve with respect.
And we must understand the grave reality that the way we engage a police officer can affect whether we walk away, whether we are driven away in handcuffs, or whether we are taken away on a stretcher.
Let's see what we can accomplish if we focus on breaking that cycle.
