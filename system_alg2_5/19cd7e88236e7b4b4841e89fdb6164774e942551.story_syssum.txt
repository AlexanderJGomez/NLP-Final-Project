CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- With the retirement of Justice David Souter, President Obama has the opportunity to bring a special kind of diversity to the Supreme Court: the diversity of broad and varied governmental experience.
Many commentators have noted that this is the first Supreme Court in American history in which every justice has come from exactly the same job: judge on the U.S.
For the first time in American history, not a single justice has ever held -- or even run for -- any elective office at any level of government.
For the first time in American history, eight of the nine justices attended one of only two law schools: Harvard or Yale.
The cases that come to the Supreme Court are there precisely because they fall between the cracks of established legal doctrine.
The Court decided 72 cases.
The best example of how there is no single "judge's answer" to Supreme Court issues can be found in the eight death penalty cases decided during the 2006 term.
That is why it is self-defeating to restrict the range of possible Supreme Court nominees to the small group of sitting federal appellate judges.
We should welcome, and not irrationally restrict, the variety of experience that can be brought to Supreme Court decision-making.
