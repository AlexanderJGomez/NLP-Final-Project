The first defense witness called was Sgt.
Padgett was the senior enlisted man on the night shift in the intelligence office where Manning worked.
At that point another soldier came in the room, subdued Manning, sat him down and Padgett continued counseling him, Padgett testified.
Prosecution witnesses testified that Manning downloaded and leaked 400,000 DoD field reports from Iraq and 90,0000 similar documents from Afghanistan.
For a short time in December 2009, he was an officer in the intelligence analysis office where Manning worked.
The investigating officer overseeing the case granted those ten and two other defense witnesses who were not on the prosecution list.
Mark Zaid, a national security attorney, said the fact the defense called only two witnesses is not surprising.
After that the Investigating Officer, Lt. Col. Paul Almanza, who oversaw the hearing, will consider the testimony and evidence and make a recommendation as to whether Manning should face court martial and if so, on which charges.
On Tuesday, a convicted computer hacker from California who became a confidential informant for the Army testified about six days of online chats that he had with someone he believes was Manning.
Army Criminal Investigation Command Special Agent David Shaver later testified that the chat logs that Lamo provided to the Army largely matched chat logs found on Manning's computer in Iraq.
