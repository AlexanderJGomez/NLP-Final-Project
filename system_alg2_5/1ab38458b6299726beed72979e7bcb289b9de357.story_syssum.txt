(Financial Times) -- Walmart is taking a 51% stake in Yihaodian, a leading Chinese e-commerce website, in a significant move by the U.S. retailer to boost its online presence in China.
The Chinese consumer e-commerce market is dominated by homegrown online retailer Taobao.
The company this month appointed Greg Foran, a 30-year industry veteran, as the chief executive of its China business.
In October, Walmart China closed its stores in Chongqing for a fortnight after the local government found it had mislabeled ordinary pork as organic.
