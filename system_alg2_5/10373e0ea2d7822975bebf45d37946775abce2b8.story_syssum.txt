Grace Yoon, 15 months, was killed after a military jet crashed into her home.
That left the jet relying on its other engine, which previously had been giving mechanics electronic indications of a problem with its fuel-flow system, Rupp said.
Maintenance rules don't require immediate repairs for the problem, he said, but the squadron flew the jet 146 times before it eventually crashed because its left engine was starved for fuel.
Alles said the officer was an "above-average" pilot who "just made a poor decision."
In an emotional press conference in December, Yoon said he did not blame the pilot and urged the public to pray for him.
I know he did everything he could," Yoon said at the time.
