Obama and McCain both promise a government that will watch over us ... "I don't like that," says Penn Jillette.
Not me.
Barack Obama is way smarter than Bush -- so way, way smarter than me.
Obama is a great leader.
We need someone stupid enough to understand that the president of the United States can't solve many problems without taking away freedom and therefore shouldn't try.
I may be stupid, but I want a chance to try to be a grown-up and take care of my family.
You gotta be smarter than me to do all that, but you don't have to be as smart as Obama, and you sure don't have to be a great leader.
People won't even hear someone suggesting that our president should do less and individual citizens should do more for themselves.
If we could find a lazier, less charismatic, stupider person than me to be president, I'd be all for it.
