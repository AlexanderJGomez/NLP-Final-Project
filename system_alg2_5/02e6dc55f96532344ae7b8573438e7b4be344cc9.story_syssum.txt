(CNN)In Moscow on February 27, 2015, a lone gunman killed Boris Nemtsov, a former deputy prime minister and a powerful and charismatic opposition leader who stood as an alternative to Vladimir Putin.
But this was the first top-level political assassination of a person who could have become party leader.
In the death of Nemtsov, irrespective of who is ultimately found responsible, we once again have the assassination of a person who could have become the leader of the country.
The question now becomes whether Kremlin's leaders imagine that they can  take the country down a similar path of isolation and ultimate destruction?
The perfidy of the regime is quite unparalleled since Hitler hid his expansionism behind the desire to reunite German-speakers in the Sudetenland.
They can (for now) still connect with each other on social media.
One can only hope it will attract large numbers.
President Obama quickly condemned the murder and stated that "I admired Nemtsov's courageous dedication to the struggle against corruption in Russia and appreciated his willingness to share his candid views with me when we met in Moscow in 2009."
But standing with them in their insistence -- echoing Nemtsov -- that Putin's authoritarian regime is based on massive corruption, will be more important than ever.
