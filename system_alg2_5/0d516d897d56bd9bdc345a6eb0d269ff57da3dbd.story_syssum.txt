In Pakistan, where U.S. Navy SEALs killed the al Qaeda leader during a raid on a compound a year ago, 55% of the Muslims surveyed had a negative opinion of the terrorist group, according to the poll.
The killing of bin Laden in that raid prompted an uproar in Pakistan.
And with the passing of time, support for al Qaeda has fallen further in key parts of Pakistan, he said.
Twenty-one percent of the Muslims questioned there had a favorable view of al Qaeda, while 71% had an unfavorable one.
Only 6% in Turkey and 2% in Lebanon viewed it favorably.
A total of 1,206 adults were interviewed face-to-face in Pakistan between March 28 and April 13.
