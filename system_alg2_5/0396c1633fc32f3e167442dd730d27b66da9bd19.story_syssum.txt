Dr. Joseph Adelegan has pioneered new energy sources, including using cow waste to create cooking gas.
Three years ago Adelegan won plaudits for his "Cows to Kilowatts" project, which used effluents and waste products from abattoirs to produce cooking gas.
His project "Power to the Poor: Off-Grid Lighting from Cassava Waste in Nigeria," was awarded a $250,000 grant in May from the World Bank after being named one of the best projects in Africa.
He told CNN: "There will be four lighting points in their homes.
The scheme will cost $310,000 and will become profitable in little over three years, Adelegan says.
"Fifty to sixty years ago, we used to have huge glaciers here, the retired civil engineer, told CNN.
So that local farmers get a real headstart when they need it most," Norphel says.
The largest artificial glacier Norphel has built so far is near the village of Phuktsey.
Natural glaciers, on the other hand, are located way up in the mountains and they melt slowly in summer, releasing water to the villages quite late.
In 1996, one year after he had retired, Norphel joined the Leh Nutrition Project, a non-governmental organization, as project manager for watershed development.
