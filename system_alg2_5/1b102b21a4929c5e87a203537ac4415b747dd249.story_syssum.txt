President Vladimir Putin's spokesman denied that the leader kept a Super Bowl ring that New England Patriots' owner Robert Kraft wanted back.
And he put it on and he goes, 'I can kill someone with this ring,'" Kraft said, according to the New York Post.
It has my name on it."
"What Mr. Kraft is saying now is weird," Dmitry Peskov said.
"He loves that the ring is at the Kremlin and, as he stated back in 2005, he continues to have great respect for Russia and the leadership of President Putin," said Stacey James, a spokesman for The Kraft Group.
At least one ring has been used to raise money for charity.
