William Earl Lynd was the first inmate to die by injection since September, when the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to consider whether the three-drug combination represented cruel and unusual punishment.
Georgia became the first state to resume executions since the court validated the lethal injection process last month with a ruling in a Kentucky case.
In Mississippi, authorities had planned to execute Earl Wesley Berry on Monday, but the state Supreme Court set the date for May 21.
In the Georgia case, Lynd was convicted of fatally shooting his girlfriend, Virginia "Ginger" Moore, in Berrien County in 1988.
Moore regained consciousness and staggered outside, where she was shot a second time and put into the trunk of her car.
The charges have been dropped.
There have been 40 executions in the state since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, ruling in a Georgia case.
If she is executed, she would be the first woman put to death in three years.
Kentucky and other states use 3 grams, a standard that the Supreme Court judged to be constitutional.
