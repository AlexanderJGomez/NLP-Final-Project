Peña may say it feels like play, but his work ethic says otherwise.
"He is a very methodical, very calculated race car driver," said Kip Childress, director of NASCAR's K&N Pro Series East.

The sport of NASCAR is one that calls for major financial backing from sponsors in order for racers to have a legitimate chance to compete at a high level.
"The main goal of the 'Drive for Diversity' program is to get minorities a chance to enter their names into the sport," said Sergio Peña.
Peña completed the program, and his success helped him land a big sponsor, Hattori Racing Enterprises.
"Sergio has been able to get the job done on the race track."
"It's getting there, step by step," Peña said.
