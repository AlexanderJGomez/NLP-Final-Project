Now, one year into my 40s, I'm blessed with home ownership and the realization that I am officially a "grown-up."
When you're dating after 40, the reaction you get from family and friends on your birthday is also totally different.
Their reaction each and every time was exactly the same: "How about some kids?"
I gave all the right answers: that buying a house made more sense than a townhouse in this market, I realized the amount of equity I could get buying in this neighborhood and of course the first-time home buyer credit was too much to pass up.
After all, if I were in my 20s or 30s and dating, the house likely would have been viewed by most as a great investment.
These were all questions that I never expected to confront at a casual birthday barbecue.
After all the birthday party guests had left, I asked my beau if the questions about children made him feel uncomfortable.
