Bamako, Mali (CNN) -- Mali's historic cultural center, Timbuktu, lacks electricity, water and phone service, because "terrorists" sabotaged the utilities there, a Paris-based spokesman for the ethnic Toureg separatist party MNLA said Thursday.
But after MNLA ousted the Malian army from Timbuktu last year, Ansar Dine and al Qaeda drove MNLA away.
But, it also appears that Mali has asked for, and will need, some help to establish government control in the north," Ham said.
Malian soldiers have carried out a number of summary executions as they seek to drive back Islamist militants who have been advancing from the north, a human rights group claimed Thursday.
The group says it has also been told of other summary executions in central Mali, and documents the pillaging of Tuareg homes by government soldiers.
MNLA rebels who returned to Mali well-armed from fighting for the late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi staged a military coup last year against the Malian government.
Among other abuses, an Amnesty report last year accused the Malian army of "indiscriminately" bombing the civilian population in response to the rebellion by armed Tuareg groups.
The CNN crew has heard reports that the houses and possessions of Tuareg families have been destroyed by either citizens or Mali's military.
France's involvement in Mali began the day after militants said January 10 that they had seized the city of Konna, east of Diabaly in central Mali, and were poised to advance south toward Bamako.
