(CNN) -- After nearly going to war last year over a Colombian military raid inside Ecuador, the two nations seemed to be patching relations when their foreign ministers met a few weeks ago.
Ecuador previously issued an arrest warrant for former Colombian Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos, who held the post during last year's raid.
Myles Frechette, U.S. ambassador to Colombia from 1994 to 1997, said Friday that "Ecuador is a specialist in bonehead plays.
Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa called the attack "aggression" and a "massacre" and severed diplomatic relations with Colombia.
After the meeting, Colombia signed a statement saying it would never attack inside Ecuador again.
Falconi quickly pointed out that the nation's judicial branch, not Correa's administration, decided to issue the warrant.
"That's not a very coordinated government," said Frechette, the former envoy to Colombia.
Alejandro Santos, editorial director of La Semana weekly news magazine in Colombia, said relations will not improve until the two countries "can close the chapter" on last year's bombing raid.
The problems between the two nations are long-standing and have a lot to do with the 45-year-old war between Colombia and the FARC.
"This has been developing for many years," Moeller said.
Said Spurrier, "For Colombia, Ecuador is an important market.
Moeller, the former foreign minister, wants normalization to get back on track.
"I hope this passes ... and that they start talking again."
