"I'd been trimming it down over the past year, but after that conversation on the Internet, it really struck me that I don't need all this stuff," he said.
He declared his intention in May to wear one outfit for one year in a blog post titled "minimalism."
Popular minimalist fashion movements include the 10-piece capsule, the five-piece French wardrobe and Project 333, which invites participants to dress with 33 items or less for three months.
When people recognize the benefits of fewer choices in their closets, they start thinking about how to apply the philosophy to other areas of their lives, said Courtney Carver, creator of Project 333.
"I tend to have a hard time getting rid of clothes even if I never wear them, because of guilt that I spent money on them or because I'm afraid I might want or need them at some point.
"It's nice only wearing my favorite clothes and jewelry, and not feeling guilty for neglecting other clothes I may not like as much," she said.
Now there is breathing room in my closet and it makes me feel like I'm starting the day with some semblance of organization and control."
Today, she continues to use only 33 clothing items (not including underwear, sleepwear or workout clothing) at a time, reassessing her wardrobe every three months to cycle in seasonal necessities from a single container into her closet.
If you can't answer "yes," "yes," and "within the last year," the item has to go, she said.
If you really want to rock a minimalist closet, it helps to invest in quality pieces that do double, triple or quadruple duty, Quint said.
Consumers are demanding a return to high-quality items that can stand the test of time, Quint said
Each piece of clothing was selected for its versatility and durability in different weather conditions and social environments, Souveny said.
"My closet is full of cheap clothes that will never wear out because I never wear them.
"This was just a fun experiment for me to see how long things last," he said.
