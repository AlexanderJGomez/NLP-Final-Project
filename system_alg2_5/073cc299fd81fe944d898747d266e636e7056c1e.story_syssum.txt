The Friday notice to lawyers in a terror case against Jamshid Muhtorov is significant because it allows the defendant to have court standing to challenge the program and its use in his prosecution.
"The government intends to offer into evidence or otherwise use or disclose in proceedings ... information obtained or derived from acquisition of foreign intelligence information conducted pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978," Friday's court filing said.
The IJU, a Pakistan-based extremist group with an anti-Western ideology, opposes secular rule in Uzbekistan and seeks to replace the regime there with a government based on Islamic law, the U.S. Justice Department said.
However, Muhtorov has not been linked to any plots or attacks on targets inside the United States, the statement said.
