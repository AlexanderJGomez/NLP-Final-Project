The IUCN assessed a total of 63,837 plant and animal species around the globe which revealed 19,817 of that number are currently threatened with extinction, with 3,947 described as "critically endangered" -- the final classification prior to extinction.
More than 275 million people are dependent on coral reefs for food, coastal protection and their livelihoods, according to the IUCN.
"The services and economic value that species provide are irreplaceable and essential to our well being," Jon Paul RodrÃ­guez, deputy chair, IUCN Species Survival Commission, said in a statement.
Paul Smith, Head of the Millennium Seed Bank at the Royal Botanic Gardens says that every plant extinction makes it more challenging for humans to adapt to change.
The seed bank at Kew, the largest of its kind in the world, currently stores 11% (around 31,000 specimens) of the world's plant species.
"There is no technological reason why a plant species should become extinct.
"The problem with any consensual approach is that it takes a very long time.
"World leaders 'recognized' problems 20 years ago, and they've done little about them since.
