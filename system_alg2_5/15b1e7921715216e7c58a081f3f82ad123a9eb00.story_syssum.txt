Saucedo grew up in El Paso and Ciudad Juarez across the border in Mexico, and says violence is now a normal part of life on the border.
The collection, which Saucedo describes as post modern conceptualism, contains four individual piñata sculptures in the shape of cartoon heads a bit larger than life size.
"I got a pressure gun and shot each piñata so it would look like a gunshot.
El Paso Library spokesman Jack Galindo said the library had only one official complaint -- a man said he was "very offended" by the pieces.
I feel it's my responsibility as an artist to represent those feelings," said Saucedo.
Criminal groups have changed their strategy.
