Inspired by a U.S. fact-checking website, a group of Egyptian activists has created the Morsi Meter, aimed at holding the new Egyptian president to his promises.
The group has not heard of any reaction from Morsi to the website.
Sobhy said that while it's unclear how much power the president will have, he hopes Morsi fulfills promises through selecting "a good government" and gaining public support.
Zabatak hopes to change the "mindset" in Egypt and get more people to be "more positive and involved," he said.
The site currently lists 64 promises.
It's a new form of journalism that holds public officials accountable for their campaign promises.
