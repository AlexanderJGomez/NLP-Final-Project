But Karl Rove's insistence that Barack Obama had not carried Ohio -- despite the call by his own network, Fox News, that the president had done just that -- represented something larger.
And that has been a recurring pattern this year.
Rove, who also has a Wall Street Journal column, helped create two political action committees, American Crossroads and Crossroads Grassroots Political Strategies, that raised and spent about $175 million in this campaign, most of it on television ads promoting Mitt Romney or attacking Obama.
Fox isn't the only news channel to employ active partisans -- CNN has a few, too -- and media organizations long ago decided to blur the line between journalism and politics.
Fox News, CNN and MSNBC were each in the process of calling Ohio -- and thus the presidential race -- for Obama.
When Romney was down in the polls, some conservatives complained that media organizations were putting out biased surveys (which led to such sites as unskewedpolls.com).
So he not only doesn't accept that the president was born in Hawaii, he doesn't accept that Obama won the election fair and square.
But for a brief moment on Election Night, we got a glimpse of pure partisanship in the guise of journalism.
