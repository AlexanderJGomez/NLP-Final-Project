"They're frustrated and they're scared and they're just overwhelmed," said Debra Forman, whose 8-year-old son, Adam, has autism.
"When he's having a meltdown on the floor and the whole entire store's looking at you like you're a bad mom, you just want to go and crawl under a rock."
Dr. Wendy Ross was heartbroken to hear stories like this from families.
Today, her nonprofit, Autism Inclusion Resources, helps families affected by autism navigate challenging social situations, such as airport travel, sporting events and museum visits.
"You can't turn down the volume of the world," Ross said.
"I don't expect the staff to be experts, just to be aware of it and (be) understanding," Ross said.
Then she escorts families to their first game, with tickets donated by the Phillies.
Ross has also found her airport travel program to be successful for families.
Building on her success with the Phillies, she is now working with Philadelphia's football and hockey teams.
Ross also hopes that the tools she gives families can help them explore other settings on their own.
"Hopefully, there will be zoos in our future, and aquariums," Forman said.
