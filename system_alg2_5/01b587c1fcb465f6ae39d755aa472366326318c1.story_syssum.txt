(CNN) -- U.S soccer star Robbie Rogers has "come out" as gay on the day he retired from the game Friday.
"I always thought I could hide this secret.
It's time to discover myself away from football.
My secret is gone, I am a free man, I can move on and live my life as my creator intended."
Truth is not always easy to display, but truly strong people always find a way #RESPECT"
But not since the tragic loss of Justin Fashanu has a top-flight league witnessed an openly gay professional football player.
It's the nature of the business.
While other sports have embraced their gay stars, such as John Amaechi in basketball, Martina Navratilova in tennis and Gareth Thomas in rugby, football has yet to move with the times.
"Homophobia is used to put players down and it's a way of deriding players.
"When a player gives a pass away or falls over, fans use homophobia abuse to put them down and it's that which we want to stop.
Rogers' story has been met with admiration from fellow gay football players, but his retirement from the game means that the community is still waiting for a player to come out and continue playing.
