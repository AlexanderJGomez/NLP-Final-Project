Even before the ink on Ohio Gov.
The campaign to repeal Senate Bill 5, led by a group called "We Are Ohio," quickly went national.
Well, in Ohio, all politics is also national.
Republicans managed to capture the governor's mansion and every other statewide office, 13 of the state's 18 congressional seats (a gain of 5 seats), and a majority in the Ohio House of Representatives (they already controlled the Ohio Senate).
Still, one can't ignore the fact that, in seeking to weaken public employee unions, the Republicans were also taking on the very groups who would be expected to bankroll Democrats in 2012.
Back in 1958, business owners in Ohio got together and placed a proposed constitutional amendment on the state's ballot that would have made Ohio a right-to-work state.
The voters of Ohio, however, did not just vote against the amendment; they also voted against the Republican Party that was seen to have backed the measure.
Since no one has been elected president in more than 50 years without winning Ohio, it may well be that vote to repeal Senate Bill 5 in Ohio helps determine who will be taking the presidential oath in January of 2013.
