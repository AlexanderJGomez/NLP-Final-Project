It's Delta Air Lines' new "Basic Economy" fare, part of the airline's new five-fare class of pricing starting March 1.
Note the options on the other end of the seating spectrum: The first-class cabin will be split into "First Class" for domestic routes and "Delta One" for long-haul international and certain cross-country domestic flights.
The "Main Cabin" coach fares on domestic and long-haul international flights will allow seat selection at time of purchase and flexibility for flight changes.
The "Delta Comfort+" coach fare on all flights will include priority boarding and dedicated overhead bin space, alcoholic drinks, premium snacks, premium entertainment, up to 4 more inches of legroom and quilted seat covers.
"Or will you get less for the same fare?"
"The lowest fare class doesn't allow advanced seat selection?"
That pricing structure seems Spirit-esque."
