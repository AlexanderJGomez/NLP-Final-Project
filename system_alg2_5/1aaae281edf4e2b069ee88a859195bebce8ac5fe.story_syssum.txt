Prosecutors cited the new law Wednesday in announcing charges stemming from an assault on Baldwin on March 6 and the robbery of Baldwin three days later.
Morris County prosecutors charged two juveniles and an adult, 19-year-old Michael Conway, with assault, robbery, theft and making terroristic threats against Baldwin.
He is free on $1,500 bail.
It could not immediately be determined whether the defendants have retained attorneys, or when the case will go to court.
