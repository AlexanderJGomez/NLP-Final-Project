Sosa was among thousands of illegal immigrants in Los Angeles who filled out a census form last year, and city officials said the response, especially among Latinos, might have saved the area money and congressional representation.
The response: The 2010 census showed that the numbers of Latinos living in this country increased by 43%, from 35 million to more than 50 million, during the past 10 years.
At more than 70%, he said, it was among the highest for large cities and close to the national mail participation rate of 74%.
"The last time around, 10 years ago, we were the second-worst among big cities in the country in terms of the undercount," Villaraigosa said.
At the Margaret Aylward Center for the Poor in the Hispanic-heavy L.A. suburb of Pico Rivera, the size of the Latino population was clear well before it was counted by the census.
Villaraigosa said California would have lost a congressional seat if this census count remained at or near the same as in 2000.
"You might have a congressional district in Los Angeles of 600,000 people but only 100,000 citizens.
