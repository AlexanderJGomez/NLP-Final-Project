(CNN) -- Three men who toppled an ancient boulder in Utah's Goblin Valley State Park have been booted from their Boy Scout leadership roles.
"Someone with a bad back who's disabled, who can't enjoy life, to me, doesn't step up and push a rock that big off the base," the defendant in Taylor's lawsuit, Alan MacDonald, told Salt Lake City television station KTVX.
But when CNN affiliate KUTV noted that Taylor didn't look particularly debilitated in the video, he replied, "You didn't see how hard I pushed."
So it's all about saving lives here at Goblin Valley.
That's what we're all about."
"We thought we were doing a good deed," Taylor told the affiliate.
The men "are currently under criminal investigation," he said ont Friday.
