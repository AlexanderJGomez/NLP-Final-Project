Almost exactly a year ago, fighters from Boko Haram entered a dusty town close to the border with Cameroon.
The Boko Haram fighters freed about 100 inmates from the prison.
It's now clear that in conceding to a key Boko Haram demand, the Nigerian government was inviting more such abductions.
"And the militants freed from prison will allow Boko Haram to benefit from their bomb-making and kidnapping skills to launch new and fiercer attacks in Nigeria, Cameroon and the border region," he said.
After secret negotiations between Shekau and the Cameroonian government (through intermediaries), Boko Haram released the family near the Nigerian-Cameroon border -- reportedly in exchange for a $3 million ransom and the release of 16 Boko Haram prisoners held in Cameroon.
Zenn believes the group "would likely demand a de-facto Taliban-like Islamic State in some portion of northeastern Nigeria and the border region," a demand that would be unpalatable to the federal government because it would damage the already shaky integrity of Africa's most populous nation.
According to the Human Rights Watch report, residents of Maiduguri said that on several occasions, members of Boko Haram forcefully abducted several teenage girls.
"Now they are picking up women anywhere and using them to satisfy themselves."
