A grand jury will decide any day now whether to indict a police officer, Darren Wilson, who shot Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, this past August.
Jay Nixon has preemptively declared a state of emergency.
The police were widely criticized for their over-the-top militaristic response, including riot cops in tanks with automatic rifles pointed at the protesters.
"Ferguson Thugs Harass, Verbally Abuse Police Officers," read a headline on the conservative website RightScoop.
Now, let's turn to white protesters: In mid-October, during the annual Pumpkin Festival in the small New England town of Keene, New Hampshire, some white college kids apparently had too much to drink and turned violent.

No.
And there's more.
The same year football fans at the State University of New York in Cortland rioted even before the game started.
