Earlier, county spokesman Dave Rose told CNN that the Black Forest Fire, burning northeast of the city, now appears to be the most destructive in terms of property lost in state history.
The fire's evacuation area was 93,000 acres, affecting approximately 38,000 people and 13,000 homes, and the flames were estimated to have burned through 15,700 acres, said Maketa.
After he spoke, residents of about 1,000 homes in Colorado Springs were told to evacuate.
"We literally had five minutes, and we left because it was, the flames were there," Jaenette Coyne told CNN's AC360 Thursday night.
A lot of people here just don't know," Jaenette Coyne said.
In northeast Colorado Springs, CNN iReporter Heather Croze took photos outside her home, capturing a billowing plume of smoke.
Joanne Gaishin slept outside in her car after fleeing her home with 18 chickens and three turkeys.
Paula Warren, one of thousands of residents forced to flee her home northeast of Colorado Springs, spoke about how difficult it was to leave and wonder if her home was all right.
For now she and her two miniature horses are staying with a friend on the outskirts of Colorado Springs.
"You can't just take 'em to a Motel 6," she said.
So many people have suffered loss, and so we're just thankful that we're here and safe and that we're loved, and that we have so many people that are willing to help take care of us," she said.
Maketa said Thursday that 360 homes had been destroyed; another 14 were damaged.
Ken Litch, a 12-year resident of the area, watched Wednesday as the Black Forest Fire gained ground on his home.
Another major fire in the state is the Royal Gorge Fire, which is burning 55 miles to the southwest, on the other side of Colorado Springs.
"We did not know until today whether the bridge was still standing," Gorge Bridge and Park spokeswoman Peggy Gair said.
