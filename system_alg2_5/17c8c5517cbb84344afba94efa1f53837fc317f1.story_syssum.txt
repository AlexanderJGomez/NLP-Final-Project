Syed Haris Ahmed, charged with providing material support to terrorism in the United States and abroad, used the time to talk about his Muslim faith instead of addressing the evidence against him.
"We worship the same God," Ahmed said.
The judge told Ahmed he would act according to the laws of the United States in deciding the case by considering the evidence.
Ahmed and Sadequee made "casing videos" of landmarks in the Washington area during an April 2005 trip, McBurney said.
"He's giving a closing argument," Ahmed said.
Martin wrapped up his case earlier Thursday after calling just two witnesses, Ahmed's older sister and his father.
Martin said Ahmed moved to a suburban Atlanta neighborhood with his family when he was 12.
Sadequee is expected to face the same charges in an August trial.
