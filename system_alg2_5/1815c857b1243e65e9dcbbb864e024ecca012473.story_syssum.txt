But of all these cases, only one person has been named as a suspect, Sister Maria Gomez.
He said the money paid for the illegal adoption of both boys as newborn babies.

After that, Barroso set up Anadir, an association for Spain's stolen children.
Ines Perez and her daughter, Ines Madrigal, have a typically loving mother-daughter relationship but are also caught in the stolen babies scandal.
When she arrived, she says, he placed a newborn baby in her arms and handed her a falsified birth certificate.
"The doctor said "Just put her in the car between two hot water bottles," Perez recalls.
In a summary of his testimony to investigators in the case of Ines Madrigal, Vela denies any wrong-doing, saying that he only helped women who wanted to put their children up for adoption, never pressuring any mother to do so.
Was she simply given up for adoption or was she one of Spain's stolen babies?
"I just want to know the truth."
