Police were offering few details Wednesday of the robbery at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. Detectives on the scene were carrying out a "slow and painstaking" forensic examination, police said in a statement.
Hatton Garden is a storied area in London and the heart of the city's diamond trade.
"The Hatton Garden area has been the epicentre of London's jewellery trade since medieval times.
But how?
"I would not be surprised, given where this one is, in Hatton Garden, if 200 million pounds is around about the amount stolen," Ramm said on BBC Radio 4.
