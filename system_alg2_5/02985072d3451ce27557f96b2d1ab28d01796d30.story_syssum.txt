(CNN) -- Pakistan cricket legend Imran Khan has described how the unfolding crisis in Haiti revived harrowing memories of a similar earthquake in his own region.
"Families were torn apart as parents lost their children and children were orphaned.
So many people needing help at one time and you don't have the infrastructure, you don't have the hospitals to help."
Balakot was one of the worst-hit places, with one in 10 of about 20,000 residents killed, according to the local government of the Mansehra district, where the town of is located.
While acknowledging the importance of the international aid effort, Khan pointed to role ordinary Pakistanis played in 2005.
"I was in an earthquake-hit area on the second day and I'll never forget seeing a three-mile queue of people trying to get to what was a largely remote area to help with whatever they could put in their cars.
