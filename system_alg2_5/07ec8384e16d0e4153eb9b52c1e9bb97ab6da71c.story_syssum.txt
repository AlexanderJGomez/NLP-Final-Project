Medea Benjamin, who co-founded the Code Pink anti-war group, said she was detained on arrival at Cairo airport Monday evening.
I did not do anything wrong.
An official from Egypt's Interior Ministry communications department said Benjamin had not been detained.
He also said that he had no information on whether Benjamin had been banned from Egypt.
On its website, Code Pink said it was sending a U.S. delegation of 15 women to join a larger coalition that would travel to Gaza.
