The Texas Republican Party adopted a plank in its platform endorsing reparative therapy for gays and lesbians, even though such treatments have been rejected as harmful by all leading medical and psychological associations and even outlawed in some states.
Studies of identical twins, who share the same genes, have shown that, if one twin is gay, the other is more likely to be gay, suggesting sexual orientation is influenced by genetics.
Although the study did not find a particular gene, it suggested that such a gene exists on the X chromosome.
But finding the biological origins of same-sex attraction has the potential to undermine the rights of gays and lesbians.
Why would a gene related to sexual orientation be useful?
The exploration of why a gay gene should not be viewed as "useful" highlights the broader concern with these scientific studies: It becomes easier for LGBT opponents to argue that gays and lesbians are biologically flawed, akin to a disease that should be and could be cured.
Why is it the "gay" gene and not just the "sexual orientation" gene, or even the "straight" gene?
There is nothing wrong with us.
