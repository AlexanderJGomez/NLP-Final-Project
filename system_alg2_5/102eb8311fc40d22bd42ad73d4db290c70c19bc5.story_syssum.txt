A new study published in the January 2008 issue of Archives of General Psychiatry found the prevalence of autism cases in California children continued to rise after most vaccine manufacturers started to remove the mercury-based preservative thimerosal in 1999, suggesting that the chemical was not a primary cause of the disorder.
In 1999, manufacturers began removing thimerosal - which is a mercury-based preservative - from vaccines.
They reasoned that if mercury exposure in vaccines was a major cause of autism, the number of affected kids should have dropped after thimerosal was removed.
But advocacy groups say it's too soon to determine whether autism rates were affected by removing thimerosal from vaccines.
What exactly are these outside factors?
Doctors are now looking for signs of autism in children as young as 18 to 24 months.
Some of them used thimerosal as a preservative.
This was happening while the government was trying to decrease our exposure to mercury.
