Hong Kong (CNN) -- Panasonic halted operations at three factories in China after angry protesters ransacked Japanese businesses over the weekend amid rising tensions over disputed islands in the East China Sea.
Panasonic also halted operations at a factory in Guangdong province until Tuesday as some local employees staged a strike as protest against Japan's claim to the island chain, called Diaoyu by China and Senkaku by Japan.
"China is a big market for us, it would be very damaging for us to see a decline of the Chinese tourists," said the man, who gave his surname as Watanabe.
Meanwhile, an editorial in the China Daily on Monday called on China to impose economic sanctions against Japan.
On Thursday last week a Chinese official warned that Tokyo's move to "buy" a disputed island chain in the East China Sea would hurt trade between Asia's two largest economies.
Despite booming auto sales in China, sales of Japanese car brands are down 2% in China compared to a year ago, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.
Nearly 20% of Japanese exports last year were sold to mainland China, compared to 15.3% exported to the U.S., according to figures from the Japan External Trade Organization.
The islands were administered by the U.S. occupation force after World War II.
