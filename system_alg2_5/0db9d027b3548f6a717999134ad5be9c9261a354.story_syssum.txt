AUSTIN, Texas (CNN) -- Monday, in the much anticipated New Haven, Connecticut, firefighters' case, the Supreme Court reversed an opinion joined by Judge Sonia Sotomayor, President Obama's Supreme Court nominee.
Circuit Court of Appeals were reversed in 1969, the year he joined the court.
More significantly, after Burger had been confirmed, the Court reversed him again, this time in a major case -- Powell v. McCormack.
Only once in the past 15 years has the Republican majority voted in favor of minorities in an affirmative action case.
That was enough for Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a Republican, who switched from her normal skepticism of affirmative action to sustain the law school program.
So when a Democratic president finally got a nomination, any person selected would dissent from the Republicans' disdain for affirmative action.
Some Republican senators may try to use the New Haven majority to paint Sotomayor as out of the mainstream.
