(CNN)  -- In-form superstars Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi go head-to-head in Monday night's El Clasico between Real Madrid and Barcelona in the Camp Nou, which is set to have a significant bearing on the Spanish title race.
"The Clasico is obviously an important match because we will play against a direct opponent," he told the official Real Madrid website.
"This will not be decisive though, but whoever does win will surely be considered to be the champions for the next week at least," he told his club's official website.
That's all," claimed Mourinho, who masterminded a Champions League semifinal victory over Barcelona as Inter Milan coach last season.
Ronaldo, who tops the La Liga scoring charts with 15, just ahead of Messi, claims the match is so much more than an individual battle between the pair.
"Real will come to Camp Nou with revenge in mind," Messi told AFP.
