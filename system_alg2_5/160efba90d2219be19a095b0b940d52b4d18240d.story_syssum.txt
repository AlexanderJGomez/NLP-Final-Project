NEW YORK (CNN) -- The missing engine from a US Airways jet that ditched in the Hudson River was recovered Friday, more than a week after the crash landing.

The right engine was still attached to the plane when it was pulled from the Hudson last week.
Meanwhile, a pilot program involving "birdstrike avoidance" radar systems will be expanded to include LaGuardia, said a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
Newly released video captured seconds after the Airbus A320 ditched in the Hudson River showed passengers trying to flee the aircraft almost immediately after it settled in the water and began to float along the river current.
Seconds later, an inflatable evacuation ramp extends from the opposite side of the plane.
Passengers run onto the plane's other wing as the aircraft floats off-screen for a few seconds.
A person manning the camera from inside the plant saw the plane hit the water and redirected the camera, Olert said.
