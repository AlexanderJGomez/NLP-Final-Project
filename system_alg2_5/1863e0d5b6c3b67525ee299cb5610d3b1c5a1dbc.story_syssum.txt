I love to come to New York and any time I got a chance, when Les Paul was still alive, I would always try to schedule to see him play.
There were only about sixty people in the club, it's a very small room, so Sir Paul gave everyone at the Les Paul performance a very special experience.
I'm a musician myself, I play bass guitar with a little band in Atlanta, where I live.
We love making music and that was inspired by Sir Paul.
