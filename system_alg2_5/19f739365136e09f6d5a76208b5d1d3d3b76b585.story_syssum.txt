"I see in Novak a little bit of Boris Becker," the German tells CNN's Open Court.
Becker began his partnership with Djokovic in December 2013 and was courtside when the Serb star claimed his seventh grand slam title at Wimbledon in July -- one more than his coach managed during a 15-year career.
Whenever he makes a mistake I feel that I make it too," Becker says.
"I have to keep my poker face and have a very cool demeanor.
While Becker received a couple of phone calls from players curious as to whether he would be willing to take up a coaching role, it was only once Djokovic got in touch that he began to consider moving back onto the circuit.
"But Novak called me and I told him I felt honored.
"I go on the road because I want to win the majors and not being happy with the quarters or the semis.
Defeats in the finals at Wimbledon and the U.S Open in 2013 and the 2014 French Open had left question marks over Djokovic's morale, but Becker believes any doubts have since been erased.
"Maybe that was something he was looking for.
"Novak is a great student given he's someone who has won so much already," says Becker.
"He had a dream, coming from very humble beginnings.
"It changed me for the better," says Becker, who has children by both his first and second wives.
It gave me another three or four years on my career and I think it will do the same for Novak.
He loves his wife and family more than anything in the world, and having that addition to his family will make him a better man."
