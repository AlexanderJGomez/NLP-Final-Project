The status of women has become one of the ideological battlegrounds in the fierce war between the self-described Islamic State and the Kurdish defenders, who have received air support from the United States.
The timing of the decree is not accidental, and it is certainly brazen.
The decree was issued by the Jazira district of Syria's Hasakeh province, about 100 miles from the now-legendary town of Kobani, where armed Kurdish men and women are holding their positions, battling to prevent the ultra-radical Islamic State, also known as ISIS, from overrunning their territory.
Although women have been a part of Kurdish fighting forces since long before ISIS swept across Syria and Iraq, women have fought for full equality.
In addition, the rule establishes maternity leave for women and, importantly, it mandates that no woman be married without her own consent, and never under the age of 18.
Like the Kurds, ISIS has also established all-women brigades, complete with weapons.
The ISIS female brigades serve many purposes.
There are reports of armed women stopping girls in the street, quizzing them on their knowledge of Islam and of ISIS rules.
To be sure, the Kurds don't have a perfect record on the treatment of women.
And the pressure from ISIS may just be moving them even farther along the road to equality.
