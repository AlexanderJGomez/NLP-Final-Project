WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Federal and state health officials said Monday that salmonella linked last week in Minnesota to King Nut peanut butter was caused by the same strain of bacteria responsible for an ongoing outbreak of 410 salmonella cases in 43 states.
The Minnesota bacteria were linked last week to institutionally distributed peanut butter, sold under the King Nut brand name.
"We do not know to what extent the salmonella contributed to the death," said Schultz, who added that the patient had other underlying illnesses.
Late last week, King Nut Companies, based in Ohio, recalled King Nut peanut butter.
The first cases nationwide were reported September 3, but most occurred between October 1 and December 31, the CDC said last week.
Strains of salmonella linked to outbreaks in the past have been traced to contaminated eggs, meat, poultry, vegetables, pet food and peanut butter.
Most people infected develop diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps within a few days of infection and the illness can last up to a week.
