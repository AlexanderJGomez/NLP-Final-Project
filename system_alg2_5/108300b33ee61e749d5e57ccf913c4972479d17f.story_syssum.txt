The inmate, David Wright, 27, wrote that officers Whitcomb, Haynes and Graff had arranged for him to fight another inmate, James Hicks, 27.
The state police report also said that officers also told Wright that they would give him lounge food if he permitted them to punch him in the leg and arm.
He said that the acts were consensual and that he was rewarded with food, the report said.
All three correctional officers have been placed on administrative leave, Trooper Hicks said.
