Perugia, Italy (CNN) -- Family members of Meredith Kercher said Saturday they were satisfied with the verdict that found American Amanda Knox and her Italian ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, guilty of the fatal knifing of the British student.
You can't really carry on as normal," she said.
Knox and Sollecito were convicted on all charges except theft.
Her mother, Edda Mellas, said, "She had a lot of support.
"People from all over the world have been sending us messages of support all through the night," Mellas said.
Sollecito's lawyer, Luca Maori, criticized his client's punishment -- less than the life sentence the prosecution requested but far short of exonerating Sollecito -- as making no sense.
People who disagree with the verdict should at least respect it, because so many professionals were involved in the investigation, Mignini said.
"And they did this."
Jurors must submit an explanation of how they reached their decision to the judge within 90 days, and this "jury motivation" will be made public.
