It's almost insulting to say the obvious, but there are plenty of women who know their sports, too.
"Ladies in the locker room are not women who think they know everything about sports; they just know the men who do," Lemon said.
And for the second time in the show's history, Lemon is traveling to the Super Bowl with a handful of her ladies and a production crew to create a version of the show featuring interviews with the celebrities and stars flocking to football's big game.
Lemon, who describes herself as a huge fan of professional football, says she hopes her show will lead more men to understand that women love sports, too.
"Men don't think women understand sports."
I just hope we get more women talking about sports."
