Washington (CNN) -- A Russian company is seeking to buy a controlling interest in one of the largest uranium extraction operations in the United States -- a sale that requires U.S. government review because of possible national security implications.
"I don't see any national security threat to the United States from the Russians partly or entirely owning a mine in the United States."
I'd be interested in hearing arguments otherwise, but I just don't see it."
Uranium One USA is involved in the "recovery" of uranium, a form of mining in which a solution is injected into an ore body and the uranium leaches into the solution, which is then extracted, said NRC spokesman David McIntyre.
And the sale may require approval of the Federal Trade Commission because it involves a stock transaction, and the Federal Communications Commission because one of the sites has a radio license, the NRC said.
The states of Texas and Utah regulate uranium mining operations there.
