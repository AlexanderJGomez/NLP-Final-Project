(CNN) -- Two airplanes came too close to one another while attempting to land at a Detroit airport, a federal official said early Saturday, days after another close incident involving three jets at a Washington, D.C. airport.
The third plane involved was another Republic Airlines flight, which was taking off and came within 2.07 nautical miles and 800 vertical feet of the arriving flight.
"During the switchover of operations, miscommunication between the Tracon and the DCA tower led to a loss of the required separation between two regional jets departing from Runway 1 and a regional jet inbound for Runway 19," the Federal Aviation Administration said.
Last year, an air traffic controller was suspended for failing to respond to two planes heading into National Airport after he fell asleep on the midnight shift.
