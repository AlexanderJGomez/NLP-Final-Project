(CNN) -- The United States will talk to North Korea, but only if the country gets serious about negotiating the end of its nuclear weapons program, Secretary of State John Kerry said Friday during a visit to South Korea, a key U.S. ally.
U.S. officials think North Korea could test-launch a mobile ballistic missile at any time in what would be seen by the international community as a highly provocative move.
South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se, speaking with Kerry at a Friday news conference, urged North Korea to open talks.
The surprising Defense Intelligence Agency assessment of North Korea's potential nuclear capabilities emerged during Thursday's House Armed Services Committee hearing.
Pentagon spokesman George Little said that "it would be inaccurate to suggest that the North Korean regime has fully tested, developed or demonstrated the kinds of nuclear capabilities referenced" in the DIA study.
On Thursday, North Korea briefly raised a missile into an upright firing position, stoking concerns that a launch was imminent, a U.S. official told CNN.
The first U.S. official cautioned that raising the untested Musudan missile, which South Korea says has a range of up to 2,175 miles (3,500 kilometers), could have been just a trial run or an effort to "mess" with the United States and its allies.
The United States and South Korean militaries have been monitoring the movements of mobile ballistic missiles on the east coast of North Korea.
Late Friday, Japan's Transport Ministry issued a notice requiring Japanese airplanes to report to the U.S. military if they fly near the U.S. military's Kadena base in Okinawa prefecture, the Kyodo News Agency said.
Annual military exercises involving U.S. and South Korean troops have added to the tensions.
