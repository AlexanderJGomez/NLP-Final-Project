(CNN) -- The state visit of the President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins to Britain this week is the culmination of a series of contacts at head of state level over 21 years, the most important of which was the successful State visit by Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh to Ireland in May 2011.
This was one illustration of the fact that relations between the two countries were not normal because of the disputed claims at the time by Britain and Ireland over Northern Ireland.
There is understandable anticipation on both sides of the Irish Sea for the return state visit of Higgins to Britain next week.
During and since my presidency of Ireland, a difficult peace process was undertaken and came to fruition.
Important amendments were made to the Irish constitution, which requires a referendum of the people, that both permitted the State to comply with the Belfast Agreement and provided for the removal of the "territorial claim" contained in Articles 2 and 3.
