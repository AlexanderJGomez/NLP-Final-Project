The Transportation Security Administration "has initiated action to remove the individual from federal service," an agency spokesperson said.
The TSA identified and removed the employee from screening operations, the TSA said Wednesday on its blog.
"TSA views the handwritten note to be highly inappropriate and unprofessional and apologizes for this unfortunate incident," the spokesperson said.
"The note was inappropriate, the agent in question acted unprofessionally when s/he put in my bag, there should be consequences and I'm glad the TSA takes these things seriously.
I would much prefer a look at why 'security' has been used to justify so many intrusions on our civil liberties, rather than fire a person who made a mistake."
