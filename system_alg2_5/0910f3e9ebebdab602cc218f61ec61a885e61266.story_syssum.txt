But as an American who has been in the country for 20 years and lived in Johannesburg and Cape Town, I can speak about the unique mindset that comes from living behind high walls, particularly the kind of high walls Pistorius lived behind in his Pretoria security complex.
In fact, it's exactly the opposite.
But the South African security complex like the one Pistorius owned offers the resident walls within walls.
Living in a concrete womb seemed to make people believe they could totally ignore the possibility of crime that somehow so captured the imagination of Pistorius that he felt compelled to post his now famous 2012 tweet: "Nothing like getting home to hear the washing machine on and thinking its an intruder to go into full combat recon mode into the pantry!
It seemed that nobody was even vaguely interested in going "full combat recon mode."
And even add a weird "waa."
The guy was charged with murder but never went to trial.
Turns out he got off on a technicality.
