Set in "Some place calling itself Rome," but filmed, very tellingly, in battle-scarred Serbia and Montenegro, "Coriolanus" imagines a modern state rocked by food shortages and border disputes.
While he easily carries the Senate, tradition demands that Caius, now known as "Coriolanus," must also seek the assent of the citizenry in the public market.
As in other modern-dress Shakespearean adaptations, there are anomalies and eccentricities in this production, which brandishes guns and tanks but talks of swords and ultimately falls back on knife fights.
Politics is a dirty business, but Coriolanus betrays everyone he's ever known to uphold his own warped sense of honor.
Logan has cut the play in half, but what it loses in detail the movie more than picks up in clarity and punch.
