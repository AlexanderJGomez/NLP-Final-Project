(CNN) -- On the eve of President Obama's speech laying out his strategy to combat the terror group ISIS, national security hawks are demanding the United States authorize airstrikes against the group's leaders.
Still, when asked why the United States is not trying to kill the group's top leaders, White House spokesman Josh Earnest did not rule out such a strategy in the future.
Analysts said the first challenge would be to locate elusive ISIS leaders like Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
But a U.S. intelligence official pointed out that over time, the United States has killed top extremist leaders, from Osama bin Laden in Pakistan to Anwar al Awlaki in Yemen to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in Iraq.
