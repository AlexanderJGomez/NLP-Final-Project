KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A New York Times reporter who was kidnapped last week was freed Wednesday in a pre-dawn military raid in Afghanistan that left a British commando, an Afghan journalist and several others dead.
Farrell called the newspaper's foreign editor before dawn and said he was "extracted" in a commando raid after a fierce firefight, according to a report on the Times Web site.
I could hear British and Afghan voices," Farrell, a 46-year-old dual Irish-British citizen, told the paper.
but dropped in a hail of bullets, Farrell said.
Farrell's citizenship played a role in the British decision to stage the rescue, said a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense.
Brown offered condolences to the families of Munadi and the British commando.
Ten weeks earlier, another Times reporter escaped after months in Taliban captivity.
The death toll in the Kunduz airstrike, which Farrell was covering when he was kidnapped, has varied, depending on the source, but local Afghan officials have said at least half of those killed were civilians.
In a separate incident Wednesday, a suicide attack killed at least two civilians and injured several others, including NATO personnel, near the main British military base in southern Afghanistan, the ISAF said.
The casualty count is unclear as an investigation continues.
