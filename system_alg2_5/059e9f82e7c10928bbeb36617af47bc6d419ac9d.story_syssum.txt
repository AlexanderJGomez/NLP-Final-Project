ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The state of Georgia, stricken by months of drought, confirmed Friday that it will sue the Army Corps of Engineers.
The Army Corps of Engineers says there is about a three-month supply of water left in Lake Lanier, which is 15 feet below its capacity.
Fish and Wildlife Service, the state and downstream users -- releases 5,000 feet of water per second from the dam between the man-made lake and the river.
Franklin also admitted that the Atlanta area did little to add to storage facilities during years of recent explosive growth, but says the city has now purchased a stone quarry to be developed into a new reservoir.
According to Franklin, 14 percent of the city's pipes, many of which date back to the 1890s, leak.
Two poultry plants have cut production by one day a week to curtail water use and are also trucking water in for other uses.
"I put a bucket in it and I use that collected water to water the two flowers I would like to save."
