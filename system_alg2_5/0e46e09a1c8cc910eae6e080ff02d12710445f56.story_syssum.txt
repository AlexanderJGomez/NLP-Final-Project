However, many consumers are now giving gifts that not only say I love you, but also help those in need.
From backpacks that provide an education to jewelry that empowers women to crocheted goods that help people rise out of poverty, here are three socially conscious companies that are trying to change the world with their products.
After returning to the United States, Clough made it his mission to provide education opportunities for underserved communities.
"By purchasing a backpack our customers carry an education," says Clough.
In Uganda [the jewelry made from paper beads] is looked down on," says Dovel.
The women at the school taught Dovel how to make the paper beads and asked her to sell the jewelry for them in the United States.
More than 100 Ugandan women now participate in 31 Bits programs, and the company reports it has raised more than $500,000 for women it employs through product sales.
Together, Ramsey, Kohl Crecelius and Travis Hartanov set out to provide the tools, knowledge and opportunities needed to enable Ugandan refugees to better their circumstances; but first they had to figure out how.
Ramsey, Crecelius and Hartanov sold the hats in the United States, providing income for the women they employed.
Stone + cloth, 31 Bits, and Krochet Kids International provide three different ways consumers can show their love for that special someone while making the world a better place.
