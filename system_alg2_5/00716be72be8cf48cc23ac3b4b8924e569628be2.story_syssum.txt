SAE was founded March 9, 1856, at the University of Alabama, five years before the American Civil War, according to the fraternity website.
The fraternity's website lists more than 130 chapters cited or suspended for "health and safety incidents" since 2010.
Stanford University in December suspended SAE housing privileges after finding sorority members attending a fraternity function were subjected to graphic sexual content.
Universities have turned down SAE's attempts to open new chapters, and the fraternity had to close 12 in 18 months over hazing incidents.
