Beijing (CNN) -- Families of Chinese passengers on board missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 have engaged in a rare late-night act of civil disobedience in this tightly-controlled city.
They're lying to us," the man repeated.
Though vastly out-numbered by Chinese security forces, the family members continued their stubborn vigil throughout the morning.
For weeks, distraught next of kin have requested face-to-face meetings with Malaysian officials.
He spoke to CNN in a "journalist's area" located out of sight of the Malaysian Embassy protest.
Even at the early hour of 1 a.m. on Friday, Chinese police had cordoned off an area for media around the corner from the sit-in.
On Friday a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, Qin Gang, called on the families protesting outside the embassy to "express their appeals in a legal and rational way" while pledging to give them further assistance.
