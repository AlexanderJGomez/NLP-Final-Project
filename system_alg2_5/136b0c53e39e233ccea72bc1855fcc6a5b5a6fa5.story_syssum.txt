President Bush and Laura Bush welcome Barack and Michelle Obama to the White House on Monday.
Bush and Obama held a private meeting in the Oval Office, while the first lady gave incoming first lady Michelle Obama a tour of the residence.
It marked the first time Obama has visited the Oval Office.
"President-elect Obama thanked President Bush for his commitment to a smooth transition, and for his and first lady Laura Bush's gracious hospitality in welcoming the Obamas to the White House," Cutter said.
Podesta said Obama will push Congress to enact "at least part" of an economic package before he takes office in January, but said the problems Americans face need short- and long-term approaches.
Ensuring that this transition is seamless is a top priority for the rest of my time in office," Bush said in his radio address this weekend.
