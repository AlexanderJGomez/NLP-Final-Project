CNN -- Donny Osmond was the Justin Bieber of his day.
Donny and Marie Osmond are guests on Monday's "Piers Morgan Tonight."
I look at Justin Bieber ... and my heart breaks for him, because I know what he's going to go through.
"They didn't look at it as being a celebrity," Marie said.
And that's what I learned from Sammy Davis Jr., from Frank Sinatra, is when you went to ... those shows, you got to know them."
Presley came to visit him in his dressing room the following evening, Donny said, and politely said "'Hi, everybody.
When you go onstage, you're just another person."
Marie said that when she broke the news of the engagement to her son, he hadn't been aware his parents were even dating.
It's out.
I went to my son and I said, 'I'm going to marry your father again and I need a song that says my love to him.'
"There's always a place that is set in your heart at the dinner table," said Marie.
