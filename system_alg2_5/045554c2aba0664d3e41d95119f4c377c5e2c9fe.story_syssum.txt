Then, this week, TMZ Sports released footage of surveillance video from inside the elevator that shows the altercation and the knock-out punch.
The facts never changed -- Rice knocked Janay Palmer (now Janay Rice) unconscious.
"We requested from law enforcement any and all information about the incident, including any video that may exist," NFL Vice President of Corporate Communications Brian McCarthy, said, specifically citing New Jersey State Police, Atlantic City police and Atlantic County prosecutor's office as places where the NFL inquired.
"That video was not made available to us and no one in our office saw it until (Monday)," he said in a statement.
While the casino said that prosecutors were given the video of inside the elevator, prosecutors have not confirmed whether it was shown to the grand jury.
The elevator video has renewed outrage, but the court says the prosecutor cannot reconsider or ask the judge to revoke the deal with Rice unless he commits a new crime or doesn't follow along in the program.
It is rare to offer pretrial intervention in domestic violence cases, Callan said, but in Atlantic City -- with an elevated homicide rate -- this incident probably was not as big a priority.
As soon as those facts come to light, we believe the public will have a different opinion."
"We know there is more to Ray Rice than this one incident."
Janay Rice on Tuesday expressed outrage, too.
According to Janay Rice, waking up after her husband was cut from his team and suspended from the NFL was a nightmare.
