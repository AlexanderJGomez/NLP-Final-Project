One-time basketball bad boy Ron Artest, who changed his name to Metta World Peace and said it was meaningful and inspirational, was ejected Sunday from the Los Angeles Lakers-Oklahoma City Thunder game for hitting James Harden in the head with his elbow.
The Thunder, they're playing for a championship this year, so I hope that he's OK and I apologize to the Thunder and to James Harden," he said.
"He will be re-evaluated tomorrow and is currently listed as day-to-day."
Sports fans were baffled, some even amused, when World Peace announced last year that he planned to legally change his name from Ron Artest.
Even before it was finalized by the court, World Peace was working on making the world a more peaceful place.
But in the world, peace sometimes comes with a price: The NBA is now reviewing World Peace's less than peaceable actions.
