The practices documented "are among the most serious human rights violations under international law, are crimes under Afghan law and are strictly prohibited under both Afghan and international law," the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) says in the report.
are methods that are absolutely non-existent in the NDS (National Directorate of Security)," the government said.
UNAMA said officials with Afghanistan's National Directorate of Security "systematically tortured detainees in a number of detention facilities across Afghanistan.
"UNAMA's detention observation report found compelling evidence that 125 detainees (46%) of the 273 detainees interviewed who had been in NDS detention experienced interrogation techniques at the hands of NDS officials that constituted torture," the report said.
Canada and the United Kingdom ceased transfers of detainees to facilities in Kandahar and Kabul at various times based on reports of torture and ill treatment, the report said.
We are happy that this report also testifies in a part that torture did not take place in a systematic manner in all NDS headquarters."
