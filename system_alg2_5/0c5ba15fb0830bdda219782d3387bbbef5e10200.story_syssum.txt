The saga of the single-engine TBM-700 aircraft also turned into an international incident, spurring both the United States and Cuba to dispatch fighter jets to trail the plane after it went radio silent.
At that time, the plane was somewhere above Statesville, North Carolina, about 600 miles south of the Rochester, New York, airport it left from around 8:45 a.m. destined for Naples, Florida.
The air traffic controller told the pilot to "stand by," then to proceed to 25,000 feet as he works on clearing the plane to go lower.
The watery crash spurred Jamaica and the United States to swiftly dispatch government aircraft to the scene.
By early evening, Jamaican authorities had found an oil slick in the prime search area that -- at that point -- was the only possible sign of the downed aircraft, according to Maj.
Yet Scott Fybush, the family spokesman and also the Glazers' nephew, said he believed the couple were the only people on the plane, with Larry Glazer flying the couple toward their vacation home in Florida.
A post on Women Entrepreneurs Blog, which is produced in conjunction with the University of Rochester's business school, notes that she ran the New York City Marathon, did whitewater rafting and learned how to fly a plane -- all in addition to raising three children and building her business.
The unresponsiveness spurred NORAD to dispatch two F-16 fighter jets set from McEntire Joint National Guard Base in Richland County, South Carolina, to investigate.
The Cuban government even let the U.S. Coast Guard's C-130 aircraft go through its airspace and also gave permission for American "military aircraft, if necessary," according to an official statement.
The plane itself was owned by Larry Glazer's company, Buckingham Properties.
