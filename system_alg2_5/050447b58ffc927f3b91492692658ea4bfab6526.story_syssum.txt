Barbie caused a stir when Mattel and Sports Illustrated revealed last week that she would appear in the 50th anniversary edition of its annual swimsuit edition, which hit stands Tuesday.
A post on "Mommyish" blog, "The Sport's Illustrated Swimsuit Issue Will Feature Barbie, So Your Daughter Can Feel Bad Too," underscored criticism of the partnership for using a children's toy to promote sexualized images intended for adults.
The 2014 swimsuit issues celebrates "legends," and Mattel said Barbie is a fitting example.
As one person said in response to a question posed on Twitter, "no little girl reads Sports Illustrated.
"Children KNOW Barbie is a toy but the 'skinny' models tell society ... that a woman must be skinny to be accepted as beautiful; a far more negative example than Barbie," she said.
Barbie and the Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition have both been accused of promoting idealized beauty in their own ways.
"Barbie is the perfect model for the SI swimsuit issue.
"Yes, the swimsuit edition is made up entirely of hypersexualized images of women, but this pairing blurs a new line.
"When you look at how the lives of women have changed since the doll originally launched, the choice strikes me as particularly tone deaf in 2014," said Rodgers, of RoleReboot.org.
