Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- South Africans in the emerging middle class are becoming savvy consumers, now concerned with brands.
While the rest of the world is utilizing social media to advertise commodities, The Creative Counsel is utilizing what it calls the "traditional" type of social media -- word of mouth.
Gil Oved, co-founder and co-CEO of The Creative Council, says: "Multinational brands are coming from all over the world and they want in on Africa as is obvious, and agencies like ours are helping them engage a consumer in a new, inventive way, which is actually a very old traditional way.
Zonal champions will inform and educate members of the emerging middle class in South Africa on what to buy, and why they should buy it.
Shameel Joosub, Group CEO for Vodacom explains: "In reaching your customers you need to reach them in different ways and one of the big things is that the traditional media doesn't necessarily reach into the far more rural parts of a country... so a lot of it has to be done through word of mouth and promotions.
For the community, a big multinational such as Vodacom now has a face and a voice and can give one-on-one advice on a daily basis.
Apart from bridging the gap between the big multinational and the consumer this marketing strategy also provides employment opportunities for South Africans.
"It means that if you're a brand that needs to support me in the community, create employment opportunities, gives me real product information, I will support you and buy your product -- one hand washes the other.
