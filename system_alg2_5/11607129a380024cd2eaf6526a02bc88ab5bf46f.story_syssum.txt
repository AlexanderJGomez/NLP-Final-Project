About 3,700 children in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone  have lost one or both parents to the disease, according to U.N. child agency, UNICEF.
In Liberia, the children's aid agency said it is training additional mental health workers to ensure children affected by the deadly virus get the support they need.
"The vast majority of the children affected by Ebola are still left without appropriate care.
Ebola has killed more than 3,000 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and the United Nations says those numbers are vastly under-reported.
Meanwhile, Sierra Leone's President Ernest Koroma is missing an Ebola donor conference in London because his British-chartered plane had technical problems, the British Foreign Office said Thursday, an hour before he was due to give a news conference with British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond.
