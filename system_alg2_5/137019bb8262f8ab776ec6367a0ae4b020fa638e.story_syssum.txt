Maybe they crave the love of an adoring public, or perhaps they see the movies as a way to leave their mark on the world, to be immortalized on celluloid.
So Connie Nielsen is not your typical movie star.
"I absolutely refuse the fame part of my business," she says.
But it wasn't until 2000, when she was cast in Ridley Scott's Oscar-winning "Gladiator", that Nielsen landed a role that really let her show her acting ability.
But Nielsen has refused to be pigeonholed, seemingly drawn to difficult roles in controversial movies.
Danish drama "Br√∏dre" (U.S. title "Brothers") is about a soldier who returns from Afghanistan a broken man, unable to communicate his experiences from the conflict.
But Nielsen makes it clear that her career is not the focus of her life and she stresses the importance of making time outside the movies.
Perhaps her commitment to her art, her interest in social issues and her disavowal of fame simply reflect her Danish upbringing, but there's no doubt that compared to many other Hollywood stars Connie Nielsen is a breath of fresh air.
