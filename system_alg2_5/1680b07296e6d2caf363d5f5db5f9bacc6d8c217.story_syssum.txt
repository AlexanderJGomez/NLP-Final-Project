Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- South Africans sang and prayed late Thursday outside the hospital where Nelson Mandela is being treated, singing "Viva Mandela!"
Mandela's condition improved, President Jacob Zuma said Thursday, as the eyes of the nation remained fixed on his progress.
"Tata" is the word for father in the language of Mandela's Xhosa tribe.
We will live with that hope until the final end comes," she said.
The ANC is organizing prayer sessions around the country "where all South Africans can come together, hold hands and pray for Madiba, his family and medical team," it said in a statement Thursday.
"We need you!"
Police also cordoned off the street outside Mandela's Johannesburg home Thursday, the South African Press Association reported.
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is on a tour of the continent this week that includes South Africa, said his thoughts are with the nation's citizens.
"He is a personal hero, but I'm not unique in that regard," Obama told CNN Chief White House correspondent Jessica Yellin in Dakar, Senegal, the first stop of his African tour.
