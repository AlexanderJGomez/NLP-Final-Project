Novato, California (CNN) -- When health care reform passed Congress more than two years ago, Julie Walters yelled for her husband to come into the living room where she was watching the vote live on television.
Walters remembers.
This week, the Supreme Court is hearing a debate on health care reform.
"Like, I-can't-sleep scared."
Before health care reform, there was a $5 million lifetime limit on Violet's insurance policy.
If Violet does lose her current insurance, her parents know there's no way another insurance company will want to insure her because her care is so expensive.
Seniors and people with disabilities have saved $3.2 billion on prescription drugs because of health care reform and insurance companies and 45 million women have received free mammograms and pap smears because of health care reform.
Violet's parents know not everyone shares their enthusiasm about health care reform.
