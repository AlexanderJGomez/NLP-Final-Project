Introduced on Wednesday, the Kindle Touch will be the first Amazon e-reader with a touch screen.
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has defended the lack of a touch screen on previous Kindle models, saying conventional touch displays produce reflections.
Applying a capacitive-touch layer to e-ink, the black-and-white display that looks like paper, darkens the screen, said Sriram Peruvemba, an executive for E Ink, the company that makes the popular screens in e-readers, in an interview on Wednesday.
Barnes & Noble implemented the same technology to bring touch screen capability to its Nook.
Another, Kindle Keyboard, costs $99 to $139 and looks just like its predecessor, the Kindle 3.
"We have many customers who tell us they don't want touch," Bezos reportedly said at the news conference in New York on Wednesday.
