According to a press release from Showtime, "Twin Peaks" will be a limited series of nine episodes.
Lynch and Frost will write and produce each one and Lynch will direct all nine.
The tone was set with Angelo Badalamenti's ghostly theme music.
"What more can I say -- 'Twin Peaks' with David Lynch and Mark Frost on Showtime in 2016!"
"To quote Agent Cooper, 'I have no idea where this will lead us, but I have a definite feeling it will be a place both wonderful and strange.'"
