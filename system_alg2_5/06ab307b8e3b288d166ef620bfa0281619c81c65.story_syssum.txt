And so it is.
Why it was, until Monday, our greatest day of the year.
To complete the celebration, Patriots Day marks the annual 11 a.m. Red Sox game at Fenway Park, an utterly local tradition concocted so baseball crowds wouldn't get in the way of marathon crowds.
These days, it's more of a pure spectacle, and I doubt many of those watching could name even one of the East African runners who have won in recent years.
As the terrible news began to spread, my Facebook feed was filled with messages from people I know telling me they were all right, or asking if someone else had been heard from.
Sadly, the marathon will not be the same after today.
And we are.
