In our solar system, only three planets lie in the sun's habitable zone -- Venus, Earth and Mars.
Say hello to the three new exoplanets: Kepler 62e and Kepler 62f orbit are the fifth and sixth planets orbiting the star Kepler 62, and Kepler 69c is the third planet orbiting -- you guessed it -- Kepler 69.
It orbits its star once every 267 days, very similar to the 225-day period of Venus.
Since Kepler 62 is a cooler star than our sun, planets can orbit closer to it than the Earth can to our sun before overheating.
In contrast, the third Earth-like planet, Kepler 69c, orbits a star very similar to our sun (that is, hotter than Kepler 62).
We don't know for sure whether there is life on Venus or Mars.
But could there be intelligent life in another planetary system, in orbit around one of the 100 billion other stars in our Milky Way galaxy?
We have had the technology to explore space and to communicate over long distances for less than 100 years -- a tiny fraction of the few million years since the first humans, much less the 4.5 billion years since the Earth formed.
So it is likely that any other technologically sophisticated civilization would be far more advanced than we.
He asked whether life might exist on one of these planets, and whether we could visit them.
Thanks to Kepler, NASA, dedicated scientists and curious citizens, we are that much closer to finding out.
