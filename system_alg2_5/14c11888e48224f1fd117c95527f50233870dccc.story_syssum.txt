(CNN)  -- A paramedic accused of plotting to extort $25 million from actor John Travolta after his 16-year-old son died in the Bahamas told a jury Wednesday the boy had been dead for some time before the ambulance service was called.
Earlier in the trial, Travolta testified that his son was found unresponsive by a nanny at the home on the island of Grand Bahama, where the family was spending the New Year's holiday.
The paramedic, however, asked Travolta to sign a statement releasing the ambulance company from liability.
In her statement, Bridgewater said she advised Lightbourn not to sell the document because she was trying to protect the Travoltas and the Bahamas.
Lightbourn said Wednesday that he asked attorney Bridgewater to assist him in negotiations with Travolta's attorneys.
Lightbourn said his eyes popped when Travolta's attorney offered him $15 million for the document Travolta signed.
The trial is expected to wrap up early next week when the jury will begin its deliberations.
