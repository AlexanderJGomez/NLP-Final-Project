Local police in Odisha told CNN's sister network in India, CNN-IBN, that seven people had been killed by falling trees.
"We have taken a zero-casualty approach," said Odisha state disaster manager Kamal Lochan Mishra.
Rainfall will also be a problem as Phailin moves up toward the Himalayas in Nepal.
Many of those evacuated from low-lying coastal areas of Odisha left on foot or by bicycle, Kamal Lochan Mishra said.
Power was out in coastal areas including Kalingapatnam, from where about 80,000 people were evacuated to relief camps, CNN-IBN reported.
Some fear a repeat of what happened on October 29, 1999, when Cyclone 05B, also known as the Odisha Cyclone, made landfall in the same area, killing 10,000 people.
"In a storm of this magnitude there is the potential for widespread damage to crops and livestock in the low-lying coastal areas and houses completely wiped away," said Kunal Shah, the head of World Vision's emergency response in India.
"We believe communities are better prepared than they were when the devastating cyclone hit in 1999," said Shah.
