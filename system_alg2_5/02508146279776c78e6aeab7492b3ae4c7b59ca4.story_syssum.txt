The engines on that flight were powered by a fuel mixture that was 30% biofuel from the jatropha plant, and the trip followed a pair of Mexican domestic commercial flights by Interjet that used the same formula.
Jatropha-based biofuels are being increasingly used in Mexico, and agave -- the plant from which tequila is made -- is being studied as a new source for ethanol.
Chiapas began cultivating jatropha, whose seeds contain oil that can be extracted and converted into biofuel.
By 2015, the goal is to have 1% of all jet fuel in Mexico be biofuel, and by 2020, 15%, he said.
"Mexico has made the very important first step to be in a very priviledged place," Lopez said.
Agave can grow in arid land, and produces less than half of the carbon dioxide emissions produced by corn-based ethanol, Oliver Inderwildi, one of the study's authors, told CNN.
The tequila business is very small compared to the fuel business, and is also more expensive than fuel ethanol, so Inderwildi predicts that alcohol prices would remain stable.
The catch, for now, is that neither jatropha or agave biofuel production is cost-effective.
The demand is there, the land is there, but there is no way to get it, he said.
