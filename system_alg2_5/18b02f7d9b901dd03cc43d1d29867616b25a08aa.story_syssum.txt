MIT researcher Pablo Valdivia Alvarado works in his lab on a robotic fish he co-created.
MIT researchers built their first robotic fish, "Robotuna," in 1994.
"We have built prototypes with the battery inside, but for my experiments, for simplicity.
The new generation has withstood harsh conditions in the lab, including two years of testing inside tanks filled with tap water, which is corrosive to standard robots, according to Alvarado, who says the Robotuna inspired him to take the technology to the next level.
