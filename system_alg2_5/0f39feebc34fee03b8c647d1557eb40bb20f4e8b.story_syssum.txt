(CNN)The mother of a quadriplegic man who police say was left in the woods for days cannot be extradited to face charges in Philadelphia until she completes an unspecified "treatment," Maryland police said Monday.
The man is unable to communicate how he came to be in the park, but Philadelphia police Lt. John Walker told reporters that the man's mother left him there the morning of April 6.
"The mother went to visit her boyfriend down in Maryland, over in Montgomery County, and we believe she placed the child into Cobbs Creeks Park," Walker said at a news conference.
When police tracked down the mother, she told them her son was with her, Walker said.
There was no reason for the man to suffer, Walker told philly.com, because the mother had sisters willing to take care of him.
Parler's sister told police that Parler has another child, a 16-year-old.
