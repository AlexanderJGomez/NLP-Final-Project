Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela at first advocated peaceful opposition to white rule in early work with the African National Congress, a liberation movement.
Over the decades that followed, as the movement against white rule in South Africa began to grow and unrest inside the country became increasingly violent, it became clear to the white government that they could no longer continue to govern without consulting the African National Congress and, in particular, Nelson Mandela.
After spending 27 years in prison, on his release Mandela pursued a policy of reconciliation between black and white in South Africa.
But "the Island," as it was known during the days of apartheid, gives the visitor an eerie sense of desolation.
Shortly after his release, Mandela built a house at Qunu, his birthplace in the Transkei, based on the layout of his prison lodgings.
Now a fascinating small museum, Mandela's old house in Vilakazi Street in Orlando West in Soweto shows just how black people lived under apartheid.
While not only about Nelson Mandela, this fascinating museum recreates what life was like for both black and white South Africans under apartheid.
Constitution Hill is the site today of South Africa's Constitutional Court, which is regarded as a post-modernist architectural icon.
A tour through the old prison gives you a sense of South Africa's layered and complex past.
If you are driving down to Durban from Johannesburg, you might want to make a short visit to the site at Howick where Nelson Mandela was arrested.
An ongoing mystery is tied to the place, though, as some activists have said the CIA tipped off the South African security forces, pinpointing Mandela at this spot.
If you're on the highway, the small museum at Qunu is certainly worth a stop.
Nelson Mandela's life and legacy are layered into the life and landscape of South Africa, and as the years go by, his stature grows.
