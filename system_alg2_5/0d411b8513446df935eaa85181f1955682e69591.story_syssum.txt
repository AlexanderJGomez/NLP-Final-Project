Jerusalem (CNN) -- The corruption trial of former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert ended Tuesday with a mixed verdict.
I honor the decision of the court, and will learn the lessons from this," Olmert said outside the courtroom.
Earlier this year, Olmert told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that millions of dollars from the "extreme right wing" in the United States helped oust him from government and derailed a peace plan with the Palestinians.
But the plan was never realized, and Olmert was forced from office accused of corruption.
