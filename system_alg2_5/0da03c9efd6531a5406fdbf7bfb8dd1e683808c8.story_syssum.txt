GAZA CITY, Gaza (CNN) -- Israeli forces fired on a U.N. aid convoy Thursday in Gaza, killing at least one contract worker and prompting the U.N. to halt some of its operations in Gaza, U.N. officials said.
UNRWA director John Ging said one aid worker was killed.
Ging said an Israeli liaison did not dispute that Israeli forces fired on the vehicle.
"We have horrific stories coming out now.
Three Israeli soldiers died in the fighting on Thursday, bringing to 10 the number of Israeli soldiers killed in the operation.
More than 20 rockets were fired into Israel on Thursday, Israeli police said.
Mohammed Hamid, a Palestinian driver, told CNN Israeli forces are stopping ambulances evacuating the wounded.
"We saw a man coming out of that house with a white flag and until now we have seen no sign of any military activity in that area," Wedeman reported.
A three-hour truce on Wednesday was also marred by fighting which Israeli officials said were in retaliation for Hamas attacks on Israeli forces.
