Athens (CNN) -- Tens of thousands of people rallied across Greece Thursday to protest further tough austerity measures, as a general strike essentially shut down much of the country's transportation network.
About 30,000 people took part in demonstrations in Athens Thursday, police spokesman Panagiotis Papapetropoulos said.
The incident is not related to any violence."
"We are here to protest the cuts 'they' are making, the misery they are imposing on the people," said a PAME union member protesting in Athens.
Shops were closed Thursday as a result of the strike, while hospitals operated on skeleton staffing and the transport system was badly affected.
The so-called troika of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF are due to report on Greece's troubled economy in the coming weeks, with the release of the next tranche of bailout money dependent on its findings.
The turmoil in the eurozone has exacerbated concerns about other ailing nations such as Spain and Italy, which are also struggling with high unemployment and debt.
