House mice not native to the island are threatening the Tristan albatross with extinction, the RSPB said.
The mice on the island eat the chicks of the albatross and bunting before they make it to the fledgling stage, the RSPB said.
Because of the impact from house mice, introduced to the island by sealers in the 18th and 19th centuries, conservation alliance BirdLife International earlier this year listed both the Tristan albatross and the Gough bunting as critically endangered -- the highest threat level before extinction.
A survey of the albatross on Gough Island in January showed 1,764 adults incubating eggs, the RSPB said.
It said eradicating the mice from Gough Island would solve the primary conservation threat facing both bird species.
Tristan albatrosses are one of 22 species of albatross in the world.
The birds can fly thousands of miles without a pause, and their only need to touch land is to nest and raise their young, the RSPB says.
