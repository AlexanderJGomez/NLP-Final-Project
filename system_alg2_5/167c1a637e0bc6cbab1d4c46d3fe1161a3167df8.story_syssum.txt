But for Rudy Fernandez, who leapt to fame with his "hellacious" dunk in an Olympic final against the U.S. Dream Team, playing in "the best league in the world" was not enough.
And you start playing 82 games in one season, it's a lot of basketball."
Playing against the might of the U.S. -- this time dubbed the "Redeem Team" following the disappointment of Athens 2004 -- he scored 22 points in 18 minutes of court time.
Spotted by Barcelona-based Joventut, Fernandez was set on the course to be a professional player from his mid-teens and was included in the Olympic squad for the Athens Olympics in 2004 while only 19 years of age.
Averaging 10.4 points and with a formidable conversion rate for three-point efforts and from the free throw line, Fernandez repaid Portland's faith in his abilities during his first season.
"Pau is probably one of the best players in the world, so he's my reference, and I work every year to be better and better," said Fernandez.
With Portland unable to make it past the first round of the playoffs in his time there, Fernandez went to Denver in a three-way trade.
Navarro and Pau Gasol would both be 36 at the time of the 2016 Olympics, so their participation is questionable, but Fernandez is hoping to go to his fourth Games.
While Spain dominates football, being the reigning world and European champions, its basketball team is not far behind.
