The Middle East refuses to acknowledge that the United States has decided to pivot toward Asia.
Claims that the world paid attention to the area only because it had oil or that the key to every single problem in the Middle East involved Israel have been proved wrong.
The region is in crisis because it suffers from endemic corruption, poor governance, discrimination against women and serious economic problems.
The implications of those beliefs will become evident as history unfolds.
The answer will help set the future of democracy in the Arab world, where Egypt leads in ideological, political and cultural trends.
Some will insist the concern is about oil, but the U.S. could still buy oil from a nuclear-armed Iran.
Separately, U.S. officials told CNN that Tehran is already finding ways to ship weapons to the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas in Gaza, just days after the U.S. helped broker a cease-fire between Hamas and Israel.
The opposition includes progressive advocates of democracy, but it also counts all manner of other ideologies, from mild Islamists to extremists who would like to see Syria as part of a supranational Islamic caliphate.
It would be nice if the American president could decide which regions will command his attention.
