He said he apologized to Marie Mills for "what appeared to be dereliction," DC news station WTTG reported.
The protocol is in question because, according to the Mills family, those who asked for help at the fire station were told to call 911.

It is understood.
Also Thursday, a spokesman said that two employees of the D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department have been suspended with pay in the wake of the incident.
"I cannot say who they were because it is a personnel matter and an ongoing investigation, but I can tell you that neither of them was the probationary firefighter involved in the incident," said Keith St. Clair, with the office of the deputy mayor for public safety.
The firefighters' union said the incident simply should never have happened.
