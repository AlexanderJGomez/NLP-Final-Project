On Sunday, it was discovered that the 900 million-person social network was "testing" a feature that would let people see a digital list of the people who were nearby in real life.
and generally complaining that the feature, which was difficult to find, much less use, invades privacy and will lead to stalking.
So that was this week.
But it seems like every week has been feeling a little like that.
Is the social network turning its back on users?
This theory is put forward by the blog the Next Web, which says Facebook is buying too many new companies -- Instagram, Glancee -- and trying too many new things.
At Facebook, 2 million complaints per week are handled largely by computers and a staff of a few hundred people.
Even when the site does give its users a chance to weigh in on policy, Madrigal says, users don't take up the offer.
And it doesn't help to know that, in mid-May, you were worth only $1.21 to Facebook.
"How much does Facebook value its users?
The more content you absorb, the less valuable your own posts seem."
