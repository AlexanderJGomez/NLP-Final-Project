There's a new league in town, and it's all about fast and furious fitness.
Sure, the idea of team functional fitness isn't exactly new.
The action takes place on a 94-by-50-foot grid, split up into eight quadrants (four for each team) plus a start and finish area.
Races -- some of which are coed, some of which are male or female-only -- can include anything from handstand push-ups, burpee box jumps, rope climbs and double-unders for time.
For each battle, the winning team gets two points (exception being the last race which counts for three points), and the losing team gets one.
"When you're competing as an individual you can find your own pace and if you mess up, you have a longer time to make up for it," says Annie Thorsidottir, captain of the New York Rhinos.
Rhinos co-captain Mat Fraser, who also earned second place at the 2014 CrossFit Games, says the relentless speed is something Grid athletes, himself included, will need to adjust to.
In this abbreviated first season, teams will play three matches each, giving fans 12 live events total (and ideally adequate time for the league to work out any remaining kinks).
Until then, fans can watch regular season match-ups on NPGL.com via web broadcast.
There's always next year's Grid League Combine.
