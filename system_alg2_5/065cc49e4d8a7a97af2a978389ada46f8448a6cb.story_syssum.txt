Madrid's new blue clay courts have been the talk of the tennis world for all the wrong reasons.
But if the controversy over the last few weeks has revealed anything about tennis, it's that this is a game where tradition still looms large.
But really, it's just a color right?
According to Tiriac the blue clay court is made exactly the same way as the red, with bricks ground into tiny fragments and spread over the ground in two different layers.
"I never was in control of the match, I didn't know how to win a point," Nadal told reporters, before suggesting he will not show up next year unless the controversial blue clay surface is changed.
It wasn't on blue.
The Serbian beat Nadal in last year's final, held on red clay, and he expressed his unhappiness with the new surface even after beating Spanish qualifier Daniel Gimeno-Traver 6-2 3-6 6-2 in his opening match on Tuesday.
Blue clay..
"I haven't noticed a difference between the blue and the red clay.
Let's not forget the Australian Open changing court color from the green to that bright blue!
3 Ivan Ljubicic tested the blue clay at Madrid last year and admitted it did "look a bit slippery."
"I would say that grass courts and even the hard courts are a lot more dangerous than clay -- any clay," Ljubicic told CNN.
I would say that the altitude in Madrid creates bigger problems to players than the color of the court."
"Players were asked at the council meeting if they would support the idea of having blue clay courts.
They clearly refused the idea -- only to see that the decision was made anyhow that the surface will be blue," he said.
