(CNN) -- He didn't die with Wendy on the streets, but Bruce Springsteen's career needed some life.
On December 5, almost 40 years later, the handwritten genesis of one of The Boss' biggest hits -- and one of rock 'n' roll's most well-known songs -- will be auctioned off to the highest bidder.

The 1975 track became Springsteen's first worldwide release, and while Sotheby's says many of the original lyrics never made it to the recording booth, the chorus was "nearly perfected" in the handwritten manuscript.
Appel is credited with discovering Springsteen, and he produced The Boss' first three albums.
