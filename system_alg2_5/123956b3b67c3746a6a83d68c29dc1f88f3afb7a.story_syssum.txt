(CNN) -- Rutgers men's assistant basketball coach Jimmy Martelli resigned the same day his boss was fired after ESPN broadcast a lengthy video of players being physically and verbally abused, the university told CNN on Thursday.
"I can't say anything right now except I'm sorry, and there will never be a time where I'm going to use any of that as an excuse or will there be any excuse," he said, according to the station.
"I am responsible for the decision to attempt a rehabilitation of Coach Rice," Pernetti said in a written statement.
According to CNN affiliate WCBS, Pernetti said he had talked to Martelli about the video.
Certainly the tape focused on Mike, but it brought some other things to light that we dealt with at the same time that we dealt with Mike."
