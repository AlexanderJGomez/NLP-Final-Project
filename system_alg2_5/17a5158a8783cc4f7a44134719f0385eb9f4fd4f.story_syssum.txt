Marching band director Jonathan Waters was fired Thursday after the report's release, Ohio State University President Michael Drake said.
A parent of a marching band member alerted the office to the problem, the report said.
When Waters was asked by investigators about the offensive nicknames, he said "50%" were probably "questionable," according to the report.
Waters' lawyer, David Axelrod, said his client was named acting director in February 2013 but that the objectionable acts laid out in the report started many years before.
It is unclear what steps Waters will take next, Axelrod said.
"He won't let his beloved alma mater take away his good name."
