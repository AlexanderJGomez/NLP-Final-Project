In its first report last September, the inspector general concluded that the incident in which Secret Service agents brought prostitutes to their Cartagena hotel last spring caused no security threat before President Barack Obama arrived in the country for a summit.
The report made no recommendations, which signaled the watchdog's satisfaction with how the incident was handled.
At a hearing by the Senate Homeland Security Committee in May, Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan insisted the incident was an aberration.
Seven U.S. Army soldiers, two Marines and an Air Force member received letters of reprimand, while two members of the Navy refused non-judicial punishment and are awaiting court-martial.
