Ultimately, developers say, the aim is to use a number of sources, including weather data or information about events, to help bus and rail customers plan their journeys better and save their money and time -- and frayed nerves too.
The developers say the "sentiment mapping" project would also provide transport operators with a better understanding about the needs of their passengers and enable them to respond better in emergencies.
While the project is still in its infancy, the team unveiled Thursday morning a live tool mapping passengers' sentiment based on Twitter.
"The way you get from A to B often involves loads of different methods of transport -- you might walk, take the bus, train, bicycle; how do you make all those different modes of transport more connected, how do we use emerging technologies like GPS, satellite technology, mobile phones, open data or sentiment mapping and how do we use these technologies to improve transport systems."
"Smart cities need smart citizens in order to be effective."
