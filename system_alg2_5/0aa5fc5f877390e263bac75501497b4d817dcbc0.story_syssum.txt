Doctors said Lakshmi was recovering well as she appeared Tuesday at a news conference.
The operation a week ago lasted 27 hours and involved a team of some 30 surgeons, all specialists in pediatrics, neurosurgery, orthopedics, and plastic surgery, working in eight-hour shifts.
The surgery involved the removal of the extra limbs and the repositioning of Lakshmi's organs.
Planning for the surgery took a month, Patil said, and Lakshmi spent that month in the hospital.
