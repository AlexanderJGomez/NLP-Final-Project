(CNN) -- Not so long ago, the idea of a Casey Anthony movie seemed like a certainty.
But when CNN asked the network if it was pursuing an Anthony project, Lifetime said it had "nothing in development."
Actress Niecy Nash, who told CNN she watched "every minute" of the trial, is among those angered about the prospect of Anthony cashing in by selling the rights to her story.
"I do think there should be a movie made" about the case, Cooper said.
"I think she's got the chops," Cooper said.
Some people remain convinced there will be a Casey Anthony movie, including The Hollywood Reporter's Matthew Belloni.
"That conflict presents good fodder for a film."
