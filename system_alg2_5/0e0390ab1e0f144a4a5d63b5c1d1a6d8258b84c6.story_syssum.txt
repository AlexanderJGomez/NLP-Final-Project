That personal app grew into Weduary, a real product that helps people design wedding sites, and Morin went on to create her own lifestyle how-to company called Brit + Co., which combines crafting, homemaking and a bit of tech.
Inspired by the Maker movement and the tech culture of Silicon Valley, Morin wanted to combine her interest in technology and crafting with the popular Maker movement.
One of Morin's favorite recent projects was an LED cowboy hat she wore to the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas.
In an effort to differentiate herself from the doyennes of DIY like Stewart, Morin avoids saying the word "craft," which she thinks makes people think of popsicle sticks.
At Brit and Co., Morin's agreeable, bubbly personality is a big part of the product.
"In the past it was Disney, Rockefeller, Walmart; all these huge companies that have lasted for decades had a person's name in the brand."
Morin says that, like her, the current generation is interested in homemaking and DIY, but suffers from a lack of time and proper training.
