Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actor Charlie Sheen on Friday declared "we are at war" following canceled production of the hit CBS sitcom "Two and a Half Men" and his impending loss of $1.2 million per episode.
"I was told if I went on the attack, they would cancel the show and all that, so I'm just sort of seeing if they're telling the truth or not," Sheen told Jones.
"Based on the totality of Charlie Sheen's statements, conduct and condition, CBS and Warner Bros. Television have decided to discontinue production of 'Two and a Half Men' for the remainder of the season," the network and studio said in a joint statement Thursday.
It's not clear if "Two and Half Men" will return for a ninth season.
Newsflash: I am special, and I will never be one of you!
Bulls**t!
"I have a lot of work to do to be able to return the support I have received from so many people," Sheen said in a statement then.
"
That's what we do for him."
"I healed really quickly, but I also unravel really quickly, so get me right now guys," Sheen said.
While his representative blamed a hernia for Sheen's pain, he later announced the actor was undergoing rehab at home.
