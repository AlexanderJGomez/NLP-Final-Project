A group representing Swedes of African descent has called for Lena Adelsohn Liljeroth to resign over that it called a racist caricature.
The artist who designed the cake, Makode Linde, is of African descent himself and said the piece was aimed at condemning the practice of female genital mutilation.
He said the minister's appearance shows she either supported what the group called a racist event "or that she has an extremely bad sense of questions of racism."
