"The media attention to protests in Delhi has raised awareness on issues of violence against women in Nepal," said Manju Gurung, of Pourakhi, an organization that advocates for female migrant workers.
Their outrage focused on several cases of alleged rape and abuse against women, including that of the migrant worker, whom they refer to as Sita Rai.
On November 18, the woman returned home to Nepal on vacation from Saudi Arabia, where she works as a domestic worker, said Basanta Bahadur Basnet, a lawyer who represents the woman.
One of the airport police officers took her to a motel near a bus park where he robbed and repeatedly raped her, the lawyer said.
Parsuram Basnet has been suspended from his job as a police officer at the airport, but he cannot be removed from his job until the verdict, said Dhiraj Pratap Shingh, a spokesman for Kathmandu District Police.
The remaining three immigration officers accused of robbing the woman have been suspended and are under investigation, according to authorities.
"We are pushing for female immigration officers at the airport and strict monitoring to prevent such incidents," Gurung said.
