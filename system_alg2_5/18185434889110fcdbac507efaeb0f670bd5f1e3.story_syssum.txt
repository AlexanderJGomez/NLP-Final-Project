So what could come next for Greece?
The vote of confidence in Papandreou's government is expected to go ahead as planned, despite discussions Thursday on the formation of an interim coalition or national unity government.
In another scenario, the leader of the main opposition New Democracy party said Thursday that his party could enter a coalition government with the PASOK party, as an interim stage leading to new elections.
The conservatives have said Greece needs to bargain harder with Europe on any deal.
Papandreou told his Cabinet Thursday he was backing off from a referendum vote because the opposition New Democracy party had agreed to the need to pass austerity measures required by the bailout.
The recent crisis has prompted talk of a "democracy deficit," she said, as people in the different countries within the European Union complain that they have no say in important issues.
If its people vote "no" to the bailout plan, European leaders have made clear they will not hand over a sixth tranche of European funds from a previously agreed bailout.
Europe must put provisions in place to allow Greece to leave the euro, if that becomes necessary, with minimum damage, she said.
"The priority now is to focus not on Greece but on the rest of Europe, in particular Italy, which is the country most likely to be affected," she said.
