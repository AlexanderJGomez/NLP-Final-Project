Now that they are home, or soon to be home, our country has a solemn obligation to help them transition back to civilian life.
Today, nearly one in five women who are veterans have delayed or gone without necessary health care in the past year.
Today, one-third of the Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers lack a staff gynecologist and 18% of VA clinics have yet to hire at least one doctor specializing in women's health.
Nonetheless, one in three VA health centers does not have enough sexual trauma specialists on staff.
In our report, "Women Veterans: The Long Journey Home," DAV outlines 27 key policy and program recommendations that Congress, the administration, VA and the Departments of Defense, Labor, and Housing and Urban Development can take to strengthen the safety net for female veterans.
To help combat unemployment among female veterans, the Department of Defense must take a hard look at the primary program designed to help veterans go into the civilian labor force: the Transition Assistance Program.
Finally, as the VA and Defense work to strengthen services to servicewomen, these agencies need to invest in improved child care options.
For example, many are unable to take part in specialized mental health services, such as post-traumatic stress disorder support groups, because child care is unavailable.
