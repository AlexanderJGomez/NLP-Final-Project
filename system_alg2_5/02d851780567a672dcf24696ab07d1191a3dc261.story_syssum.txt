(CNN) -- Louisiana authorities said Tuesday they found the body of a missing 6-year-old girl, stabbed and stuffed in a trash can down the street from her home.
They found a pool of blood in one of the buildings, Normand said, and when DNA results came back Monday evening showing the blood belonged to Ahlittia, investigators searched the area again.
Normand said garbage collection in the neighborhood happens Tuesday mornings.
Flugence's brother Russell, 21, was arrested for obstruction of justice in the case, Normand said.
