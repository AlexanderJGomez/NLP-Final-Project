(WIRED) -- Facebook has rolled out its new Timeline feature to the masses.
1.
To hide a Timeline element, click the pencil icon at the top of the offending post, then choose "Hide from Timeline."
2.
These events aren't listed on your Timeline, but they can be.
3.
If you set a cover photo and then decide it's not as great as you first thought, just hover your mouse over the image, and a "Change Cover" option menu will pop up, letting you reposition the image or select a new one.
4.
On your Timeline, click "Activity Log."
5.
You can change it to "Only Important" updates or "All updates," and you can also filter what types of posts you're interested in seeing: things like life events, status updates, or photos.
You can click "More" next to Lists to add other lists of your choosing â€” "Acquaintances," "Poker Club Members," you get the picture.
