Three suspects, one of them wounded, were in custody, said Georgia Bureau of Investigation spokesman John Bankhead.
CNN affiliates WSB-TV and WXIA reported the trooper wounded the suspected shooter shortly afterward.
The injured suspect was taken to the same hospital and underwent surgery, Bankhead said.
