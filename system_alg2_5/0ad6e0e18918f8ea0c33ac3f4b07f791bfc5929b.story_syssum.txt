Santana recalled the moments when he recorded a roughly three-minute video of North Charleston Police officer Michael Slager shooting Walter Scott as Scott was running away Saturday.
At no time did Santana see Scott go after the Taser.
Police said Slager used a Taser against Scott, but Slager would also later tell a dispatcher that Scott at some point had grabbed the Taser.
When Santana's video begins, Scott starts running away from the officer, with Scott's back to Slager.
"He was there.
Judy Scott said she couldn't watch the whole recording.
But ... if I wouldn't show my face, everybody over there knows, including the police, who I am," Santana said.
His attorney, Todd Rutherford, said Santana's video would be useful in an investigation -- not only into the shooting but also into whether Scott received prompt medical attention.
