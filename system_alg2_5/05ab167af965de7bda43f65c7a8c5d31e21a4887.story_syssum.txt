Spraying chemical dispersants on the slick, as BP has, is one way to remove oil from the surface.
BP has also injected dispersants into the oil plumes rising from the oil rig's broken plumbing on the seabed to try to prevent oil slicks from forming on the surface at all.
This is therefore the first spill where large plumes of oil have been observed spreading below the sea surface.
To map underwater concentrations of oil and dispersants, instruments need to be lowered into the plumes to take measurements and samples that are later analyzed in a lab.
Near the source of the oil plumes in the gulf, the sampling problem is particularly severe because "young" plumes tend to be extremely patchy (the oil distribution is very uneven).
To determine the extent of the oil spill, we will need to combine measurements with computer modeling.
It is equally important, however, to continue to collect data on the circulation in the gulf over the full water depth to validate and improve the realism of models for this spill.
