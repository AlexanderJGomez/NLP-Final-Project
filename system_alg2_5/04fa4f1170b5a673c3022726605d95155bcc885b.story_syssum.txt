But the splash is bigger when such projects fail or when people starting mumbling about Chinese influence.
When a Chinese company bought Volvo, it was the transfer of technology that made the headlines, along with the end of the era for a venerable European brand.
But any attempt it makes to expand in Europe, United States or Africa is met with fears of technology transfer to a firm linked to the Chinese military through its founder.
A change of leadership in Beijing will not have much impact in Europe.
It also helps to expand China's middle class which appears to love European and American products.
But it did.
It cannot expect its companies to grow in the Chinese market, then be surprised when enriched Chinese companies come shopping for European companies to buy.
China needs to understand that it will take time for Europe to get comfortable with China's investments.
