When buying beef, we tend to stick to what we know, which may be why almost 60 percent of our beef dollars go for ground beef.
A 3½-ounce serving provides 27g to 30g of protein and is an excellent source of iron, zinc, and phosphorus.
The beef we eat comes mostly from 18- to 24-month-old steers, averaging about 1,000 pounds, and yielding about 450 pounds of meat.
• Grain-finished: Nearly 75 percent of U.S. beef comes from cattle fattened on grain (usually corn) for three to six months in feedlots.
Their meat is lower in saturated fat, cholesterol, and calories than grain-finished.
About 90 percent of American beef is sold as large vacuum-packed cuts.
• Processing and packaging: Until the 1960s butcher shops bought beef as half- or quarter-carcasses.
• Fat content: The USDA defines "lean beef" as having less than 10 grams (g) of total fat, 4.5g or less of saturated fat, and less than 95 milligrams of cholesterol per 3½-ounce serving (100g) of cooked beef.
Because lean beef contains less fat, it's best cooked to medium-rare (145°F) or medium (160°F) to optimize tenderness.

• Natural and Organic: Beef labeled "natural" must not contain any artificial ingredients and cannot be more than minimally processed, such as ground beef.
• Buy lean cuts.
And when the fat cooks away, lean cuts provide more meat for your dollar.
Advice to buy a side or quarter of beef may seem sensible, but you'll likely have more meat than you can store.
