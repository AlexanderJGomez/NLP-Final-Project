Tavis Smiley, talk show host and author, has always used his platform to discuss the issues of the black community and the country as a whole.
That said, I respectfully disagree with West and Smiley's characterization of President Obama's first term in office.
They ignore the positive moves Obama has made to benefit -- in real ways -- the black community, the poor, the disadvantaged, and the country as a whole.
Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which he shepherded and signed into law, insurance companies are no longer allowed to deny insurance to individuals because of pre-existing conditions.
Then there is the Children's Health Insurance Re-authorization Act, signed into law by Obama, which provides health care to millions of kids .
President Obama also expanded Pell Grants, which help low income students pay for college.
There's more.
To review, then: Putting money into community colleges, job readiness programs, putting actual checks into actual hands -- these things don't sound like the actions of someone who doesn't care about the poor and impoverished.
If West and Smiley would like Obama to do more, that's valid.
I'm not saying that President Obama should be exempt from criticism, nor do I believe it is some act of racial treason for a black person to hold our president accountable for his actions.
If they think they have issues with the president not doing enough for the poor now, wait and see what happens if the opposition takes office.
...The road ahead will be long.
