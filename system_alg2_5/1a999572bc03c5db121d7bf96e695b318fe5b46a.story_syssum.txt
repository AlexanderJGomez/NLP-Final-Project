A painting by the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh, which was previously believed to be a forgery, has been authenticated.
It is said to be the first full-sized canvas by van Gogh to be found in 85 years.
On March 30, 1852, Vincent van Gogh was stillborn in the Netherlands.
He left school at 15.
His brother Theo would write that, very near the end, Vincent said to him: "The sadness will last forever."
You don't have to be an aficionado of fine art to walk into a public gallery, stand before a painting done by someone long dead, and think: One day, many generations ago, whoever created this work decided that this tiny brushstroke here would be preferable to another, subtly different one; that this shade of red in this corner was the ideal one, instead of a shade more vivid or more muted; that the shadows over on this side of the canvas were what was needed to set the proper mood.
The book can be by an acclaimed author -- F. Scott Fitzgerald, the wonderful writer of Westerns Dorothy M. Johnson, Philip Roth -- or by an author with whose work you are unfamiliar.
The writer, on that day, may not have known whether his or her book would ever be published.
