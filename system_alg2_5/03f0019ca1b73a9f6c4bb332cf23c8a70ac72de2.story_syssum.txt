At the end of the APEC trade summit in China, U.S. President Barack Obama announced a climate change agreement with Chinese President Xi Jinping that would cut both countries' greenhouse gas emissions by close to a third over the next two decades.
A senior administration official calls the goals both  "ambitious and achievable," but also acknowledged that U.S. domestic politics could put a damper on the announcement.
The White House said the announcement marks the first time China has agreed to cut its carbon emissions, and said the Chinese are calling for "an energy revolution" that would include a broad economic reform program that would address air pollution.
The reduction of smog and the appearance of blue skies was noted by media throughout the APEC Summit.
