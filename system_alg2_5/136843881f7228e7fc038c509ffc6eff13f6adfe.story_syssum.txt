If you've spent any time downloading music, apps or other stuff from iTunes, you know what Meyers is talking about: Those messages from Apple that pop up on your laptop, iPad or iPhone and say, "iTunes Terms and Conditions have changed.
"Yeah, just agree," wrote one user, macbookairman, on a MacRumors.com forum, echoing the sentiments of many Apple users on the site.
But two digital-media attorneys contacted by CNN say that customers of iTunes, Apple's online marketplace, should still be aware of what they're agreeing to -- and what legal rights they may be giving up.
"When they change the iTunes terms, as they do all the time, they give you all 50 pages instead of giving the option of seeing the changes," Grossman said.
Both Grossman and Handel are quick to say that this is not just an Apple issue.

Grossman said that while this is not something to lose sleep over, people should know where their information is going.

Grossman said that there is no leeway on this point, and that anyone who tried to take Apple to court over a lost digital file would lose very quickly.

"C'mon, Apple.
"Whatever is in those 50 pages needed to be said," he said.
In addition, Handel said the lengthy terms are not all Apple's doing.
It's not clear whether Apple will ever incorporate user suggestions and shorten or revise its iTunes  terms.
But in the meantime, Handel said, Apple customers should scan those terms and conditions the next time they get that pop-up message.
