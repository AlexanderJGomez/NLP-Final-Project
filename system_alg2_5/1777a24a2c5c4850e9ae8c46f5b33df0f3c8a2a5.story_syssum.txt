Mitt Romney's savaging of Gingrich helped him to clinch Florida.
Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich will compete over who is the most conservative, and Ron Paul will push his unique brand of libertarianism.
So it would serve Santorum well to hit Mitt hard in the debate.
One thing Santorum doesn't particularly need to do in the debate is make voters like him: They already do.
Hitherto, Mitt has suffered from the "weirdo factor" -- the sense that he's not quite like you and me.
But Mitt has been countering the "weirdo factor" with a series of ads and personal appearances in Michigan that emphasize his local roots and his concern for the auto industry in a state beset by tragic levels of unemployment.
But if Romney's reinvention as a human being does pay off, it will be because Republicans desperately want it to work.
Republicans still tell pollsters that they think Mitt is the most electable candidate.
