The squeamish gasp.
Babies cry.
Turbulence, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, is caused by a quick change in air movement.
Jet streams, air shooting off of mountains, cold or warm weather fronts and thunderstorms can all cause changes in speed or direction.
There have been 234 turbulence-related accidents since 1980, and 114 passengers were seriously injured in those accidents, the FAA reported.
"The majority of injuries actually happen to flight attendants," Dorr said.
Passengers said most of those injured were not wearing seat belts.
No passengers were reported seriously injured in turbulence incidents in 2008, and five flight attendants -- down from a high of 19 in 2003 -- received serious injuries, according to the FAA.
All licensed pilots also receive "upset training," which teaches how to deal with extreme turbulence, he said.
