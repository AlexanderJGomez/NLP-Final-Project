Maybe Drudge is more entertainer than reporter.
People Magazine did a story on Clinton, and the photographer taking the picture for the front cover asked Clinton to stand by a lawn chair, grab the top, and lean into the camera.

"It's better not to argue with women," Putin said, "but Mrs. Clinton has never been too graceful in her statements."
Well.
Politico ran the quote with the observation, "This isn't going to play well in Moscow."
We can expect a lot more to be said about Hillary Clinton, since her memoir, "Hard Choices," is coming out.
And, unfortunately, I'm also sure some in the media will be right there with some tweetle-dumb about it.
