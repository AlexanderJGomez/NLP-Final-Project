Now, the designer of "Civilization" is ready to take over a completely new world -- social gaming on the pages of Facebook.
"Each game starts out in a brand new world (and is) probably going to go off in a different direction than your last game.
It felt like, both in terms of the technology and also where players were, that they would respond to having a strategy type game on their console."
Long-time fans bemoaned the simplicity of the console version, but it won 2008's Best Strategy Game award from the British Academy Video Games Awards.
Meier said there were things that a Facebook game can offer Civ players over a traditional PC game.
He said pacing and having to work with other people would be the biggest adjustments for PC "Civilization" players.
Unlike other Facebook games (oh, let's say "Farmville"), "Civilization World" will have a beginning and an end.
The game will also look different from its PC counterparts.
He said designing a Facebook game does give them the ability to update things really quickly because players are essentially downloading the whole game every time they play.
"Games are really taking over the world."
