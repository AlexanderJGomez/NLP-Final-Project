The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives this week for the first time made public the tests it has done on a model of handgun called the Liberator, made using 3-D printer technology.
One gun made using a plastic called ABS-M30, commonly used in toys and luggage, fired a .380-caliber round without failing all eight times it was tested at an ATF lab in Martinsburg, West Virginia, ATF officials said.
Another pistol made from a plastic called Visijet didn't perform as well in ATF tests.
Many popular models made with plastic parts still must use a certain amount of metal to abide by the detectability law.
This is an extremely serious threat to law enforcement, to people who fly every day," Holder said in remarks in St. Louis on Thursday.
A handful of lawmakers are backing bills in the House and Senate to try to extend the detectable firearms law but there's no indication they'll get a vote in a Congress that is bitterly divided on many issues, including gun safety laws.
