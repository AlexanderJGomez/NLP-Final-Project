A former prosecutor who declined to bring charges against Bill Cosby a decade ago said Wednesday that he wishes he could've nailed the comedian on an allegation that he drugged and molested a woman at his Pennsylvania home.
Castor, who was the district attorney for Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, when Constand came forward in 2005, now tells CNN he thought Constand was credible, and he thought Cosby was evasive in his interview with prosecutors.
"I had a theory that Cosby had drugged the woman using something to make her sleepy and to make her defenseless or unable to recall what happened, but because of the delay, I couldn't check her blood," he said.
The case would have come down to she said, he said, and while Castor felt strongly that Constand was telling the truth, her statements alone were not going to be enough to convict Cosby, the ex-prosecutor said.
No, I didn't," he said.
Dickinson did not return a telephone call from CNN seeking comment, but Cosby has repeatedly said previous allegations are untrue.
Bowman alleged she was drugged, then raped, though she said she never saw drugs.
On Saturday, NPR broadcast an awkward interview with Cosby in which he didn't utter a word when repeatedly asked about the accusations.
