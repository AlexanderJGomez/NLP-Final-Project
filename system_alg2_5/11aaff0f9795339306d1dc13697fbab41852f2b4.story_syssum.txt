It is 10 years after the invasion of Iraq, and images of Iraqi women from various political parties are filling the streets of Baghdad ahead of April's local elections -- a sign to casual observers that women's equality is on track in this war-ravaged country.
The women who could afford it withdrew from the public space due the violence dominating  the streets.
Violence against women -- and the lack of legal protection for women -- is also on the rise.
It would be unfair to blame the regression Iraqi women have faced only on the last 10 years, as the previous decade of economic sanctions that preceded it also took its toll on Iraqi society.
But despite the challenges that face them, some Iraqi women continue to stand up for women's rights.
They deserve everyone's support, for the story of women's rights is the story of Iraq's future.
