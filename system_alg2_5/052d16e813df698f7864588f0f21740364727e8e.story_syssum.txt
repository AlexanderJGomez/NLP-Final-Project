Hawking, one of the world's most famous physicists, is also a cosmologist, astronomer, and mathematician.
On his Web site, Hawking has written about living with ALS.
Hawking is completely dependent on others or technology for virtually everything -- bathing, dressing, eating, even speech.
In 2004, police completed an investigation into accusations by Hawking's daughter that his second wife was abusing him.
The following are some quotes from that interview:
The one major development that was not anticipated was the discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating now, rather than slowing down... We live in the most probable of all possible worlds."
