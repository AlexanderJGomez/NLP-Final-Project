(CNN) -- Legendary and now disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong told Oprah Winfrey during a confessional interview that he hopes to compete again.
In part one of the interview, which aired Thursday, Armstrong admitted, unequivocally and for the first time, that he used performance-enhancing drugs on the way to seven Tour de France wins.
"I deserve to be punished," Armstrong told Winfrey.
Armstrong, in the first part of the interview, talked about the culture of cycling at the time he competed, telling Winfrey that doping was widespread then and just as much "part of the job" as water bottles and tire pumps.
"To make that decision and to step aside was -- that was big," he said in Friday's broadcast.
"It isn't fair."
But Armstrong was not telling the whole story, author David Coyle, who wrote a book about doping and the Tour de France, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Thursday night.
Armstrong described his years of denial as "one big lie that I repeated a lot of times."
Former cyclist Tyler Hamilton, who raced as a teammate of Armstrong from 1998 to 2001, said it was nice to hear Armstrong own up to some of his faults.
According to Hamilton, the next step for the disgraced cyclist is to testify before cycling officials about the doping network, naming names as needed.
After winning various legs of the Tour de France, Armstrong's sporting career ground to a halt in 1996, when he was diagnosed with cancer.
"We wouldn't be sitting here if I didn't come back," he told Winfrey.
In April, the USADA notified Armstrong of an investigation into new doping charges.
"He could have come clean.
