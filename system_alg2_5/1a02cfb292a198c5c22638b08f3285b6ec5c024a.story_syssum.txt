Anti-abortion protesters plan demonstrations this weekend outside Dr. LeRoy Carhart's clinic in Bellevue, Nebraska.
Anti-abortion groups, led by Operation Rescue, plan to launch protests outside Carhart's clinic this weekend in Bellevue, just south of Omaha.
Operation Rescue President Troy Newman has vowed a peaceful demonstration and said that any hints of possible violence are ginned up by what he calls left-wing groups and the liberal media.
Abortion rights supporters were predominant in the 50 to 75 people gathered outside the clinic Friday morning.
He said he abhorred the killing of Tiller.
He said he was confident his organization would have shut down Tiller this summer through a legal battle.
Carhart has vowed to open an office in Kansas and said he'll keep doing abortions as long as he's healthy.
Carhart was performing an abortion in his clinic when Tiller was killed that Sunday morning.
The outside of his office has the name of his clinic in bold letters: Abortion & Contraception Clinic of Nebraska.
"I do abortions, and that is what I do," he said.
Gietzen's message to Carhart: "Please respect the life of the babies.
"When they're ready to accept our position, then we'll sit down.
