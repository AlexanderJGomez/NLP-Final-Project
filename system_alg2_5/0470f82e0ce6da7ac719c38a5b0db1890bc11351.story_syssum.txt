Why?
The shooter, apparently picking the victim at random, shot the San Francisco State University student in the back.
"Some are no more than two to three feet to him," said San Francisco District Attorney George Gascon "We're seeing people that are so disconnected to their surroundings.
I think I would," Gascon said.
You may remember the woman who was so absorbed with texting that she fell right into a mall fountain.
This is different, especially for San Francisco State University students.
