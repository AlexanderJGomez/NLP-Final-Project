(CNN)Talk show host Dr. Mehmet Oz is defending himself against a group of doctors who accuse him of "manifesting an egregious lack of integrity" in his TV and promotional work and who call his faculty position at Columbia University unacceptable.
It all started when a group of 10 physicians from across the country emailed a letter to Columbia University expressing disapproval that Oz is on the faculty.
The email was sent by Dr. Henry Miller, a fellow in scientific philosophy and public policy at Stanford University's Hoover Institute.
The FDA disputed the findings and said the report was misleading and irresponsible.
Miller and the other doctors who signed the email echo that sentiment, saying Oz is misleading the public and they tell Columbia's Goldman that having him on the faculty is unacceptable.
Orlando, Florida, anesthesiologist Dr. Shelley Fleet told CNN when she received an email from Miller inviting her to sign the email to Columbia, she said of course.
He and Fleet share McCaskill's example of Oz's promotion of "miracle weight loss drugs" on the show as failure on Oz's part to follow the oath taken by doctors to do no harm.
For its part, Columbia University is standing by Oz.
Oz rose to fame after frequent appearances on "The Oprah Winfrey Show" led to the creation of his own show and magazine.
