(CNN) -- Bruce Levenson couldn't cut it as a successful NBA owner.
So if you are going to invest in the Atlanta Hawks of the NBA, a league that boasts the highest share of black television viewers, at 45% -- three times higher than the NFL or NCAA basketball -- and a player roster that is nearly 80% black, well, then you better have a smart business strategy to keep your core customers happy and attract corporate dollars at the same time.
The "self-reporting" bigot seems to have awakened one day, looked around the City of Atlanta (which according to the 2010 census is 54% African-American and 38.4% white) and decided that all of his business failures in Atlanta had nothing to do with his own mismanagement of the team.
By focusing on race, I also sent the unintentional and hurtful message that our white fans are more valuable than our black fans."
And when Levenson and his partners realized that the arena was half-empty, the first questions Levenson should have asked are: Will sports fans pay money to watch this team play?
Successful teams across sports in cities like New York, Washington and Los Angeles are using this same multicultural business strategy to run winning franchises.
And there's no arguing that he was right.
This year, he took his NBA team the Holocaust museum in Washington.
But in real life, it takes courage, humility and commitment to live by it.
I say good riddance to Levenson and other NBA owners like him, of which I think there are few.
And more important, they are shrewd businessmen who understand that in today's global economy, a company that doesn't not have the cultural intelligence to build a diverse customer base will fail.
And today, as America's face shifts from white to shades of brown, it remains to be seen whether we will ever stop stumbling over that line, fearing the line, hating that line, so we can finally stand together as one strong nation.
