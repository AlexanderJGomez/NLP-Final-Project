(CNN) -- Wednesday night's debate showcased a Mitt Romney resisting his worst debating weaknesses and playing solidly to his strengths.
Wednesday night?
He was strong in all areas Wednesday night.
Romney talked over him so often that I swear one time I saw Lehrer slumping behind his desk while he meekly gazed up at Romney and muttered, "Excuse me, I believe you have my stapler."
But not Wednesday night.
Romney put Obama on the defensive and kept him there all night defending his policies.
As for Obama, one strength is that he is solid at picking a theme and sticking with it.
What was it?
The problem was that Obama needed to couple that theme with something else.
Which brings us to Obama's weaknesses: I wrote two days ago that his detachment was one weakness, that he can appear dispassionate and distancing to the audience.
For Obama, with a troubled economy, it works against the president.
Obama needs to find a much more effective way to pin Romney down to a specific policy.
If he doesn't, Romney will be like Teflon, and nothing Obama says will stick to him in these debates.
Since Romney will continue to put him on the defensive (and this is guaranteed), Obama must turn potential flaws into strengths.
He needs to keep debating precisely like Wednesday night.
If he decides that his bullying technique of the moderator was effective (it worked Wednesday night, but I wouldn't push my luck if I were him), then he risks alienating voters.
Romney can lose more votes than he can gain in future debates if he comes across as rude or mean, an impression many had of McCain four years ago.
