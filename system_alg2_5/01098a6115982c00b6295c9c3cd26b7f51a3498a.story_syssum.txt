A police officer said  "one family member made a noose of rough cloth around her neck while her brothers smashed bricks into her skull."
The #Farzana hashtag comes on the public heels of another long-known and rarely noted issue that caught fire in the public's imagination and provoked a storm of well-deserved outrage: the kidnapping of schoolgirls in northern Nigeria by the militant group Boko Haram.
The misogyny in the killer's more than 100-page diatribe led women to begin using the #Yesallwomen hashtag to push forward a conversation on Twitter and Facebook and Tumbler about the rarely discussed though frequently experienced issues of violence against women, from sexual assault to harassment to domestic brutality.
Or will online outrage lead to real world change?
The hashtag activism and social media outrage is an important start to addressing issues to which the world for so long had remained indifferent.
