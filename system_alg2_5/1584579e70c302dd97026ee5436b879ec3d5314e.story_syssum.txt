When the 32-year-old New York Knicks lifer first drummed up the plan to follow his beloved NBA team at every stop -- including London -- for an entire season, he had no idea it would be a historic one.
Doyle arrived in London (via Iceland) on Saturday to watch the Knicks as part of the NBA's Global Games initiative.
For Doyle, however, supporting the Knicks is practically out of his hands.
"I ended up choosing the team most like the Knicks," Doyle explains.
"It's a tough season, so we really appreciate his effort of trying to see all of our games," says Pablo Prigioni, the Knicks Argentinian point guard and Doyle's favorite current player.
After talking it over with his sister Kelly, a life coach in Charlotte, North Carolina, Doyle paid $3,500 for a season's worth of middle-tier corner seats at Madison Square Garden and began plotting his six month odyssey.
"But a lot of people in my position will travel the world.
he says.
"At a certain point, it's like watching a small animal get tortured and there's no reason to continue to subject myself to that kind of pain," he says.
Nevertheless, Doyle admits that he'll be relieved once the season is over, and doubts he'll renew his season ticket even though he thinks the Knicks can become a playoff team next season.
"I miss watching it on TV," he says.
