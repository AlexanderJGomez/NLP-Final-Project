A safe distance from Nairobi's Westgate Mall, several Kenyans stare through a stand of trees at the site of one of the nation's worst terrorist attacks.
It will take a long time to return to any sense of safety or normalcy.
On the day of the attack, my cousin, Charles Mugo, and his two daughters, ages 6 and 3, found themselves with about 40 other shoppers in the mall parking garage.
When the gunmen demanded to know if they were Muslim, Mugo hesitated just long enough for the attackers to turn their attention to a man nearby.
"Girls, did you pray today?"
"Westgate bad, blood," the younger daughter told me later.
Kenyans and foreigners died in attacks scattered across the complex.
The Nairobi attack targeted non-Muslims at a stylish mall.
This is -- this was well-planned and well-thought out."
At the time, all I kept thinking was I just couldn't let these girls die."
Kamau, the taxi driver, shakes his head.
