"It's a time when Israel is really joining the family of modern nations, and Playboy is just part of modern global culture," says Dan Pomerantz, who emigrated from his native Chicago to Israel 15 months ago.
Albin admits that she wanted a marketing gimmick that would cause a stir, but maintains that the magazine was introduced for more than just shock value, standing for a more liberal, secular society.
Some observers believe that reading the Hebrew edition of Playboy could still be seen as political statement.
Unless the articles are holding their own merit, I don't see the interest," she said , noting that the Hebrew edition's Facebook page has only around 5,800 "likes."
"We don't see ourselves as a magazine company," says Pomerantz.
For all the potential pitfalls of print publishing and dealing with controversial content, Pomerantz remains bullish about the magazine's ability to push a few boundaries.
We've seen so far a real interest that we want to encourage."
