No one should believe, however, that simply replacing the secretary with a new person will solve the Veterans Administration's problems.
Deming had a bin full of mixed red and white beads.
Trying to fix the VA by replacing the secretary but not the whole system is like trying to obtain white beads by replacing the person dipping blindly into the bin.
There is no bank teller involved.
More than 314,000 work full time for the VA compared to 202,000 in the Marine Corps (potentially shrinking to 150,000--at which point there would be half as many Marines as VA bureaucrats).
Just the size of the VA training system is enormous.
At VA facilities, veterans wait twice that time on average and that understates the problem in especially mismanaged sites.
This means that one out of four veterans in those sites was experiencing a wait more than 12 times longer than the national average.
Every effort to integrate Department of Defense and VA medical record systems has failed.
The DoD and VA spent $1.3 billion to build a joint electronic medical record system for their health care services before the two secretaries announced in February that they were abandoning the effort.
They did such a bad job that fewer than 50,000 veterans were getting help out of more than 200,000 wounded veterans from World War I. Forbes stole hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayer money
As the scandal broke, President Harding summoned Forbes to the White House and "took him by the neck and shook Forbes 'as a dog would a rat,'" as Amity Shlaes writes in her book "Coolidge," ending the tenure of the first director of the modern Veterans Administration.
