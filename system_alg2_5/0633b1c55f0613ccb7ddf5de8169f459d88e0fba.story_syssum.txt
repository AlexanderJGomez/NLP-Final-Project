-- Senator Chuck Hagel, 2006
Their people are like the American people -- free, independent, capitalistic and tolerant.
The danger in what Hagel said is if he thinks Israel is supported on Capitol Hill because of intimidation, then it's not hard to see why Hagel is so soft in his support for our ally.
In 2000, Hagel was one of only four senators who refused to sign a Senate letter in support of Israel.
But if Chuck Hagel believes that it's intimidation and not sound judgment that has caused his colleagues to support Israel, then Chuck Hagel should not be confirmed as our next secretary of defense.
