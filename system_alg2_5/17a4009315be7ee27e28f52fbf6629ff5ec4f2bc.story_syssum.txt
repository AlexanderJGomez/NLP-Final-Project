(CNN)Shortly after the 10th anniversary of the Iraq War, paralyzed veteran Tomas Young spoke with me about why he intended to end his life.
He said he seldom left his bed and that he popped a dizzying assortment of more than 30 different pills every day.
He said he wanted to spend more time with his wife, Claudia Cuellar.
Former television host Phil Donahue, co-director and executive producer of "Body of War," said Wednesday that Tomas and Claudia made a remarkable love story.
Donahue said he had been waiting almost 10 years to hear what he heard on the phone Monday.
When we spoke last year, he asked me about my experiences covering the war in Iraq.
And she did.
Young returned home from war a broken man.
