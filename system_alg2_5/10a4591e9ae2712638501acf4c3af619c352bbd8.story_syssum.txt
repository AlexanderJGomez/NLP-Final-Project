The arrest was made by police from Lakeland, Florida, the Polk County Sheriff's Office and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, who were accompanied by FBI agents, he said.
The FBI said Holt worked for Wiles at the time he disappeared.
Authorities say he now works as a contract employee doing similar flight maintenance work at Patrick Air Force base near Cape Canaveral in Florida.
Without disclosing details, agents said the investigation led them back to Holt and his whereabouts the day Wiles disappeared.
We just want Robert back.
The FBI will not reveal what makes agents believe Wiles is dead.
