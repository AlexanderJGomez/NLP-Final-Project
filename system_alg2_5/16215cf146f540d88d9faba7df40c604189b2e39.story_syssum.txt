San Antonio, Texas (CNN) -- The case of the New Mexico hotelier who required Latino employees to adopt English names and avoid speaking Spanish at work reminds us of the need for balance as we grapple with cultural evolution in America.
I didn't speak English yet, having been home with my mom up until that first day of kindergarten.
My journey as an American began.
And that was that.
I didn't mind "Rudy" but I didn't like "Ruiz" pronounced in English.
Balance.
To the north loomed my future, which I was learning and absorbing at school and in the media.
And all along, as I introduced myself, I started my name in English and switched gears into Spanish for the second half.
And the alliteration of "Rudy Ruiz" provided a challenge in that the "r" in Rudy flows smoothly in English, while the "r" in Ruiz rolls like a locomotive thundering over the old railway bridge that spans the Rio Grande in Brownsville, often backing up traffic for miles.
Four letters in Spanish.
Balance.
The key to attaining the right balance is empathy.
Just like my name.
