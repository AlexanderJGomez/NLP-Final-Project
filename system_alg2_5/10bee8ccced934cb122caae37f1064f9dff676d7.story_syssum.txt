Court documents filed by Grammer -- a former "Real Housewife of Beverly Hills" cast member -- describe in dramatic detail an early morning fight with Charalambopoulos in a Houston, Texas, hotel where she was recovering from surgery two weeks ago.
The argument began at 1:30 a.m. on October 16 when she was awakened by the vibration of Charalambopoulos' cell phone "with incoming text messages and phone calls from another woman," Grammer said.
In so doing, Mr. Charalambopoulos succeeded in pulling out swaths of my hair and gave me a large, painful contusion on the side of my head."
"He told me I was going to hell, and then, to make his escape, he said he would 'knock (me) out' if I moved from the bed while he left the hotel," Grammer said.
Three minutes after he walked out, Grammer "hobbled down" four flights of stairs to the hotel lobby where an employee called police, she said.
