In a controversy that echoes the ordeal of South African runner Caster Semenya, the 27-year-old is facing accusations about her gender.
Park took to social media to give her side of the story.
In a statement released to CNN, the sports council said the actions of the rival clubs were an infringement on her human rights and it demanded an official apology.
The mayor of the capital Seoul, Park Won-soon, tweeted: "As the father of a daughter, I will do my best to protect Park Eun-seon's human rights," local media reported.
