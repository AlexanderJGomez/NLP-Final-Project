London, England (CNN) -- China will execute within a few hours a British man convicted of smuggling heroin, his family said Monday.
But Khan and Shaikh said they are nevertheless "hoping the Chinese government will show some compassion."
"Both Chinese and international law clearly indicate that a person who committed a crime while suffering from significant mental illness should not be subjected to the death penalty," Alston said in a statement released by Reprieve, a British legal group.
China says it has followed the law.
His final appeal -- to the People's Supreme Court -- was rejected a week ago.
A spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told CNN in October there was no evidence of mental illness.
Shaikh said he was given a suitcase to carry by another man who had duped him into believing he was traveling to China to become a nightclub performer, and was unaware that the bag contained drugs.
Schaapveld traveled to Urumqi this year for Shaikh's appeal hearing but was unable to meet Shaikh or attend the appeal.
