Hong Kong (CNN) -- Eight Chinese officials have been fired or suspended after five boys died in a rubbish bin after suffocating on fumes from charcoal they burned to stay warm, according to state-run media.
One user on Sina Weibo, China's version of Twitter, wrote: "China is supposedly an intermediate developed country but still can't protect its own children.

Persistent truants, the boys were said to have been missing for three weeks before they were found dead.
Rutstein says the presence of street children is obvious in some cities, but it's safe to assume that many remain in rural towns, the byproduct of a huge demographic shift in China, as parents move to booming cities for work.
It's estimated there are 55 million "left behind" children in China, the sons and daughters of 200 million migrant workers who have moved to the cities for a better life.
Once sent back, the children would be placed in government-run shelters, according to Xinhua.
China's aware of this and there are many efforts in place right now to professionalize the whole system of social workers, to introduce alternatives to institutionalization, or just sending children to a state orphanage, which traditionally has been the main response to these kinds of situations," he said.
Referring to Beijing's decision to turn on the city's heating system two weeks early this year due to colder temperatures, one of China's most popular fairy tale writers, Zheng Yuanjie, posted: "Beijing spent 800 million [yuan] to start the heating system 15 days ahead of time, but you're out of the reach.
The boys were Tao Zhongjing, 12; Tao Zhonghong, 11; Tao Zhonglin, 13; Tao Chong, 12; and Tao Bo, 9.
