Suze Orman says it's a good thing the federal government bailed out troubled national insurer AIG.
Larry King: A few months ago, you said on this very show that you would be worried if there was another big government bailout.
AIG is an international giant that just doesn't have ramifications here in the United States.

The major danger that we had here, which is why you saw the stock markets go up today, is that rumors were circulating that AIG was going to be saved.
Why were they lending money to people who shouldn't have been borrowing money?
Orman: No.
It's not a good time to get in with brand-new money.
Are gas prices going to go down?
Gas prices probably will go down, I hope, to essentially $3 a gallon.
Your gas bills, in terms of what you put in your cars, aren't going to be as high.
Orman: I personally think it was bad.
You would think that they couldn't, but when you see dinosaurs -- Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, AIG -- going down the drain, anything can happen.
