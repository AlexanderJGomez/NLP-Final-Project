In Miami, basketball star Dwyane Wade tied the knot with actress Gabrielle Union on Saturday, the same weekend that Ashlee Simpson -- the musical younger sister of Jessica Simpson -- reportedly wed Diana Ross' actor son Evan in Connecticut, and Donnie Wahlberg said "I do" to Jenny McCarthy.
Union, 41, wore a strapless Dennis Basso gown that she helped design.
So happy," the actress posted on Instagram with a photo of her wedding day look.
Closing out the love-filled holiday weekend was New Kids on the Block star Wahlberg and former "The View" personality McCarthy, who swapped vows in Chicago.
It was on the ABC talk show that McCarthy, 41, announced her engagement to Wahlberg, 45, in April.
