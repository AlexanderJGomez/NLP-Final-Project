Like a football or basketball game, a host can't "win" "SNL" with a great opening monologue, but he or she sure can screw it up.
For the second straight year, EW.com readers have voted to determine who was "SNL's" best host.
Throughout the show's season, the most recent host was pitted against the four most popular previous hosts in a vote, and the one with the least number of voters was eliminated while the four survivors advanced to the next week.
Live comedy is a gauntlet that can expose and undermine the proudest of entertainers.
It helps, of course, if you think CK is a comic genius, but even if you're not tuned in to his brand of comedy, his first time hosting had a refreshingly off-beat vibe.
CK lasted a few weeks in our voting contest before being eliminated by Jeremy Renner, but if he hosts again next year he's a total must-watch, especially with one show under his belt.
He did everything every host tries to do â€” he just did all of them well.
With those out of the way, he should be even freer and more unpredictable the next time he visits.
Was it half-scripted?
But if you were obsessed with the show, like the nearly 6 million people who watched the season two finale, Hathaway's impression of jazz-freakout Carrie was one of the most perceptive caricatures "SNL" has ever showcased.
Can we hope "Homeland" is in the middle of a season again the next time Hathaway gets the call?
Of course, the person I'm already looking forward to hosting next season was a cast member just five days ago.
Thanks again for voting throughout the year, and congratulations to Justin Timberlake, Mr. Saturday Night 2013.
