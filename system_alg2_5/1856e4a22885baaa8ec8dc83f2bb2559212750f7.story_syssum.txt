According to iSight, the hackers create fake accounts on social networks masquerading as journalists, government officials and defense contractor employees.
But among the more than 2,000 people with whom the hackers made connections are a four-star U.S. admiral, British and Saudi officials, journalists and lawmakers.
"The actors have intimated their interest in specific defense technology as well as military and diplomatic information by their targeting," iSight said.
"What we can say is -- based on who was targeted, the types of information they were going after, the infrastructure that was used and where it's registered in Tehran and a number of other indicators -- that we believe there are links to Iranian actors here," Jones said.
The State Department says it has been aware in the past of hackers from Iran using social media websites to investigate targets, including U.S. officials.
