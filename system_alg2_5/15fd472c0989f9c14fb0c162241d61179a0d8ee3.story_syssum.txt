The woman traveled from Oklahoma to Louisiana for the ceremony and was taken to a campsite near Sun, Louisiana, about 60 miles north of New Orleans.
The suspects, most of whom were still in the woods near the campsite several miles from where the body was found, were taken into custody without incident, he said.
Bonnett said he has not seen any Klan activity in the area in three years he has worked there.
