They matched any gene variations they found in the DNA with study participants' individual symptoms.
Past studies done on twins and families have shown that about 80% of the risk for schizophrenia is inherited, the study authors say.
A study published in July showed as many as 108 genes may be tied to the mental health disorder.
The idea that schizophrenia is not one single disorder is not really new, says Dr. Charles Raison, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Arizona.
"Schizophrenia is probably 80 different diseases," Raison says.
Several things can cause pleurisy, including a viral infection, pneumonia or cancer.
The same could hold true for schizophrenia and other mental health conditions, Raison says.
