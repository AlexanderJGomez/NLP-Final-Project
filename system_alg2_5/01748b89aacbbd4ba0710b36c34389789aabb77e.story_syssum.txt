(CNN) -- Twenty-five people were discharged from hospital Friday, state media reported, a week after a meteor exploded in spectacular fashion in the skies above Russia's Urals region, shattering glass in thousands of buildings.
The Chelyabinsk region, the hardest-hit area, asked federal authorities Monday for $16.6 million in aid, RIA Novosti said.
The national space agency, Roscosmos, said scientists believe one meteoroid entered the atmosphere, where it burned and disintegrated into fragments.
The space agency put the amount of energy released in the meteor's explosion at nearly 500 kilotons.
Kuznetsov said he experienced what felt like "a push," as a sound wave passed through his body.
"For some seconds I simply stood," he said, amid the sound of breaking glass.
"This was perhaps the single greatest contributor to the blast damage."
