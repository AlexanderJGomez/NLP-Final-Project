(CNN) -- Any minute, the Duchess of Cambridge will birth a new heir to the British throne.
Will you be the first to know?
This will be the first chance for the nation and those watching around the world to find out whether the new baby is a boy or a girl.
Besides being adorable, the girl could one day have a fantastic career.
Rules dating back centuries decreed that the crown passed to the eldest son and was only bestowed on a daughter when there were no sons.
And Margaret Rhodes, a cousin and lifelong friend of the queen, said Elizabeth's parents -- King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, later known as the Queen Mother -- tried to keep their daughter's childhood "sacrosanct."
This baby might win the day all around because its mother is the first commoner to marry into the royal family since the 17th century.
