(CNN) -- The family of long-missing former FBI agent Robert Levinson has renewed its request for a meeting with the bureau's new director following reports Levinson had been working for the CIA when he vanished, the family's lawyer said Monday.
His family had also said he wasn't working for the government.
McGee said records he found show "without a shadow of a doubt" that Levinson was a CIA contract employee on a rogue assignment in Iran for the agency when he disappeared.
When the Levinson family first went to the Senate Intelligence Committee for help, staffers contacted the CIA and at that point, the CIA told them "they have no connection with him at all," McGee said.
Confronted with the evidence, the CIA then demurred, said it would get back in touch and later admitted the relationship with Levinson, he said.
Ultimately, seven CIA staffers were disciplined and three were fired, McGee said -- including Levinson's chief handler.
