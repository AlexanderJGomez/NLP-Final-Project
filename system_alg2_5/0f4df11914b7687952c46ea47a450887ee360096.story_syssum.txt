Nearly two out of three of the world's Muslims are in Asia, stretching from Turkey to Indonesia.
There are about 1.57 billion Muslims in the world, according to the report, "Mapping the Global Muslim Population," by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life.
"Overall, the number is higher than I expected," he said, noting that earlier estimates of the global Muslim population have ranged from 1 billion to 1.8 billion.
The team at the Pew Forum spent nearly three years analyzing "the best available data" from 232 countries and territories, Grim said.
One in five of the world's Muslims lives in a country where Muslims are a minority.
The Pew researchers concluded that Nigeria is just over half Muslim, making it the sixth most populous Muslim country in the world.
"Only one or two censuses in the world ... have ever asked the sectarian question," said Grim.
"We don't care only about Muslims," Grim said.
They're also digging into what people believe and practice, since the current analysis doesn't analyze that.
