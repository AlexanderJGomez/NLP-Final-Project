It's anyone's guess, he said, what price the home might bring now, if it ever sold.
"So there is going to be all kinds of government programs to help, but if they don't qualify for standard mortgage financing, there's no one to buy these properties."

"They will eventually sell.
"There are some cases where the properties have been so damaged that it's not profitable for the mortgage investor, which is a bank, to take title to the property," he said.
A spokesman for the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington told CNN that unsalable homes are still a relatively small part of the national inventory of foreclosed properties.
