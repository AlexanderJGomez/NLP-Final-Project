New York (CNN) -- A New York district attorney recommended Monday that charges be dropped against former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who was accused more than three months ago of sexually assaulting a hotel housekeeper.
There was "no trauma to her body or oral cavity" and "scrapings from underneath her fingernails ... yielded no results."
"Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance has denied the right of a woman to get justice in a rape case," Thompson said.
Thompson had said before the meeting Monday that he believed Vance was going to drop the charges.
Diallo, who has conducted high-profile interviews about the case, and her attorneys have said Strauss-Kahn attacked her, and that her case should go to trial.
"What does it take for a low-income immigrant -- a woman of color -- to publicly name one of the most powerful men in Europe as a sexual abuser?"
That prompted the alleged victim's motion filed Monday, which cites allegations of "abuse of confidence, unfair treatment and bias and prejudices" by Vance that, Diallo's attorneys claim, should disqualify him from the case.
"This is not a 'he said, she said' case," Thompson said Sunday.
"This is a case that looks like it has nothing but losers -- the alleged victim, the defendant, and the prosecutor," Toobin said.
"The conclusion is likely to be entirely satisfying to no one."
