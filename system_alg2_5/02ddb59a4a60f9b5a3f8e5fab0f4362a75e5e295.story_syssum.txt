(CNN) -- An eastern Pennsylvania police chief who went on profanity-laced video rants against those who disagreed with him on gun laws has been suspended for 30 days without pay.
"I am a big supporter of the Constitution."
Kessler did not respond to repeated requests by CNN for comment, but he told WFMZ at the time that he was not in uniform in the videos and was exercising in his First and Second Amendment rights.
Kessler has been the town's police chief for 14 years "without a mark against him," Hennon said.
On the CSF Web page, Kessler is identified as the group's president and is featured in his Gilberton police uniform.
