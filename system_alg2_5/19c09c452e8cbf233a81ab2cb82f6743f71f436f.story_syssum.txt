A little something.
What was it?
He'd tried to go, walking back to his car in the dark twice now, but the nagging in his brain wouldn't let him leave until she was absolutely perfect.
She just wouldn't shut up.
It was the only thing about her he could stomach.
What was it?
It was maddening...he couldn't bring himself to leave until everything was just right...perfect, in fact.
It was his favorite brand --it was actually the only twine he would ever consider using -- just shipped in from France.
The wrist?
No.
No.
As he stood there at the foot of her body, staring into her face, her own eyes stared away from him and straight up into the sky, her lips still slightly parted just as they had been in life...just as they had been at the zenith, that incredibly beautiful and intimate moment when she exhaled her last breath into the night.
He squatted down and gently picked up her left hand.
He placed the hand back gently across her stomach.
