Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- His compound in Tripoli has been overrun, rebels control the closest international airport and world leaders including President Barack Obama are declaring his 42-year rule over.
Professor Abubaker Saad, a former Gadhafi aide, on Tuesday described to CNN a system of bunkers under the Gadhafi compound in Tripoli that could serve as a hideout.
There has been speculation that tunnels might lead from Gadhafi's now-overrun bunker to the Rixos hotel, where about 35 journalists are being held against their will by low-ranking Gadhafi loyalists.
The United States wants Gadhafi to issue "a reliable, affirmative statement" to the international community and his loyalists still fighting in Tripoli "that he understands ... his leadership is over, so everyone can move on," Nuland said.
A U.S. official, speaking on condition of not being identified, said Gadhafi is most likely still in Tripoli.
Countries considered possible exile homes for Gadhafi include Venezuela, a rumored destination for months.
On Tuesday, Chavez said his country would only recognize a Libyan government led by Gadhafi, state media reported.
However, Gadhafi's relationship with Saudi Arabia has cooled since the Saudis accused Libyans of trying to kill their king several years ago, and it would be unlikely for the desert kingdom to accept an exiled Gadhafi now, according to Christopher Boucek, a Saudi Arabia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
