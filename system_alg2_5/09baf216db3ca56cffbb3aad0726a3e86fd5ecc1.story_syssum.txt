Boston (CNN)After weeks of dramatic testimony, jurors are set to begin deliberations Tuesday in the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who faces life in prison or  the death penalty for working with his brother to explode bombs at the 2013 Boston Marathon.
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev "chose a day when the eyes of the world would be on Boston," Chakravarty said.
The prosecutor showed a picture of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan in the marathon crowd.
If Tsarnaev is found guilty of at least one of the 17 capital counts, the trial will proceed to a second phase, the so-called penalty phase.
"He was there," defense attorney Judy Clarke conceded as the trial opened, but the defense strategy always had been to focus on persuading the jury to spare Tsarnaev's life.
"These children weren't innocent to him," the prosecutor said.
But luck had nothing to do with the Boston bombings, the prosecutor said.
"
The older brother, a 26-year-old former Golden Gloves boxer, had hoped to wage jihad and his slacker younger brother was just along for the ride, the defense has said.
"Tamerlan Tsarnaev didn't turn his brother into a murderer.
The final moments of the three Boston Marathon spectators who died were recounted by the people who were by their sides.
That bomb, which exploded near Marathon Sports, claimed the life of Krystle Campbell, a 29-yeaer-old restaurant manager.
Lu "received blast injuries all over her body.
He identified that person as Tamerlan Tsarnaev.
"Tamerlan wanted suicide by cop," the prosecutor said Monday.
We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all."
And they traced the purchase of the pressure cookers, ammunition and BBs, which appeared to have been made by Tamerlan.
