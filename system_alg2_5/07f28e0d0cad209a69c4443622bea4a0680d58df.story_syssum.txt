Wayne LaPierre says the Mexican drug war isn't a reason to restrict gun ownership in the U.S.
Barely a month on the job, Holder cited the Mexican cartel killings as the excuse to resurrect the Clinton gun ban.
But that's precisely how the 1994 gun ban came about.
They fooled the American people and the U.S. Congress into thinking they were banning "high-powered," "rapid-fire," "battlefield-bred" guns designed to "spray fire from the hip."
But the guns aren't designed or used by the military.
As the study mandated by that Congress found, "The banned weapons and magazines were never used in more than a modest fraction of all gun murders" in the first place.
Nobody can substantiate claims that U.S. guns cross the border "by the thousands" or "account for 95% of weapons used by Mexican drug gangs."
That's how gun abolitionists claim Mexican gun laws are so strict that our "weak laws" (read: freedoms) are to blame for "fueling the violence" in Mexico.
At issue is not the absence of law, but the absence of political will to enforce the laws that both nations already possess.
And use existing gun and drug laws against violent drug syndicates here and in Mexico.
But leave American freedoms alone.
