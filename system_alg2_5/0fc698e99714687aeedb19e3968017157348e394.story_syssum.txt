Results of an unofficial quick count on Wednesday indicated a slight edge for Widodo, a former furniture exporter who rose to become Jakarta governor, ahead of Prabowo, a former military man.
"It's not a victory for the party, not a victory for the team but this is a victory for all Indonesian people," Widodo told his supporters, dressed in his trademark checkered shirt.
Prabowo, a former son-in-law of Indonesian president Suharto, has sought to project an image as a take-charge leader.
"We will be patient, be polite," he told supporters.
The next president will be inaugurated on October 20.
