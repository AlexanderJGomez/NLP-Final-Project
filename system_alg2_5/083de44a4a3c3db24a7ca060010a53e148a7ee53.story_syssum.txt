Mom2Mom is the only helpline in the United States focused on mothers of special-needs children.
Cherie Castellano, who launched Mom2Mom in 2010, has started a number of initiatives based on the idea of "reciprocal peer support": that people with similar experiences can help each other.
Dads are welcome to call the Mom2Mom line too, Castellano said.
Most of the time, the caller agrees to engage in ongoing peer support, Castellano said.
The program has gotten calls from more than 20 states where moms struggle to find support as they care for special-needs children.
Many mothers of special needs children want to appear as "supermoms," being able to balance all of their appointments and challenges and emotions, Castellano said.
The youngest two of Lee's four children are on the autism spectrum: a 27-year-old son and a 20-year-old daughter.
"You meet a lot of people that you can talk to," she said.
At least you can talk to people who can understand what you're going through.
