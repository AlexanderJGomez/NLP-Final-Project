Savage and her neighbors say they had no clue that Thurmond, 36, had a wife, let alone four kids; they were also oblivious that Thurmond may have held the five hostage in the three-bedroom mobile home for three years.
Thurmond kindly told Savage he hadn't seen anything suspicious.
Alma Medina, the property manager for the 100-unit Beaver Creek mobile home park, lives three doors from what is now a crime scene.
"I never saw them outside, never," she said.
Lt. Missy Collins, the investigator who had Thurmond arrested Tuesday after a two-week investigation, said her husband used to work with Thurmond at a pump-manufacturing facility in nearby Toccoa.
"You never saw anybody with him," the chief said.
Collins said police are not sure if padlocks were the only way Thurmond imprisoned his family.
Watch Collins explain how Thurmond instilled fear Â»
Collins said she is not certain exactly what emboldened the family to flee the filthy trailer, but the mother told police that Thurmond had said he was leaving her for another woman.
Only one, the 14-year-old, had ever attended school, and though the mother said the other children were home-schooled, the children told Collins that Thurmond wouldn't buy them school supplies.
On August 6, after Thurmond hadn't responded to a notice on his door threatening eviction, Medina sent her maintenance man to the mobile home.
The kitchen floor was rotted.
Collins said she went behind an adjacent mobile home and vomited when she and another officer first opened the door.
Medina said she has to gut the entire trailer and replace the floor, walls and ceiling before she can rent it again.
" Collins said.
"He didn't even ask until he was behind bars."
