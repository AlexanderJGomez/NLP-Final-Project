(MMN.com) -- Lulu and I have had our share of training issues, from mastering the down command to heeling during walks.
"Come is the command people practice the least," says Wilson, founder of an online training forum called My Smart Puppy.
Use the "come" command before each meal, and make sure dogs sit before digging into that bowl of kibble.

"As we run backward, the dog follows," he says.
"Stop asking your dog 30 times to come," he says.

"If you can't walk the dog easily and safely, don't ask the child to do it," she says.

He also says owners should let dogs be dogs.

"A dog needs to run, too.
Upshur tells owners to walk with confidence and move away from distractions such as stray dogs or children playing.
"The dog needs to know that the owner is not going to let anything happen," he says.
