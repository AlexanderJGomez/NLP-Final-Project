The former heavyweight world champion has teamed up with colorful Canadian businessman and philanthropist Yank Barry to help Syrian refugees in Bulgaria.
As soon as we arrived, Holyfield and Barry were surrounded by hundreds of refugees angry at camp conditions in Bulgaria.
In midst of the chaos, Barry said to Holyfield: "We can't blame them for being angry.
We are a private foundation."
"I wouldn't refuse food if I was hungry.
Barry offered to place them in a converted hotel with other Syrian refugees for up to a year.
When asked why he would have more success than others in reaching out to Assad, Barry said: "I know he loves Louie Louie.
It's my song.
It's dark by the time we reach our next destination -- the hotel that Barry is using to rehouse refugees.
When I ask Holyfield why this mission is important to him, he says: "Because at some point in time, when you leave this earth, they won't be asking about how many championships I won.
Barry says he is already looking for another hotel to house more refugees.
If the group travels only to Bulgaria, the price they pay to traffickers is much lower.
It's unacceptable that they go on suffering once they reach the EU," U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees AntÃ³nio Guterres said recently during a trip to a refugee camp in Sofia.
Bulgaria is now building a wall along the most thickly-forested section of Bulgaria's border with Turkey, in an attempt to keep people out.
