Paul Embleton's BRAVE Foundation has trained more than 1,000 volunteer firefighters in Guatemala.
[Firefighters] would respond to these calls, grab the patients from the streets and throw them in the back of the pickup truck.
Embleton launched the BRAVE Foundation -- Bomberos Resourceful And Valiant Efforts -- to provide emergency response training and equipment to volunteer firefighters (bomberos) in Guatemala.
"I'd gone back to my hotel to try to think how I was going to teach with the same limited resources they had," Embleton said.
In 1998, with assistance from fellow Washington firefighters and Rotary International, the BRAVE Foundation established a pilot emergency medical training program in Guatemala City, using the U.S. emergency medical technician curriculum translated into Spanish.
In 2007, just a few years shy of retirement, Embleton was granted a leave of absence from his work as a Washington firefighter.

"The firefighters have the motivation, and you get a heart for it because you see how well we have it in the States," Embleton said.
