(CNN) -- If you took a moment during the heat of the presidential race to drop by the Mitt Romney campaign office, you would have been shocked by the number of white people working to get him elected.
In a conference call with donors, Romney attributed his loss to the president playing Santa Claus by showering minorities and young voters with "gifts" -- health care, student loans and those things Americans clearly don't need.
2?
Now it's time for a dose of reality from the black guy to the white guy, Mitt Romney.
But Mitt, you need to check your facts and realize that there were a lot of white people who really didn't like you.
See, if you accept Romney's theory that minorities were a prime reason he lost, then he should have cleaned up in the Electoral College in those really, really, really white states.
This is why Mitt Romney shouldn't have been president.
Bottom line, Mitt: The black guy beat you because he offered a more inclusive message to a cross section of people than you.
You think that minorities and young people are a bunch of victims who just want free stuff, or as you call them, gifts.
