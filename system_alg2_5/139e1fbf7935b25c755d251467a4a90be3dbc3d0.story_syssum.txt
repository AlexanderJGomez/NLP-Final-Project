Last May, a group of heavily armed men, believed to be linked to the Seleka rebel group, entered Dzanga Bai and slaughtered a reported two dozen elephants.
The growth of these groups, with funds from illegal wildlife trafficking, is destabilizing African governments even as it devastates populations of elephants, rhinos and other high value wildlife.
Out of these conversations has emerged a challenge to the worldâ€”from African nations--to stop buying ivory.
Together, we have three straightforward goals: (1) stop the killing; (2) stop the trafficking; and (3) stop the demand.
Once the demand for ivory is curtailed there will be little financial incentive for criminal groups to continue elephant poaching and trafficking.
Before it's too late, let's stop the killing, stop the trafficking and stop the demand.
