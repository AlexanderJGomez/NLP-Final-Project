(CNN) -- Washington and Lee University cited slavery's "regrettable" role in the Virginia school's history and announced that it will remove Confederate battle flags from a chapel that serves as a major meeting place.
The original flags will be placed on rotating display at Lee Chapel Museum in a more "appropriate location" where the stories behind them can be properly told, wrote Ruscio.
He said some students felt uncomfortable with the flags at Lee Chapel.
"It's commendable that the university and the administration took into consideration the feelings of all students," Hernandez Stroud, former president of the Black Law Students Association, told CNN.
In his letter Tuesday, the administrator said the purpose of the historic flags in a campus setting is to educate.
The absence of such explanation allows those who either 'oppose' or 'support' them to assert their own subjective and frequently incorrect interpretations."
