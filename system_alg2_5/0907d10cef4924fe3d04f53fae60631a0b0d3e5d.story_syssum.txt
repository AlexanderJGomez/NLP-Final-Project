Those who support Khalsa's hunger strike say it is long overdue that the cases of those Sikhs be reviewed.
Three of the six convicts whose freedom Khalsa is fighting for were arrested in 1995 for their alleged role in the assassination of Punjab's then-Chief Minister, Beant Singh, in a car bombing.
Phoolka said.
Khalsa is "weak but says he will not end (his hunger strike) until he sees those six prisoners free," his aide said.
In India, state authorities can review a lifer's case after a prisoner serving that sentence has spent 14 years, Bains and lawyer Phoolka said.
"There were serious human rights abuses during the Punjab insurgency," the human rights group said.
Both militants, with their attacks, and the security forces, abusing the now repealed terror law, committed human rights violations, the group said.
Himself a Sikh and the country's first non-Hindu head of government, Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh issued a public apology for the deadly events -- 21 years after their occurrence.
