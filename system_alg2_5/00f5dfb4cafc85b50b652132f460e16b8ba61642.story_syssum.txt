Paris (CNN) -- Investigators trying to determine why an Air France plane crashed mysteriously two years ago have recovered the complete contents of the flight data recorder and the last two hours of cockpit conversation, they announced Monday.
They will not bring more bodies up from the ocean if they cannot identify the two they already have, they said Thursday.
If they can identify the remains, they will consider bringing up other bodies from the wreckage.
The fuselage was discovered in April with bodies still inside, investigators said.
