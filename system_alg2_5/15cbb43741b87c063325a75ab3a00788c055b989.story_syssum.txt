The world finally knows how to address the latest addition to the British royal family: HRH Prince George Alexander Louis of Cambridge.
He was followed by a line of kings with the same name, including George III, who was known for his bouts of insanity.
Authors Mary Anne Evans and Eric Arthur Blair also chose George as their pen names: George Eliot (1819-1880) and George Orwell (1903-1950) respectively.
The name "Alexander" is a feature of the Dutch royal family: Willem-Alexander ascended to the throne after the abdication of his mother Queen Beatrix earlier this year.
