The 131,000 U.S. troops in Iraq still will "maintain full coordination with Iraqi forces inside the cities" and continue to have intelligence capacity, Odierno said.
"I think we're on the right path."
Odierno also said Iran continues to "interfere" in Iraq, including training insurgents and paying surrogates.
