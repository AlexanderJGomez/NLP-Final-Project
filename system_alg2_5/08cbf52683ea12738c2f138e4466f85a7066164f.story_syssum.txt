"The film is a wonderful ambassador, in a way, of South Africa and I think as it travels the world it's going to spread the word about an industry that is young and vibrant and extremely talented," says "Zambezia" director and co-writer Wayne Thornley.
Yet, after joining Zambezia's air force and defending it from a band of marauding lizards, he also discovers the true values of teamwork and community sharing.
The third computer generated 3D film to be made in South Africa, "Zambezia" is  "probably the biggest budget animated film ever to come out of anywhere in Africa," says Thornley  -- Triggerfish was unable to disclose how much the film cost, but said its budget was under $20 million.
Thornley says it all became possible after well-known U.S. producer Mace Neufeld saw the film by chance.
"I want people to sit back and have a fantastic time with the characters and have a fantastic insight into some of the amazing African landscapes that we've put into this film," says Thornley.
