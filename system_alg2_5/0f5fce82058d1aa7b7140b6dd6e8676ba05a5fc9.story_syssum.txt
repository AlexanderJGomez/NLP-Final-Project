Because there is no working government in Somalia and no country is willing to take captured pirates, bring them to trial and detain them, there is no deterrent for pirates to stop attacking ships, Vice Admiral William Gortney said at a Pentagon briefing Thursday.
In the past three months, piracy attacks have averaged about 12 to 14 a month off the east coast of Africa.
Pirates attacked nearly 100 vessels and hijacked as many as 40 in the waters off the coast of Somalia in 2008, according to the International Maritime Bureau.
Additionally, pirates are able to get away with the crimes because of the lack of government and overall lawlessness in the country.
