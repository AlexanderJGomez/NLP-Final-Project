Despite two days of intensive negotiations, Iran and six world powers "remain far apart" on Tehran's controversial nuclear program, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said Saturday in Kazakhstan.
While Ashton said these were the most detailed discussions that the two sides had had, with "a real back-and-forward between us," she also made clear that she was disappointed by the lack of progress made.
"The quality of the discussion was different because there was this back and forth, this Q and A," the official said.
He repeated Tehran's position that Iran has the right to a peaceful nuclear program.
Now, after many proposals put forward by Iran, it's the turn of the six world powers to respond, he said.
"The purpose of any sanctions is to put pressure in order to get this process to work," said Ashton.
Iran's deputy chief negotiator said the Iranian proposal tabled Friday was based on a previous PowerPoint presentation that the Iranian delegation submitted during a round of talks in Moscow in June 2012.
And that pressure only will increase if Iran does not begin to take concrete steps and concrete actions," said a senior U.S. administration official in a telephone briefing to journalists this week.
"It is the right of the Iranian people to peaceful nuclear energy and most importantly to enrichment," Jalili said.
