Scientific tests have shown that four registered chemicals provide a high level of protection from a number of bug bites, according to the EWG report: Picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (and its synthetic derivative known as p-Menthane-3,8-diol, or PMD) and DEET.
Despite DEET's reputation as a harmful substance, the EWG researchers found it to be one of the most effective chemicals against the risks of West Nile virus and Lyme disease.
The virus migrates around the country, so health officials say it's very important to be aware if your area is being affected.
"You need to know the insects that exist where you live and what works best against them," Andrews said.
Although these four chemical repellents are effective, they need to be used correctly, the EWG warns.
Researchers say anything more concentrated isn't necessary unless you are working outside for a long period of time.
The organization recommends covering up with clothing, like long pants and long sleeves, socks and shoes.
