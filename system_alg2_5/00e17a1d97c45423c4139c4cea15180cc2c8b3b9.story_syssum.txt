The sublime scenery of the Shimanami Kaido (Island-Wave-Sea Route) runs from Onomichi in Hiroshima Prefecture down to Imabari in Ehime Prefecture.
As of March, Onomichi is home to Japan's first hotel designed exclusively for cyclists: Hotel Cycle in the Onomichi U2 building, just five minutes' walk from the JR station.
You can park your bike in your room, and there's even a cycle-through restaurant.
You'll see the splendid Senkoji Temple, which dates from 806 AD, one of the oldest temples in Japan.
There are just 10 stools inside, so you may have wait a while.
As you breeze across the routes magnificent bridges (seven of them), a labyrinth of misty islands unfolds below.
As for those bridges, their exquisite state of the art forms make them an attraction in their own right.
Kosanji Temple on Ikuchijima Island is a must-visit.
Bicycles can be rented for 500 yen a day (children 300 yen).
By car, the tolls are about 4,000 yen one way.
