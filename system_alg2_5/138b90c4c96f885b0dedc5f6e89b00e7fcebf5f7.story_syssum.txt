"We are in denial here in Congress," Paul said on the House floor.
What Paul did not do was attend a closed-door gathering of House Republicans.
Ron Paul does that," said Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Alabama, who has served with Paul for years.
He feels very strongly about limited government, about personal responsibility and individual freedoms, and staying consistent has drawn a good, solid base for him in this presidential campaign," Brady said.
"We didn't count on him for anything.
And if you want to vote with him, great, and there's been a lot to be said for it," said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, who says he personally likes Paul very much.
"Ron Paul is less like a Ronald Reagan and more like somebody who is a great professor but you wouldn't want to have him run your company," Issa said.
"I like Ron Paul's independence," Jones told CNN in his office.
Jones thinks Paul has caught fire now because he has been so consistent.
"He's a workhorse, and that's what Washington needs right now is a workhorse, not a show horse," Jones said.
