After celebrity gossip site TMZ released footage of Baldwin shouting profanity at an aggressive videographer (with muffled audio that may or may not have contained a gay slur), Baldwin published a bitter "goodbye to public life" essay in New York Magazine.
In fact, it's staring all of us in the face.
Why not take one with you when you go in public, thus ensuring the public can always see your side of the story?
Does that sound like too much trouble?
Go about your daily life, but have a trusted and well-paid photographer at your side, documenting just how rude, invasive, and aggressive the celebrity chasers can be.
If you want to show the world what really happened with that jerk of a photographer, just upload the footage from your Google Glass.
It may be too late for Baldwin, but not for other celebrities.
Don't disappear from public life just to spite the paparazzi.
