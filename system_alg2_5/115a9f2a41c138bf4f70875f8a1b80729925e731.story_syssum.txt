"The Bourne Supremacy" started with $52.5 million on the way to $176.2 million, and 2007′s "The Bourne Ultimatum" started with $69.3 million en route to a $227.5 million finish.
Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis' election comedy "The Campaign" took second place with $27.4 million.
Political tales "Man of the Year" (2006) and "Swing Vote" (2008, an election year), grossed only $37.3 million and $16.3 million, respectively.
The highest grossing political comedy in recent memory is actually Sacha Baron Cohen's "The Dictator," which was widely perceived as a misfire when it earned $59.7 million against a rumored $100-plus million budget and massive advertising campaign.
Sony paid just $15 million to acquire "Hope Springs" from Mandate, who shelled out $29 million to produce the film, and if it proves as leggy as some of Streep's other films — "Julie and Julia" climbed to $94.1 million after a $20 million weekend, and "It's Complicated" earned $122.7 million after a $22.1 million debut -- it will become a profitable mid-level hit for the studios.
