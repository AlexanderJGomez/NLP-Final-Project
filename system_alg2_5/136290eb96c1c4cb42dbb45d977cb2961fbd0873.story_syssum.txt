EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy told the Republican-led committee that the agency cannot access some e-mails belonging to a biologist who worked on a controversial mining project assessment.
The environmental assessment concluded that the Pebble Mine project could significantly harm the sockeye salmon fishery in Bristol Bay.
McCarthy insisted the agency is trying to recover the biologists' missing e-mails, but also tried to downplay his role in the mine assessment.
Meadows pressed McCarthy on whether the agency broke federal records-keeping law.
"You have not complied with the subpoena," he told McCarthy.
"I hope that over the next few days our folks and your folks can resolve this with all the e-mails," Issa concluded.
