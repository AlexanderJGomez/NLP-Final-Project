(CNN) -- A Jackson, Mississippi, high school basketball coach is accused of whipping students for "failing to run basketball plays correctly," according to a federal lawsuit filed this week by three students.
The students are still attending classes and are playing on the boy's varsity basketball team, Ross said.
The three students were beaten for "no legitimate purpose whatsoever," but Dorsey accused them of "failing to run basketball plays correctly," the suit said.
Dorsey has not commented to CNN, but the lawsuit filing included a statement issued by the coach after the whipping allegations hit the news media.
Principal Freddrick Murray is also named as a defendant.
