(CNN) -- World Cup holders Italy came back from a goal behind to secure an unconvincing 1-1 draw with Paraguay in their opening Group F match.
Perhaps unsurprisingly the opening goal came from a set piece, with Alcaraz jumping above Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro and De Rossi to meet Torres's free-kick with a firm header into the corner.
With the game seemingly drifting away, Italy coach Marcelo Lippi made a crucial change, bringing on Mauro Camoranesi and reverting from a 4-3-3 to a 4-4-2 system.
"We played this game equally against the current world champions," Paraguay coach Gerardo Martini told AFP.
It gives is a lot of confidence going ahead in this tournament."
