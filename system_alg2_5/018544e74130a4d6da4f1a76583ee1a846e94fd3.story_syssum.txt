Pearl Reich, a former Orthodox Jew who identifies herself as a victim's advocate, said the verdict ushers in "a new era for the Jewish religious community."
Joel Engelman, an advocate against sexual abuse among Orthodox Jews who described himself as a survivor of such abuse, said it is rare for respected members of the community to face such allegations in court.
In the past, members of the community have intimidated and pressured those who have accused their leaders of sexual abuse, he said.
Sentencing is set for January 9.
