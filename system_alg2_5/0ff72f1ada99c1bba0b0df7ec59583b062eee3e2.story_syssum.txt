With boundless health information available at the click of a TV remote or computer mouse, patients such as Patti and Cliff have come to rely on these media as they would a doctor's visit.
"There's a lot of useful information that people get from TV," said Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist, assistant professor of medicine at Emory University.
"A lot of my patients do a preliminary search, and get frightened by something they read.
By 1 p.m. the next day, the emergency room doctor told Cliff he was lucky not to have had a heart attack.
"People will hear something and it's like, it's meant," Oz told CNN.
Patients who play an active role in their care, which can include searching symptoms online, have better health outcomes, Bergquist said.
Although Cliff and Patti now readily turn to the Internet and TV, they know it can't replace a relationship with a doctor.
"[Stents are] a scary thing to look up," Patti said.
But if used correctly, the Internet and TV can make you a more educated and empowered patient -- and maybe even save your life.
