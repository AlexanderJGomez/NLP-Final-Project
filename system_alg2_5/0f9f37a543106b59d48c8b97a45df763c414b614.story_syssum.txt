The legendary Formula One team has re-signed Finn Kimi Raikkonen to partner Fernando Alonso in 2014.
Ferrari released Raikkonen in 2009 -- ending his multimillion-dollar contract a year early -- to make way for Alonso as its number one driver alongside Massa.
Alonso, who won back-to-back world titles with Renault in 2005 and 2006, left McLaren after a single season in which he and Hamilton fought over No.
Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo had said earlier this year he did not want "two roosters in the same henhouse" but that view softened at last weekend's Italian Grand Prix.
Raikkonen, who has won two races since returning to F1 with Lotus in 2011, will be determined to fight for victories -- something Massa has struggled to do alongside Alonso.
Ferrari will hope their "fire and ice" combination will bring out the best in each other as it seeks to win its first team title since 2008.
He soon earned his corn, bringing the drivers' title back to Ferrari after seeing off Hamilton by a single point.
Ferrari has now returned to Raikkonen for a quick fix as the Scuderia desperately seeks to rein in the all-conquering Red Bull team.
