(CNN) -- A suicide bomber who carried out an attack in Somalia this weekend was an American citizen of Somali descent, a website associated with the Al-Shabaab Islamist movement claimed Sunday.
In the Somali-language interview that Al-Shabaab released, the speaker says he has been fighting with the group for two years and killed "many infidels" with his own hands.
The FBI identified Beledi as one of two suicide bombers responsible for killing two African Union soldiers in Somalia in May.
Ali was also found guilty of 12 other counts including sending more than $8,000 in 2008 and 2009.
