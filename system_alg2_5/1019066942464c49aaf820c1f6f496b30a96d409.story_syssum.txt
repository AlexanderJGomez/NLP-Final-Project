Dr. Ira Longini studies simulations of hypothetical influenzas and how they would spread.
For the moment, he said, there is not enough information about the swine flu that has sickened hundreds in Mexico and about 50 people in the United States to accurately forecast how the disease will travel.
I am fairly optimistic we can do that," he said.
So far, Longini said, it appears that everyone sickened by swine flu in the United States contracted the disease while traveling in Mexico, the apparent epicenter of the outbreak.
Longini said health officials are doing everything they can to mitigate how widely the swine flu spreads in the United States.
Longini said he hopes that as more data come in about the outbreak, it will help to answer questions researchers have about why the swine flu appears more deadly in the Mexico cases than the ones in the United States.
Even outbreaks such as swine flu tend to follow standard flu season patterns, he said.
"Timing is terrible for people in the Southern Hemisphere -- places like New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, parts of South America, "Longini said.
