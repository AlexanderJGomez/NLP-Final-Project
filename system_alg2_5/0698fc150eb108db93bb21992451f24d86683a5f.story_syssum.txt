Jett Webb killed the massive animal last month in eastern North Carolina.
"They can't believe something that big is running around the woods of eastern North Carolina."
"The meat the pig provided and the memory that hunting provides is worth more than any trophy," he said.
Webb said he used an AR-10 with a .308-caliber round.
It topped out, but Webb said he didn't think the boar weighed much more than 500 pounds.
In North Carolina, wild boar may be hunted year round during normal hunting hours.
