Foreign ministry spokesman Abubakar Al-Sidiq said that he is not aware of any plans to release Mariam Yahya Ibrahim before a ruling from an appeals court.
Some Western media outlets have reported that Ibrahim would be released in a few days, but her husband said that only the appeals court could free his wife.
"She said, 'How can I return when I never was a Muslim?
"
"
A CNN request for an interview was denied, and the justice minister said they don't comment on such matters because a final judgment has not yet been issued.
His wife, he said, was raised a Christian by her mother, an Ethiopian Orthodox, after her Muslim father deserted the family when Ibrahim was 6.
It is illegal for a Muslim woman to marry a Christian man, therefore we were brought before the court."
Wani said he's not been allowed to visit his detained family as much since the apostasy charge was added.
In addition to the death sentence, the court sentenced Ibrahim to 100 lashes for the adultery conviction.
Perhaps it will result in the judgment being overturned."
"The fact that a woman could be sentenced to death for her religious choice, and to flogging for being married to a man of an allegedly different religion, is abhorrent and should never be even considered," said Manar Idriss, Amnesty International's Sudan researcher.
The last time Sudan executed someone for apostasy was in 1985 when a man criticized Sharia law.
