(CNN)The nurse in Texas seemed to have taken all the precautions needed to protect herself from Ebola.
How could a nurse at an American hospital contract the virus?
Or could there be more to it?
The workers are supposed to double their gloves in some situations, she said.
"It is possible in the coming days that we will see additional cases of Ebola," Frieden said.
The official who has direct knowledge of the Texas case told CNN that health authorities will make daily visits to dozens of Dallas health care workers who treated Duncan between September 28 and October 8 at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital.
When a passenger on a flight from New York to Los Angeles fell ill Sunday, the biggest concern was Ebola.
President Barack Obama wants federal authorities to immediately take further measures to ensure health care workers are able to follow protocols for treating Ebola patients.
On Saturday, passengers arriving from the three countries hardest hit by Ebola started getting special screening, including having their temperature taken, at New York's JFK airport.
And 85% said their hospital hasn't provided education on Ebola where the nurses can interact and ask questions.
"The time to act is long overdue," she said.
