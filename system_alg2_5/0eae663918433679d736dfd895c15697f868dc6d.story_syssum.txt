That was the selection made Wednesday by Kwasi Enin, the New York high school student accepted by the eight Ivy League schools -- Harvard, Yale, Brown, Columbia, University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth, Princeton and Cornell.
"We are grateful for all the inspiration," he said.
He's also ranked 11th in his class at William Floyd High School, a public school on Long Island, according to his principal, Barbara Butler.
"I applied knowing that going to any of the Ivy League schools would be wonderful," Enin told CNN earlier this month.
"He is an incredibly modest, humble and respectable person," Butler said.
"Standardized test scores and good grades will get a student in the door to have their application read," Rubin said.

Enin added that Yale also has a strong music program, one of his beloved hobbies that he hopes to continue when he isn't hitting the books in college.
"Follow your passions in high school and not just follow suit for what you think can get you into these schools," he said.
