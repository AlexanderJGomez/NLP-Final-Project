ISIS, as the Islamic State jihadists in Iraq and Syria are known, has become the new face of international terrorism in the eyes of the United States and its Western allies.
Pressure is increasing on Obama to go after ISIS in both Iraq and Syria, ignoring an essentially non-existent border between them.
Obama "has not made any decision to order military action in Syria," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday, but the speculation and insistence continued.
A White House spokesman said last week that Obama would consult with Congress before taking such a step in Syria.
ISIS fighters have attacked the Syrian opposition fighting government forces, but also have seized some government territory.
"ISIS is a very powerful local organization, and probably a reasonably powerful regional terrorist organization," former CIA chief Michael Hayden told CNN on Sunday.
Bank robbery, kidnapping, smuggling, selling oil on the black market -- ISIS gets money to fund and expand its organization in all kinds of ways.
The United States is working with governments in the region, including Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, to stop such private donations, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said last week.
