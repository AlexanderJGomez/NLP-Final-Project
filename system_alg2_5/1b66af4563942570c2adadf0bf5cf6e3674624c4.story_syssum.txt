(CNN) -- When the National Security Agency sent a tweet Monday filled with garbled nonwords like "tpfccdlfdtte," the Internet was confused, and intrigued.
Turns out the nonsensical tweet was a coded recruiting pitch by the NSA, which is seeking code breakers to help decipher encrypted messages from potential terrorists.
When contacted by CNN, NSA spokeswoman Marci Green Miller said the Twitter account is run by the NSA recruitment office, which will post coded tweets each Monday for the rest of the month.
"If you have a few, shall we say, indiscretions in your past, don't be alarmed.
Monday's tweet was not the first time the NSA has sent a coded message on Twitter.
Documents leaked by Snowden showed the NSA ran a secret surveillance program to intercept Americans' phone calls and Internet messages.
