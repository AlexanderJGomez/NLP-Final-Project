(CNN) -- The president of the Central African Republic has fled the country's capital and rebels have seized control of the city, a government official said Sunday.
Some South African soldiers were killed in clashes, according to a statement from the office of French President Francois Hollande.
Sounds of fierce gunfire rang out for hours Sunday, she said.
But that peace deal also fell apart.
Hollande's office said the French president had spoken Sunday with South African President Jacob Zuma, expressing condolences for the soldiers' deaths.
