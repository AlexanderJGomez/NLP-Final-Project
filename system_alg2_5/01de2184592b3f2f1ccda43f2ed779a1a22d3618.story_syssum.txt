"In the first three months, I saw such a fast improvement, now I'm worried about plateauing," said Jason Dinant.
He also wanted to display a healthier physique for his blog called "Naked Boy News," where he stands shirtless to give what he calls "the naked truth about today's news."
With the parade only two months away, Dinant said: "Now I'm in high drive.
There's no cheating on the diet."
"You can't see a six-pack through fat," Dinant said.
Body builders try to offset the weight loss by consuming protein powders and supplements, Dothard said.
Compared with just four months ago, the "man boobies" and the extra layer of flab around his midsection have been lost, Dinant said.
While pleased with the results, Dinant worried that with two-thirds of a six-pack, his body will begin to plateau.
"Jason has to do something different or harder to maintain results to keep on the track that he's on," Dothard said.
The body is adjusting to what you're doing."
