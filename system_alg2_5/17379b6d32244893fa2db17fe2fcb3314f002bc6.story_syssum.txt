Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has blamed Grupo Clarin for her low approval ratings.
This bill is "for everyone who wants to live in a more democratic and more pluralistic Argentina," Fernandez de Kirchner said in a speech last month.
Among the changes proposed in the bill, a company that owns a cable business would not be allowed to own any over-the-air broadcast channels.
"It hits other media groups, but Clarin is the one it hurts," said Daniel Kerner, an analyst at Eurasia Group.
If anyone is applying unfair pressure, it is monopolistic media companies, Fernandez de Kirchner said.
In response, Fernandez de Kirchner has come out swinging at the Clarin newspaper and its parent company, observers said.
The editor bristles at the characterization of the bill as part of conflict between his newspaper and the government.
It's paradoxical."
