Paris (CNN) -- Police who searched buildings in Paris as part of a far-reaching investigation into a suspected terrorist cell found "all the elements needed for making explosives," prosecutors said Wednesday.
The premises where the alleged explosives components were found are used by the same person at whose address a list of Jewish organizations was found by police Saturday, Molins said.
"We are clearly and objectively facing a terrorist cell of an extreme dangerousness," Molins said.
French intelligence operatives had been monitoring him since spring -- well before the Sarcelles attack -- but he had not been questioned by authorities, Molins said.
"He appeared (to be) a delinquent converted to radical Islam," Molins said.
