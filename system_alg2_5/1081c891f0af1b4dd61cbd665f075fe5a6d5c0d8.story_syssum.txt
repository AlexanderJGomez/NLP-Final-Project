Jordan Henderson scored deep in the second half to give Liverpool a 4-3 win over Swansea City, rekindling memories of the Reds' victories over Newcastle by the same score in 1996 and 1997.
After Sturridge and Bony traded goals -- the latter's second came via the penalty spot -- Henderson settled the affair in the 74th minute when he scored on his own rebound.
A rejuvenated Henderson has been another bright spot for Rodgers this season but the defense is a worry.
Loic Remy scored in second-half injury time to give Newcastle a 1-0 win against Aston Villa at home, leaving Villa, like Norwich, four points above the relegation zone.
