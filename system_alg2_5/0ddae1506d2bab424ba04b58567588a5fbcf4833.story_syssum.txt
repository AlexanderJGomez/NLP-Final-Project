(CNN) -- Two Alaskan volcanoes that began minor eruptions weeks ago are showing their strongest seismic activity yet, emitting small amounts of lava and ash along with smoke plumes, the Alaska Volcano Observatory said Tuesday.
The ash has at times affected those local flights.
It has also produced a lava flow and an ash plume, though not as high as Pavlof -- only about 8,200 feet.
"Our best estimate of what is going to happen is similar to what's happened in the past -- this level of activity and some level of ash."
