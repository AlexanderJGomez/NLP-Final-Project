According to the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities, it's here, at a spot known as Abusir, that the tomb of Marc Antony and Cleopatra might be located.
I met Martinez in a dusty tomb full of bones at the excavation site.
The last queen of Ancient Egypt, she told me, "spoke nine languages, she was a philosopher, she was a poet, she was a politician, she was a goddess, and she was a warrior."
It was "bad propaganda," in Martinez's words.
Marc Antony was a no less fascinating character than Cleopatra.
Octavian, according to Plutarch, allowed them to be buried together "in splendid and regal fashion."
The sudden focus on Antony and Cleopatra has also reignited an old debate over the latter's looks.
"The only thing you can see here is her nose is a bit big."
Plutarch wrote in his "Life of Antony" that "for her beauty was in itself not altogether incomparable, nor such as to strike those who saw her."
In any event, it's just one of many mysteries in Egypt.
Why were they built?
There has been plenty of excitement in the past few days over reports that Martinez and her team are about to find the long-lost tomb of Antony and Cleopatra.
I guess we can wait a few more months.
