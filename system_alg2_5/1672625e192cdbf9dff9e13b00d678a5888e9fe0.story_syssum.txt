Washington (CNN) -- Inside a tall, red-brick building in Alexandria, Virginia, there is a federal courtroom just waiting for admitted intelligence leaker Edward Snowden to show up.
That's why a guy in Snowden's position -- now a world away in Russia with a grant of temporary asylum -- has to think about his next move.
It takes him out of the discomfort of the transit zone and into Russia itself, where he presumably has to be with friends and associates and it just gives him a tremendous amount of time," said international extradition lawyer Jacques Semmelman.
Option 2: Negotiate a solution and return to the United States.
Option 3: Extradition.
Why?
Hong Kong has an extradition agreement with the United States.
Experts say it is always a possibility to camp at a foreign embassy in Moscow or elsewhere.
