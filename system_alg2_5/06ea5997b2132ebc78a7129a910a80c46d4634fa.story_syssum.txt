The truth is that the reductions in spending that will take place over the next year will, at a minimum, have no positive impact on the economy.
In no case are the recently enacted sequester cuts likely to stimulate job creation and increased economic growth.
Public policies such as stimulative Federal Reserve actions that are helping to inflate the stock market, and tax cuts for the wealthy, have combined to create a level of economic inequality not seen in the United States since the Great Depression.
The most effective way to promote that result, particularly now, given the economy's current slow growth trajectory, is to invest strategically in the economy in a manner that will provide the incentives for new private investment, business growth and ultimately job creation.
