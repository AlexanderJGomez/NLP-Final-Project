The pilot, identified as Marcus Schrenker, 38, later checked into a hotel in Alabama under a fake name and then put on a black cap and fled into woods, authorities in Alabama said, according to the Santa Rosa County Sheriff's Office in Milton, Florida.
The plane crashed Sunday night in a swampy, wooded area within 50 to 75 yards of some homes in East Milton, Florida, the sheriff's office said.
Those three companies are under investigation for possible securities violations, according to Gavin.
Schrenker "appears to have intentionally abandoned the plane after putting it on autopilot over the Birmingham, Alabama, area and parachuting to the ground" Sunday night, the sheriff's office said in a news release.
Controllers tried to tell the pilot to divert the flight to Pell City, Alabama, but he did not respond.
Meanwhile, Schrenker reportedly was more than 220 miles north of the crash site.
The Childersburg police didn't know about the plane crash, so they took Schrenker to a nearby hotel, authorities said.
He was not there, they said.
Kathleen Bergen, spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration, said a "detailed review of radar data" and the fact that the plane had switched to autopilot suggested the pilot might have parachuted.
Darlington described the pilot as "accomplished" and said he owns "a couple of airplanes" and flies regularly.
