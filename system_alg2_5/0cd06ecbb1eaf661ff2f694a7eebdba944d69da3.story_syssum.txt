Arora, who shared the video with CNN on Sunday, said he also turned it over to authorities investigating Lisa's disappearance in hopes it will help in the search for the girl.
Bradley said she last saw Lisa at 6:40 p.m. the night before.
The attorney for Lisa's parents said the release of the affidavit Friday was "unfortunate," as it could derail the search for the missing girl.
Bradley said in an NBC interview last week that she was drunk the night the infant disappeared and that she had last seen the baby about four hours earlier than initially reported.
Asked whether he had questions about Bradley, Jeremy Irwin told NBC, "No.
I know the kind of mother she is."
