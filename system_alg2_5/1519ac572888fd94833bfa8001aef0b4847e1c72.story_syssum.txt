Supermodel Natalia Vodianova was discovered in Moscow in a classic rags-to-riches tale.
I go to very remote parts of Russia that are far from Moscow and it gives these children an extra message of love," she told CNN.
When Vodianova was 11 she began to help out on the family's fruit stall, and at the age of 15 she had moved into her own apartment with her best friend.
Vodianova impressed him and he sent her to Paris to sign with Viva Models on the condition that she learn English within three months.

Over the next few years two more children followed.
Afterwards, Vodianova took Valentino for a well-deserved holiday to her much-loved city of Moscow.
At the age of 27 Natalia Vodianova has achieved more than most people could ever dream of.
It's really about people in general -- I really love people and I try to never say no if someone needs my help."
