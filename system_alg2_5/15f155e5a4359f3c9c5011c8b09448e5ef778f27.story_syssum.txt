The shooting began after the student walked into Arapahoe High School in Centennial with the intention of confronting a specific faculty member, Robinson said.
But Robinson told reporters that the condition of a  a 15-year-old girl who was shot was in critical condition after surgery.
Pierson walked into Arapahoe High School carrying a shotgun and made no attempt to hide it, Robinson said.
I said, 'They are shooting in the school.'"
In addition to the shotgun, authorities found two Molotov cocktails inside the school, Robinson said.
As part of the investigation, authorities also will be looking at school surveillance video, the sheriff said.
The first sheriff's deputies and police officers arrived at Arapahoe and entered almost immediately after the shooting was reported, Robinson said.
While authorities hunted for the student gunman inside the school, students were locked in their classrooms.
They soon heard people yelling, and walkie-talkies crackling, and then they heard police asking someone to drop the gun, put the gun down, and hold his arms up, she said.
Colton Powers told CNN affiliate KDVR that he heard gunfire during his English class.
The high school, with a student population of 2,229 students, has 70 classrooms.
John Hickenlooper called the shooting an "all-too-familiar sequence, where you have gunshots and parents racing to the school and unspeakable horror in a place of learning."
