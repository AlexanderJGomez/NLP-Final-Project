The gay civil rights movement has reached the Supreme Court -- a milestone by any measure.
In fact, a majority of Republicans under age 50 now support the freedom to marry -- including more than 60% of evangelicals under 30.
Former San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom also brought recognition to the issue by officiating over same-sex marriage ceremonies at City Hall.
This means outreach to Republicans as well as making counter-intuitively conservative arguments for same-sex marriage.
"This is a civil-rights issue and a human-rights issue."
Likewise, look at the 131 Republicans who signed on to the amicus brief in support of the freedom to marry, including prominent members of the Bush administration and the Romney campaign, both of which had pledged to pursue a federal marriage amendment.
To some ears, "Gay marriage" is more polarizing than "freedom to marry" (the preferred term for conservatives) and "marriage equality" (a phraseology that unites liberals).
Perhaps not coincidentally, it also is the type of argument that might sway swing votes on the Supreme Court -- as well as swing voters -- to support this extension of individual civil rights.
The centrist model by which it moved forward can be replicated as we try to call a ceasefire in the culture wars and actually start to solve problems through the process of addition rather than division.
