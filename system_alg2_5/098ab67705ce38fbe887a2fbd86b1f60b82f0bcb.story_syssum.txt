(CNN) -- Republicans now have the Senate Majority and control of Congress going into next year.
It's an exciting moment for the GOP because it can showcase its policies.
For the first time in eight years, Republicans will have the chance to demonstrate that they are the party of common sense ideas, because they will run the entire show on Capitol Hill.
In addition, Republican lieutenants like House Majority Leader Kevi McCarthy, House Republican Whip Steve Scalise and Senate Republican Whip John Cornyn are all loyal and very able leaders to help implement the party's agenda.
Yes, there will be several high-profile senators who will be positioning themselves for a presidential run, but the focus of House-Senate efforts must not change because of them.
While we can continue to show why Obamacare remains a failure, we do not have 60 votes in the Senate to repeal it.
While members of the GOP are slapping each other on the back for the hard-fought and well-deserved victory, the Republican brand still remains stagnant outside the beltway and must be fixed.
It's time for Republicans to shine and prove that they can successfully navigate this new journey forward.
