Teachers and doctors in Buenos Aires went on strike Wednesday and are scheduled to go back to work Friday, the government-run Telam news agency and other outlets reported.
The doctors are not only seeking better salaries, but also improvements to the public health system.
Teachers also want greater pay and announced Thursday they would go back on strike Tuesday because of failed talks with Buenos Aires Education Director Mario Oporto.
The teachers say they want their raises by year's end.
They, too, want pay raises.
