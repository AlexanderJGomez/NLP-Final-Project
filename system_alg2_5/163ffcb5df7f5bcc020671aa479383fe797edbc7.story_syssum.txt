Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Ugandan opposition leader Kizza Besigye was barred from  boarding a flight back home on Wednesday from the Kenyan capital, where he was undergoing treatment, an airline official said.
"This is an example of the ongoing frustrations, concerns and  violations of rights by the Uganda government," Besigye said.
Despite being held in Kenya, protests will proceed, according to Besigye.
President Yoweri Museveni is scheduled to be sworn in for a new term following his re-election in February.
