Diego Maradona's second strike against England at Mexico 86 tops our greatest-ever goal list.
If you're English, the other goal he scored that day sticks in the craw as well as the mind.
The best team goal of all time.
A miracle of technique, this goal had Zidane written all over it.
Arnold Muhren pumped over a ball from wide on the left and everyone was expecting Van Basten, in space on the far right of the box, to either pull the ball down or head it back into the area.
Sixty yards ahead of him, Bergkamp was on the move and De Boer picked out his run with a pin-point pass.
A rival to Carlos Alberto's goal against Italy, the ball was shifted effortlessly between dark blue shirts 24 times, in and out of Serbian players, before Cambiasso played a one-two with Hernan Crespo in the box and thumped home.
Picking the ball up from deep on the right, Messi ran at the Getafe defense, skipping past challenges until faced with the keeper.
Goals that see players run the length of the pitch with the ball are always crowd favorites.
Robert Pires cut in from the left and threaded a pass to Bergkamp's feet on the edge of the area.
