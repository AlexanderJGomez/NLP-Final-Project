(CNN) -- The CEO of popular messaging app Snapchat is apologizing after a set of filthy e-mails he wrote several years ago to his fraternity brothers at Stanford University was leaked publicly this week.
A Snapchat spokeswoman told CNN that Spiegel had no further comment.
Spiegel created Snapchat along with fraternity brother Bobby Murphy while attending Stanford.
Snapchat claims its users send more than 700 million photos and videos a day.
Snapchat reportedly turned down a $3 billion acquisition offer from Facebook last fall.
