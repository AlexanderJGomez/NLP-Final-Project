(CNN) -- Hurricane experts are throwing cold water on an idea backed by billionaire Microsoft founder Bill Gates aimed at controlling the weather.
Hurricanes are fueled by warm water, and cooling the waters surrounding a storm would slow a storm's momentum.
"The problem is the storms come up so rapidly," said Gray, a professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University.
It's very difficult to bring up enough cold water in two to three days to have much effect."
And flooding and storm surges are determined by these outer winds, Gray said.
"You're doing something to the ocean that the hurricane would have done anyway," Emanuel said.
"This would only be practical if the amount [of money] you spend doing this would be less than the damage caused by the hurricane," Emanuel said.
A spokeswoman for Intellectual Ventures, which holds about 27,000 technology patents, didn't elaborate on the cost associated with the patent.
Hurricane expert Gray agrees.
