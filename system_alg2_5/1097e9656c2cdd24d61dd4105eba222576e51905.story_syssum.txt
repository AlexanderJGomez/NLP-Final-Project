Chicago workers resurface alleys with permeable concrete that cleans rainwater before it runs into Lake Michigan.
"We wanted to come up with a different way of solving that problem other than reconstructing, putting in a sewer system and adding water to our already full sewer system," said Janet Attarian, sustainability coordinator with the Chicago Department of Transportation.
That's a big deal, Attarian explained, because the city takes about a billion gallons of water out of Lake Michigan every year.
But only about 1 percent of that water finds its way back to the lake, Attarian said.
How green are those alleys?
