(CNN) -- The small, World War II-era plane that crashed Friday during a Reno, Nevada, air race was equipped with data and video recording devices that investigators hope to use to help determine what happened and why.
Several memory cards have been found at the wreckage site that may have come from either device, and will be sent to the NTSB laboratory in Washington, D.C., for a full analysis, Rosekind said.
Besides the cards, Rosekind said parts of a plane's tail, an "elevator trim tab" and video camera fragments have been found.
Besides the plane's trim tab, parts of a tail, the memory cards and already known plane data, investigators also will pore over "a tremendous (amount of) video that was captured" at the scene, according to Rosekind.
Besides Leeward, the dead include Michael Joseph Wogan, a 22-year-old from Phoenix who was attending the event with his father as part of a father-and-son vacation, his family said in a statement.
Michael Wogan graduated magna cum laude from Arizona State University with a finance degree in May, his family said.
The Hewitts were killed when the plane crashed into the seating area, said R.D.
He went down around 4:15 p.m. PT Friday while taking part in a qualifying round in the "unlimited class" division of the air race, said Mike Draper, the show spokesman.
One local hospital, Renown Medical Center, received 34 patients, four of whom were in critical condition as of Sunday afternoon.
St. Mary's Hospital in Reno said it had accepted 28 patients from the accident: As of Sunday afternoon, two were in critical condition and six in serious condition.
