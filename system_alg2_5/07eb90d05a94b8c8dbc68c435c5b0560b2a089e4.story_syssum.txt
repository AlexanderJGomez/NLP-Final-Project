Isinbayeva reclaimed the women's pole vault title in front of her adoring public on Tuesday, then two days later defended her country's anti-gay propaganda law after receiving her medal.
"It's unrespectful to our country," Isinbayeva told reporters.
"Maybe we are different from European people and other people from different lands.
"What I wanted to say was that people should respect the laws of other countries particularly when they are guests.
"It blows my mind that such a young, well-traveled, well-educated woman would be so behind the times," said Symmonds, who spoke out against the law after winning a silver medal in Tuesday's 800 meters event.
Kenya's Ezekiel Kemboi claimed his third consecutive world title in the 3,000-meter steeplechase -- adding to his two Olympic gold medals -- with a time of eight minutes, 6.01 seconds.
