(CNN) -- Journalist Bob Woodward describes in his new book a secret U.S. program to assassinate terrorists in Iraq.
I mean, the U.S. subcontracted out an assassination program against al Qaeda way back in early 2006.
Then when America put 100,000-plus insurgents on the U.S. government payroll, including members of al Qaeda, that not only took them out of the field, but it also let them run their own assassination programs against the Iranian-backed militias.
Ware: It does work together.
This is your American militia, the counterbalance to the Iranian militias.
