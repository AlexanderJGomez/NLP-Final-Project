Whether a trip to the McLeod Ganj just above Dharamsala in northern India -- the hometown of the Dalai Lama -- offers an easy route is open to question.
Like thousands of others he's on his way to listen to a three-day teaching on wisdom and compassion.
During the event, the Dalai Lama appears each morning at 8 a.m., led by plain clothes armed policemen and followed by a small entourage of a handful of monks carrying pots of burning incense.
He makes his way through the temple courtyards, up two flights of stairs and through the back of the main hall.
While the culture of the towns, Dharamsala and McLeod Ganj, are predominantly Tibetan Buddhist, the small surrounding villages are more Indian and attract an international hippy crowd.
A break from the all the spiritual adventure can be found at the Trimurti Garden Cafe (Bhagsunag, Mcleod Ganj; +91 98 1686 9144) in Lower Dharamkot, a little oasis serving the best carrot cake and vegan chocolate cake in the area.
The Dalai Lama offers teachings at Dharamsala a few times every year but also in different places.
The next public lectures in Dharamsala are from November 11-13 and December 2-5.
