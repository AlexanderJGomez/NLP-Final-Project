Tuesday evening, Zooniverse founder Chris Lintott gave a public lecture, "Discovering Planets from Your Sofa: Adventures in Citizen Science," about how hundreds of thousands of interested citizens are making original scientific discoveries, including finding new exoplanets.
That's because many colleagues who work for federal agencies like the National Science Foundation and NASA have been told to stay home.
Hundreds of thousands of scientists work in the federal government.
The nation benefits when top scientists like these contribute their efforts to the federal agencies.

In many disciplines, 10 proposals for new research projects are rejected for every one that is funded.
Astronomy research experiences for undergraduates -- funded by the National Science Foundation, among others -- are an effective way to retain students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math, or STEM, majors.
So our short-sighted policies are preventing government scientists from conducting the best possible research, not to mention losing U.S. leadership in important international efforts.
