London (CNN) -- Two men went on trial Friday accused of the "cowardly and callous murder" of British soldier Lee Rigby, who was hacked to death in a London street.
Tell them to bring our troops back so you can all live in peace.
Leave our lands and you will live in peace."
Footage from a different surveillance camera showed two men dragging the soldier's limp body from the sidewalk into the middle of the road.
When police arrived at the scene, the two men moved toward their vehicle, Whittam said.
"It is clear that there was an agreement to attack the police when they arrived," Whittam said.
While the gun carried by Adebowale was not loaded, he also had on him the bloodstained knife he'd used to attack Rigby, the prosecutor said.
Having been given morphine for the pain, he allegedly told paramedics, "Your government is all wrong.
Whittam said the attack unfolded in a very public place, near a school.
Some family members left crying as images were shown of the soldier shortly before the attack, as he left the public transit system in Woolwich.
The car allegedly used by the suspects was also caught on surveillance video maneuvering in the vicinity of the street where Rigby was attacked later that day.
