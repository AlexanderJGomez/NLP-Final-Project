President Barack Obama signed an executive order Monday banning federal contractors from discriminating against employees on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.
Rea Carey, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, was in the room as Obama signed the order and said it was an emotional moment.
But Obama's signature on Monday did not touch a 2002 executive order signed by President George W. Bush that allows religious groups to weigh prospective employees' faith in hiring decisions.
"I believe the administration has left open a path that religious groups can work with," Schneck said.
But on the federal legislative level, LGBT groups have struggled to enact similar legislation.
But the measure, which exempted religious groups from the would-be-law, did not make it to the House floor where Republicans opposed it.
