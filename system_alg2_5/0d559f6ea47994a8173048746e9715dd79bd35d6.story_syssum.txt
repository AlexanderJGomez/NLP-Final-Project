Jardim Brandao dithered on the ball in his own box and Marco Borriello dispossessed him before trying to go round goalkeeper Gianluca Curci.
Substitute goalkeeper Gianluca Pegolo's first task was to pick the ball out of his net.
Gennaro Sardo's stunning first-half strike proved to be the only goal of the game as Juve turned in a performance lacking energy and confidence which comes on the back of a 3-0 hammering at the hands of Milan in their last league outing.
And, on the hour mark, Vucinic turned provider again for Toni to head home his second.
