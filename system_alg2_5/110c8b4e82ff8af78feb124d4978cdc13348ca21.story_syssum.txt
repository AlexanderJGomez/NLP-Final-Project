Pauley had been leading an 18-strong patrol of the United States First Armored Division in the city of Tal Afar when he was hit by the blast.
Private First Class Jody Missildine of Plant City, Florida, just 19 years of age, had died that day, April 8, 2006 and Pauley blamed himself.
"I battled three or four years of just helplessness, anxiety and depression, until I was introduced to the Wounded Warriors Project," Pauley says.
Aimed at helping injured service members, and raising awareness in the community, it brought him together with Norbie Lara -- who also joined the army in the mid-1990s and who was also seriously wounded on duty.
Like Pauley, his army days were over and with discharge came the same sense of helplessness and loss.
This year more than 150 courses in the United States will be used for an event with an expected 15,000 entrants, all playing in teams of four.
"We've hit a chord within the golfing community," Hill tells CNN.
Missildine's family invited Pauley to visit and pay his respects, something he had been unable to do in 2006 because he was in hospital recovering from his injuries.
Lara, who works full-time for Wounded Warriors, will perform similar speaking duties at 1757 Golf Club in Dulles, Virginia before showing off his golfing skills.
Nearly 40,000 veterans and their families have benefited from its various programs and fundraising efforts.
Having already presented a check for $735,000 in January, Hill hopes this year's fundraising will break through the $1 million mark.
"It's a great way to raise money and awareness for the Warriors, " Lara says.
