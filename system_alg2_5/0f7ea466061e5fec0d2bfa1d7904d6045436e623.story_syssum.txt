"Puss in Boots" cost $130 million to produce, and it earned Dreamworks' third-worst debut for a computer animated film, beating only "Flushed Away" and "Antz," which started with $18.8 million and $17.2 million, respectively.
The 3-D "Shrek"-spinoff, cost as much as Dreamworks' "Megamind," which opened in early November 2010, but that film began with $46 million, and it played well through the Thanksgiving season on its way to a $148.4 million total.
Fox's $40 million Justin Timberlake/Amanda Seyfried thriller "In Time" underwhelmed with just $12 million in its opening weekend.
The $24 million production has now earned $38.5 million after 17 days in theaters, and it will pass the total of Julianne Hough's first feature film, "Burlesque" ($39.4 million), sometime this week.
Johnny Depp's latest, "The Rum Diary," stumbled out of the gate with just $5 million.
The $50 million picture marks the third straight box office disappointment for FilmDistrict, the young distributor that found success with Insidious ($54 million) earlier this year.
It's not likely to platform much further.
It has earned $1.5 million so far.
