Baghdad (CNN) -- A brazen insurgent attack inside a provincial council building in Baquba killed at least 12 people Tuesday, Iraqi Interior Ministry officials said.
U.S. troops, who were on routine patrol in the area, assisted with an initial search of the building at the request of Iraqi police and later assisted with security, said spokeswoman Maj. Angela Funaro.
The 12 fatalities included four attackers; at least 28 others were wounded in the incident, officials said.
In March, armed militants took over a government building in Tikrit in northern Iraq and held hostages.
A new Iraqi government was formed in December but key positions that oversee security forces remain vacant amid political wrangling.
