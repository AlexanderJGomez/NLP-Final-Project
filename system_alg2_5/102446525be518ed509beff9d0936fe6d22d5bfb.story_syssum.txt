(CNN) -- A police helicopter crashed into the roof of a pub crowded with Friday-night revelers in the Scottish city of Glasgow, trapping a number people under the debris, rescuers and witnesses said.
Jim Murphy, a member of the UK Parliament, said he arrived at the pub just moments after the crash and saw people trying to get out of the building.
"We were watching the band and there was kind of like a (roof) panel fell, there was a whoosh of dust, then we laughed that the band said, 'We didn't think we were going to bring the roof down,'" she said.
"Everyone was really confused and scared," she said.
There is no fire," she said.
"I thought that didn't sound right for a couple of seconds," O'Neill said.
Think I just saw a helicopter crash in Glasgow," he tweeted.
Terrifying experience.
"My thoughts are with everyone affected by the helicopter crash in Glasgow -- and the emergency services working tonight," he said.
