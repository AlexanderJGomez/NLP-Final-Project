Putting the blood onto the testing strip, she saw the results: dangerously low blood sugar.
She yearned for an automatic way of knowing when Elle was dipping into a dangerously high or low blood sugar -- and not just at night, but at school, where the 12-year-old is largely responsible for monitoring her own blood sugar.
Shaheen didn't have to set her alarm to wake up every three hours at night because the device was designed to catch a dangerously high or low blood sugar and treat it.
It was Elle who urged her mother to enroll her in an artificial pancreas study.
The Shaheens first heard about the artificial pancreas shortly after Elle was diagnosed with diabetes at age 8, but she had to be 12 years old to enroll.
I don't know what's wrong,'" Shaheen says.
For three days, the device did the work Elle's pancreas can no longer do.
Russell's research partner, Edward Diamano, an associate professor of biomedical engineering at Boston University, says the device learned Elle's blood sugar patterns and made changes accordingly.
"We're extraordinarily impatient for access to the device," Shaheen says.
"That was really hard," Elle says.
Russell said he hopes that by the fall, the FDA will give him permission to allow adult diabetic patients to leave the building and walk the grounds of the Massachusetts General Hospital campus accompanied by a nurse, eating as they like and using the hospital's gym.
"We're extraordinarily impatient for access to the device," she says.
