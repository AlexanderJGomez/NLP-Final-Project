Three European nations were notified about concerns over horse meat as early as a year ago, the United Kingdom's food safety agency said Sunday.
The horse meat was sent from Denmark to Italy and officials sent out the alert to let Italian authorities know about their concerns about the paperwork, not the meat itself, Kim Sigsgaard said.
February 2012 is six months before what had been thought to be the earliest possible time frame where horse meat had been discovered in products labeled as 100% beef.
Of 2,501 tests carried out on beef products across the industry by noon Friday, 2,472 found no horse meat content above 1%, the Food Standards Agency said.
Authorities across Europe have been scrambling to get a grip on the crisis over rogue horse meat in beef products.
The discovery of pig DNA in beef products is of particular concern to Jews and Muslims, whose dietary laws forbid the consumption of pork products.
Jewish dietary laws also ban the eating of horse meat.
