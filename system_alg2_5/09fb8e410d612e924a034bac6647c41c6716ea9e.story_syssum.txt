(CNN) -- A former Florida middle school principal stabbed four people Friday at a group home for the hearing impaired, killing two of them, then struck five others with a car, the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office said.
The other two, ages 25 and 43, suffered what the sheriff's office said were non-life-threatening injuries.
The sheriff's office said the man's injuries "appear to be life-threatening."
It was not clear whether he had retained a lawyer.
"Before I could ever hope to go on and help anyone again, I need to help myself," Giancola told CNN.
Then, in early 2010, Giancola was arrested again and charged on two counts -- intent to purchase cocaine and loitering -- according to online records from the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office.
