Stuck in a foot of snow on a road somewhere outside Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, the couple from Wisconsin pulled all the clothes out of their suitcases and wore them, trying to keep warm in their car with temperatures dipping below zero.
Their route took them on Beartooth Highway, but they said they didn't see any signs warning that the road was closed.
"I decided about 9 o'clock that it was too late to go out," Barnett told CNN.
Then he got on the snowmobile and minutes later, found the couple just about where he thought they'd be.
"Mark heard it first and he was like, 'Kris!
Kris!,'" Kristine Wathke told the Billings newspaper.
Barnett loaded Mark and Kristine on his snowmobile and drove back to his truck.
"We help people off there quite a bit," he said.
