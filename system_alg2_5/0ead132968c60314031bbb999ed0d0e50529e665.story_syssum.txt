We headed there to see if family members or friends wanted to talk to us about him.
They were gracious and warm to us, and invited us to join other mourners who were with them.
She told us she wasn't sure if she wanted to talk, but invited us to come back later in the morning.
Widya and Angela, her daughter, invited us to sit down with them, and it was there that they decided they did want to say a few words to us about Irianto.
I marveled at how kind Irianto's wife and children were to us, how kind his parents were to us.
This family made it very evident they were lucky to have Irianto in their lives.
