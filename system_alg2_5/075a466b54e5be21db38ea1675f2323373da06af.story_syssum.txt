Danny Boyle, the Oscar-winning director -- and east London resident -- best known for hit movies "Trainspotting" and "Slumdog Millionaire" was the man responsible for the Olympic opening ceremony, the show that televisions around the world were tuned in to at the start of London's long-awaited Games.
"We have to celebrate all that is great about the past but also all the potential Britain has in the future," said British Prime Minister David Cameron.
"His ability as a storyteller, as a creator of spectacle, his background in both theater and film and the passion he has for this city and this project -- they all just screamed at us," said Bill Morris, director of Ceremonies for the London Games, when Boyle was appointed to the role.
"He gets the Olympic Games, he gets sports, he lives in London, he's a stone's throw from the Olympic Park, and it was just such an obvious fit."
And it is the uplifting, life-affirming mood of "Slumdog Millionaire" that the director brought to the opening ceremony, because despite the dark subject matter of many of his films, and his recent return to theater with a rapturously-received production of Frankenstein, Boyle insists he remains positive, an optimist.
As the athletes launch into competition in venues around his home, his ceremony's combination of novelty, national pride and nuttiness seems to have accomplished exactly that.
