(CNN) -- Flooding described by India's prime minister as the worst in recent times, has left at least 95 people dead and almost 2 million others homeless in the country's remote Assam state.
"I am stuck.
The agency reported that flooding had begun as early as June 24 in some areas and affected all of Assam's 27 districts.
The people of Assam are facing one of the worst floods in recent times," Singh said in a prepared statement.
Every year the monsoon dumps heavy rains across India, and every year it claims lives.
