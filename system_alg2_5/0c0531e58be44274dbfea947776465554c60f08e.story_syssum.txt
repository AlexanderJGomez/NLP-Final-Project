The American Medical Association Alliance has been trying to get movie studios to make smoking-free films.
The association has given no G ratings in the past two years to a movie with smoking, Graves said.
Overall, 55 percent of the  movies rated in the past two years showed some smoking, but 75 percent of those with smoking scenes were given R ratings, Graves said.
A spokesman for Twentieth Century Fox, the studio responsible for the Wolverine movie series, said Jackman's cigar was never lit and it was limited to just two scenes.
The alliance will keep an online scorecard throughout the summer to count "how many tobacco impressions each studio delivers to G, PG and PG-13 audiences," she said.
They began factoring smoking scenes into the ratings two years ago as "a reflection of changes in society and health concerns," she said.
"Any movie with smoking should be rated R," he said.
