When it was announced last year that we would be getting a Green Day version of "Rock Band," fans of the band (myself included) were pretty excited.
Playing songs like "When I Come Around" and "Pulling Teeth" brings back memories of college days, and yes, I will admit I wish they had put "All By Myself" in the game, because it's the only hidden track that Green Day has ever included on an album.

Also notable is that the band's clothing choices match the theme and era of each album.
In this case, you get "cred" instead of "fans" and with that the ability to open up more sets with tougher songs like "Peacemaker" from "21st Century Breakdown" -- a fun, fast-paced song about death and destruction.
Fans both new and old will enjoy playing along with their favorite songs.
