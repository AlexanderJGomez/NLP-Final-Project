Polokwane, South Africa (CNN) -- A South African court charged Julius Malema with money laundering Wednesday, and the firebrand politician scoffed at the accusations and riled up his supporters moments after his release on bail.
The ruling party said the allegations are not politically motivated.
Before the hearing, Malema's supporters sang songs deriding the president outside the court in Polokwane.
Crimes in South Africa are categorized between schedule one and schedule five, the latter being the most serious.
His populist rhetoric has made him a controversial figure in the nation and sparked outrage in the ruling party.
His calls came after police killed 34 striking mine workers in August during the miners' labor protests to demand higher pay.
Malema's controversial road to fame includes his calls to seize white-owned farms in South Africa, especially incendiary in a nation with a history of racial tensions.
