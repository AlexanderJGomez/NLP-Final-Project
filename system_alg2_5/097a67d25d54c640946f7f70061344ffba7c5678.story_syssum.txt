It is September 2003, and I just found out my daughter is going to be born with Down Syndrome.
After a few agonizing days I realize she is my child.
It doesn't.
I want her to be born healthy and be happy.
These days, Jaylin is doing well.
Had she not been born with Down Syndrome I don't think I would be as good a person as I am now.
Jaylin is almost 6, and this year was our fifth Buddy Walk.
She will keep doing what she loves, in great shoes, just to make me happy.
