LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- California's director of adult prisons is recommending against "compassionate release" for a terminally ill former Manson family member, a spokeswoman said.
Atkins had been held for years at the Corona prison, which earlier determined that she met the criteria for compassionate release under the law, and sent her request to the corrections department.
The board also can decide whether to refer the request to the sentencing court.
Atkins, known within the Manson family as "Sadie Mae Glutz," has been in prison since 1971 and has been denied parole 11 times.
Tate and three houseguests were slain in August 1969 by killers who burst into her Benedict Canyon home.
Atkins, like family leader Charles Manson, received a death sentence.
Atkins is a born-again Christian, according to a Web site maintained by her husband.
