The former European player of the year is competing in his first professional golf tournament as part of the Kharkov Superior Cup in his native Ukraine, but struggled to a 12-over-par 84 in Thursday's opening round.
"I am not a big fan of football so I didn't really know much about Andriy but it was great to play with him.
He entered this tournament as one of several amateurs in the 130-strong field, having initially taken up golf to help ease the pressure of playing elite football.
"I just found this great game where you have to be focused and balanced and that's why I like it.
"It's the first event for me and also in Ukraine so it's big for golf here," he said.
