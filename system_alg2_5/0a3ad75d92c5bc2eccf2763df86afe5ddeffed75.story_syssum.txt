TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (CNN)  -- The de facto president of Honduras denied Wednesday that his government turned off the power at the embassy where deposed President Jose Manual Zelaya surprisingly reappeared this week, and said that the people inside were free to come and go.
As of Wednesday, power was restored to the building, Micheletti said.
But the de facto leader said in a statement read by his foreign minister Tuesday that his offer to talk with Zelaya does not nullify an arrest warrant issued against the ousted president by the nation's Supreme Court.
The United States and Brazil have said they support dialogue between the two sides, centered on the San Jose Accord, an agreement negotiated by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias.
Micheletti said that other nations have not given his government a fair hearing of its position.
Despite increasing political, diplomatic and economic isolation, Micheletti has steadfastly resisted pressure to allow Zelaya to return to power and Micheletti thwarted two very public attempts by Zelaya to return to his homeland.
"The situation in Honduras can only be described as alarming," said Susan Lee, Americas director at Amnesty International.
