Mexico City stores, such as this supermarket, can no longer give out non-biodegradable plastic bags.
About 90 percent of the bags used in the United States are not recycled.
Ireland reported cutting use of the bags by 90 percent after imposing a fee on each one.
Achim Steiner, executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, says plastic bags are the second-most-common form of litter, behind cigarette butts.
Mexico City, which has had some of the worst air pollution in the world, also is looking at improving its environment in other ways.
