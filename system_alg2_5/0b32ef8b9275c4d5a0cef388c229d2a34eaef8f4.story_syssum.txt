He's had more than 90 radiation treatments and 200 chemo treatments since being diagnosed with head and neck cancer eight years ago.
"With treatment, two years," the doctor responded.
He's on his fourth clinical trial.
...
Cossman is one of the tens of thousands of people worldwide enrolled in drug trials.
He wants to make others "aware of head and neck cancer, and that clinical trials are available," he says.
"You want to see how long you can actually hold the disease at bay," Fetzer says.
When the test drug is for cancer, the patients have very aggressive forms.
He underwent 36 radiation and chemo treatments over 2Â½ months.
The tumor was eliminated, yet a spot showed up again about a year later.
"By June 2006," he says, "I went through every type of chemo that's been approved for head and neck cancer.
To remain in a trial, tumor growth has to be limited to 20 percent.
In his second study, he developed a tumor on his right arm.
Then, when the CT scan comes back and it shows the tumors are growing, it's really frustrating."
So Cossman entered his fourth study this summer, the trial by Cerulean Pharma.
In fact, he celebrates life because "it's been good to me."
He says far too few cancer patients who could be eligible for trials are aware of them.
On the other end of the line, his doctor delivers the best news he's had in more than a year.
Cossman hopes to enter a new one soon.
"Definitely," he says.
