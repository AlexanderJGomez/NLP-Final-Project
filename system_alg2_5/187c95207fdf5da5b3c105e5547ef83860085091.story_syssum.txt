Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- Hundreds of people fled a pro-Alassane Ouattara neighborhood in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, where forces loyal to incumbent President Laurent Gbabgbo have been fighting an armed Ouattara supporters for the past week.
Ouattara is holed up in the Golf hotel in Abidjan under the protection of U.N. peacekeepers.
In a statement released Friday, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed deep concern over the deteriorating situation in Ivory Coast, deploring recent clashes between rival groups as well as threats against the United Nations, including the call to impede the movement of peacekeepers.
Army spokesman Col. Babri Gohourou said on national television that the police officer went to the U.N. camp to negotiate the release of three Gbagbo supporters who were arrested during a demonstration.
The political standoff in the country has raised fears of a renewal of the bloodshed suffered after a civil war broke out in 2002.
