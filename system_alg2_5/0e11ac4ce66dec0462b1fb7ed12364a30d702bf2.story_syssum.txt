"What is Prince William like?"
He may be a prince but he's doing it the old-fashioned (non-royal) way.
We started chatting, he was on great form and I knew immediately that he was going to give a great interview.
In fact before I knew it, the cameras were rolling and the interview was under way.
William was very comfortable and revealing about his conservation work, and I can't wait for people to see the full version of the interview in next month's special.
It could be any new dad, and that's what I like about the interview.
