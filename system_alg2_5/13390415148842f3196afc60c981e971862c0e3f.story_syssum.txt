Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The failed computer system that caused flight delays across the country has been restored, the Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday.
Due to the outage, air traffic controllers had to enter flight plans manually, a problem that causes delays, according to the FAA and the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.
AirTran Airways spokesman Christopher White said the airline had canceled 22 flights around the country as of 8 a.m.
"We will be a mess all day," he said.
The longest delays have been a little more than an hour, but no flights have been canceled, and some might be consolidated, he said.
All passengers are encouraged to contact the airlines regarding the statuses of their flights before they head to the airport," the airport said.
The air traffic controllers said "weather equipment was affected" and information such as winds speeds was not "processing."
