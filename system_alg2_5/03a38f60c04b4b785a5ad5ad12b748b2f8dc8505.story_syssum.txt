New York (CNN) -- Police are investigating the slaying of a 32-year-old man in the Greenwich Village neighborhood early Saturday as a hate crime because the gunman made multiple anti-gay comments, they said.
The gunman confronted the two men again, before shooting Carson in the face, police said.
The suspect turned over a silver Taurus .38-caliber six-shot revolver, according to police.
The identities of the suspect's two companions -- at least one of whom Kelly said left the suspect before the shooting -- are still not known.
On May 8, another gay man was assaulted by two men shouting anti-gay slurs as he left a bar in Manhattan's West Village, New York Police said.
