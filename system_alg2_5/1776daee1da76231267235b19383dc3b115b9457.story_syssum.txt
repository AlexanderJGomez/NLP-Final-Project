NASCAR driver Carl Edwards grew up in Columbia, Missouri.
He won a Busch Series Cup in 2007, finished last year's Sprint Cup Series in second, and is fiercely fighting for Sprint Cup honors this year.
"This park is one of Columbia's best secrets.
The park boasts 15 miles of trails and endless possibilities for adventure, from hiking and biking to canoeing and even cave exploration.
For what he calls the best burger in the world, he heads to Booches Billiard Hall, one of his high school hangouts.
We'd shoot pool, eat booch burgers and just have a good time," he said.
These are just some of the hidden gems of Carl Edwards' Columbia, but this town has much more to offer.
It's a perfect weekend getaway from its larger surrounding cities.
