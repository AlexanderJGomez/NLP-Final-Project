(CNN) -- Another State of the Union address, another road trip for President Barack Obama to push now-familiar policies that he said he would pursue on his own if Congress won't cooperate.
Obama heads to Wisconsin and Tennessee on Thursday, continuing a tradition of selling his policy prescription directly to the public after the ceremonial report to the nation.
He said what?
Last year, 53% of respondents in a similar poll rated their response to the 2013 address as very positive.
"Let's make this a year of action," Obama said.
The President also promised an executive order to raise the minimum wage for some government contract workers.
"We hope the President will join us in a year of real action -- by empowering people -- not by making their lives harder with unprecedented spending, higher taxes, and fewer jobs," she said.
On another major reform issue, Obama chided Republicans for trying to undermine his signature health care law that passed in 2010 without GOP support.
Obama said he will order the U.S. Treasury to create a new federal retirement savings account called MyRA, a savings bond that would guarantee "a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in."
Even as he cited a growing economy and increasing corporate profits, Obama said average wages have been flat.
Along with his order raising the minimum wage for workers on federal contracts, Obama asked Congress to get on board with a Democratic proposal to raise the federal minimum to $10.10 per hour.
