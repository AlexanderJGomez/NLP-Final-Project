(CNN) -- Western companies operating in Africa have long underestimated the continent's consumers, according to a top executive in one of the world's biggest consumer goods groups.
"What we now increasingly do is we think much more in terms of sub-clusters, where you have east Africa, where you have west Africa, where you have southern Africa," he said.
Instead, Nielsen says its seven types of consumers can be grouped in three tiers based on monthly income and average spending.
The growth in spending on consumer goods, telecoms and banking can turn Africa's consumers into an increasingly attractive business proposition, creating markets large enough to be appealing for multinational firms, said McKinsey.
"So certainly your products can be found in more places in Africa, so you expand your catchment area -- that to us is the real story of our growth in Africa at this moment."
