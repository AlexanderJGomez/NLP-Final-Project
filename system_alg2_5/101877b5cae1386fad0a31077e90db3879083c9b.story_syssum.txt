POPPY HARLOW, CNNMONEY.COM ANCHOR: We're gearing up to go two miles deep into one of the biggest gold mines in the country.
Here, in Barrick Gold's Cortez Mine in rural Nevada, more than one million ounces of gold were mined last year alone.
RANDY HAGER, GOLD MINER:Yes.
You can't see it.
HAGER: There's gold in this.
HARLOW: So, after the gold ore is mined, about 400 tons of it goes in massive trucks just like this one.
Of that, only four ounces is pure gold.
HARLOW: Barrick mines gold for around $300 an ounce, and gold is selling for record highs, around $1,400 an ounce.
HAGER: There's job security here with gold that high.
AZUZ: It's something people can play by day, and by knights.
Enjoy the Martin Luther King holiday, and we'll see you on Tuesday!
