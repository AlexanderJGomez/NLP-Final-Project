(CNN) -- Yemen's parliament on Saturday began debating proposed amendments to the country's constitution despite calls from the United States not to proceed with any planned action.
The ruling party has been in a dialogue with various political forces, the source told SABA.
The United States on Friday urgently called on Yemen "to delay parliamentary action" and asked all parties involved to return to the negotiating table.
According to Mohammed Albasha, spokesman for the Yemeni embassy in Washington, Saleh started a dialogue on the proposed amendments two years ago, but "coalition building efforts faced continuous hurdles and obstacles because of divisions amongst the opposition bloc.
According to Toner's statement, the United States welcomes "reports that President Saleh has decided to appoint a new team from the ruling party to re-engage with the opposition in a new effort to reach a mutually agreeable conclusion.
For that reason, we urgently call on all parties to delay parliamentary action and to return to the negotiating table to reach an agreement that will be welcomed by the Yemeni people as well as Yemen's friends."
