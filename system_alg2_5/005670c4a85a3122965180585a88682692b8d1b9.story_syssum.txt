(CNN) -- A rebel group in the Democratic Republic of Congo killed at least 321 civilians and abducted 250 others -- including at least 80 children -- in a previously unreported rampage late last year, Human Rights Watch said in a report released Saturday.
The LRA also killed those they abducted who walked too slowly or tried to escape, Human Rights Watch said.
The Congolese government denies that the LRA is still a serious threat in the country, which may have contributed to the absence of reports about the December massacre, Human Rights Watch said.
"It's as if we don't exist."
The two commanders who perpetrated the December massacre report to one of those indicted leaders, according to Human Rights Watch.
