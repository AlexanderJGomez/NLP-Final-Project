Fethiye Cetin, with her grandmother, said she felt deceived when she learned her origins.
"I felt deceived," she says.
According to the Armenian Patriarchate in Istanbul, in 1914 there were more then 2,000 Armenian churches scattered across what is now Turkey.
Every April 24, Armenians around the world commemorate the anniversary of what they call the "Armenian genocide."
"Regardless of whether 1,000 people were killed or one person was killed, it was still a human" says Cetin.
"Hrant Dink was defending democratization.
And at the same time Hrant Dink was destroying the taboos of the system," Cetin said.
But today, his surviving son is still defending himself in court for his father's genocide comments.
Twenty-eight-year-old Aris Nalci, one of the new generation of Armenian journalists in Turkey inspired by Hrant Dink, said he opposed a proposed resolution in the U.S. Congress to formally recognize the Armenian genocide, arguing it would only hurt U.S.-Turkish relations.
"And we are like orphans, stuck in between."
