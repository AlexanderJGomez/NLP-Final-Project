Even the terms used to name them -- Hispanics, Hispanic-Americans, Latinos, Latino-Americans, the Spanish-surnamed -- too tightly package the people categorized by those definitions, some observers say.
From a census standpoint, being of Hispanic or Latino origin means a person identifies himself in one of four listed categories: Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban or "other Spanish, Hispanic or Latino" origin.
But the broader terms -- Latino, Hispanic -- are the ones tossed about when the media want to discuss a "trend among Latinos," or when a politician appeals to the "Hispanic vote."
"That's the way you call our people," Susana Clar, 52, said of the terms.
He never uses Hispanic to identify himself because "I am mixed," Baez said.
"For me...there is no such thing as a Latino identity," said Suzanne Oboler, professor of Puerto Rican and Latino studies at John Jay College at the City University of New York.
There is "very definitely a Latino identity," Kravetz said.
So much so, he said, that he and others coined the term "new generation Latinos" to refer to them.
Chitel said this group of U.S.-born Latinos should be reached with culturally nuanced media, in the same way the African-American market functions.
And I don't say, 'I'm Hispanic or Latino, or I'm from Mexico,' because I'm not."
