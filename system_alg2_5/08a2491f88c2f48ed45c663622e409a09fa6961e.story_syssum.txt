It means England, who invented the game of cricket but has never won the World Cup, still hasn't been past the last eight stage of the one-day tournament since 1992.
"Pretty poor to be knocked out of a World Cup so early, it is very disappointing," Morgan said at the post-match presentation.
"Our expectations are much higher than this.
"It's a hollow feeling at the moment," Moores said after England's defeat.
England now face a dead rubber against Afghanistan on Friday while Bangladesh has cemented its place in the last eight.
