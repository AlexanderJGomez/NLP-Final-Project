Philadelphia (CNN)Hazel Donnelly was taking her husband to the doctor when they got a call that their apartment building was on fire.
Jen Leary, a former firefighter who founded the group, met with building residents and, once the fire was out, retrieved the animals.
Donnelly was thrilled to learn that Red Paw could provide free short-term care for Kramer.
Several years ago, Leary began working as a firefighter and American Red Cross volunteer.
How is my pet going to get medical care?"
Now, whenever the Red Cross responds to a disaster and discovers that an animal is involved, they call Leary.
Rescuing animals is only part of what Red Paw does.
Leary's home is the first stop for most animals that don't need immediate medical care.
"We want to make sure that they're starting off the right way."
"I cried when we were reunited," said Donnelly.
