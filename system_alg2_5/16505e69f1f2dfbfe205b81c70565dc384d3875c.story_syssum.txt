During a press conference at the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, Clinton said the United States is willing to serve as mediator in the disagreement, which began to simmer last month when Japan detained a Chinese vessel that collided with Japanese boats in the disputed waters.
China and Japan have historically laid claim to the islands, which lie between the two nations.
But the Chinese captain remains in custody, accused of ramming two Japanese boats with his vessel.
The China-Japan dispute parallels U.S. efforts to curb Chinese claims for territory in the South China Sea, out of fear the increasingly powerful Chinese military could seek to dominate Asian waters.
