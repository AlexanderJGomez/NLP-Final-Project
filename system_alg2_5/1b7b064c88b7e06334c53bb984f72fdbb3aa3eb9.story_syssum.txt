(CNN) -- After actress Mackenzie Phillips spoke about her sexual relationship with her musician father, online and telephone calls to an anti-sexual assault hot line surged.
The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, which calls itself the nation's largest anti-sexual assault organization, said it had seen an 83 percent increase in activity on its online hot line and a 26 percent increase on its telephone hot line after Phillips' interview with Oprah Winfrey aired last week.
At times, a victim may feel unable to tell other family members what's happening.
"Their sexual selves are damaged.
"
Father- or stepfather-daughter incest is the most common form, although it also occurs between mother and child, according to the National Center for Victims of Crime.
Humans "have an instinct for avoiding incest or inbreeding," said Debra Lieberman, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Miami (Florida) who researches incest.
"It also depends on his other mating opportunities," Lieberman said.
"It doesn't make you broken," Phillips said.
