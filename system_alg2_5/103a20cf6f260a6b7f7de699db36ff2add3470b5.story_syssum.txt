Hong Kong (CNN) -- Pro-democracy activists took their fight Thursday to the doorstep of Hong Kong's chief executive, sitting down outside his office gates to express their dissatisfaction with him and the central government in Beijing.
But tensions have risen after a late August decision giving Beijing control over the slate of Hong Kong chief executive candidates in 2017.
The activists are open to talks with Chinese or other Hong Kong leaders, but not with Leung, one of the movement's figureheads, Lester Shum, said Wednesday.
He demanded the chief executive step down by Thursday night, or else protesters will "occupy different important government buildings."
Suraj Katra, a CNN iReporter who works for a non-profit in the city, said late Wednesday that demonstrators "seemed exhausted" but still high-spirited, whether they were singing songs or applauding speeches.
Aside from that day, things have been relatively calm and peaceful and, outwardly, it seems like leaders on both sides want to keep it that way.
Hui Chun-tak, the chief superintendent of the police public relations branch, said at a joint police and emergency services news conference that although the protests remained calm, police would continue to monitor them to ensure public order and safety.
Cheung is among those wary of resorting to "very controversial" tactics like that one, expressing concern it may cause "conflicts" with the police and government.
But that doesn't mean they can't make a point.
Despite the huge turnout on the streets, not everyone in Hong Kong is behind the protest movement.
"The longer it goes on, the longer that these disputes -- that, in some cases, are splitting apart family members and friends -- the worst those relations are going to get," Watson said.
