A study has found nearly 200 new species of frogs in Madagascar.
"The diversity of species in Madagascar is far from being known and there is still a lot of scientific research to be done.
"To get an idea of its biodiversity --while in the Iberian Peninsula [there] are about 30 species of amphibians and in Germany about 20, in a single locality in Madagascar we can find around 100 species of frogs," said Vieites.
But the majority of life forms on Earth is still awaiting scientific recognition."
