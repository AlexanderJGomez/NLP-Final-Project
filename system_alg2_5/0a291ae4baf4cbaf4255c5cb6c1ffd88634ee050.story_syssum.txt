BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Half of Iraq's registered voters turned out for peaceful provincial elections this weekend, the election commission said Sunday.
The highest turnout -- 65 percent -- was in the Salaheddin province in northern Iraq, the commission said.
Saturday's voting also was seen as a referendum on the popularity of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki.
Observers believe the provincial vote will be a gauge of the country's political direction and an indication of how the parliamentary elections will turn out later this year.
There were no casualties.
