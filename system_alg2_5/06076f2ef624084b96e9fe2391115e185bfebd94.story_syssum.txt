Washington (CNN) -- North Korea has completed the structures at a second missile launch site in the northwest part of the country, a U.S. official said Thursday.
The official, who asked not to be named because the official was not authorized to speak on the issue, said the location of the facility allows North Korea to launch heavier payloads.
"It's a dual-use facility," said the official.
In April 2009, North Korea attempted a test to launch what they said was a satellite into space from its other launch site near Musudan-ri, in the northeast.
The launch was widely condemned.
