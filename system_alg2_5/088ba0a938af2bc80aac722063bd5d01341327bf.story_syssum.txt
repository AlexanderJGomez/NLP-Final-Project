There have been days of prayers and protests for Jahi McMath.
Doctors and a judge have declared her brain dead and said there's no chance Jahi will come back to life.
Children's Hospital Oakland spokesman Sam Singer said the hospital would comply with the order.
Attorneys for the family are filing a new complaint in federal court requesting a temporary restraining order and an injunction to prevent the hospital from disconnecting Jahi from life support, he said.
Before the surgery, Jahi said she was worried that she would never wake up, according to her uncle.
According to family members, Jahi went into cardiac arrest.
"The medical situation here in this case is that Jahi McMath died several weeks ago."
When asked about the girl's possible movement, the hospital spokesman, citing privacy laws, said he would not comment directly on any claims the family makes.
The case is "giving the impression that dead people can come back to life," Arthur Caplan, director of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center, told CNN last week
His report also says McMath showed no sign of breathing on her own when a ventilator was removed: "Patient failed apnea test."
Jahi's family has criticized the hospital's handling of the matter, accusing doctors of pressuring them to disconnect life support.
