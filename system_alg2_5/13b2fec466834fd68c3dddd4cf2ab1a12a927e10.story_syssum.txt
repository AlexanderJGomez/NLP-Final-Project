Fans of the show are buzzing about photos of Jon Gosselin apparently on vacation in Saint-Tropez, France, with a young woman who is definitely not his wife and reality TV co-star.
Given the media spotlight, dating coach Patti Feinstein said, it's not a good idea for Gosselin to be out with another woman so soon after the marital rift.
"Their whole TV show is based on them being parents and caring for all of these kids they have, and both of them seem totally wrapped up in themselves," Slotnick said.
"It is hurtful to children to think that their parents are dating when it is done so soon after a separation," Neuman said.
Neuman noted that parents going through a divorce can date privately but said they should also consider counseling before entering another serious relationship to guard against the high divorce rate for second marriages.
