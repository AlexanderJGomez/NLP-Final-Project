(CNN) -- The former stepson of singer Usher Raymond remained in critical condition in an Atlanta hospital Tuesday, four days after he was injured while riding in an inner tube at a north Georgia lake, his family said.
Investigators concluded that alcohol was not involved in the incident.
Kile's mother is Tameka Raymond, who was married to Usher for two years until their divorce in 2009.
