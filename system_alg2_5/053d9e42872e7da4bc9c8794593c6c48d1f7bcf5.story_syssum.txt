Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Documents showing that China offered to sell arms to Moammar Gadhafi in the waning days of his rule are "the real deal," a senior member of Libya's transitional government said Monday.
And Mohamed Sayeh, a member of the NTC, said Libya's new leaders have seen the documents.
China says it followed U.N. Security Council resolutions that banned the export of arms to Gadhafi's government.
"I tell the Libyan people not to surrender to the gangs and that the end is near," Ibrahim said late Monday.
The documents NTC officials were examining Monday detailed a trip by Gadhafi's security officials to Beijing on July 16 during which they met with four state-controlled weapons manufacturers, the newspaper reported.
The Chinese said they would replace the Algerian arms sent to Libya, the document said.
Sayeh said the NTC was amazed that the deal was discussed at a time when Gadhafi's forces were killing "thousands and thousands of Libyans, and it was done by two U.N. members" who signed the arms embargo.
Algeria will in the future recognize the NTC as the government in Libya, Algerian Foreign Minister Mourad Medelci told French radio network Europe 1 last week.
The Ukrainian Embassy in Tripoli and the ministry are rendering proper consular assistance to those arrested, the ministry said.
