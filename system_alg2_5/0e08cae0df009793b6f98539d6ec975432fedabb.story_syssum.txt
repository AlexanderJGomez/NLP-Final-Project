New York (HLN) -- It's racing season in America!
Many thousands of thoroughbreds end up being slaughtered for horse meat.
Despite the myth that they end up knee-deep in grass on some idyllic farm, the reality is that horses are very expensive to keep.
Some are dead on arrival.
Part of the problem is that the horse racing industry breeds for perfection.
Before that, the HSUS estimates 100,000 horses were being slaughtered every year in America.
It's time for compassionate Americans to send a wake-up call to their members of Congress and demand passage of legislation to end the wholesale slaughter of America's horses once and for all.
