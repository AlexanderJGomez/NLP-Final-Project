A report released Thursday details a nearly two-year Justice Department investigation which found that Cleveland police use guns, Tasers, pepper spray and their fists excessively, unnecessarily or in retaliation.
Officers also have used excessive force on those "who are mentally ill or in crisis," the Justice Department said.
After a 25-minute chase that reached speeds of more than 100 mph and ended in a school parking lot, 13 officers fired 137 rounds hitting Russell and Williams more than 20 times each, the report said.
Many officers were there, but none identified any fellow officers who had exacted excessive force on the suspect, and no officer was disciplined, the Justice Department said.
That's when the man, who the Justice Department reports identifies as "Mark," got angry, threatening the officer and trying unsuccessfully to stand up.
Mark had committed no crime, was strapped down and was in the midst of a medical crisis," the Justice Department report says.
The sign sends a message indicative of the community's opinion of the division, Justice Department officials said.
The results of the federal review come as the Cleveland Division of Police is under fire for the November fatal shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice.
Authorities say Cleveland police need better training and more accountability going forward.
"We will work to make this police department better," he said.
