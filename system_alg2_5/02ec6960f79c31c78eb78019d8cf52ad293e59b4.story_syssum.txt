A couple of weeks later, in July 2011, Pippen bought nicotine patches, started exercising and never looked back.
"I can remember looking at myself in the mirror thinking how wonderful it would be to just wake up one morning, healthy and physically fit."
Instead, the former Airman 1st Class went on a low-carb diet, remembering that his drill instructor had forbidden potatoes and bread when an overweight Pippen entered boot camp.
"I think when Kevin made the decision to get healthy, it made it easier for both of us -- that we both had to make time for exercise, and our eating choices had to be healthier."
In the first year, he lost 117 pounds.
Susan worried that once Pippen reached his goal, he would revert to his old habits.
Neither is worried about going back to their old lifestyle; they like the energy these healthy habits have given them too much to quit.
Pippen gave up his low-carb diet after the first year and has switched to calorie counting.
Pippen does kickboxing on Wednesdays and swims laps on the weekends, while Susan runs on the treadmill.
