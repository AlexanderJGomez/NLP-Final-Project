Nathaniel Nicholson, son of an infamous CIA double agent, faces his own spying charges.
The elder Nicholson pleaded guilty in 1997 to spying for Russia and is the highest ranking CIA officer ever to be sentenced for espionage.
Nathaniel Nicholson had complained to his father that he and his sister were short of money to pay for college, prosecutors said.
The FBI agents informed Nicholson that lying to them was a federal crime and offered him a "mulligan," or a chance to change his story, according to the agent's testimony.
