(CNN) -- As a child, Ranjan Avasthi was once bitten by the family's German shepherd.
He also knows that kids will be kids.
We all know that kids and pets can peacefully coexist.
Avasthi says.
Reinforce healthy interaction: Help kids understand how to safely approach a cat or dog.
"We sit with kids and talk about things dogs don't like and cats don't like," Collins says.
During subsequent sessions, kids watch videos of pets and gradually interact with an adult cat or dog.
"Then the child is not afraid and doesn't learn the wrong behaviors," Avasthi says.
Encourage a healthy respect for Mother Nature: "Educate kids that our house pets — even though domesticated and pets — they are animals," Avasthi says.
