"We are going to lose our distinctive way of life and identity if no one protests against the government plan," said lifelong Tai O resident Wang Waking, 51, who runs the Tai O culture workshop.
While the redevelopment celebrates Tai O's seafaring heritage -- in 1960, villagers caught 30% of all seafood sold in Hong Kong, according to the book "Tai O History" -- it comes in the wake of a 2012 Hong Kong law banning of commercial trawling.
"It wrecks my heart to see fishermen forced to sell their large trawlers," said a local fisherman surnamed Wong, who says he catches 70% less after the ban.
Besides tourism, real estate development could change the fortunes of the town, as Hong Kong has one of the world's most expensive real estate markets.
But villagers do all their real estate business by word of mouth to keep outsiders out of the property market, Wong said.
"Tai O has no job market at all.
He makes 30% less than a similar job in other parts of Hong Kong, but he enjoys the commute-free work.
Before tourists poured in, the only local job Lieu could find was temporary construction work.
"Tai O people have deep feeling for the mountains, rivers and wetlands surrounding us, because we live so close to nature," she said.
