(CNN)It was a very telling mini-scandal, the faux-fury over Michelle Obama's short visit to Saudi Arabia.
The presence of an American first lady on Saudi territory embodies the intense unease that surrounds U.S. and Western relations with the Saudi kingdom.
The United States wants to have good relations with Saudi Arabia, not only because it has a lot of oil, but because it is one of the most powerful countries in the Middle East and the two countries share many strategic goals.
The U.S. needs Saudi Arabia -- and Saudi Arabia needs the U.S.
Saudi law does not require foreign visitors to wear a hijab, the Muslim headscarf.
Countless prominent women have appeared in public meeting Saudi royals without wearing headscarves.
But it was not committed by the first lady or by King Salman.
The story made headlines because people in the United States and in the West feel a scandal in the relationship, because much of what goes on in Saudi Arabia is an affront not just to Western principles but to human rights conventions endorsed by most of the world.
Saudi women, who are intelligent, strong, competent, mature, capable of making decision for themselves as well as any Saudi man, are treated in many cases as if they were children.
Already 16 people have been beheaded this year.
So what is the United States to do?
A condolence call was not the time for public criticism, and Michelle Obama's presence in Riyadh was a meaningful sign that the United States believes women belong in the public sphere.
