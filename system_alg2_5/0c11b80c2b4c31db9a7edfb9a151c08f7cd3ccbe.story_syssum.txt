From the Swat Valley in the north to Sindh province in the south, as many as 15 million Pakistanis have been affected by torrential monsoon rains that have washed away villages and bloated rivers, authorities said Wednesday.
Many Pakistanis now face severe food shortages, and aid agencies stepped up appeals for global assistance.
For many parts of southern Pakistan, the worst is yet to come.
Gul, who set up a temporary stall on the road, said prices of fresh produce, including tomatoes and cucumbers, have doubled.
He has already lost work and money is tight, but with the cost of food soaring, he said he and his family will simply have to eat less.
Holmes said thousands of villages and at least 288,000 homes have been destroyed.
"From 5,000 to 50,000 per village, we have no way of counting.
"Millions more are expected to suffer from the combined impact of continuing torrential rains and unprecedented water levels in the rivers," Holmes said.
U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates on Wednesday authorized 19 Marine and Navy heavy-lift helicopters to Pakistan to relieve six U.S. Army helicopters that have been taking part in flood relief since Saturday.
Also Wednesday, Germany said it was increasing aid for flood victims to about $12.8 million.
"Whatever amount the U.S. will give as donation, we will give the government of Pakistan more."
Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari has taken much of the heat.
