(CNN)New federal law enforcement guidelines set to be issued Monday will expand protection from profiling, but won't apply to screenings at borders and airports, or in intelligence operations.
The new profiling guidelines apply to state and local law enforcement agencies when they are part of federal law enforcement operations.
DHS agencies, including federal air marshals, Homeland Security investigations, and the Coast Guard will be covered by the new policy.
The group Muslim Advocates also argued the new rules don't go far enough in protecting American Muslims from profiling by the FBI, Customs and Border Protection, and other law enforcement agencies.
