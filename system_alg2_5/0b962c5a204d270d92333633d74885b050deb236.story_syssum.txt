Why?
Awful.
Shapiro and the show's two other hosts -- Chris Dimino and Nick Cellini -- were fired Monday evening.
He's a hero in New Orleans not just for his play as a defensive back but, more recently, for his battle against amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a neuromuscular disease also known by its acronym ALS and as Lou Gehrig's disease.
Gleason also explained his struggles with, and triumphs over, the disease.
"The pressure is to try to do a good radio show, and that wasn't a good moment," Shapiro recalled.
Within hours, the radio station and its parent company had suspended Cellini, Dimino and Shapiro.
All three hosts have apologized on Twitter and personally to the Team Gleason foundation, as Gleason himself wrote on Facebook.
At the same time, he's personally shaken for his part in offending so many -- including Gleason, those fighting ALS and the city of New Orleans.
"And to make fun of those, it's an awful thing.
Those radio hosts were suspended, not fired.
The Atlanta saga would have ended better if the fired radio hosts, after being suspended for some time, had returned to talk about ALS with Gleason and raised money for the cause, said Thomas.
