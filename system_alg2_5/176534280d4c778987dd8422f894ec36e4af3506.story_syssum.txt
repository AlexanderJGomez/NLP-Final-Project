In June 2006, al-Zarqawi was killed in a U.S. strike.
Its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi said his group will now be known as Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant.
The 'L' stands for Levant which is a translation of "al-Sham" -- the word the group uses to refer to itself, Bergen said.
Khalidi said: "How you translate 'al-Sham' determines whether you have an 'L' or an 'S' in English.
ISIS is an English translation of  the acronym in Arabic for Al-Dawla Al-Islamiya fi al-Iraq wa al-Sham, or the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham.
CNN has been referring to the organization as ISIS, shorthand for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
When people in the Arab world, use the term DAIISH, it's derogatory, according to Columbia's Khalidi.
"Those who disagree with them, call them DAIISH," Khalidi said, adding that the jihadists have objected to the name.
