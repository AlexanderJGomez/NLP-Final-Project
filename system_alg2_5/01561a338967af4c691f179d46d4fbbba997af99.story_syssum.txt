Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- What was Hurricane Karl weakened Friday to a tropical storm after making landfall, but the heavy rain it spawned could still cause mudslides and flash floods in the Mexican interior, forecasters said.
Maximum sustained winds later weakened to around 70 mph (115 kph) with higher gusts, according to the Hurricane Center.
These winds will continue to spread inland along the track of the center tonight but should decrease rapidly as Karl weakens," the Hurricane Center said.
Within the past day or so, some 8 inches of rain has fallen in Veracruz, according to CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller.
Mexico's National System for Civil Protection issued a red alert, the highest level, for central and southern Veracruz.
A larger threat to south Texas will come from several inches of rain that could cause flooding and mudslides.
The area could see as much as 4 inches by Sunday, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in far southern Texas.
