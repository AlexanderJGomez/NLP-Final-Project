For her, and many decorators who contributed to this week's "inviting bedrooms" Open House assignment, the feel of bedding is important.
But she also pointed out that the pillows in said bag are "not always the softest material," and that matters a lot.
Pillows are key, decorators said, and they must be chosen carefully.
The calming, white master bedroom she decorated is "the most comfortable place for me in our home," she said.
"Don't do it!"
And according to the logic of most bedroom decorating schemes, designers say the bed and headboard are more important than the rest of the furniture.
"Whether it's a full bed frame or even just a pretty quilt hanging on the wall behind the bed, a headboard makes the room feel more finished."
CNN iReport head-honcho and home decor blogger Katie Hawkins-Gaar is similarly proud of the impact her DIY headboard has on her master bedroom.
"I recently moved the lamps in our bedroom to another room in the house, and we were with only an overhead light for a couple of months," she said.
Soft light makes a bedroom cozier, she said.
"I know for so many a TV in the bedroom is a big no-no, but I have to have a TV in the bedroom.
If you can swing it, no home office or TV in your bedroom."
