The flooding in Pakistan has been of epic proportions: 20 million people affected; more than 1,400 dead; 900,000 homes damaged; 3.5 million children at risk of waterborne diseases.

"Pakistan is seen to have done the international community the disservice of aiding and abetting terrorism, and this perception has almost certainly influenced people's willingness to dig deep into their pockets," Shaikh said.
"Unless Pakistan can show that it can be transparent, the international community will be wary of pumping in the kind of money that it needs at the moment," Shaikh said.
