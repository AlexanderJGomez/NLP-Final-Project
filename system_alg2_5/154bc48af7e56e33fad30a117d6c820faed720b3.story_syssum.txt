Baghdad (CNN) -- At least five people were injured when bodyguards for a top Iraqi official opened fire on stone-throwing Sunni demonstrators Sunday, the country's interior ministry said.
The deputy prime minister's bodyguards opened fire in an attempt to disperse the crowd as protesters hurled stones at the stage, Anbar provincial council member Suhaib al-Rawi told CNN.
The demonstrations were called by tribal leaders and Sunni scholars, protesting against what they decried as unjust practices of Maliki's government.
"We don't want your food, your water and your medicine," one scholar told the crowd.
"When we want to express an opinion, we have to do it in a civilized, humane and patriotic manner," he said.
