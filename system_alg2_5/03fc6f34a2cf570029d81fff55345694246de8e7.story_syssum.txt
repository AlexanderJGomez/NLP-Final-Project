The scientists said amphibians are the world's most threatened group of animals.
"Amphibians have so much to offer humans," said amphibian specialist Simon Stuart.
Andrew Blaustein, who began documenting amphibian declines two decades ago, said the loss of species was part of an overall biodiversity crisis.
"The long-term ecological repercussions of their decline could be profound, and we have to do something about it."
