(CNN) -- An official in Inner Mongolia is disputing an Amnesty International report that parts of the region are under martial law.
The Amnesty report said Chinese authorities declared martial law in some parts of the autonomous region in an apparent response to days of protests.
Amnesty reported that the drivers of the coal truck are both in custody of Chinese authorities.
Protesters say their culture is under threat as pastoral herders are pushed out from the grasslands and forced to move to the cities, or to places where animal grazing is not possible, according to Enghebatu Togochog, Director of the Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center.
