More than 30 years later, I still remember the awful day my mom told me my friend had passed away.
So many years later, the sorrow was just under the surface.
The experience left an indelible impression on me, one that I better understood after becoming a parent myself.
Amin Hassan took me to see the tiny burial site of her 1-month old daughter, Addison.
They had left Somalia in search of food and water, and felt relief when they finally reached the camp.
I thought of that unnatural order of parents burying their children.
Amin Hassan dug the grave for her daughter by herself.
