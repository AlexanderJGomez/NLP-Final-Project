Los Angeles (CNN) -- With a nod to the future, Sony paid tribute to the gamer and revealed new, power-packed and very bloody titles at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles on Monday.
Tretton said there will be 60 new titles for the Vita next year and PlayStation 1 titles will also be available for play on the handheld console.
Jessica Chobot, correspondent for G4TV's "Attack of the Show" said she was really impressed with the new game play for "Assassin's Creed III."
I'm a big RPG (role-playing game) fan so things that have a really good story for me carry more weight for me as a gamer," she said.
