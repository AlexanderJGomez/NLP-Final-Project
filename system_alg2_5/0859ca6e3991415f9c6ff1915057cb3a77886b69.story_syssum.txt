A dormitory is trashed after a riot at the California Institution for men, in Chino.
"The prison is still under a state of emergency," George Kostyrko, a spokesman for the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation told CNN, which means no visitors were allowed and the prison could not take any new inmates.
"The lockdowns will remain in effect until all the staff that we deployed to Chino from other areas go back home," Kostyrko said.
The facility has seven units, each of which houses about 200 inmates.
Most of the residential areas were badly damaged and some inmates were being temporarily housed in tents, the spokesman said.
