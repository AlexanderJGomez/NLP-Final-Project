Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- Twelve members of former Ivorian president Laurent Gbagbo's inner circle have been indicted for crimes relating to the post-electoral crisis that left over 3,000 dead.
NoÃ«l Dje, a representative of the Office of the Public Prosecutor, told CNN those indicted remain under arrest.
"According to our information, everything happened out of the blue yesterday, with no warning.
The members of the inner circle and the Gbagbos are being held under a colonial-era law that allows anyone considered a threat to national security to be kept under house arrest indefinitely.
Ouattara Sunday said he was extending an "olive branch" to former members of Gbagbo's party.
