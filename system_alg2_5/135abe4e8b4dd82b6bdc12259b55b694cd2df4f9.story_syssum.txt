Rather than having dinner with her husband, Walter E. "Eugene" Crum, she spent Thursday night mourning his violent death and taking over the job he held as sheriff of Mingo County, West Virginia.
It took two shots to kill Eugene Crum around noon Wednesday, as he sat in a parking lot near the Mingo County courthouse.
The suspect -- Tennis Melvin Maynard, 37 -- was in critical but stable condition Thursday at Cabell Huntington Hospital, said Rockel.
He "said some things to us" on his way to the hospital, West Virginia State Police First Sgt.
On Thursday, a source with knowledge of the suspect's past told CNN that Maynard had spent time at a state hospital for mental health issues within the past couple of years.
"He went crazy," Olgie Maynard told CNN, explaining her son hadn't been the same since he was involved in a workplace explosion five or six years ago in Alabama.

The man he allegedly killed, 59-year-old Eugene Crum, had been a county magistrate and a special investigator for the prosecutor's office before becoming sheriff in January.
His slaying has shaken the rural county, which normally sees only one or two slayings per year, said Lt. Randy Hatfield of the Mingo County Sheriff's Office.
In addition to Thursday night's candlelight vigil, a memorial service for Crum will be held late Saturday afternoon and his funeral will take place Sunday, both services at Mingo Central High School.
