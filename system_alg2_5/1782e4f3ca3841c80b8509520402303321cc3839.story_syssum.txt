Ryanair has complained to OFT about its ongoing row with the UK's Advertising Standards Authority.
Last week, Ryanair complained to OFT about its treatment by the ASA.
A Ryanair spokesman said the airline was not forced by the OFT to shut down its system as a punitive measure.
Aer Lingus met the new deadline, the OFT said, but Ryanair did not.
