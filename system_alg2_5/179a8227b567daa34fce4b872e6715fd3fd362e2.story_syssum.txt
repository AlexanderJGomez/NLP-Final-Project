2 executive, Sheryl Sandberg, might be worth as much as $1.6 billion.
How did she get the confidence to perform so well at such a high level?
And Maureen Dowd of The New York Times, echoing one of the most commonly held beliefs about why women don't have parity, wrote that women weren't fairly represented because they are afraid of being attacked and care too much about what others think.
They lack confidence.
As women, in many cases, the impulse to do something out of the norm of our peer group, like write an opinion piece or ask for a promotion, has simply never occurred to us.
Why should we?
We must see our peers and ourselves as leaders who have a right and a responsibility to weigh in on the matters of our day.
We can create more Sandbergs by surrounding ourselves with confident, outspoken women.
