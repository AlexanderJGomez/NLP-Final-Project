Washington (CNN) -- A Washington lawyer has filed a lawsuit in federal court, claiming he is the father of basketball star LeBron James.
A few months later, she told him she was pregnant, but did not say whether he was the father.
Stovell said he filed the suit two weeks ago because a statute of limitations was about to expire.
The lawsuit states Gloria James was 16 at the time of the alleged encounter, but Stovell said she told him she was in her early 20s.
Public records show Stovell is a former government attorney with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Federal court records show the case was settled when the commission paid him $230,000, while not admitting fault.
