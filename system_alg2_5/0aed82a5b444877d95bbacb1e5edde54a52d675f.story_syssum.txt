Hawking, on the other hand, has lived more than 40 years since he learned he had the disease, which is also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease in America and motor neuron disease, or MND, in the United Kingdom.
Bob Hawkins, 75, of Fayetteville, North Carolina, who learned of his ALS diagnosis last year, said Hawking, with his long life and ability to communicate through a voice synthesizer, gives him hope.
This empowerment theme is part of the mission of the ALS Association, she said.
People typically are between 40 and 70 when they learn they have ALS; Hawking found out at age 21.
ALS affects 350,000 people worldwide and up to 30,000 people in the United States, the ALS Association estimates.
Hawkins said he first experienced weakness in his legs and arms, typical symptoms of the disease.
People with ALS may also find it difficult to lift their arms or feet, Matland said.
Drugs in these trials include lithium, ceftriaxone, and memantine, according to the ALS Association.
In the UK, the MND Association is funding a trial for lithium, which has produced promising results in mice, Barry said.
Hawkins said he will be participating in the 2009 Fayetteville, North Carolina, Walk to Defeat ALS in May.
