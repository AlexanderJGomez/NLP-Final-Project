Investigators found a letter in the waste bin of his Dusseldorf, Germany, apartment saying that Lubitz, 27, wasn't fit to do his job, city prosecutor Christoph Kumpa said Friday.
They found no goodbye note or confession, authorities said.
According to authorities in Germany and France, Lubitz was a co-pilot on Germanwings Flight 9525 between Barcelona, Spain, and Dusseldorf on Tuesday when he apparently locked the captain out of the cockpit, then activated a control causing the plane to descend toward rugged terrain.
While the ailment Lubitz had sought treatment for hasn't been revealed, that he was declared unfit for work is an important detail, aviation analysts say.
Reuters reported that a German newspaper said Lubitz had been treated for depression about six years ago.
Rescuers have found bodies at the rugged crash site, but few of them are intact, Yves Naffrechoux, captain of rescue operations at Seyne-les-Alpes, told CNN.
There were five on Friday, Bloy said.
"Our focus in these darkest hours is to provide psychological assistance to the families and friends of the victims," said Thomas Winkelmann, a spokesman for the Germanwings executive board.
Lufthansa and other German airlines have already adopted the rule, the airline said.
