Bensalem, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- About 100 vehicles were involved in a series of wrecks on the eastbound Pennsylvania Turnpike just north of Philadelphia on Friday morning, injuring at least 30 people and causing a traffic backup for hours over parts of two counties, officials said.
Thirty people were hurt, including five with serious, but non-life-threatening injuries, Reed said.
Traffic was moving again in one affected section of the turnpike by 2 p.m., video from CNN affiliate KYW showed.
Pasco said she had stopped her car after she saw "cars bouncing off of the center divider."
Police told her that her wreck was about 3.5 miles behind the initial crash, she said.
