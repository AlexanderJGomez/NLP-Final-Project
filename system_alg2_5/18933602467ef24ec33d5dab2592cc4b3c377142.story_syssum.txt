The Dayton, Ohio, VA clinic is contacting 535 veterans who received treatment during an 18-year period from a dentist who admitted to not washing his hands or changing gloves between patients.
The center is offering free tests to those involved and the clinic will provide all necessary care and treatment without charge should a veteran test positive for the viruses, Sledge said.
Veterans could still receive care at other facilities, Sledge said.
More information and a list of labs in contractual agreement with the Dayton center is available by calling the VA's hotline at 1-877-424-8214.
