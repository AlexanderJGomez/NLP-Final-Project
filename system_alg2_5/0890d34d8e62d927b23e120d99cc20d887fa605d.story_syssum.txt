Her new job will be another first in Napolitano's career: She was the first woman valedictorian at the University of Santa Clara; the first woman to be elected governor of Arizona by popular vote; first woman to head the mammoth, sprawling and unwieldy Department of Homeland Security.
And now the first woman president of the nation's largest public university system.
In the process, she has overseen the maturation of that department's "one-size-fits-all" security approach to one that matches the strategy to the threat: intelligence-driven and risk-based.
Napolitano is not a limelight-seeker.
She has been was willing and ready to roll up her sleeves and work with all sides to construct an approach on immigration that works -- one that addresses both national security needs and immigrant potential.
Janet Napolitano is also one of the warmest and most caring individuals I know.
"[She] played a critical role in the Governor's Office," Napolitano wrote.
Napolitano has done exemplary work at the Department of Homeland Security, most of it away from the spotlight.
