Delta Air Lines Flight 2566 from San Francisco to Minneapolis diverted to Salt Lake City on Wednesday when a pregnant passenger went into labor during the flight.
"I was getting contractions about every minute almost immediately, which was really scary ..."  mother Allison Peery told CNN affiliate KTVX on Thursday.
It's not the first time this month that a pregnant passenger has diverted a flight.
Everybody was clapping."
Delta doesn't restrict the travel of pregnant passengers, but the airline does offer guidance about change fees on its website.
However, "air travel is not recommended at any time during pregnancy for women who have medical or obstetric conditions that may be exacerbated by flight or that could require emergency care."
