Introducing MS Turanor Planet Solar -- the world's largest solar-powered boat.
Led by University of Geneva climatologist Martin Beniston -- a member of a United Nations-backed panel on climate change that won the 2007 Nobel peace prize -- they used high-tech "vacuum cleaners" to measure aerosols (fine particles in the air) and winches which plunged 200 meters below the water.
It's not the first time the high-tech vessel has made headlines around the world.
But for such a futuristic-looking vessel, MS Turanor Planet Solar has an ancient-sounding name.
It may also prove to be the beginnings of an epic adventure -- this time on the high seas.
