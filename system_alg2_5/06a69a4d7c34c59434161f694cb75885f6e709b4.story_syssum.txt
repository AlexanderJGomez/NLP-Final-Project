The Pentagon unveiled plans Tuesday for fully integrating women into front-line and special combat roles, including elite forces such as Army Rangers and Navy SEALs.
More than 200,000 women are in the active-duty military, representing about 14.5% of the overall force, according to Pentagon figures.
Military leaders released individual plans for the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines and special forces on Tuesday, and said they would spend the next year or so evaluating how they should be carried out.
Services will evaluate cultural issues and physical demands associated with fully integrating forces and, in some cases, assessing the views of men who comprise the Rangers, SEALs and Army Green Beret units.
"I just want to see what happens," he said.
"There is an understanding that doing this right takes a period of time," said Juliet Beyler, who directs the officer and enlisted personnel management.
