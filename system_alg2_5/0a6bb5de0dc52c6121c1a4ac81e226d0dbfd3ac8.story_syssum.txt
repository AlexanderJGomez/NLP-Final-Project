Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigerian aviation authorities suspended Dana Air's operating license Tuesday as torrential rain hampered recovery efforts after a deadly weekend plane crash.
Dana Air's Flight 0992 slammed into a two-story residential building in a densely populated neighborhood of Lagos, Nigeria's largest city.
The pilot declared an emergency as the plane was on final approach to Murtala Muhammed International Airport, and witnesses said it appeared the plane was having engine trouble, said Oscar Wason, Dana Air's director of operations.
Also among the dead were six Chinese citizens who were on the plane, the Chinese Embassy in Nigeria said Monday.
Dana Air says its fleet comprises Boeing MD-83 aircraft.
