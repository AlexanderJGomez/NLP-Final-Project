Are you involved in your kid's school?
Alex has been in school for a week now.
A form also came home in Alex's kindergarten folder to sign up to be the class mom.
I don't have the time or desire to be that much of a super mom (for now), but I do want to be involved.
At all.
Or do I love it?
Are you involved in yours?
Kids get a kick out of seeing their parents at school, right?
When did you get involved and what's your experience been like?
