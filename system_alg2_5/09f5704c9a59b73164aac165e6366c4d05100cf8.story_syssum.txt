(CNN) -- An Australian pilot landed a company plane in the ocean off Darwin on Friday, in a water landing that prompted comparisons to last month's landing of a US Airways jet in New York's Hudson River.
"It's essentially a good story," Blyth said.
The plane's trajectory took it over the water, giving the pilot limited opportunities to ditch the plane on land, Blyth said.
"Sully" Sullenberger was hailed as a hero for landing the plane safely and ensuring that all 155 people on board survived.
"The correlation for a water landing is as close as it gets," he said.
