Helg Sgarbi has admitted blackmailing Germany's richest woman, Susanne Klatten.
We asked him about where the money is, about accomplices and videos... and he refused to say anything about that," Winkler said.
At the time, her spokesman, Joerg Appelhans, told CNN that Sgarbi's goal had always been to con her.
