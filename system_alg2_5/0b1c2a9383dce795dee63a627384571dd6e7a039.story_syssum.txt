Russian authorities insist that is not the case.
But in November 2010, Shuster said, Navalny "blew the whistle" on what he said was a $4 billion embezzlement scheme at the state-run oil pipeline operator Transneft -- a claim vigorously denied by the head of the company and Russian president Vladimir Putin.
Navalny presented "a serious political challenge as a result of his unique personality and his amazing energy," she said.
"He's become a popular figure but he cannot be described as the leader of the opposition," she said.
These people steal billions.
Lipman said she also believed the verdict was politically motivated.
Russian authorities have always insisted Navalny's prosecution is not political.
When Navalny arrived in court the day after his conviction, he found the prosecutor who had argued he should be sent to prison arguing instead for his release pending appeal, so that he could continue campaigning for the Moscow mayoralty.
But she said any political involvement would be denied by the government.
The idea is that now he is at large up until his lawyers send in an appeal in a higher court re-examine his case.
Speaking to reporters outside court after he was released, Navalny said he would return to Moscow to discuss his next steps with his staff, RIA Novosti said.
Once in Moscow, he will decide whether to boycott the election or continue his campaign, he said, according to the news agency.
"The minority of more modernized urban Russians -- people who resent the government for being lawless -- people likely to sympathise with Navalny -- I think they will be even angrier.
"Navalny's prosecution is meant to silence a leader and messenger," she said.
Not on previous occasions and not this time."
