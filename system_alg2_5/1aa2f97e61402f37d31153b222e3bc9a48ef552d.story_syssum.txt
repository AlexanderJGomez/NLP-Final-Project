But right now, I am struggling and I thought a little bit of crowd sourcing with the highly intelligent men -- and especially the women -- who visit CNN.com might help.
Not least thanks to media interest and a host of events, at which it has been snapped up variously at gatherings for students, business people, football fans, environmentalists and political activists, it has gone within four days of publication to Number 1 in the UK hardback non-fiction charts.
So what is the problem as I look down from the top of the Sunday Times charts at those reviewers who said it was awful?
At every single one of the nine or so events I have so far done about the book, and in several of the many interviews, I have been asked -- usually but not always by a woman -- a version of this same question: "Do men and women win in different ways?"
rather than the one I had been asked, "do men and women win in different ways?"
But moderator Ren√© Carayol clearly didn't agree and handed his microphone to Fiona to ask her for her view.
At my next event, a Labour fundraiser, thankfully neither Fiona nor Grace could make it.
You can't win, said I.
This question has come up everywhere I have been.
And the next time I sit down with CNN's woman winners, Christiane or Becky, I need to have a better answer than the ones I have been deploying thus far.
