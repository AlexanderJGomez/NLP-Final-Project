Washington (CNN) -- A company dispatcher who was seated in the cockpit jump seat as Southwest Airlines Flight 4013 landed at the wrong Missouri airport has been placed on paid leave pending the outcome of the investigation, the company told CNN on Tuesday.
Under an FAA regulation known as the "sterile cockpit" rule, pilots must restrict all conversations to flying-related matters when planes are taking off and landing.
The NTSB plans to interview the pilots and the dispatcher in the coming days, Holloway said.
At one point, after a government investigation disclosed widespread abuse of the privilege by air traffic controllers, the FAA halted the program.
No one was hurt in Sunday's landing on the airport's relatively short runway.
If the plane had overshot the end of the runway it could have tumbled down an embankment and onto U.S. Highway 65.
