When the first CD player was released that same day, it was described as a "new digital record player, using laser beams" by United Press International.
The first test CD was Richard Strauss's "Eine Alpensinfonie," and the first CD actually pressed at a factory was ABBA's "The Visitors," but that disc wasn't released commercially until later.
Because getting a new player and replacing an entire music collection was costly, audio manufacturers were savvy enough to market the first CD players to classical music fans, who were more likely to care about sound quality and have extra disposable income.
Some will still argue that records sound better than CDs, but that is only plausible when people take meticulous care of their albums, listening to them in scratchless, snap-crackle-and-pop-free condition.
The first compact discs could hold up to 74 minutes of music (the rumor was that the length of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony established that standard) or at least several songs more than a vinyl LP.
Listening to music on a CD was easier -- there was no standing up to flip over the record or tape, less time spent searching for the song you wanted to hear right then.
Even so, CDs are gradually being overtaken by digital files.
Like CDs before them, this new format is changing both the creation and consumption of music.
Katz doesn't think CDs and physical music storage will ever vanish altogether.
That explains why vinyl sales are up, often among young hipster types who weren't even alive when vinyl was the dominant medium.
