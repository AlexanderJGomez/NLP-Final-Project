(CNN) -- A grand jury has brought felony charges against three Dallas, Texas, police officers who were caught on patrol car dashboard cameras beating a motorcyclist after a chase, prosecutors said Thursday.
An internal investigation found that Bauer and Randolph disregarded an order to stop the chase, with one of the officers saying, "Keep us going.
Randolph beat Collins with his baton after Collins dropped to all fours, and Bauer began hitting and kicking him, police said.
After seeing the video, police dropped the resisting arrest charge.
