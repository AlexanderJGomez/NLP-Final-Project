Alice Schroeder says investor Warren Buffett has become a symbol of stability in American business.
Alice Schroeder got Buffett's cooperation in writing her new book, "The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life" (Bantam Books).
Schroeder estimates she spent about 2,000 hours with Buffett and interviewed 250 people for the book.
What he really likes to do is run Berkshire Hathaway, and he's not going to let anything take him away from that.
CNN: You make clear that in the 1990s tech boom, Wall Street turned away from Buffett and there was some criticism of him.
...
He always says, don't sell into a panic, don't let the fear and the emotions of the market change how you feel.
...
Schroeder: No, he's a handicapper -- big difference.
Schroeder: He is somebody who can be very tough in business and very impersonal, including with people he likes.
But when he was in junior high, he was a shoplifter.
He was criticizing Wall Street and saying if you want to make a lot of money, hold your nose and go to Wall Street, and at the same time he was already there.
Schroeder: You've got an economy in which financial intermediaries who don't add anything to the economy ... have in the past two decades stripped off huge amounts of fees, particularly buyout funds, and hedge funds and funds of funds, and he's very, very critical of the amount of fees that have been taken out.
So they're getting paid these huge amounts of money as an incentive to stay and then they get paid the consolation prize when they get fired.
Schroeder: That people should think for the long run and make their personal decisions for the long run and build a margin of safety into their lives as best they can.
And be realistic about what you can afford, because having a financial cushion means you can sleep at night, and that's worth more than a big-screen TV.
