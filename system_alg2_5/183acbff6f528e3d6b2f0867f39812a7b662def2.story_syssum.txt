(CNN) -- Olympic officials discounted an e-mailed threat to the upcoming Winter Games in the Russian city of Sochi on Wednesday, but the reported warning raised new concerns about security at the events.
Nagy said the Hungarian Olympic Committee had shared the letter with the organizers of the Sochi Winter Olympics as well as the IOC.
The U.S. Olympic Committee also received the message and sent it "to the appropriate authorities," committee chief Scott Blackmun said.
But Russian authorities are aware of those threats and are planning accordingly, he said.
McCaul, who has been in Sochi to assess the security situation, said cooperation between U.S. and Russian security teams was good, but there was room for greater intelligence sharing.
he said.
Besides U.S. security officers deployed through the diplomatic security service, Olympic teams themselves are also hiring private security teams, he said.
"We are all very hopeful these will be safe and protected Games," he said.
As for Sochi, Russia has "devoted more resources to security than frankly I've ever seen," Giuliani said.
I guess you could ... (but) the minute you hold the Olympics in a place, whether it's Salt Lake City or it's Rio de Janeiro or it's London, you have actually brought all the world's problems to you," he said.
