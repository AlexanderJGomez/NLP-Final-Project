(InStyle) -- On August 25th, Claudia Schiffer -- the youngest of the crop of so-called "original supermodels" who made their mark on fashion in the late 1980s and early 1990s -- will turn the big 4-0.
Then: Discovered at 15 while window-shopping in London's Covent Garden, Campbell quickly went from being an in-demand catwalk star to posing for numerous magazine covers, many of which had never before featured a black model.
Ten years later, she lost a number of major runway bookings when she suddenly swapped her then-shoulder-length hair for a boyish, close-cropped style, but her ever-changing 'do eventually became her trademark.
She's also launched a skincare collection, called (of course) "The Body," and recently became the host of "Britain's Next Top Model."
This year, Turlington -- who's married to actor/director Ed Burns -- released a documentary, "No Woman No Cry," about at-risk pregnant women around the world and co-starred with models Karen Elson and Natalia Vodianova in Louis Vuitton's Fall 2010 campaign.
