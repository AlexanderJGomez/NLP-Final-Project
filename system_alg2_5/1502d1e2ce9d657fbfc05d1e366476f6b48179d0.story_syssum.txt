It was hurtful," said Danielle, who remembers thinking that her co-workers at the bank must wonder how a mother could steal her child's money.
"Those mothers can have many needs themselves, and the one person who can fulfill those needs is that child," says Alicia Salzer, a psychiatrist and the author of "Back to Life: Getting Past Your Past With Resilience, Strength, and Optimism," a book about how people can overcome trauma.

"To these girls, normal is something that looks like a Disney film," says Salzer.
Her mother, Regina, was addicted to crack when she became pregnant.
"Being honest with you, I told Danielle I didn't want her even when I was pregnant, but I'm glad I didn't get rid of her.
Danielle went to college; her mother went to jail.
Danielle bought her a car, and Regina got drunk and had an accident.

She didn't give me up for adoption," said Danielle.
My husband and I started the Soledad O'Brien Brad Raymond Foundation two years ago to help promising girls who were future leaders.
