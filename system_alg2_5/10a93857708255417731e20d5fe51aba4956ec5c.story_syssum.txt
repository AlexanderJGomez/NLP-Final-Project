Santos said he has been thinking about the possibility of peace ever since the FARC's military commander was killed in 2010.
Peace talks between the rebels -- the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC -- and the government have occurred sporadically since the 1980s.
Yet, the president has said their will be no cease-fire while the two sides are in talks, though the rebels have said they would ask for one.
And that's why there's no cease-fire, no decrease in our military operations, and my government agenda will continue as it was until then."
"President Obama welcomes President Santos' deep commitment to working for peace and recognizes the courage and sacrifice of successive Colombian governments -- and most especially of the Colombian people -- in achieving this milestone," the White House said in September.
