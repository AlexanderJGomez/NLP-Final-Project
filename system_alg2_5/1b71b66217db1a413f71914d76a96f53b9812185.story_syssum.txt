ISIS had demanded her release, threatening to kill two hostages if Jordan didn't comply.
The online posts, which CNN could not verify independently, appeared four days after an ISIS video demanded that the Japanese government pay $200 million within 72 hours for the hostages' release.
"They are just demanding the release of their imprisoned sister Sajida al-Rishawi," the voice said.
In 2006, al-Rishawi was sentenced to death, but that same year, Jordan imposed a moratorium on the death penalty.
She told Jordanian authorities that her husband taught her how to use her explosives belt.
Jordanian authorities at the time said the attacks were orchestrated by the terrorist group al Qaeda in Iraq, which was led by Jordanian-born Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.
ISIS started in 2004 as al Qaeda in Iraq with the aim of creating an Islamic state across Sunni areas of Iraq and in Syria.
Muasher said Jordanian authorities had information that al-Rishawi's husband "asked her to step out of the room" when her explosives failed to detonate.
"There were women, men and children."
