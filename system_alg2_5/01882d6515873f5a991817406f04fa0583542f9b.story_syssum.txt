Sabrina Boyd says terrorism allegations against her husband, Daniel, and two sons are false.
Officials identified three of the men as U.S. native Daniel Patrick Boyd, 39, -- who according to the indictment had fought against the Soviets in Afghanistan -- and Boyd's sons, Dylan Boyd, 22, also known as "Mohammed," and Zakariya Boyd, 20.
Sabrina Boyd, the wife of Daniel Patrick Boyd and the mother of the two younger Boyds, said the allegations against her family are false.
"He said, 'They're innocent, the truth will come out.'"
She said authorities took her, her daughter and pregnant daughter-in-law to the hospital, where she learned that her husband and sons had not been in a car accident.
According to the indictment, Daniel Boyd and his sons left the United States for Israel in June 2007 to "engage in violent jihad, but ultimately returned to the United States after failing in their efforts."
Sabrina Boyd said her husband flew to Israel in 2007 with Zakariya after Luqman's death.
The newspaper reported in October 1991 that the brothers and their families had moved to Peshawar to work with a Muslim relief agency.
