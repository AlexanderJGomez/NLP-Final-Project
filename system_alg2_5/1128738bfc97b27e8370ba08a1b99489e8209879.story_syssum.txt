While President Barack Obama has relaunched a massive public relations effort for the Affordable Care Act, Republican opponents to the law have also implemented a relaunch of sorts.
The troubled roll out of Obamacare has also forced the President to delay multiple important components of the law, including the insurance marketplace for small businesses and the requirement that businesses with 50 or more employees provide their workers with health insurance or face fines.
Instead, Republicans have gone to great lengths to promote the negative aspects of the law by launching their own public relations campaign.
"It's all negative," Tanner said of the Republican strategy.
"As the law is being implemented, millions are either losing health care or having premiums go up, and Republicans want to make sure that everyone recognizes that."
That has caused Republicans to move away from their blanket calls for repeal to highlighting problems with the law.
"They don't have to go down the legislative road to defund Obamacare at this point because it didn't work," Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said.
And the President still has time.
Republicans might have realized that the defund or repeal argument is not politically advantageous as it is associated with the right-wing elements of the party.
Bonjean said Republican incumbents shouldn't be worried about primary challengers if they drop the repeal argument in the halls of Congress because they can still espouse it on the campaign trail.
Regardless if Republicans continue to shelve the repeal argument, Tanner said repeal will never happen.
On the other hand, if the law is successful and voters are pleased, the law is unlikely to be rolled back.
