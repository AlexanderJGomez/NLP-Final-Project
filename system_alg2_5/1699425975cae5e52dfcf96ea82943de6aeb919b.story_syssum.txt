LONDON, England (CNN) -- An American professor doing research in London stumbled across a series of previously unknown letters written by, to, and about Benjamin Franklin, a stunning find that sheds new light on early U.S. history.
"The first item was a letter from Benjamin Franklin to the secretary of the governor of Maryland, and I looked at it and I started to read, and I thought, 'This doesn't look familiar,'" Houston told CNN.
The letters cover Franklin's success in dealing with British Gen. Edward Braddock, who had been sent to Pennsylvania in 1755 to defeat the French at Fort Duquesne, in modern-day Pittsburgh.
Franklin went all over Pennsylvania trying to persuade farmers to lend their horses and wagons to Braddock and his men.
Eventually, Franklin managed to get the farmers to agree, and within weeks, Braddock and his men were on the march.
Houston said he believes the documents he read at the British Library are copies of that collection.
Birch's transcripts were filed in the British Library as "Copies of Letters relating to the March of General Braddock."
They form part of the massive Birch Collection containing the hundreds of volumes of his copies that Birch bequeathed to the library on his death, said Shaw.
