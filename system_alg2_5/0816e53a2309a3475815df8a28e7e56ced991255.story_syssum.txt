The sport-crazy country's national team has been humiliated during the Ashes series against an England side they would once routinely embarrass.
But his absence could mark a wholly different watershed: his replacement, 24-year-old Usman Khawaja, is set to become the first Muslim to play for the Australian national cricket team.
As many as 50 Iraqi and Iranian Kurdish immigrants died when their boat sunk off the coast of Christmas Island last month, an Australian territory that holds thousands of failed asylum seekers in detention camps to prevent them entering the mainland.
But for some, the emergence of Khawaja can have a far wider impact than leveling what has been a disastrous Ashes series for Australia.
