My-Linh Bui, American Airlines spokeswoman, said the problem was apparently a bird strike.
None of the 236 passengers or 15 crew members was injured.
Everything from a wood thrush to a barn swallow has tangled with airplanes there.
Of those, only one resulted in any notable problem.
Everyone was rescued.
