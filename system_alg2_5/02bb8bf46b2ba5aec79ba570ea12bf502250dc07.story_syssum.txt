(CNN) -- Within minutes of the news of his death, the backlash started.
Mandela was branded a communist by the white apartheid government, which made it a crime to be one.
The Cold War between the United States and the Russian Soviet Union was in full swing.
Then the government banned the communist party and the African National Congress, which fought for the freedom of black South Africans.
Not really, believes South African historian Sampie Terreblanche.
"The ANC is not a communist Party," he said.
At the time that Umkhonto we Sizwe carried out its first attacks, Mandela was at its helm.
Police intercepted the plan and arrested Mandela and other ANC leaders.
"I think it's a very naÃ¯ve plan with very little outlook for success," the former professor of political science at the University of Cape Town said.
Umkhonto we Sizwe beat the war drum against the "white supremacy" and "the white state."
"Umkhonto we Sizwe is a new, independent body, formed by Africans, It includes in its ranks South Africans of all races," the group said in its manifesto.
At a sports match in 1995, as President, Mandela made a gesture of support to white South Africans that drew gasps.
The crowd began chanting his name.
