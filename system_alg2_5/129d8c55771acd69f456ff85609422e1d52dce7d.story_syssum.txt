Enter the Powerbag, a line of battery-equipped shoulder bags and backpacks made by RFA Brands.
I tested the Powerbag messenger bag for about a month, and I also spent a brief time using the backpack, which is very similar.
The battery is stored in a zippered pocket at the bottom of the bag.
Now I need to charge my shoulder bag, too?
An iPod can be tucked into one zippered pocket while a BlackBerry can go into another, each filling with juice simultaneously.
A standard USB port is hidden in the battery pouch, so perhaps buying a USB-to-laptop charging cord would do the trick.
The RFA spokesman said this was only an issue with pre-production models, like the one I tested, and that it's been fixed for the bags sold in stores.
The Powerbag, designed by Ful, is stylish as well as useful, making it a good companion for gadgetheads who don't want to advertise their geekiness.
