Robert Lewandowski, the Poland striker, was already one of the most feared forwards in European football before his took the field.
"It was a great game by my team.
Go back to the strong first 25 minutes'."
Forget that Real, boasting the mercurial talent of Cristiano Ronaldo, failed to produce their normal level of performance.
Alongside the fleet footed Marco Reus, the pair tore into a Real side which looked anemic inside the red hot atmosphere of the Westfalenstadion.
Just seven minutes had elapsed when the wonderfully talented Reus danced his way through the Real defense, before unleashing a rasping effort which was parried away by Diego Lopez.
But whatever Klopp said to his side at the break worked a treat as they produced one of the most enthralling second half displays in recent times.
That fourth goal was not far away, however, and when Xavi Alonso fouled Reus inside the penalty area, Lewandowski stood up to power home from 12-yards.
"I think Dortmund were the best team by far," Real boss Mourinho told Sky Sports.
"They won every individual battle on the pitch, they were stronger physically and mentally so I think they deserve it.
"We know everything about Robert Lewandowski, every detail possible and we lost him in three goals.
They are a great side."
