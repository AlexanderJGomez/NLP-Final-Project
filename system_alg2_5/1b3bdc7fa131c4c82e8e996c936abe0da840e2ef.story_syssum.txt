(CNN)Noelle Velentzas, 28, couldn't understand why U.S. citizens like herself were traveling overseas to wage jihad when they could simply "make history" at home by unleashing terrorist attacks, according to a federal criminal complaint unsealed Thursday.
Velentzas and Siddiqui did not enter pleas when they appeared in federal court in Brooklyn on Thursday.
In the past 18 months, the Justice Department's National Security Division has prosecuted or is prosecuting more than 30 cases of people attempting to travel abroad to join or provide support to terrorist groups.
"Given how the terrorist threat to the world is evolving, how the potential terrorist threat to our nation is evolving, homeland security is becoming a matter of 'hometown security,'" Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson told reporters Thursday.
Velentzas and Siddiqui repeatedly expressed support for violent jihad, the complaint said.
Velentzas described the late al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden as one of her heroes.
In February, Velentzas and the undercover agent drove past a Home Depot in Queens.
In a statement, Islamic Circle of North America said Velentzas was formerly homeless and provided shelter by the relief organization.
Velentzas appeared to have experienced hardship in her life but was "working towards self-development and long-term stability," the statement said.

The two U.S. citizens were charged in criminal complaints filed in U.S. District Court of the Northern District of Illinois with one count each of conspiring to provide material support and resources to a foreign terrorist organization.
In February, three New York men were arrested and accused of a failed attempt to join ISIS in Syria, prosecutors said.
