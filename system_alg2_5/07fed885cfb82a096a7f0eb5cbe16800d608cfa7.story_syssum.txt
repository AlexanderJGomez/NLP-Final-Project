Hewlett-Packard certainly is.
Consider two Stanford neighbors of Hewlett and Packard Halls -- Gates Hall and the Huang Center.
The tech job market is excellent for younger workers, but many of those who are laid off and over 35 will find the market less welcoming.
The HP layoff will consist disproportionately of older workers.
Yet he, too, got caught up in a huge layoff, and could find engineering work only sporadically afterward.
Those who survive this round of HP layoffs will likely find themselves being asked to not only do their own jobs, but also those of the departed.
Unlike Livermore's explicit position on cheap labor, former HP CEO Carly Fiorina said that HP offshores work because the American educational system doesn't develop good math skills in its students.
Probably so, but the message here is that engineers, like many others, will have to get used to a life of layoffs in a globalized economy.
