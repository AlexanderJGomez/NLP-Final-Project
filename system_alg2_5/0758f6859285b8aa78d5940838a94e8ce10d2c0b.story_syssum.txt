(CNN) -- A month before Delvin Barnes grabbed a woman off a street in Philadelphia, he hit a teen with a shovel in Virginia and stuffed her into the trunk of a car, authorities say.
Like in Philadelphia, the abduction in Virginia was brazen.
Though police did not release many details of the Virginia incident, authorities say the victims didn't know the suspect.
She was taken to the home of the suspect's parents in Charles City County, where she was sexually abused, authorities said.
The mother says Barnes allegedly told her daughter that he was going to kill her.
A man then got out and met Freeland-Gaither at an intersection, Philadelphia police Chief Inspector Dennis Wilson said.
Then her abductor pounced.
(It) really was horrific to watch it unfold," Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said.
He's pure evil.
A car dealer identified Barnes from the videos and alerted authorities that he had placed a GPS device in the suspect's car because of concerns about his bad credit, authorities said.
Barnes was told the device was in the car, Schwartz said.
