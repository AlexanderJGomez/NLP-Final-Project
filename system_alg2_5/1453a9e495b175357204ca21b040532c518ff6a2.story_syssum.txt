Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- For years, small groups of Cuban dissidents have taken their demands to the streets, calling for political freedom as they get pushed around and shouted down by swarms of government supporters.
The 54-minute video was posted on the video-sharing website Vimeo by someone identified only as "Coral Negro" and has since appeared on dozens of blogs, many of them critical of the Cuban government.

According to the leaked video, the Cuban government's fear is that U.S.-backed dissidents will use social networks like Twitter and Facebook to incite unrest.
"What can be a threat is the person behind the technology, in the same way it can be an opportunity for us to do something with it."
Dozens of pro-government blogs have also appeared, many of them written by journalists who work for state-run media.
"They have their bloggers and we have our bloggers," the unidentified man in the video says at one point.
Cuba currently accesses the internet via expensive satellite connections.
