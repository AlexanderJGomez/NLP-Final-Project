Before May 26, BP used 25,689 gallons a day of the chemical dispersant Corexit.
Gulf Coast environmentalists say it's another sign that the federal agencies monitoring dispersant use are not being tough enough with BP.
The directive states that BP must ramp down dispersant use by "75 percent from the maximum daily amount used."
The EPA and Coast Guard say they're trying to keep dispersant use to around 18,000 barrels a day.
"The EPA-Coast Guard directive has been successful in ensuring that BP uses the lowest volume of dispersant necessary," U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Erik Halvorson, a spokesman with the Unified Area Command.
