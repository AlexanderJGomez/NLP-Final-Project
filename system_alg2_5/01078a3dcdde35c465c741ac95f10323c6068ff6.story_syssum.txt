"I remember saying to the police officer, 'He is one of us,'" Richter said.
And Army investigators said Wednesday that the gunman still had 177 rounds on him when he was shot by police.

No," Munley said.
Munley said she exchanged fire with the gunman and was injured herself.
After she was wounded three times, Munley was on the ground and her police weapon "malfunctioned," she testified.
He did not shoot her again and Munley said he appeared to be having problems with his own weapon.
During the period of the final shots, Todd made repeated calls for Hasan to drop his gun.
Army Criminal Investigation Division officer Duane Mitchell said 177 unexpended rounds were recovered from Hasan in both 30- and 20-round magazines.
The prosecution said it planned to complete presenting its case on Thursday.
The defense has been told it can take up its case November 8.
