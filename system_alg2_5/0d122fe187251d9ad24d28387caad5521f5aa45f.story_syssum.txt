The MD-82 was carrying 162 passengers, four non-working crew members and six working crew members, Spanair said.
The aircraft was carrying seven passengers from Lufthansa Flight 2554, according to the airline.
Barajas Airport closed after the crash but reopened more than two hours later, allowing a limited number of takeoffs and landings, an airport official said.
The fatal crash was the first at the airport since December 1983, when 93 people were killed as two Spanish airliners collided.
