The main "downs" of buying a used car are that it's a used car, not new -- so there's no new car warranty and you are more vulnerable to used car problems that could cost you money, as well as aggravation.
CPO used cars are usually clean and well-maintained -- the "cream puffs" of the used car market.
Do a "background check" for indications that the particular used car make/model you are considering might be a problem car: One with an unusual record of either recalls or consumer complaints.
Have a third-party mechanic (not one working for the dealer) look the used car over as a condition of sale.
It can cost hundred of dollars (or more) to repair a used car that fails either state safety or vehicle emissions testing -- and in many cases, you can't legally register or drive that used car until it does pass.

Though it requires the driver to stop the vehicle, get out and manually engage the front hubs by rotating a knob in the center of each front wheel, these 4x4 systems tend to be more durable and problem-free in the long haul than the electronic/automatic hubs used on most new pickups.
Excellent used car resale value and top of its class occupant protection are additional reasons to consider an Odyssey.
Siennas are offered in a variety of configurations, including models with full-time all-wheel-drive (AWD).
