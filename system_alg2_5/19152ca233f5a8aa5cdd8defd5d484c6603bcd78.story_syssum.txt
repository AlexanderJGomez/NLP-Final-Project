"That's my favorite part of the circus," Dutch photographer Wiesje Peels said.
Her father traveled Europe as a one-man show, "Theatro Picollini," performing at hospitals and amusement parks.
Starkly different from her father's small production, the circus boasted multiple tents and more than 100 performers.
The images capture a "glimpse of the hidden life of the performing artist."
He emanates an "unavoidable authenticity," Peels says.
"There's the home life and the artist life," Peels says.
"So do you."
