"All the residents of neighborhoods near Jintilo have fled into the city due to the ongoing battle between troops and Boko Haram gunmen who want to enter the city," said Modu Zannari, who lives nearby.
The hostages had been held in two Boko Haram enclaves since a January 6 raid on the village of Katarko, 20 kilometers from the state capital, Damaturu, in which 218 women and children were abducted, according to sources.
The hostages were released after they declined to fight alongside Boko Haram, which branded them infidels, said a local politician from Katarko.
Several Boko Haram fighters were killed in that raid; scores of others were arrested and an arsenal was seized, according to vigilantes.
