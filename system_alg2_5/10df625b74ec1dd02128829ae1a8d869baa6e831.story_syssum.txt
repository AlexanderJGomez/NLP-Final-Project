(CNN) -- A property dispute between family members apparently led to a shooting in which a man killed two people in the central Virginia town of Louisa before he was shot by police, authorities said.
The incident began when deputies responded to a report of an argument at the home, police said.
"Based on evidence at the scene, as soon as deputies arrived they were in an active shooting situation," Geller said.
"Since 2000, deputies have been to this property 23 times," Lowe said.
