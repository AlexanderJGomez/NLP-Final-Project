But Willimon, 35, is willing to talk about plenty of other things: the show's Emmy nominations -- including best drama -- the value of power, the balance between idealism and cynicism and who some of his models are.
Beau Willimon: I always keep my expectations pretty low.
But a number of my friends, including my best friend, Jay Carson, who is a political consultant on the show, were in the upper tiers and really knew what was going on.
Willimon: Well, beyond the pale ethically for most people, sure.
CNN: Francis often says that he prefers power over money.
To a degree, money is a form of power.
They didn't.
Willimon: I don't consider myself to be a cynic nor the show to be cynical.
The problem with Washington right now is that people are too stuck to their ideology.
He says, I've got people over here who think this, and people over there who think that.
Willimon: Sure.
CNN: I do find the sausage-making ugly.
I don't think that the media actually has the power to determine the course of history.
But I just see that as a function of the media doing what it has always done since the first leaflet was printed -- trying to find its audience and keep them engaged.
I knew we had 26 hours, and there were things I could lay into the very beginning of season 1 that wouldn't boomerang back to the very end of season 2.
In terms of political figures, someone we keep going back to for inspiration is LBJ.
The ability to make documentaries that are not only so epic and thorough and artful, but have them reach mainstream audiences -- I find it to be not short of miraculous.
Are we going to see more in season 2?
