"In this case, my office examined newly discovered scientific evidence that was not available at the time of the trial," Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth P. Thompson said in statement to CNN.
Yarbough and Wilson were already incarcerated when the 1999 rape and murder occurred, according to Adam Perlmutter, Wilson's attorney.
Yarbough's mother, Annie, his sister Chavonn Barnes, and Chavonn's  friend Latsaha Knox were killed.
Yarbough's attorney and the district attorney's office began revisiting the case in 2010.
"I was extremely anxious and nervous.
At this time, after years behind bars, Yarbough is happy to move on.
"It was hard to keep my hopes up, but God is good now, I'm out now, I'm free, thank God," Yarbough said.
