(CNN) -- A black Agriculture Department employee who resigned after a video clip surfaced of her talking about a white farmer said Tuesday her remarks were taken out of context.
Sherrod resigned Monday after conservative media outlets aired the video, in which she says she did not give the white farmer "the full force of what I could do" to help him avoid foreclosure.
To prove she had done her job, she said, she took him to a white lawyer.
In the end, she said, the lawyer did not help the farmer and she "had to frantically find a lawyer who would file a Chapter 11 to stop the foreclosure."
Sherrod told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution there were white people, including a mayor, at the banquet where she spoke.
According to her remarks, she mistreated a white farmer in need of assistance because of his race," said Benjamin Todd Jealous, president and CEO of the civil rights group.
She said she tried to explain to USDA officials, "but for some reason, the stuff Fox and the Tea Party does is scaring the administration.
What would I do?"
"I think she is using this an anecdote to work through her own issues but also to show the audience we can move beyond and transcend some of these circumstances," he said.
The National Tea Party Foundation expelled Williams' organization from its coalition as a result.
