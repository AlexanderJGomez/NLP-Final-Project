He is covered with bandages; a ventilator breathes for Michael Brewer because he can't do it for himself.
He has not been able to speak with police since his desperate fight for life began October 12, when police say five teenage friends, including a 13-year-old, doused Brewer with rubbing alcohol and set him on fire.
Police say the bicycle was stolen because Brewer did not pay one of the boys $40 for a video game.
His contribution to the breathing is trivial," Namias said.
On Monday, the five teens who are accused of taking part in the attack appeared separately before judges in Broward County, Florida.
The 13-year-old also could be charged as an adult but under Florida law only if Brewer dies.
"There's no evolutionary mechanism to survive a 65 percent burn," Namias said.
"It's understandable that people can be burned in accidents," Namias said.
This didn't have to happen at all."
