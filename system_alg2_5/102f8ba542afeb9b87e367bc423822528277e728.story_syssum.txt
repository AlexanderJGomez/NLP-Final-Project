On paper, Sotnikova had one more triple jump than Kim, including the triple loop, which Kim does not do.
Three-time world champion Elvis Stojko, for example, who had always accentuated an aggressive style over artistry, praised the marks, pleased that the judges rewarded Sotnikova's athleticism and degrees of difficulty over Kim's elegance.

Further, the sport had changed its scoring system to avoid this very situation.
Although she skated cleanly, Kerrigan had doubled a triple jump; Baiul, considered the superior artist, did a two-footed landing, and performed no triple-triple combination.
If the governing body wants us to talk about figure skating as a sport, it needs to ensure that it behaves like one, with credibility and transparency.
