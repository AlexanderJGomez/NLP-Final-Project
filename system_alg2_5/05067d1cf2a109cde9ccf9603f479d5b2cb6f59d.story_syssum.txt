(CNN) -- On Wednesday, the Los Angeles Times published photos of U.S. soldiers posing with what the paper said were bodies of insurgents in Afghanistan.
The images are just the latest in a string of scandals that some say could damage U.S. efforts in the war, which is in its 11th year.
The U.S. is due to hand over control of the country to Afghan forces in 2014.

It's very, very difficult for a White House to walk away from this, especially when the same people that attacked us on 9/11 are going to come back.
I don't think we're going to speed it up, we're just going to hope for the best and get better control of the military.
This is very damaging to all the U.S. efforts, specifically the U.S. effort to assure it stays in harness with the Afghan government and the Afghan security forces moving forward in this critically important mission.
You've got to hold these bad guys with respect that they deserve if they're willing to kill themselves to achieve a goal ... our soldiers understand this.
The record of the military in our conflicts, both in Afghanistan and Iraq, and routine activities that take place every day around the globe [have been] decentralized out to young men and women like these folks [in the photos], who sadly made a huge mistake.
...
Our soldiers and our leaders know you don't pose with dead enemy bodies, and there's a lot of other things that you don't do.
I think the men and women of the armed forces have done a remarkable job, our leadership has done a remarkable job.
And it's not going to recover, at least not in the near term there.
I think we can continue training Afghan security forces.
This is a country that's been through 40 years of war.
