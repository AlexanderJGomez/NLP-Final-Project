Lawmakers new and old picked up their keys to their new offices and got sworn in for the 114th Congress on Tuesday.
Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, a member of the new Democratic minority in the Senate and a former member of the House, said he was committed to getting something done on Capitol Hill even with Republicans at the helm — but sounded less than confident it was possible.
Republican Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas received a congratulatory handshake from Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner in the hallway off the old Senate chamber, before turning to say "hi" to newly-minted GOP Sen. Steve Daines of Montana.
Dan Sullivan, Mike Rounds and Thom Tillis, and had about a dozen receptions he planned to hit — but he'd spend "most of my time" with his new colleague from Iowa, Sen. Joni Ernst.
Mia Love, an African-American Mormon representative from Utah, got a special visit from Rep. Paul Ryan — who thanked her friends and family for bringing "this budding star" to Congress — before heading to the House floor for the first business of the new Congress.
Indeed, it seemed despite Tuesday's fun, the dirty work of legislating wasn't far from lawmakers' minds.
"The hard work begins tomorrow."
