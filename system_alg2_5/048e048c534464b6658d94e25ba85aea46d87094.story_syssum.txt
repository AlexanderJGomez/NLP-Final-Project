"The brothel where I was ... there [were] many customers coming in every day.
The 61-year-old woman and her group, Maiti Nepal, have been fighting for more than 16 years to rescue and rehabilitate thousands of Nepal's sex trafficking victims.
According to the U.S. State Department, some 10,000 to 15,000 women and girls from Nepal are trafficked to India and then sexually exploited each year.
"Every day, there was battering.
Maiti Nepal was her brainchild for giving voice, legal defense and rehabilitation to victims of sex trafficking.
The group has facilities throughout Nepal and India, but most of the rehabilitation work takes place at its main campus in Kathmandu, Nepal.
Many of the staff are sex trafficking survivors now committed to helping rehabilitate other girls.
For these girls, Maiti Nepal becomes their new, and possibly last, home.
"The hardest part for me is to see a girl dying or coming back with different diseases at an [age] when she should be out frolicking," Koirala said.
They easily recognize a girl that is being trafficked or will be trafficked," Koirala said.
Some girls who are trafficked choose to remain prostitutes for life because their home villages will not accept them.
She credits Koirala and Maiti Nepal for the strength to keep living and the confidence to join the fight against sex trafficking.
