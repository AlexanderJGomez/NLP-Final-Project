But, as Mark Woodman, the president of the Color Marketing Group points out, a color as bold as orange is never gone for good.
But even as colors come and go in popular use (orange is already beginning to cycle down in popularity, with cooler blues taking the forefront in design and color news), orange always comes to mind as the weather cools down.
"It is poised to be the metal to embrace in coming years and will keep orange alive," he said.
Want to add orange to your home's color palette?
"Pair orange with cooler colors, and use it more as an accent to add a small dose.
With black or darker colors, orange can be a bit too 'heavy.'
While it's not for everyone, I have to say that I love it."
