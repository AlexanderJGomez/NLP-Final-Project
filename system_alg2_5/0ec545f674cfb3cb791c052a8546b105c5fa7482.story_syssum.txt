The transfer window is a set period of time when football clubs are allowed to buy new players.
The transfer window can see some of football's biggest stars switch club and it is a period that can determine how a team will fare during the season ahead.
When a club is active in the transfer window, making big name buys, it can be taken as a statement of intent for the following season.
This summer's transfer window is likely to be dominated by one club -- Real Madrid.
The owners have so far struggled to attract big names to the club and will be keen to show that City are genuine Champions League material.
