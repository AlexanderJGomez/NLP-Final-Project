Paris, France (CNN)  -- The future of social networking, the real-time Web and a host of apps and gadgets were the talk of the annual Le Web conference as it opened here Wednesday.
Facebook developer Ethan Beard touted his own site's 500,000 applications and its power to drastically boost hits to news sites such as The Huffington Post through the 60 million users it now claims for its Facebook Connect feature.
Chad Hurley, co-founder of Google-owned YouTube, also refused to disclose company revenues but said some popular users have earned more than $1 million since advertising was introduced to the video-sharing site.
On the sidelines of Le Web, the chatter was focused on the Facebook vs. Twitter battle and the opening of data streams to app developers.
People are also asking what the formula for success is -- why do some applications or platforms succeed, and why do some fail?"
You cannot depend only on an online application, you need to do something tangible," he said.
More than 2,000 participants from 46 countries were expected in Paris for the Le Web conference, one of Europe's largest annual tech events.
