Washington (CNN)John Boehner and his allies scrambled to lock down support for his reelection as Speaker on Tuesday morning as the small army of conservative lawmakers promising to vote against him continued to expand.
Rep. Justin Amash, one of the original dozen that opposed Boehner for speaker in 2013, said in a Facebook post that while "Speaker Boehner has given his best to our conference...it's time for Republicans to change our leadership."
"We're at over a dozen right now and you're going to see more people get on and decide not to vote for the current leadership," Yoho said Tuesday on CNN's New Day.
Yoho painted his challenge to the establishment leadership as a "vote against the status quo" and a rebuke of Boehner's leadership, which Yoho and his allies have called weak, short-sighted and eschewing regular order in favor of cobbled compromise.
