Léogâne, Haiti (CNN)  -- Joanie Yestin walks through a small alleyway to what used to be home, now a pile of concrete and crushed belongings.
A block had fallen on him.
Yestin, like many of Haiti's almost 10,000 Boys and Girls Scouts, decided to contribute her share to the earthquake relief effort.
The Scouts have one other advantage: They are young.
By day, few are in school.
She tore open the plastic-on-foam mattresses and blankets to hand out to the needy.
"It was God's will" that her father died, she had said earlier.
Or worry that her education was in peril.
"I love the way we work together," she said of the Scouts.
