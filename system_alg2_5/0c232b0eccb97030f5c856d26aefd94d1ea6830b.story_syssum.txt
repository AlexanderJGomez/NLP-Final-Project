London, England (VBS.TV) -- In April this year I embedded with the elite soldiers of the 2nd Battalion British Parachute Regiment at their training facility in Thetford, United Kingdom.
We went there to film the British army's much-talked-about, multimillion pound "replica Afghanistan village."
Perhaps more shocking than the horrific injuries the soldiers had sustained was the lack of support of these men from the British government of the time -- particularly those who suffered psychological problems as a result of combat shock.
A week before we set off for the embed, I asked Stuart what kind of experience we were letting ourselves in for and he said: "Not only are the Parachute Regiment Britain's most elite soldiers, they are the most brutal of British troops.
And so the troops you are going to be sleeping next to every night are some of the hardest men in the world."
I remember it was in Helmand 2006 that Afghanistan became very hairy indeed.
Richard talked to us about his love for the army and for war.
With the help of my co-producer Jason Mojica, we packed two small cameras into our bags and traveled to the middle of the British countryside to try and ingratiate ourselves with the most brutal soldiers in the whole of the British army.
Soon we were put in jeep, driven an hour-and-a-half away to a gloomy brick building in the middle of nowhere and told that the next time we slept in a bed would be in five days time.
Then the sergeant major introduced himself and told us to get in line with the rest of the troops.
