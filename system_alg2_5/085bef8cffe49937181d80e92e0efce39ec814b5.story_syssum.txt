In addition to the 12 Somali and 11 Yemeni suspects, the Indian navy seized two small boats and "a substantial cache of arms and equipment," the military said in a statement.
The Gibe reported that two boats were firing small arms at it.
The Mysore changed course toward the Gibe and launched an armed helicopter, the Indian military said.
The ship's owner said the sunken vessel was a Thai trawler that was being seized by pirates when an Indian warship fired on it.
Indian authorities insisted that their ship, the frigate INS Tabar, had acted against a pirate vessel that had threatened to attack it.
A day earlier, the German cruise liner MS Columbus said it would fly its 246 passengers and most of its crew over the Gulf of Aden instead of through it to avoid any pirate attack.
The Pentagon said Friday, however, that there are no plans for U.S. forces to go ashore in pursuit of pirates in Somalia.
