Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban told CNN the grenades were launched from the area where the anti-government protesters, known as the Red Shirts, have been encamped for weeks, but the protesters denied any responsibility for the attacks.
Suthep said riot police and helicopters were deployed to join Thai troops in the area, which was still littered with glass amid the standoff.
Thursday's explosions took place near an elevated train station where the Red Shirts are gathered, said Col. Sansern Kaewkumnerd, spokesman for the Center for Resolutions under Emergency Situation.
Abhisit declared a state of emergency April 7, hours after anti-government demonstrators stormed the country's parliament.
