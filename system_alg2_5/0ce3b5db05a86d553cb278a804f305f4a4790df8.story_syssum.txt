(CNN) -- The Hillsborough County, Florida, sheriff on Wednesday offered a personal apology to a disabled man who was dumped onto the floor from his wheelchair while in deputies' custody.
Sterner had been picked up by sheriff's deputies on a warrant for a charge of fleeing and attempting to elude police in an incident in October of last year, his attorney said.
The deputy responsible for dumping Sterner from the chair has been suspended without pay, Gee said in his statement.
Trevena said his client would likely not file a lawsuit in the matter, because Gee has pledged to "make it right."
He said he will do anything and everything to make it right."
Sterner took his story to WTSP a few days after he was released from custody, his attorney said, and the station obtained the booking video from the sheriff's department.
