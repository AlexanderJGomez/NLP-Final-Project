(CNN) -- A Dutch court intervened Friday to stop a 13-year-old girl from attempting to sail around the world by herself, stripping her parents of sole custody.
The court will then make a final ruling on whether her parents may have the final say about their daughter's plans, the court official said.
He said the parents are especially pleased that the court didn't prevent Laura from making the journey, because they hope she can still proceed with her plans.
Laura believes she will be able to convince the court that she is fit to make the trip alone, de Lange said.
He said he doesn't think age alone should determine whether Laura Dekker is ready for such an adventure.
Is she an electrician?
he said.
That's a big difference," she told CNN.
