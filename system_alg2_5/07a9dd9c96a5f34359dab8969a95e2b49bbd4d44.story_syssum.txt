She was awarded the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize for her non-violent struggle for democracy and human rights.
Now, she will participate in Myanmar's next elections, Nyan Win, the spokesman for her National League for Democracy, said Friday.
Known as the "lady" in Myanmar, Suu Kyi has been compared to former South African President Nelson Mandela, who spent a chunk of his life in jail for fighting apartheid.
The daughter of Gen. Aung San, a hero of Burmese independence, Suu Kyi spent much of her early life abroad, going to school in India and at Oxford University in England.
When Suu Kyi's mother died the next year, Suu Kyi vowed that just as her parents had served the people of Burma, so, too, would she.
One of them was Nyo Ohn Myint, who participated in the 1988 protests as a college professor and now serves as one of the leaders in Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy.
Suu Kyi, meanwhile, became the recipient of several human rights prizes and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.
But Suu Kyi refused to turn back and was detained in her minivan for almost two weeks.
"That's a skill I barely see in other people," Myint said.
Instead, the junta encouraged Suu Kyi to join her family abroad.
"Maybe we are good at politics," Suu Kyi told Myint.
One day, maybe, people will see her canvases.
Even when Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar in May 2008, Suu Kyi was not allowed to leave her house, though trees were crashing down all around her.
Some believe that Suu Kyi's stubborn defiance has become an obstacle to progress in Myanmar.
Those simple ideals have greatly complicated one woman's life.
