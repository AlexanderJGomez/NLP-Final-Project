Carlos Ortiz, nicknamed Charlie Boy, is also charged with murder in the death of Lloyd and has pleaded not guilty.
Ernest Wallace is also charged with murder in the death of Lloyd.
Her sister, Shaneah, was dating Lloyd at the time of his death.
She has pleaded guilty to obstruction in the Lloyd case.

Assistant District Attorneys William McCauley and Patrick Bomberg are on the team leading the case against Hernandez.
