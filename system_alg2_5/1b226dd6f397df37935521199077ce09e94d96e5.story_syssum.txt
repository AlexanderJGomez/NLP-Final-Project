A man purported to be the notorious leader of the so-called Islamic State appeared at a mosque in Mosul, calling on people to carry out a holy war, according to witnesses and a video posted to the extremist group's website.
During the sermon, the man said Muslims are sinners if they did not seek this goal of establishing an Islamic state.
...If I disobey God, then you are no longer obligated to obey me."
The video identifies the man as Al-Khalifah Ibrahim, the name al-Baghdadi now goes by with his followers since ISIS declared the creation of the so-called "Islamic State" -- a move that enraged many Muslims.
"The emir of the believers, he will give the sermon," said one of the men who arrived with al-Baghdadi.
Those who accompanied al-Baghdadi took over the first row in the mosque, she said.
There were a number of gunmen who blocked the door."
