For me, it brought back memories of my dad, who fought the Nazis in Europe.
Dad was not amused.
He was drowned out by cheers, and by amused laughter at the cleverness of the trumpeter.
Later, Dad explained to me that his strong emotions went back nearly 15 years when he was an officer on Gen. William Woodward's staff during the 104th Infantry Division's assault on Nazi Germany.
Whenever Dad told that story, his voice would catch.
Dad was a shy man, placid, slow to anger.
At the Atlanta reunion, I had a chance to relay Dad's appreciation of the infantry to several of the veterans I met -- and I listened as many of them talked about their experiences.
"I just shut down completely," he said.
(On April 11, 1945, the 104th liberated the Mittelbau-Dora camp in Nordhausen, Germany.
I asked several of the men.
An experience, I fear, that will be lost forever if more of us don't encourage these men and women to tell their stories for history.
