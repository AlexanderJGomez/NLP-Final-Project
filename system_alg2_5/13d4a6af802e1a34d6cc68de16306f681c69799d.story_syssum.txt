Marion Christopher Barry, the 34-year-old son of Marion Barry, the iconic former D.C. mayor and council member who died last year, is running for his father's seat on the district's council.
Despite his name recognition, the path to the council will not be an easy one for Barry.
After leaving the mayor's office, the older Barry was elected to the council of the District of Columbia where he served until his death.
Barry received 18 months of supervised probation for the plea.
