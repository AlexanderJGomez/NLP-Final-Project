In the southern province of Kerala, the strike hit government-run transport services hard, authorities said.
Most marketplaces in the state were also closed, Kerala police spokesman S. Sudhir said.
The strike appeared to have little impact in bustling New Delhi.
While markets in the city remained open, at least one branch of the State Bank of India in New Delhi was hit hard by the strike, with senior executives picking up the slack.
