"The incidence of skin cancer, including melanoma -- the deadliest kind -- is going up, and wearing sunscreen is one of the best ways to prevent it," says Dr. Ronald Moy, a dermatologist and spokesperson for the Skin Cancer Foundation.
"If you think your sunscreen is pasty, thick or smelly, you have the wrong kind," says Dr. Jeffrey Dover, clinical associate professor of dermatology at Yale University.
Try Neutrogena Beach Defense sunscreen spray broad-spectrum SPF 30 ($11; at mass retailers).
Coola Mineral Sport broad-spectrum SPF 35 Citrus Mimosa ($36; coolasuncare.com) contains zinc, and L'OrÃ©al Paris Sublime Sun Liquid Silk Sunshield for face broad-spectrum SPF 30 ($10; at mass retailers) has avobenzone.
"Several big studies show that most people rub in only about a fourth of what's needed to reach the labeled SPF -- it's faster and easier to put on just a bit," notes Dover.
"People apply sunscreen to their face, but either skip or speed over their nose -- especially if they wear glasses, because they don't want to take them off," Wang says.
Use a sunscreen stick to spot-apply; try Sun Bum Clear Face Stick SPF 30+ ($10; trustthebum.com) or Ocean Potion Dab-On Spot Stick broad-spectrum SPF 50+ ($5; at mass retailers).
While regular tanning or getting several bad burns when you're young raises your risk of skin cancer, Moy says, what's critical is that you put on sunscreen these days.
