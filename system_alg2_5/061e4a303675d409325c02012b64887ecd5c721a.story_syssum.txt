Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Authorities in northern Pakistan were looking for 384 inmates who escaped from a prison early Sunday morning after hundreds of Taliban militants raided the facility.
The attackers apparently were aiming to free a senior Taliban commander, he said, but prison records were destroyed in the attack, and officials were still working to verify the names and crimes of those who escaped.
Authorities were investigating how militants managed to enter the city, Hussain said.
"We will go where we need to go" said Ehsan, vowing to continue attacks that would result in the release of other imprisoned Taliban fighters.
