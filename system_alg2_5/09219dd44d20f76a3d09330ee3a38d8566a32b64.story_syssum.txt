Nway prepares for her new job, selling vegetables from her aunt's garden.
Her name is Nway, and that's how she looked when aid workers found her after Nargis destroyed her isolated village.
Pam Sitko, the aid worker, said Nway -- like thousands of people in Myanmar -- is slowly recovering one year after Nargis demolished their country.
The brunt of the storm hit Myanmar's delta region, the country's bread basket.
"Most of the people are going back to their livelihoods," Marina said.
That hope appears to have spread to Nway.
She is fortunate to be alive.
Nway wouldn't talk about the cyclone after aid workers found her a month later.
On most mornings, she smears white powder made from tree bark on her cheeks (it's used as a skin beautifier by women and children in Myanmar).
Nway told Sitko that she's made "four new best friends."
"She wanted to study and said that she was smart," Sitko said.
The shocked girl who aid workers met a year ago has changed, Sitko said.
I think she's been really transformed by our experience."
