Bolivian President Evo Morales says opposition leaders are trying to overthrow the government.
Julian Torrico, a peasant leader, said he and other Morales supporters will storm the eastern city of Santa Cruz if the talks, which started Thursday, do not yield progress.
Anyelo Cespedes, president of the Santa Cruz Youth Union, which opposes Morales, said they don't want a dictatorship or a communist regime.
The differences flared into violence with opposition protesters occupying government buildings and energy installations.
Morales has said the opposition leaders are trying to overthrow the government.
Ivan Canelas, a government spokesman, said the talks provide a critical opportunity to break an impasse that has split the country for months.
He said the goal is to "give peace back to our country and give certainty to Bolivia."
