After thousands of Russian troops filtered into the territory -- purportedly at the invitation of Ukraine's self-exiled president -- Ukraine's regional parliament called a referendum on secession, and before you could say "borscht," Crimea was part of Russia.
Before long, rebel forces -- believed to be supported by Russia -- had taken control of major cities in Ukraine's east.

Fall and winter will slow the fighting.
"The Russians will try everything to weaken the regime in Kiev," Kaplan said.
Putin's strategy of assembling a larger Russian empire has significant ramifications for Estonia and Latvia, Conley said, raising questions about just what the West will do to stop Russia if Putin chooses to further extend his reach.
Kaplan says Putin can't pull back without gaining assurances that Ukraine will never become part of NATO.
