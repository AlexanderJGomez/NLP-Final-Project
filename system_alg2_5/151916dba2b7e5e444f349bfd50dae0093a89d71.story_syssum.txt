(CNN) -- Gore Vidal, the eclectic author who faithfully chronicled the major shifts and upheavals in the United States in books, essays and plays, has died.
Vidal also appeared in a number of films, including the political satire, "Bob Roberts," where he played a U.S. senator.
He ruffled others by befriending convicted Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh and saying he understood "why he did what he did."
The more they communicated, the more impressed he was by McVeigh, Vidal said.
Vidal "was always a gadfly," Bram said.
To be fair, Vidal had called him a "crypto-Nazi" first.
... And because I'm a writer, people think that I'm this poor little fragile thing.
He was born Eugene Luther Gore Vidal on October 3, 1925.
Unlike his father, Vidal showed no interest in sports and took to writing at age 14, joined the Navy at 17 and published his first novel, the World War II-themed "Williwaw," while on night watch in port at 19.
It was well-received.

Following his lucrative TV stint, Vidal returned to writing and produced three widely acclaimed novels that cemented his reputation as an internationally best-selling author: "Julian" (1964), about the Roman emperor who wanted to restore paganism; "Washington, D.C." (1967), the first of his fictional chronicles of American history; and "Myra Breckinridge" (1968), a satirical treatise on transsexualism.
"I would say that since 1945, the United States, which was absolutely the 'mandate of heaven,' as Confucius would say, had fallen upon us," he told CNN in 2007.
"We share a plot, and I'll be there," Vidal said.
