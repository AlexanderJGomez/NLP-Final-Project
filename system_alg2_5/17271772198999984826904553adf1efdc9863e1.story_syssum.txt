(CNN) -- Two of the four survivors of this week's crash on an Alaska mountainside were well enough to talk with government officials looking into the cause of the crash, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Chairwoman Deborah Hersman told reporters on Friday.
The family of experienced pilot Terry Smith, who was killed in the accident, released a statement Friday saying, "This is a time of great sorrow for our family.
He said the state medical examiner, Dr. Katherine Raven, found the injuries to be consistent with this type of crash.

"Despite suffering serious injuries that have required surgery, Kevin is also showing dramatic improvement," the statement said.
Federal officials are continuing to probe the cause of the crash, said NTSB's Hersman.
