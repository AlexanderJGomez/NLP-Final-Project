Former President George W. Bush has a new mission: helping those with the least in Africa.
Bush got his own hands dirty working on the refurbishment of the clinic -- a sign, he said, of his commitment to the cause.
"It breaks your heart to realize that such hope was given to communities throughout the continent of Africa because of antiretrovirals and then women are dying of cervical cancer -- so there's hope and then there's despondency," George Bush said.
The former president is aware that his legacy will be tied to the Iraq War, but he wants people to know what he is doing in Africa, too.
His legacy will last for a long time," he said of the ailing anti-apartheid icon.
"The only time I really cared was on Election Day," he said.
In any case, the former president said he doesn't expect a fair assessment of his legacy in his lifetime.
