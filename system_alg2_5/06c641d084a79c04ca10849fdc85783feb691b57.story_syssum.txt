Their AdTrap device intercepts online advertisements before they reach any devices that access your Internet connection, allowing you to surf the Web -- even stream videos -- without those annoying ads.
So, Russell and Butkus set out to recreate the past and they came up with AdTrap.
"I think it speaks to the mindset of people right now of their experience on the Internet," Russell said.
Compared to the various software ad-blockers, Russell said a hardware solution is more effective because it works on every device connected to your network.
"We're not trying to be against all advertisers," said Julie Russell, Chad Russell's mother, who handles finances for AdTrap.
