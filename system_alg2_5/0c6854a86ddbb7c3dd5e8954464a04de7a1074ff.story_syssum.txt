Community leaders offer shockingly high estimates for drug use among young people in this part of Myanmar.
"The drug is the first enemy of the Kachin people," he adds.
"Drug problems are not unique to Kachin state or Myanmar for that matter," he says, before claiming that government efforts to combat the region's drug problem have been successful.
Community leaders send out volunteers to clean used needles off the streets, while church groups organize raids against suspected drug dealers, sharing photos and videos of what they say are confiscated narcotics that they subsequently burn.
One of them, the Light of the World camp, is a compound on the banks of the Irrawaddy surrounded by 10-foot high aluminum walls as well as a guard tower.
"We need to have the walls," says Zau Tu, a pastor leading the team who was treating at least 18 patients at the camp.
But patients spend their first week in rehabilitation overcoming drug withdrawal symptoms while locked in a prison-like room that Ahga called the "prayer room."
He and the other patients say heroin and other drugs are bought and sold in the open in an outdoor market near the jade mines.
Asked why counter narcotics officers do not intervene in Hpakant, Sai Thein Zaw of the Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control in Myitkyina blames the Kachin insurgency.
Despite state and community-led efforts to battle the drug trade, many community leaders predicted the worst was yet to come in Kachin.
Against this macabre backdrop of death and drug abuse, our team encounters a couple of men injecting heroin at sunset.
"If I have more money, I will use more [heroin]," the man says.
Their used needles lie discarded in the grass.
