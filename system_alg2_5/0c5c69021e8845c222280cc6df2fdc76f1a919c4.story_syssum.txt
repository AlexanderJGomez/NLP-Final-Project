The Republican hopefuls will face off Wednesday in the CNN/YouTube debate.
"You watch hundreds of these questions and you really get a sense of what's on people's minds."
It's only the second time such a debate has taken place -- Democratic candidates duked it out in a similar format this past summer.
While the GOP debate will also face a YouTube audience, don't expect to hear the same questions.

"We've really begun to find a way for people around the country and even around the world to play a significant role in the process.
CNN's political unit is keeping the questions a secret, but those selecting them say viewers should be prepared for presentations that are funny, questions that are poignant and a format that is unprecedented for the GOP.
"There are plenty of animated figures out there, there are certainly some funny questions, but more importantly, there are hundreds, if not thousands of really, really good, solid questions from real people on real issues."
