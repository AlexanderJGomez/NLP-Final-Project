Comanche, arguably the world's most hotly-anticipated yacht, has finally taken to the seas and for its billionaire owner Jim Clark, it's a chunk of money that could land him a place in the record books.
You're just praying the boat stays in one piece and that's a realistic fear with such a cutting-edge project like this."
Clark likes to talk about how the team behind his creation "is pushing the envelope" with Comanche, which lends its origins in part to the yacht Speedboat, which was launched in 2008.
"It was in the late 1980s that I bought my first sail boat and, from there, you always want to get something bigger," he says.
The last Comanche tribe chief Quanah Parker surrendered about 60 miles from where Clark grew up in an area where "the plains are very flat like the ocean".
Clark tells the story of going out on the first Wild Oats, Bob Oatley's boat that has dominated the Sydney to Hobart race, and being blown away by the technology of a keel boat.
"This is so cutting edge that we'll got into that race with lingering doubts it might go wrong," admits Read.
The race is part of the Australian sporting psyche, on a par with the Melbourne Cup, the Australian Open tennis or an Ashes cricket Test match between Australia and England.
You can have the greatest thing since sliced bread but you won't go record breaking if the weather's not right.
"My wife's an Australian and a very competitive lady," says Clark, "and she wants to sail in Sydney-Hobart.
I'll let her run the show."
