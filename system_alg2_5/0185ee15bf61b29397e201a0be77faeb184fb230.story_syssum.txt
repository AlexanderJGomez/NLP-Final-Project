"I just knew FootGolf would be a bit of a no-brainer for the amount of golf courses there are, as well as the number of golfers and footballers," O'Connor told CNN of a game that involves players kicking a football around a golf course, complete with bigger holes.
"He created everything, from how the game is played, down to the look of the players.
Footballers are well known for playing golf in their spare time, so perhaps it is no surprise that FootGolf has proved such a hit with those hailing from a footballing background -- 70% of people who have taken up the sport have been footballers.
"There is that challenge when playing golf.
"It can be a challenge if you want, but I think it's good that you can actually have it as a casual game as well.
"A lot of people are getting involved and loving the sport.
"When I first set up FootGolf I knew a lot of people would want to play the sport, and I knew I wouldn't be alone in liking the idea of playing football on a golf course," he said.
So much so, that the governing body has taken the steps to set up its very own UK FootGolf Academy Scheme, due to start for business in May, and headed up by Hughes, who previously played for Birmingham City, Charlton Athletic and Hull City and is now a player-assistant manager at Scarborough Athletic.
"The concept of FootGolf is something that really appeals to me and I'm sure there is a massive amount of people that would really want to get involved with the Academy Scheme.
They need direction and for somebody to really push them a little, to get them right up there and become the best they really can be.
They all want to get ranked and be known as a good FootGolfer, not just in their own country but around the world."
"In five years' time, every country in the world that has got golf courses will be a member of the Federation for International FootGolf," O'Connor said.
That's how big an impact the sport is having around the world."
