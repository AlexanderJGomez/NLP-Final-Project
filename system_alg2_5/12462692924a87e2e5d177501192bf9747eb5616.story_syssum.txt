At the hearing, lawyers for the Patriots said the team would not pay Hernandez the $3.25 million that the NFL Players Association has said the player is owed.
The wrongful death lawsuit, filed Monday, claims Hernandez "maliciously, willfully, wantonly, recklessly or by gross negligence" caused the death of Odin Lloyd.
Police have said that the homicide may be linked to Hernandez, according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation.
Attorneys for the Patriots and the Lloyd family did not return CNN's calls.
