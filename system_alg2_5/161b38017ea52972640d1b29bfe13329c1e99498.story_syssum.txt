Jury selection begins Friday, as attorneys begin to whittle down a pool of more than 1,100 potential jurors to the small group that will decide whether Hernandez is guilty of murdering semipro football player Odin Lloyd.
Hernandez, 25, has pleaded not guilty.
Lloyd's texts to his sister: For example, the jury won't hear about text messages between the victim, Odin Lloyd, and his younger sister, sent just minutes before Lloyd's death.
At about 3:20 a.m. on June 17, 2013, prosecutors say, Lloyd was in a car driven by Hernandez with Wallace and Ortiz.
Minutes later, witnesses heard shots fired at an industrial park about a mile from Hernandez's home, they told prosecutors.
Hernandez's texts to Lloyd: Jurors will, however, be able to see texts between Hernandez and Lloyd from earlier that night when the football player invited Lloyd to hang out.
Investigators say a vehicle that appears to match the description of a car rented by Hernandez is seen on security cameras driving through the industrial park, allegedly with Hernandez, Wallace, Ortiz, and Lloyd inside.
Prosecutors have said they plan to argue Lloyd's murder was a "joint venture."
In court papers, detectives said they were looking for three pairs of sneakers photographed in a closet during their original 2013 search.
Nor will the jury be able to hear that Hernandez has been indicted for shooting to death two men in Boston after leaving a nightclub in 2012.
Prosecutors have permission from the judge to take jurors to see Hernandez's home, as well as the shooting site.
Inside Hernandez's home, jurors will see the layout and its multicamera video security system.
