A combination of pathogens, disease-causing micro-organisms, is to blame for the illness, the World Health Organization, in conjunction with the Cambodian Ministry of Health, has concluded, the doctors said.
said Dr. Arnaud Tarantola, chief of epidemiology and public health at the Institut Pasteur.
On the steroids issue, Tarantola said, "When you have a dying child, you try to use what you have at hand, and they were right to try that."
"Not what is the illness, but now, how long has the virus been circulating?
Beat Richner, head of the children's hospitals -- which cared for 66 patients affected by the illness, 64 of whom died -- said that no new cases of the illness had been confirmed since Saturday.
Most of the children who have contracted the illness have come from the south of the country, though health officials cannot find what is known as a cluster -- a lot of cases coming from one specific area.
In milder cases, EV71 can cause coldlike symptoms, diarrhea and sores on the hands, feet and mouth, according to the journal Genetic Vaccines and Therapy.
Adults' well-developed immune systems usually can fend off the virus, but children are vulnerable to it, according to the CDC.
In Cambodia, as with many places around the world, parents first try treating their child at home.
