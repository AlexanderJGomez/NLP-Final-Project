There's still a Sunshine State for folks like us -- it's "Old Florida."
Sometimes thought of as "Forgotten Florida," I'm talking about the more northerly portions of the state.
And you can enjoy it all without devastating your wallet and facing large or pretentious crowds.
1.
Art is a big part of the town, with all manner of public displays popping up.
If you seek a traditional, white-sand beach with aqua Gulf of Mexico waters right at your doorstep, you need to go elsewhere.
2.
This is a wonderful state park dedicated to native flora and fauna (minus one hippo that is a holdover from another incarnation of the park).

Alexander Springs is one of several in Ocala National Forest, a true gem of a wilderness that will evoke memories of "The Yearling" if you ever read that Pulitzer-winning novel.

Apalachicola oozes "Old Florida" charm.
I stayed across the bay in nearby Eastpoint, which is even smaller, more blue collar and boutique-free.

St. George Island State Park

There didn't seem to be as much beach and parking for visitors, but the green and blue waters and soft sands were just as inviting.

Amelia Island and Fernandina definitely have a Georgia/Carolinas kind of feel -- in a good way.
Downtown Fernandina is definitely the most upscale of the places on this list, but it still had a down-to-earth charm.
