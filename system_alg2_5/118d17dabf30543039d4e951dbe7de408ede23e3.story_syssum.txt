This is Japan's exclusion zone.
That's what strikes you first about the exclusion zone -- what you can't see, the people.
Bicycles near a bus stop lie tipped over, as if owners forgot to retrieve them.
I'm carrying two radiation meters with me, one to measure surface radiation and one to track how much my body accumulates.
Tomioka, in the southern end of the exclusion zone, has a lower level of contamination than towns to the north and northwest of the plant.
On the pavement, the surface reads a radiation level of 0.042 millisieverts per hour, which is 10 times what you're exposed to in a dental x-ray.
But the rest of Tomioka sits empty, of people, of progress and an apparent future.
