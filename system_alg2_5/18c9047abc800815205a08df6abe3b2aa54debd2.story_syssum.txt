"While applying for public aid, the mother of 14 children allegedly failed to disclose that she was also getting checks for personal appearances and residuals from videos," said a news release from Los Angeles District Attorney Jackie Lacey on Monday.
An adult video featuring Suleman was released in June.
"I wouldn't even kiss somebody for money," Suleman told CNN's Nischelle Turner.
"But right now, people don't understand that."
Suleman faces up to five years, eight months in prison if convicted, the prosecutor said.
