These are some of the hard-to-stomach images that the Obama administration has shown a select group of senators in closed-door briefings to make the case that a limited military attack on Syria is justified.
The administration told senators that their authenticity was verified by the intelligence community.
"That video will sensitize the American people that this isn't just an intervention, that this is a military strike to stop that type of atrocity," the former congressman told CNN.
An aide to Dianne Feinstein, the committee's chairwoman, said it's expected the video will be played Monday at a briefing for all House members.
The video captures at least six rows of adults with no less than four bodies each.
Another man comes with a bottled water and the men together try to rinse the small boy's face.
The videos were shot from multiple angles, providing overlap, not just in what could be seen but what could be heard, the administration officials told the senators.
