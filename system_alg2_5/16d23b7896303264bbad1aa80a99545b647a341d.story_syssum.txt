Every girl should have the right to that life, but there are millions of girls in my country who are not so fortunate and are subjected to child marriage.
The law in Bangladesh says no girl should get married before 18 years of age and no boy before 21 years of age.
It is estimated that two-thirds of Bangladeshi girls are married before the age of 18.
That is how parents treat their daughters â€” like dolls who have no voice.
If a girl can feed her family, it will help parents rethink the idea that their daughters are a burden.
If we stop this problem, other problems in our country will be reduced automatically.
I am a part of World Vision's child forum and just this year we have used our voices to stop three child marriages in our community.
My hope is that my friends in Bangladesh and girls around the world will get to chase their dreams, too.
