Recent US PGA champion Rory Mcilroy sits two under par after his third round of 69 helped him recover from his poor second round.
After three birdies in the first five holes he struggled on the back nine to leave him even at the end of his round.
However, two bogeys on the back nine, after a fine birdie on the 13th, left the American one stroke over for the day.
The Northern Irishman had disappointed on Friday when he struck five bogeys to undo a promising first round.
