(CNN) -- As captain of the Neptune tugboat, Viktor Nikolsky spends his days gently directing giant cargo vessels in and around the vast port of St. Petersburg, Russia.
Despite sailing more than five times the recommended distance from the coast as a precaution against hijacking, the fast moving dots were speedboats carrying heavily armed pirates.
A U.S. Navy ship kept watch of the Faina from a distance while pirates patrolled the decks.
Bargaining chips in the middle of all this were Nikolsky and his crew.
"The crew was under control all the time.
They left, and the ship and crew free to go.
He told us that everything was clear and all the pirates left the vessel."
The Faina sailed into the port of Mombasa, Kenya, a few days later where Nikolsky was reunited with his wife and family.
"But I spent at sea all of my life, 45 years ... (and) now I like my village, I like my job here."
