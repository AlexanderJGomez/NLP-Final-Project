(CNN) -- Two employees at the Baltimore, Maryland, branch of the liberal community organizing group ACORN were caught on tape allegedly offering advice to a pair posing as a pimp and prostitute on setting up a prostitution ring and evading the IRS.
"Stop saying prostitution," the woman, identified by the filmmaker as an ACORN tax expert, tells Giles.
Calls to ACORN's Baltimore offices were not immediately returned Thursday.
On Wednesday, arrest warrants were issued for 11 Florida voter registration workers suspected of submitting false information on hundreds of voter registration cards, according to court documents.
Founded in 1970, ACORN calls itself "the nation's largest grassroots community organization of low- and moderate-income people."
