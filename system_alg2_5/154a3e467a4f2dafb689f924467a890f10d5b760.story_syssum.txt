Muse "conducted himself as the leader" of the pirates who allegedly took over the Maersk Alabama, according to the criminal complaint.
A federal judge ruled Tuesday that Muse could be tried as an adult.
Muse was arrested in the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama, a cargo ship that pirates attacked on April 8 about 350 miles off the Somali coast.
According to the criminal complaint, two of the 20 crew members -- all Americans -- saw lights heading toward the Maersk Alabama around 4:30 a.m. on April 8, while the ship was in the Indian Ocean.
Muse demanded that the Maersk Alabama be stopped and that the crew give him the number of the ship's owner, the complaint said.
The captain then ordered the crew to the bridge after Muse ordered him to do so, the complaint said, citing Crew Member 2.
Phillips boarded the lifeboat with them and the ship's crew freed Muse, who then boarded the lifeboat, according to the criminal complaint.
On April 12, Muse boarded the USS Bainbridge and demanded safe passage for himself and the other pirates in exchange for Phillips' release.
