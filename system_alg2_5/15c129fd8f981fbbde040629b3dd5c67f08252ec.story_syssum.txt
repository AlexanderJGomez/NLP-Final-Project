(CNN) -- Sitting inside the quaint tasting room of Chateau O'Brien, an award-winning French-style winery in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Northern Virginia, co-owner Debbie O'Brien pours some of the best red wine in the region.
Tasting fees at most Northern Virginia wineries range from $6 to $15 per person, and while some Virginia wine loyalists are somewhat optimistically comparing the region to Napa Valley and Sonoma, there are indeed several standouts that can compete with some of the nation's better wineries.
Wines at Delaplane Cellars include crisp whites like Chardonnay and Viognier and complex red wines that include Melange Rouge, William's Gap Reserve, and Cabernet Franc.
On a recent visit to Delaplane Cellars, the large tasting room was crowded and every table overlooking the mountains was filled.
For red wines only, visit Boxwood Wineries in Middleburg, Virginia, a picturesque property owned by John Kent Cooke, the former owner of the NFL's Washington Redskins.
Since the Tannat flourishes in humid climates, Virginia is the perfect region to harvest the grape.
You won't regret it.
The Ashby Inn & Restaurant is only a 10-minute drive from Delaplane Cellars.
There are 18 rooms in six separate cottages.
The restaurant serves great food for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Watching the burnt-orange sun slowly dropping behind the mountains is a perfect end to a great day.
