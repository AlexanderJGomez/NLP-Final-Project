Savvy cyber criminals are taking advantage of our increasing reliance on computers and the Internet.
Last year, antivirus maker McAfee saw a 500 percent increase in malware types -- more than the company had seen in the previous five years combined.
In the United States, the FBI reported a 33 percent increase in Internet crime last year.
On these Web sites, would-be criminals can purchase toolkits to learn how to side step security measures or create their own "botnet" -- referring to software that can, unbeknownst to victims, turn their computers into spamming foot-soldiers for criminal networks.
Although the techniques of cyber crime have evolved, online criminals prey on human vulnerabilities like criminals throughout the ages.
Now the biggest threats include "phishing" schemes and "botnet" attacks.
"They ring up the IT manager of a company and say, 'Pay us a million or we'll take you down'," said Fraser, who has worked with companies victimized by botnet attacks.
"Once it became a business, then (cyber criminals) began to look at what companies like us were doing, and figure out weaknesses," he said.
"Child pornography is easier to prosecute because it is possible to find the evidence on the perpetrator's computer systems," said Spafford of Purdue University.
Often criminal networks are run in countries such as Russia and China, where government officials turn a blind eye to these activities -- so long as their victims reside outside the host country, Spafford said.
