The trial is expected to start Monday.
Guandique was sentenced in 2002 for attacking two other women in the same park.
Defense attorneys have questioned the police investigation and, this week, wondered about a second man named in a FBI fingerprint memo prosecutors had just disclosed to Guandique's counsel.
The judge's instructions and opening presentations in the trial are expected to begin Monday.
