For Father's Day, my wife gave me some boxer shorts and a tiny reading light, so I can flip through a book in bed without disturbing her.
I've been thinking about how our society recognizes parents because Father's Day is upon us again, but also because, a while ago, my worst nightmare happened: My wife had to have surgery.
Why?
If this were 1897 or even 1974, I could have coasted through the weekend, serving potato chips and cold cereal to Isabelle, and I would have brought the girls to my wife's bed for her to do the changing of the diapers.
As long as I managed to avoid the house catching on fire, and the girls didn't come down with malaria, at the end of the weekend, my family and friends would have laughed heartily at my mishaps, like they used to do in the last couple seconds of those 1970s and 1980s one-hour dramas (you know, after somebody made a joke and the shot went into freeze frame).
We not only love our children, we're acutely aware that we have a responsibility to be the best parents we can be.
I grew more confident in my parenting skills and even gave both girls a bath -- at the same time -- not once, but two nights in a row!
The soldiers would remain at their posts.
Even full-time working moms do more child-rearing than us dads, studies have repeatedly found.
Yet I think we dads merit at least a little more than boxer shorts, soap-on-a-rope, and neckties.
So if any of you mothers now feel guilty enough to spring for a slightly nicer Father's Day gift -- say, a plasma TV with a 50-inch screen -- make sure it also has built-in speakers with surround-sound.
