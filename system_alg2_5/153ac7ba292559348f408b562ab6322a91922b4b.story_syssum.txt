As evacuees from last year's Fukushima nuclear disaster, Mikio and Hamako lost everything: their home, their jobs, and any hope for the future.
The triple nuclear meltdown at the plant spewed radiation across a wide swath of Fukushima prefecture, forcing the mandatory evacuation of 70,000 residents and a second tier evacuation of an additional 90,000.
In a landmark case, Watanabe filed a lawsuit last month against TEPCO, blaming the utility company for his wife's suicide.
"She cried so much and repeatedly asked me to take her to our home," he says.
"We talked a lot then," recalls Watanabe.
"The next morning, I woke up early around 4 a.m.
Watanabe continued to weed around his house and went inside to take a shower.
Watanabe says it's strange what you remember in trauma.
This wasn't supposed to happen, says Watanabe.
"We lost everything," he says.
"Watanabe's case is very symbolic," says his attorney Tsugio Hirota.
Due to the size of the affected area, TEPCO and the Japanese government are unable to estimate if and when residents will ever be able to return.
