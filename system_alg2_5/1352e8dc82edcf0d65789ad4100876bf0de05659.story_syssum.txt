(Tribune Media Services) -- If you think being a secret agent is all just one giant adrenaline rush, think again.
Welcome to Operation Spy at the International Spy Museum (www.spymuseum.org) in Washington, D.C. "Today intelligence is the first line of defense against ideology-driven terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other threats to our country," explains Peter Earnest, executive director of the International Spy Museum, who spent 36 years at the CIA.
But I've got a bigger mission ahead this weekend: Can I make a visit to the nation's capital, museums and historic sites at every turn, fun?
(Memo to parents: If you take kids to a restaurant like this and they've outgrown the kids' menu, suggest they share a meal -- assuming they want the same thing.)
The theme of this hotel is "art in motion" and when we get to our room, the kids find personalized cartoons drawn by a local cartoonist and an iHome to plug in their iPods.
Fall and winter weekends are a great time to visit D.C. with bargain hotel rates.
(TIP: Even in the fall, the entire day's tickets had been given out before 10 a.m.
NOTE: Though (free) tickets aren't required September through February, tours still fill up.
Me too.
The Smithsonian museums and the capital will be here next trip.
