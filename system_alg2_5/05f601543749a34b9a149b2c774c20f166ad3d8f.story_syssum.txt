Rescuers had pulled at least seven injured people from the rubble after Sunday's landslide in Bello, Colombia, which buried between 30 and 50 homes, Nova said.
"I hope they can be rescued.
More than 700 people were working in shifts on search teams at the site Monday, Caracol reported.
I also have a 6-year-old boy," Garcia told Caracol.
In a few hours we will go directly to Medellin to be with the victims' families and tell them, 'Whatever the government can do to mitigate this pain and suffering, we will be there,'" Santos said in a statement Monday.
