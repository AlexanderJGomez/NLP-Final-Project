Apatow's latest comedy "Funny People" pairs Adam Sandler (left) with Seth Rogen (right).
A former stand-up comic and writer for television sitcoms like "The Larry Sandler Show," Apatow has taken to heart that old maxim that the best comedy is born out of tragedy.
"Every time we meet someone new and they're great we think 'I want to use that person on the next one' because it's so hard to find someone that's hysterical, interesting and fun to be around."
Surprisingly, considering their longtime association, "Funny People" is the first time Apatow has helmed a feature with Sandler in it.
So we always reminisce about that time because we had nothing going on other than our comedy sets at night."
