Fourteen people were killed when the plane slammed into a cemetery March 22 in Butte, and investigators immediately began focusing on why the pilot asked to divert the flight from Bozeman, Montana, to Butte, 80 miles to the west.
The pilot two minutes later again requested to divert to Butte.
At 2:29 p.m., air traffic control "called the aircraft in the blind with no response," and the accident was reported four minutes later.
One witness with aviation experience reported that the airplane was west of the runway centerline and appeared too high to land on the runway," the report said.
The preliminary NTSB report said "visual meteorological conditions prevailed" at both Bozeman and Butte.
