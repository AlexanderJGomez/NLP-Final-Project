For citizens to actively participate in democracy, it is critical that they are able to access information on parliamentary proceedings and elected representatives.
A data repository has been created online, enabling journalists, analysts and campaigners to utilize this information to hold government to account and campaign for improved service delivery.
In Nigeria, a simple application created by developer Pledge 51 enables citizens to access their constitution by mobile phone and has been downloaded more than 750,000 times.
Across the continent, platforms are being developed that enable citizens to use SMS from basic phones to report challenges in service delivery.
CIPESA has created a platform populated with information on health programs being implemented in the region and citizen journalists are able to submit reports, photographs and audio footage describing the real situation on the ground, whilst Voluntary Sector Accountability Committees established by WOUGNET are utilizing a similar platform to report on corrupt practices and poor governance.
As young people are the biggest consumers of technology, platforms are being developed that enable them to become more actively engaged.
Map Kibera has equipped young activists with GPS-enabled phones and has supported them in creating a map of the region, part of a wider program that empowers youth to raise awareness of the challenges faced by their communities and advocate for change.
Technology applications can be developed anywhere and what's exciting about many of these initiatives is that they're being devised locally.
However, when combined with well devised programs, their power to reach the previously unreachable and to bring the voices of citizens closer to government makes them a significant contributor to the process of ensuring that government's best serve the interests of their citizens.
