Like seasonal flu, H1N1 is more active in the winter than in the summer, and a majority of infected people get better on their own, Fukuda said.
The virus is also becoming more active in Europe and Central and Western Asia, Fukuda said.
Mongolia reported "a number" of cases over the past week, he said.
In Australia, for example, "aboriginal groups are disproportionately represented in people who end up in hospitals from diseases related to the pandemic," Fukuda said.
But Fukuda said that's a dangerous mind-set.
The WHO also has no evidence of widespread resistance to antiviral medication, Fukuda said.
Other useful protections against H1N1 are vaccines, which the WHO recommends against pandemic infections, Fukuda said.
