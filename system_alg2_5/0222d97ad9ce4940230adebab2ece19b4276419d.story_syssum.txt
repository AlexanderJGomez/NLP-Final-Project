The new printers that HP is unveiling today along with ePrint can connect directly to Google Cloud using their touchscreen interface.
Similarly, Box.net and Docstoc users can also retrieve and push documents to and from the cloud through new print apps.
HP also sees a big opportunity for providing different types of activities for parents and kids, and to that end has signed on Crayola for coloring pages and PBS for a variety of education-driven printing.
With more and more types of documents getting digitized and smartphones replacing former functions of printers (think coupons and tickets), HP needs new ways to drive printer usage.
HP will dive into these topics at apress conference this morning to kick off Internet Week New York, where I'll be moderating a panel with a number of the players involved in the new ePrint initiative.
