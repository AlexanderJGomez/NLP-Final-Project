Tom Shupe thinks black bears have a people problem.
He explained that perpetually hungry black bears need plenty of food habitat.
Instead of scaring it away, too many people say: "Oh, isn't he cute.
But it's the beginning of the end for that bear, because the people are teaching it to associate the smell of people with food.
But the bear has learned people equals food, and does it again.
Why?
We put out all sorts of food for them: lawns, gardens, shrubbery, birdseed, grill grease, garbage, dumpster waste.
And we offer protection from predators, mainly ourselves.
Over the last century and half, forests grew back on abandoned farmland; a century ago we ended commercial hunting and began restoring wild bird and animal populations.
There we get most of our nature on digital screens, where wild creatures are often portrayed as pets performing all sorts of antics.
What this means is that in just the last few decades, for the first time in 11,000 years, huge swaths of the whitetail's historic range -- the Eastern United States -- have been put off-limits to its biggest predators.
Estimates say about 100 people die in hunting accidents, mainly in cases of mistaken identity.
These days, deer kill more than twice that many, both in deer-vehicle crashes and when drivers swerve into a tree or an oncoming vehicle.
Black bears are shy and docile creatures motivated by hunger and fear, but they, like deer, beavers, turkeys, waterfowl and others, were almost wiped out in the United States by the end of the 19th century.
It isn't.
Nuisance wildlife control people say tossing rocks at coyotes would help reinstill their fear of people.
Conflicts between people and wild animals will continue to rise as both populations grow into one another.
Feeding them won't.
