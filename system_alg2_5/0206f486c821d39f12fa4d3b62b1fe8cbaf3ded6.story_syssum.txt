ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- You are about to meet Mr. Brown.
The show focuses on Mr. Brown and his daughter Cora, played by Mann's real-life wife, Tamela Mann, as Mr. Brown tries to turn his house into a home for the elderly.
"If it hadn't been for Cora, Mr. Brown and Madea probably would have killed each other by now," Mann said.

"One word can trigger a whole different thing with us, and that's what I love about working with Tyler Perry," Mann said.
"Oh, he can come out any time," Mann, speaking as Brown, said.
"What's funny is when people see me out they're like, 'Are you Mr. Brown's son?'
No, I'm Mr. Brown," he said.
