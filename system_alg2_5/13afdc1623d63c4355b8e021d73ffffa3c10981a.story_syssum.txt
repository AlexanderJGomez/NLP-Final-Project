(CNN) -- The mother of a 25-year-old woman killed in a Boston hotel more than a week ago said Friday that she will remain haunted by her daughter's death for the rest of her life.
They say Markoff may have met her through the online site.
He has his family's support.
She was held at gunpoint and bound, prosecutors said.
McAllister said Markoff "is the wrong man" and "was set up."
On April 16 at a Holiday Inn Express in Warwick, a man tied up and demanded money from a 26-year-old dancer who had posted a Craigslist advertisement, Warwick Police Chief Col. Stephen McCartney said.
He said the incident "may be related to similar crimes occurring in the Boston area" but that had not been determined.
