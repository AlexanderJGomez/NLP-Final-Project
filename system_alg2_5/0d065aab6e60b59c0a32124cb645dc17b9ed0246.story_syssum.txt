The problems of very long wait lists for veterans and serious scheduling issues go well beyond Phoenix and exist in many VA facilities, Inspector General Richard Griffin and members of his staff told the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee.
The VA system might need as many as 28,000 doctors and other medical staff to help fix the problems and provide proper and timely care to veterans, said McDonald, who also testified.
That report found 28 veterans who suffered "clinically significant delays in care associated with access to care or patient scheduling."
The report reviewed the cases of more than 3,400 patients and found 28 instances of clinically significant delays in care associated with access or scheduling.
"I said at the time of my confirmation hearing that I will put veterans at the center of everything we do at VA," said McDonald.
McDonald said that as of August 15, the Veterans Health Administration had contacted more than 294,000 veterans and had decreased the electronic wait list nationwide by 57%.
A new recruiting push by the VA was underway, McDonald said.
"And if you're the VA, this is the line you want inserted in that report."
McDonald testified to numerous efforts underway across the VA system to decrease wait times and provide veterans faster, needed medical care.
He told the senators there is a new push to have many changes made before Veterans Day in November.
