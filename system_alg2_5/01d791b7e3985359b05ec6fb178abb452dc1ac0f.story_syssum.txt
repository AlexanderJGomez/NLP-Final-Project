West Milford, New Jersey (CNN) -- For Gary Oppenheimer, 2007 was a year of plenty.
So Oppenheimer took the produce to a local food pantry at a battered-women's shelter.
"
He reached out to food pantries across the country through social networking, food banks, master gardeners, faith organizations and other groups to encourage them to sign up for inclusion in his database of food pantries.
"The country is loaded with gardeners who have more food than they can possibly themselves use," Oppenheimer said.
Those who rely on food pantries are often surviving on canned and processed foods.
"That's the food that ... we can get into the system to help diminish hunger in the country."
Although Oppenheimer cannot track the amount of produce that has been donated to food pantries, he said he's received messages from numerous pantries and clients across the country who've been given food as a result of AmpleHarvest.org.
