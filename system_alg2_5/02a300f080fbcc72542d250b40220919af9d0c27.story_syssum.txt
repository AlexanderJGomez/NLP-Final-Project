In his plea agreement, Masri said that on July 19, 2010, he told an associate he "wanted to travel to a conflict zone to engage in jihadist fighting" and that he had the choice of going to Afghanistan to help al Qaeda or travel to Somalia to aid Al-Shabaab.
According to the plea agreement, Masri said to avoid suspicion they should not travel directly to East Africa.
Masri told his associate that once they left for Somalia they would be "wanted men."
Masri was arrested when he left the store.
