Sidney Frank, shown accepting an honorary degree in 2005, gave $100 million to Brown University.
Frank -- who left Brown after one year in the late 1930s because he couldn't afford to stay -- gave the school a $100 million endowment in 2004.

The school intends to give 30 to 35 Frank scholarships per year.
