Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, a strongman in the troubled Horn of Africa and a key United States ally, has died, his government announced Tuesday.
"He came to power at the barrel of a gun, but he made the transition from rebel leader to political leader very quickly," said Ayo Johnson, a writer on Africa and director of Viewpoint Africa.
His Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front took all but one seat in parliament in elections in 2010, Africa expert Jason Mosley pointed out in the wake of Meles' death.
Meles died at 11:40 p.m. Monday from an unspecified infection, spokesman Bereket Simon said.
The news came almost a week after the government said Meles was "recovering well" after treatment for an unspecified illness.
The government held a news conference last month and announced Meles received treatment for an unspecified illness.
Meles has been credited with working toward peace and security in the region, and the Ethiopian army sent peacekeepers to battle the Islamic extremist group Al-Shabaab in Somalia.
