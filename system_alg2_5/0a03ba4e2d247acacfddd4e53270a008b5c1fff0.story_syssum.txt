Though she was one of the most seriously hurt that day, Wright is now aiming for a spot on the British Paralympic volleyball team in 2012.
"I would love, absolutely love, to be part of the Paralympics in 2012," Wright told CNN affiliate ITN last month.
"I've learned to fly planes, and I've jumped out of a plane, learned to ski again."
The British Volleyball Federation announced her place on the team last month, and this week the team is competing at the 2010 Sitting Volleyball World Championships in the U.S. state of Oklahoma.
"Even on your darkest days, there will always be someone that's worse than you are, unfortunately," Wright told ITN.
