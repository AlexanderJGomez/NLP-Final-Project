Holbrooke, who had served President Jimmy Carter as an assistant secretary of state, offered his recommendation to Bill Clinton's advisers during the 1992 presidential campaign: Direct use of force against the Bosnian Serbs.
When Clinton embraced a get-tough policy, Holbrooke was optimistic.
Holbrooke wanted to handle Bosnia for the Clinton administration.
And the Europeans said, 'Absolutely no.'"
Under mounting criticism in the press, Clinton asked Holbrooke in May 1994 to leave his post in Germany and return to the White House to help with Bosnia.
"What I said to the Europeans was, 'We're going to do this.
"I don't like to advocate the use of force, [because] I know people will get killed," Holbrooke said.
