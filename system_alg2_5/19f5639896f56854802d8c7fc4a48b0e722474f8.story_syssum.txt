Santos says he became one of the thousands of American and Mexican teenagers recruited into the dangerous world of drug smuggling.
I had no conscience," Santos said at a boxing gym in El Paso, Texas.
Drug cartels "just need someone who can legitimately cross the border," said Bill Molaski, the El Paso Port Director for U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
As an American, Santos could freely cross the El Paso-Juarez border and not raise suspicion.
"I can't say I wasn't nervous," Santos said.
Santos, who is now 21, says he was arrested once but spent only a few days in jail.
Federal and state authorities say drug cartels recruit young smugglers from schools.
Mexican officials say cartels have placed classified advertisements in Mexican newspapers with cryptic messages offering young people a job with good salary and benefits.
Boxing and smuggling can both be vicious worlds, but at least boxing is legal.
Santos is working two part-time jobs, and he says it takes him two months to earn the money that he used to make in one day of drug smuggling.
I feel better now."
