(CNN) -- Even during the harshest periods of the communist era, being Shanghainese had a special cachet in China.
A number of pockets in China have impressive Western buildings -- the German Quarter in Qingdao, Russian buildings in Harbin -- but none provide the surreal feeling of "elsewhereness" like the Bund.
It was largely built in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to establish Shanghai as the British Empire's trading hub of the Far East.
With the financial center's move to the east bank of Huangpu River, the old Bund has become a new home for world-class hotels, restaurants and retailers.
Lujiazui is home to the most recognized high-rises in China, including the 468-meter Oriental Pearl TV Tower, the 421-meter Jinmao Tower and the 492-meter Shanghai World Financial Center.
When international events set up in China, Shanghai is as often as not the default host city.
Set to open toward the end of 2015, Shanghai Disneyland will be the first Disney theme park in mainland China (Hong Kong Disneyland opened in 2005) and the sixth in the world.
New kitchens often set up on the Bund, around Xintiandi and in the former French Concession, as rivals to the established fine-dining scene in Beijing.
Known locally as "spicy soy sauce," Shanghainese Worcestershire sauce was first produced in 1930 to cater to the large expat market.
Local mothers usually cook it to treat friends and families.
When the Communist Party took over in 1949, shikumen architecture was at its height -- there were around 200,000 shikumen buildings throughout central Shanghai, each divided into tenements to house five or even ten families.
Since the 1990s, shikumen buildings have been getting pulled down more quickly than the skyscrapers rise.
