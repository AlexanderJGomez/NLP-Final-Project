(CNN) -- World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) president John Fahey has told CNN he doesn't think Novak Djokovic "has the faintest idea" what his organization does after the former world No.
"What I do know is they have a program and a commitment has been given.
Every sport can do more.
"What that said to me and the rest of the world was no matter how big you are, how tall, how successful you are, you can get caught and be dealt with.
Fahey said doping is not just a problem in successful sporting countries like Kenya and Jamaica, but rejected the notion performance-enhancing drugs were beginning to ruin sport.
There had been a suggestion that certain countries could be banned from the Olympics if they refused to comply with anti-doping programs -- raising the prospect of Jamaica's six-time Olympic champion Usain Bolt missing out -- but Fahey said that was for the International Olympic Committee to determine.
