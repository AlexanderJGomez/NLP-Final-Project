CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (CNN) -- Nine bodies have been found in a common grave in the desert south of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, according to Chihuahua state prosecutor's spokeswoman Daniela Gonzalez.
Extreme violence among warring drug cartels and the Mexican government has long plagued Juarez and the state of Chihuahua, but the situation has been getting worse.
Enrique Torres, spokesman for the Chihuahua Joint Operation, said by Sunday there will be 7,500 military personnel, 2,300 federal police and 1,600 city police working together to patrol the city and aggressively fight the cartels.
Torres said the city has been preparing for a year to "clean up the local police."
To prevent corruption among the just arrived soldiers, Torres said they will be frequently rotated.
"The majority of the weapons used for homicides here have been identified as coming from the United States" he said.
"It is so easy there for organized crime to get access to these types of weapons.
