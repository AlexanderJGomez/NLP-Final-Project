"It was a tough close for sure but whole match was tough," Federer said.
Tsonga fought back twice from being a set down and saved four match points, but as so often, Federer prevailed in the deciding fifth set, breaking the Frenchman in the fourth game before going on to serve out the match.
"Today was the best I've played so far," Murray said afterwards.
I knew I had to be sharp.
