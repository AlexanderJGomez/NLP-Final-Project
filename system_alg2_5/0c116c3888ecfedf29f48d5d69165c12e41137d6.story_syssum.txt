Or would such measures lead people to come to games to get the match abandoned," Blatter said in a speech at a meeting of the company Early Warning System, with which FIFA works in its fight against match-fixing.

Also on Friday, FIFA confirmed that Brazil will not be completely ready to host June's Confederations Cup -- a precursor event to next year's World Cup in the South American country.
There will be 12 grounds used at the 32-team World Cup, which will host 64 matches -- four times that of the eight-nation Confederations Cup.
There will be no compromise."
