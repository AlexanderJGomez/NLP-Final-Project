A metal fragment from the doomed Hindenburg airship, a signed photo of vanished pilot Amelia Earhart and items brought to the moon on the Apollo lunar missions are among hundreds of aviation- and space-related artifacts going on the auction block.
Seventy items from Apollo 11 -- the first manned mission to land on the moon -- will be offered, including pieces from the personal collections of Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins.
And many items that return from space missions are stored away in private collections or donated to museums, which is why rare auctions of spaceflight memorabilia draw interest from aviation enthusiasts.
"Objects coming directly from moon walkers and that have been in private collections since returning to Earth are unquestionably the most sought after," said Bobby Livingston, executive vice present of RR Auction.
