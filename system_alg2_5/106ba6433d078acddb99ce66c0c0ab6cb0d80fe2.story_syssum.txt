(The Hollywood Reporter)Sam Simon, the nine-time Emmy Award-winning comedy writer and producer who helped develop "The Simpsons," made millions after leaving the show in 1993 and then donated his riches to charity, has died, his foundation announced on Facebook.
" Simon said with a laugh on Marc Maron's WTF podcast that first ran in May 2013.
A cartoonist and Stanford graduate, Simon developed "The Simpsons" with Matt Groening (who came up with the characters based on his family) and producer James L. Brooks.
'What are they thinking?'
"I remember Sam coming into the room, and me pitching to him and initially being really intimidated," O'Brien told Vanity Fair in 2007.
If I could make Sam laugh, I was excited."
He was in his mid-30s.
"The sort of lifetime achievement stuff that I'm getting now is kind of like Tom Sawyer's funeral because they all know I'm sick," Simon told THR's Gary Baum.
Simon, who won eight of his Emmys for writing/producing "The Simpsons" (many after he left) and one for producing "The Tracey Ullman Show," was married to and divorced from actress Jennifer Tilly (1984 to 1991) and Playboy Playmate Jami Ferrell (for mere weeks in 2000).
Another time, Elvis Presley returned the dog that Simon had lost.
During his chat with Maron, Simon noted that the way to know when to put down your ailing dog is to "list the three things he loves to do.
"One of my three things is laying in bed and watching TV.
