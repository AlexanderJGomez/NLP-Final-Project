(CNN) -- Wildlife officials in Colorado say they have killed a bear believed to have been involved in an attack on a teenage boy Friday morning.
The bear entered a tent occupied by a teenage boy and at least one other person early Friday.
The bear was then chased away by the teen and other campers at the site.
The bear kept getting more and more aggressive and I didn't think I would have lived if he didn't run," Voss told the affiliate.
Earlier this month, a man was killed in a grizzly bear attack in Wyoming's Yellowstone Park.
