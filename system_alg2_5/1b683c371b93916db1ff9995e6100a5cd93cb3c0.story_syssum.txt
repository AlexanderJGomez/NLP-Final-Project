(CNN) -- When the HMS Birkenhead, a British ship carrying troops, began to sink off the coast of South Africa in 1852, the captain and military officers on board famously allowed women and children to board the lifeboats first.
Lee Joon-seok of the Sewol, the South Korean ferry that sunk last week, has come under heavy criticism for abandoning the ship while hundreds of passengers remained on board.
Witnesses said Schettino jumped into a lifeboat to flee the ship, even though hundreds of passengers were still on board.
"The captain's first obligation is for the safety of his crew and passengers," Capt.
An international maritime convention on the safety of life at sea makes a captain responsible for the vessel and all the people on board, but it doesn't stipulate that the captain stay on the ship throughout the crisis.
Some countries, including Italy and South Korea, make abandoning ship a maritime crime.
Schettino and Lee are not alone in leaving a doomed ship before their passengers, though.
Its captain was reported to have abandoned the ship at the first opportunity, but he died the following year of "a broken heart" according to a report in The New York Times.
Lee's early departure may have exacerbated the crisis on board the ship, said Doherty, who teaches safety management at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy.
Although U.S. law doesn't specify abandoning ship as a crime, it's a long-standing tradition that the captain be the last one off a sinking ship, according to legal experts.
"Generally speaking, the captain is the last person to get off that vessel," Staples said.
He praises the security a ship provides to its passengers.
