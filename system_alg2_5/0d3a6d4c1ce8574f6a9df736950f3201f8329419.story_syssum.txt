Chaifetz posted the recording online Monday, which has since led to disciplinary actions, including the removal of at least one teacher, school officials said.
Chaifetz said he reached out to school officials to report the alleged actions of the teacher and her aides.
Chaifetz said an earlier meeting with school officials about his son's behavior prompted the decision to place the recording device in the boy's pocket.
It was unlike his son to misbehave and hit his teachers, Chaifetz said, though he had difficulty getting answers from Akian because he struggles with speaking.
