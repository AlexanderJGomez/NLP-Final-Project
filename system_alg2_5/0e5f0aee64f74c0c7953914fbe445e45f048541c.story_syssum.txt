"Watchmen" led the weekend box office, grossing $55.7 million during its first weekend.
And aside from that theater-count statistic (which almost any film could break at any time, really), there will be no major records to report on this weekend (for example, "Watchmen's" debut was just the fifth-best opening ever for an R-rated movie).
2) grossed $8.8 million on its third weekend; the film, Perry's biggest yet at the box office, has banked $76.5 million to date.
3) also moved along like the unstoppable force it has been for more than a month now, earning $7.5 million and bringing its six-week sum to $118 million.
5) took its eight-week total to $133.6 million thanks to another $4.2 million gross.
So, all in all, I'd say today's was a good report, indeed.
