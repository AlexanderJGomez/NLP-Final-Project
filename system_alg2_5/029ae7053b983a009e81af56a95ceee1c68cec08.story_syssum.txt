Washington (CNN) -- In what one member of Congress called "a charade," a couple that showed up at President Obama's first state dinner -- uninvited, the White House claims -- declined to answer questions surrounding the event before a House committee Wednesday.
"The Constitution protects fools," Lungren said.
"This was not a hearing looking for information," the couple's attorney, Stephen Best, told reporters after the hearing.
"Were you there?"
Salahi's wife, Michaele, also invoked her Fifth Amendment right under questioning by committee members, but replied, "yes," when asked if she would return to testify after the investigation has concluded.
Best said after the hearing the couple received "representations that they relied upon" that they were invited guests.

There also was criticism of the White House in Wednesday's hearing.
"I don't know what the White House is trying to hide," King said.
"They are Americans," he said.
