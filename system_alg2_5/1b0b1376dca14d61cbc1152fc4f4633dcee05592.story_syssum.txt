Italian Luca Moneta is one of the world's leading show jumpers but has been labeled by his peers "The Carrot Man" for his novel approach to training horses.
It doesn't work'.
For Moneta, the first sighting of this more novel approach to riding and training horses came from watching an unnamed British rider on a clip jumping a barrel without a bridle.
Moneta fully accepts he was ridiculed for a time but, as his success continues, he expects others to follow suit.
"When I started with horses, people were just hard with them.
"Why not?"
For him, it is simple horse play with or without the results in competition.
