Her tight-knit Irish-American family lives on New York's Rockaway Peninsula in the Belle Harbor neighborhood of Queens, where a powerful mix of converging weather systems flattened homes on October 29.
After each storm surge, she uploaded photos of the aftermath to Facebook, keeping Rigaut abreast of the condition of her home.
By late evening on October 29, it became clear that Sandy had rendered the Rigaut family homeless.
Having that fabric of the family in the same neighborhood," she said.
"For us, it's like the house died, but we didn't," she said.
"On top of all of this sadness, we are struggling with the insurance companies," said Rigaut, whose family is now holed up in a rental home in southern New Jersey.
But with a daughter who is "borderline asthmatic," the Rigauts say they plan to stay only one night.
The remains of their home will now likely join the massive garbage heaps along the Rockaway shore, adding to potential health concerns.
