This is "an extremely important issue of trust between the European Union and the United States," said Claude Moraes, head of the nine-member European Union delegation tasked with investigating disclosures of American spying on European leaders and citizens.
"This old chestnut of 'spying has always happened' just can't stand," he said.
"I have trust in the United States and its democracy," Kirkhope told reporters.
Meanwhile, U.S. intelligence leaders began to publicly push back Tuesday against the European complaints.
"We need to look at and make sure that we are not just gathering intelligence because we can, but we're gathering it because we need it," White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Tuesday, echoing similar comments earlier by Obama in an interview with Fusion TV.
