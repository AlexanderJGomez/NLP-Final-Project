(CNN) -- More than 160 protesters were arrested Sunday during a violent opposition strike in Bangladesh, police said.
Iqbal Khan Chowdhury, additional home secretary for Bangladesh, told CNN that road traffic in the city of Dhaka was relatively less.
The BNP accuses her government of failure in dealing with corruption and of suppressing opposition voices.
In the meantime, the BNP's Alamgir said his party would hold a public meeting Monday in Dhaka as a mark of protest.
