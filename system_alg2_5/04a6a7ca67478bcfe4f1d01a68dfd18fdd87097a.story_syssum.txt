BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN)  -- After 17 hours, Kerri Gannon and her husband were still stranded in an airport in Bangkok, Thailand, Wednesday, trying to find a way home to the United States after the facility was occupied by crowds of protesters and closed.

Protesters blockaded people trying to get to one of the airports.
"When we took the exit there were lots of tourists standing around wondering what they were going to do."
"As more and more tourists leave [the airport], the fact that we don't have any information and there's no one to give us information, now we feel stranded here and we don't know where to go," Gannon said.
The airlines have also been mum on the situation, Gannon said, making it difficult for them to decide whether to wait it out at the airport or try to find a hotel.
"We are just trying to go home, get back to work and Thanksgiving."
