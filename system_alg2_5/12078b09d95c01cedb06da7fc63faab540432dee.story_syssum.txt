I see signs of a revolution everywhere.
I see a revolution that is burning white hot among young people, but also shows up among the parents and grandparents in my kids' school.
I see this medical marijuana revolution in surprising places.
"Marijuana...?"
Even as a grown man, mom can still make my cheeks turn red and shatter my confidence with a single word.
I had my own turn around a couple of years ago, and at the time it was a lonely place to hold a supportive position on medical marijuana.
Even worse, I didn't even know if they would care.
This time around, you will hear from the heads of government agencies earnestly sharing their point of view, both Democratic and Republican senators, and even the President of the United States.
Make no mistake, we have plenty of evidence that the approval and support of the federal government can fast track a revolution at a faster pace than we have yet seen.
There are no shortage of examples where the federal government has been a guardian of our public health needs, and you could argue that medical marijuana would also qualify as a worthwhile investment.
As I sat across from Sens.
They want it now.
They want it now.
I needed to remind them that people, long before me or them, have been trying to do many of these same things for 40 years, and had been rejected every time.
Take a good look at the data, educate yourself and talk to the patients, who are often out of options and find their hope in the form of a simple plant.
At some point, common sense prevails.
And, we should do it now.
