Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Sandiaga Uno is without doubt one of Indonesia's richest men.
Struggling to provide for his family, Uno decided against the odds to set up his own business and with four staff in a tiny office, Saratoga Capital was born.
"I knew when Asia came out of the crisis energy would be in high demand.
Despite all this success, Uno believes the country's wealth is not being evenly distributed.
He says corruption is the number one problem holding his country back, a view shared by many in the international community.
"The money is there, we just need the government to sort out the land acquisition problem among other things which will require changes in the law and then we can start building the infrastructure Indonesia so desperately needs," he said.
He describes how impressed he was with the U.S. President who spoke to him in Bahasa and believes the leader of the free world knows just how important Indonesia has become.
"We are so rich in resources but we can't even produce.
I think in the next four to five years Indonesia must be able to generate that expertise."
