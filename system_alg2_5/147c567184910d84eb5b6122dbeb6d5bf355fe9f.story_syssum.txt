Nicknamed the "accidental millionaire," Hui "Leo" Gao made headlines three years ago after he and his girlfriend fled the country when he accidentally received access to $10 million New Zealand dollars (U.S.$7 million).
The next day, Gao discovered the error in his bank account and told his girlfriend, Kara Hurring that he was "fâ€”ing rich" and had millions of dollars, according to court documents.
After transferring money to overseas accounts in the names of his mother, his girlfriend and himself, Gao fled to Hong Kong in April 2009.
Westpac, the Australian bank, recovered about $2.9 million from the couple's New Zealand accounts, but has yet to recoup the remaining $3.8 million.
The bank had no comment.
