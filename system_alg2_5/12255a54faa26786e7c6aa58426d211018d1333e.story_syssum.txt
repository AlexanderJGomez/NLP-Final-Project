Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- A battle raged in a strategically located Libyan city Saturday as state television showed a fist-pumping Moammar Gadhafi visiting a school, his first public appearance in days.
Opposition spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah told CNN that rebels flew two attack helicopters from Tobruk to join the fighting in Ajdabiya.
The African Union's special committee on Libya -- represented by Mauritania, Congo Republic, Mali, Uganda and South Africa -- will then travel to the Libyan rebel stronghold of Benghazi to meet with the opposition leaders Sunday and Monday, according to the South African government.
Libya also holds a seat on the 15-member Peace and Security Council.
State TV also aired images Gadhafi visiting on Saturday what appeared to be a primary school in Tripoli.
Weldon visited Libya in 2004 when he was a Republican congressman from Pennsylvania and said he was invited this time by Gadhafi.
At one point, opposition fighters appeared to have all but lost again territory that was hard won.
"The troops of Gadhafi have good weapons and have training and have leadership and have experience," one rebel fighter said.
