Among violent incidents reported to police, murders were down about 0.7 percent, robberies dropped 4 percent, aggravated assaults declined 3.9 percent, and forcible rapes were down 2.5 percent.
Despite the positive trend, crime remains a serious problem in many urban pockets riddled with gangs, drugs, and poverty.
Guns were used in two thirds of the nation's murders last year, 41 percent of robberies, and 21 percent of aggravated assaults, the report showed.
The FBI crime statistics differed from a telephone crime survey released by the Justice Department early this month.
He also noted the increase that the Justice Department reported was from an all-time low in the crime rate the previous year, suggesting crime is entering a low level where police officials hope it will stay for some time.
