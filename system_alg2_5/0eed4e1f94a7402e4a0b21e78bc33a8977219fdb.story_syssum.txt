"These were frightening days," current boss Bob Dudley told the BBC, which aired "BP: $30 Billion Blowout" on Tuesday.
"It is very difficult to hate a company," said Hayward, conceding BP contingency plans were inadequate.
Hayward said the company can restore the environment and jobs, but not the lives of those who died on the Deepwater Horizon.
Referencing his own earlier remarks about "culture of complacency," Reilly said, "all three companies we heard from displayed it," Reilly said.
Commission co-chairman Bob Graham, a former U.S. senator from Florida, cited a culture that failed to ensure safety.
The disaster began April 20 with an explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drill rig, which was completing the well for BP at the time of the blast.
"There seemed to be a compulsion to get this rig completed in that April 19, April 20 time period," Graham said Monday.
"I think it would probably be much more effective if [training] drills were regularly conducted along these lines on the rigs that were doing the operations with the crews."
"We seek to go beyond compliance, to create a culture in which employees are not only meeting the safety procedures, but they are challenging them so they can be improved where needed."
