The seizure is just one of thousands of highway stops that state and local authorities call "interdictions:" Roadside stops aimed at catching drug dealers or even terrorists, but which can also result in cash seizures alone with no criminal charges attached.
It's called Civil Asset Forfeiture, and it was started in the early 1980s by the Justice Department.
It's a simple premise that the government should not be taking money from people who have done nothing wrong.
Now, however, they are suing to get the rest of the money back and have asked for unspecified damages.
In a small Nevada county two hours driving time east of Reno, a single deputy sheriff has been responsible for more than a dozen cash seizures in 2014 alone, according to a lawsuit filed on behalf of motorists whose money was taken.
One of them said their colleague, Dove, "had been going through a tough time" and had called them to complain about our presence.
The Justice Department recently said it was backing away from the civil asset forfeiture actions it had been taking for nearly three decades.
"With this new policy, effective immediately, the Justice Department is taking an important step to prohibit federal agency adoptions of state and local seizures, except for public safety reasons," said Attorney General Eric Holder.
