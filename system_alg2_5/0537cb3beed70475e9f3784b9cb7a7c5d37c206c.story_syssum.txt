"(The Palestinians) were throwing stones, and the (Israeli) soldiers throw the tear gas.
Plastic bullets," Zayed said.
But an Israeli military spokesman say its forces fired no live rounds during hours of clashes on May 15.
The Israeli forces responded with volleys of tear gas while periodically firing rubber-coated bullets from their rifles.
At 1:45 p.m. May 15, Zayed's security camera caught the moment when one of the stone-throwing boys was mortally wounded.
Though Khadder didn't know it at the time, he was filming two Israeli security troops firing their rifles at the Palestinian protesters at the same exact moment when Nouwarah was shot.
At 2:58 p.m., the security cameras filmed a second fatal shooting.
The boy was shot just a few steps from where Nouwarah had been wounded.
Nouwarah's father, Siam, told CNN he had expressly instructed his eldest son not to attend the Nakba protests.
"We were surprised when we took the school backpack back from the hospital to find this bullet inside," said the elder Nouwarah.
He then pulled a small used bullet stored in a plastic bag out of the backpack.
Regarding the CNN video of the Israeli security forces firing rifles at the Palestinian demonstrators at the moment when Nouwarah was shot, Lerner said the weapons being used had an attachment at the end of the barrel for firing rubber-coated projectiles.
Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department has joined several human rights groups calling for an investigation into the deadly incident.
