-- use of 3-D technology.
Of course, that might also be because no movie ever needed 3-D less than "Titanic."
As scrupulous a job as Cameron has done, I can't really say that I recommend "Titanic 3D" in order to experience this landmark movie with an added dimension.
That's "Titanic."
What a difference one global economic meltdown and the rise of our own gilded one percent makes!
Some have called it callow, but I implore you to go back and see Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in this movie and watch how dazzlingly spontaneous and multi-faceted their chemistry is.
In recent years, a hint of off-putting harshness has crept into Winslet's work (in "Revolutionary Road" and "Mildred Pierce," she did too much gloomy suffering for our sins), but in "Titanic" she plays Rose as a spiky princess, trapped by privilege, who allows herself to melt like a girl and, in doing so, melts her own prison and finds herself as a woman.
Rose, with her hint of a Jane Austen dilemma (if she follows her bliss and goes off with Jack, it will leave her family in ruins), is the young feminist who now has the peril, as well as pleasure, of choice.
To watch "Titanic" again is to do nothing less than enter a movie and come out the other side, with one's spirit feeling just a little bit larger.
