Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The three security guards and the driver of an American development expert who was abducted in Pakistan on Saturday have been detained for questioning, a police official said Monday.
As Weinstein's security guards prepared for the meal before the Ramadan fast early Saturday, three men knocked at the front gate and offered food for the meal -- a traditional practice among Muslims during the Ramadan holy month, according to senior Lahore police official Tajamal Hussain.
The men tied up the three security guards and duct-taped their mouths, he said.
U.S. Embassy officials are working with Pakistani authorities on the case, Embassy spokesman Alberto Rodriguez said Saturday.
Weinstein's abduction follows another high-profile incident involving an American in Lahore.
