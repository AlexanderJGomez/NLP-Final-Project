The video sparked protests worldwide, starting in Egypt and Libya, and then spreading to other countries.
As things become clearer, it seems that the video was created and promoted by members of the American Coptic Christian community -- a community with its roots in Egypt.
In response, the Coptic Church, both in Egypt as well as in the United States, insisted that it has nothing to do with the video.
Sadek's personal actions have nothing to do with the Coptic Church or the Coptic-American community.
The Muslim community at large is not responsible for the violence, and it should not be expected to apologize for the actions of some of its members.
The violent actions of a comparatively small number of individuals do not represent all Muslims, just as the video does not represent the views of all Coptic Christians.
It provided an ideological base for Anders Breivik, recently convicted of mass murder in Norway.
The least we can do now is to make sure not to blame the wrong people for the vile actions of a few individuals.
