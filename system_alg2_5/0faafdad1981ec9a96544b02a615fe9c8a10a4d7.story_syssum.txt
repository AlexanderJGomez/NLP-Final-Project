(CNN) -- Standing in the shadow of the Burj Dubai Kye Ho Kim of Samsung Construction rattles off the list of records the building will break.
As the project is metaphoric for the strength of Samsung Construction, the company itself symbolizes the growth of South Korea onto the world stage.
Some of Korea's more impressive building projects are happening at home.
"Under construction today is about $10 billion" of the project, said Chris Sausser, executive vice president of Gale International.
"Green growth is not a plan B, it is plan A," said Kim Sang Hyup, executive director of the Green Growth Committee.
