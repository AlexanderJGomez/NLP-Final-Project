(CNN) -- "Out of an abundance of caution," American Airlines said Tuesday it would inspect 47 Boeing 757 airplanes after seats on two of the company's jetliners came loose.
Not all of the seats were loose, the company said, but they had the potential to become so.
Earlier Tuesday, an American Airlines flight from Chicago to London made an unscheduled landing at Shannon Airport in Ireland after a passenger reported a smoky odor, an airline spokesman said.
Since then, the pilots have been engaging in what the airline calls a slowdown that has caused the number of flights that are delayed and canceled to skyrocket.
Late Tuesday, a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association said it would resume contract negotiations with the airline.
"Problems related to seats are less likely a labor problem, but rather a management issue related to outsourcing work to third-party facilities," he said.
