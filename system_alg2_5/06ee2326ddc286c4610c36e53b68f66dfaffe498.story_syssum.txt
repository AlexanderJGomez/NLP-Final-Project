FAIRBURN, Georgia (CNN) -- In a south Atlanta neighborhood lined with palatial homes and manicured lots, the Hicks family was living out its American dream.
"I've always been looking in this subdivision, but never thought we could afford a home here," Terese Hicks said.
It all seemed like a dream come true, until the couple learned the interest rate on their loan would readjust in just six months, making the loan a short three-year ARM.
Struggling to pay the new adjusted mortgage, Terese Hicks appealed to their mortgage company, Homecomings which is owned by GMAC, for help.
"They said there was nothing they could do about the rate readjusting, so I said let's weather the storm and see what we can do," she said.
At the time of the Hickses request for a loan modification, investors backing the loans required some proof of financial difficulty.
"We advise homebuyers not to talk to a realtor or lender before we can meet with them for a Mortgage Profile Meeting," said Griffin.
During the recent housing crisis, Griffin says people of color have become "easy prey" because they often don't know the right questions to ask about subprime and ARM loans.
Griffin believes families like the Hicks could have qualified for a better, less risky loan and should have been better informed about the terms of their loan.
The Hicks family learned that they qualified for President Obama's new homeownership assistance program.
"People don't know where to go and who to talk to," says Griffin.
