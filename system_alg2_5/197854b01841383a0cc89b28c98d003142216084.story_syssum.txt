Blockbusters like "Finding Nemo" and Dreamworks' franchise "Shrek" have turned animation into a multi-billion-dollar industry, and a market once dominated by Disney is becoming crowded with competition.
And when Pixar merged with Disney he became one of the most powerful players in the movie business.
But while Pixar and Disney may be the giants of animation they face formidable competition from another box-office monster -- Shrek.
Everything is inverted.
And the polar climate has also been kind to Warner Brothers with last year's Oscar-winning "Happy Feet" charming audiences around the world with a tale of dancing penguins, while the Tom Hanks-voiced "The Polar Express" also scored well on its way to becoming a seasonal stocking-filler on DVD.
"The Simpsons Movie" is the world's longest-running animated television series, and fans have eagerly awaited its move to the big screen.
"Happy Feet" is a Warner Bros. film; Warner Bros., like CNN, is a unit of Time Warner.
