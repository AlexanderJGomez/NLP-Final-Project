The rebels contend that the peacekeepers entered a Syrian village near the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, an area where peacekeepers should not be and where intense fighting has been raging for days between rebels and government forces.
In one, a rebel insists that the peacekeepers will be held until al-Assad's forces withdraw from the village of al-Jamlah, where there has been heavy fighting.
The 21 peacekeepers are Filipino, the Philippine government said Thursday.
"The blood of the people of Syria will be a curse on the whole world if there" is "no effective action," it said.
There has been "hardly a Syrian village spared from the regime bombing" the letter said.
Tayar, 50, told CNN he saw 19 burned bodies at the scene of the blast.
Smoke billowed in the distance from a burning car.
"I thinks it's the regime who killed those people, and that is because the regime wants to take revenge against Raqqa because that it's the first province that was fully liberated," Tayar told CNN.
