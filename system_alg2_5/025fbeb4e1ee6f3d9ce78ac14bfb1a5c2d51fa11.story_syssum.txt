The armed forces also are accused of funneling money from diamond fields to President Robert Mugabe's party.
"Three men in army uniform jumped into my car and asked me to drive them back to the mining area," Chiso said.
"The police and army have turned this peaceful area into a nightmare of lawlessness and horrific violence," Gagnon said.
Separately, Human Rights Watch has accused the armed forces of funneling money from the fields into ZANU-PF, President Robert Mugabe's party.
"The money will not be handled by any party but by the Treasury," he said.
