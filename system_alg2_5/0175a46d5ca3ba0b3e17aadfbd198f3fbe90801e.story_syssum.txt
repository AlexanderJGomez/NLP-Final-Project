Stephen Colbert's trip to Iraq, facilitated by the USO, was six months in the planning.
The organization, which was founded in 1941 to bring comfort and entertainment to America's men and women in uniform, has been focusing its support on American troops stationed around the world, particularly those in the military theaters of Iraq and Afghanistan, said Phillips.
"We try to keep our footprint small," she said, noting that the organization is reliant on the military to feed and house its guests.
He also put in a plug for USO donations: "The USO does more than bring my show to Baghdad," Colbert said on the show.
"What we try to do is give the soldiers -- the people that are out there putting their lives on the line for our country ... we try to say, one day if you come to Los Angeles, if you want to be a comedian, our door is open to you.
Toby Keith has gone on at least seven USO tours; "He insists on going to the smallest, most remote places," said Phillips.
"I've participated in several USO tours over the years and I've seen firsthand their sacrifice.
At its core, Phillips said, the USO remains dedicated to the needs of U.S. service members.
