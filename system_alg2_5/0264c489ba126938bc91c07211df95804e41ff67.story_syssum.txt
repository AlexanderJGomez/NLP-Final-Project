WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton said Sunday she won't vote for any more money to support the four-year-old war in Iraq without a plan to start bringing U.S. troops home.
May's spending bill made continued U.S. support contingent on a set of benchmarks for Iraq's government.
Nearly two-thirds of the American public now opposes the war, according to a CNN-Opinion Research poll conducted in early September.
