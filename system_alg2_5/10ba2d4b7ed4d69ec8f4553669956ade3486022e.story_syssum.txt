A new Field Poll, released at the end of February, provides the evidence of what many of us here on the left coast have been sensing over the last 4Â½ years: When it comes to same-sex marriage, many California voters want a do-over.
The "pro" figure represents a big jump from 2008 when the Field Poll showed that 51% of California voters approved of same sex-marriage.
I now understand that we can't have a two-tiered system, where some of us enjoy the right to marry and our brothers and sisters and cousins don't, based solely on sexual orientation.
In 2000, another ballot initiative -- Proposition 22, which defined marriage as between a man and a woman -- was approved by 61% of California voters.
California voters approved the measure, 52% to 48% -- and in doing so, betrayed their own liberal reputation.
One of the main messages behind these ads was that, if same-sex marriage were legal, it would somehow creep its way into the public schools through the curriculum.
I remember one television ad that showed a little girl who hurried home from school and excitedly told her mother that she was reading a book about a prince who didn't marry a princess because he settled on marrying another prince.
But, as we have learned time and again, fear doesn't listen to facts.
In the poll, 57% of Americans now say that they have a family member or close friend who is gay or lesbian.
Speaking of this issue being close to home for many of us, among those attending the arguments will be Chief Justice John Roberts' lesbian cousin who lives in California.
