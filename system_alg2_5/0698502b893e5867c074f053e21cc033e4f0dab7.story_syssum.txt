Mizoram, India (CNN) -- The world's population hits 7 billion this week, but Ziona, the patriarch of what may be the biggest family in the world, is not bothered.
Ziona's father, Chana, founded the Christian sect in Baktwang village that promotes polygamy as God's will.
Four hours away from Mizoram's only airport, in the isolated village of Baktwang, Ziona's bright purple house with 22 bedrooms stands out.
"There is no discrimination amongst us, he treats us all equally," fifth wife Twangi says.
Like a well-oiled machine, everyone carries out their individual chore, so dinner for 160 is ready within an hour and utensils are washed and put away within minutes.
But while he likes living in a big family, he himself doesn't want more than one wife.
But for me, having one wife and one son is quite enough.
"My father is the greatest god that we can have in this world, he has done so much for us," says his eldest son Nunparliana, who has two wives and 14 children.
The family is not listed in the Guinness Book of World Records because Ziona says he doesn't want the publicity.
But as word gets out, Baktwang village and Ziona's family may not remain so isolated.
