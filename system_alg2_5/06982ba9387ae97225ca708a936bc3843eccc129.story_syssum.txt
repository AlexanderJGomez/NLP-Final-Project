Hamid Dabashi says protesters in Iran would be harmed by U.S. aid to "promote democracy" in that nation.
This has been particularly admirable given the pressure that is coming his way from a U.S. Congress that -- up until the night before the Iranian presidential election -- was discussing even more severe economic sanctions on Iran, which would have hurt precisely the young men and women the legislators now seem too eager to support.
The only thing it needs is the moral voice of the American civil rights movement to come to its aid.
From the same fund I would establish an annual prize for 100 best essays on a contemporary Islamic society written by a junior from a public high school.
I would call it the Rosa Parks-Neda Aqa Soltan Prize for Non-Violent Civil Rights Movement.
But the other three swords are held over this movement from outside Iran, in fact from the United States government.
By wedding the freshly cut flower of Neda Aqa-Soltan's young life in the fertile soil of Rosa Parks' memory, Iranians and Americans will finally come together in their common dreams of basic human decency.
