The weekly Friday concert had started at 2 p.m. "just like normal," recalled Joseph Silverstein, then a 29-year-old violinist in his first year as the concertmaster for the Boston Symphony Orchestra.
And that, Silverstein recalled, is when this very normal day was shattered.
As the group walked to the concert hall, several orchestra members openly wept, but Silverstein says they still managed to take their seats.
Seated at the end of a row, closest to the audience, Silverstein watched the stunned people react to the news.
Cabot, who regularly attended the Friday afternoon concerts, told the audience a story about the death of his father, according to Silverstein saying that he had "needed to hear music to help through the tragedy" because of the "solace" music provides.
Once the program was over, the remaining audience members stood and filed solemnly out of the hall.
The shooting of the president was the "first time anyone of us had been confronted with the situation," he said.
