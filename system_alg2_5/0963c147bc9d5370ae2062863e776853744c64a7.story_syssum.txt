TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- When Japanese police arrested three sumo wrestlers and their stable master on Thursday over allegations they beat a 17-year-old wrestler to death, the case sent shockwaves across a country that links its national identity to the sport.
Takashi Saito, 17, collapsed at his sumo stable and was rushed to the hospital.
Police say on June 25, Yamamoto instructed the wrestlers to beat the boy using sticks and a metal bat.
The results of an autopsy conducted last year by Niigata University concluded that Saito died of shock caused by multiple injuries.
"These are bad apples who took it too far."
