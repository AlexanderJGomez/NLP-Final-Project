Polcari had just been laid off from her job, and now she and her husband were looking at an $850 bill.
Of all times?'
But now, they didn't know what to do.
"It's to prevent dogs from being surrendered to shelters or euthanized when their owners cannot afford care," said Marlo Manning, who founded Fairy DogParents.
And it's just one more thing that they can't afford.
...
Manning knows how much an ailing dog can cost.
Over time, the costs for Ladybug's medicine, vet bills and special food averaged about $300 to $400 a month, Manning said.
"
I said, 'I have to do something.'
"
I chose to find a way to sponsor other people who could not afford to keep their dog.
"The money is given directly to the vet or pharmacy," Manning said.
"A lot of the people that we sponsor ... have already lost so much that the one thing they try to hang on to is their dog," Manning said.
Manning says 75% of the grants her group has awarded have paid for emergency treatment that spared the dogs from being euthanized.
This dog is with its family and never had to go into a shelter," Manning said, beaming.
The dog doesn't even know we exist, and we're just making sure it gets to the ball."
