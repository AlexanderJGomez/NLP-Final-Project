Jaycee Dugard is reuniting with her close relatives for the first time in 18 years, after having been found on August 27.
In concealing the boy, Wilfong violated the terms of a court order that granted joint custody of the child to Michael Chekevdia, the documents said.
"This is a joyful time for my family," she said.
After allegedly being confined for 18 years, Dugard probably would find the outside world frightening, Lebow said.
Learning to live with and even like the perpetrator has survival value, Napoletano said, and also explains why someone like Dugard probably would feel somewhat torn about returning to her original family.
It is also important to know how Dugard felt about her family before she was taken away, Tabin said.
Lebow said.
The situation is likely also difficult for Dugard's two daughters, born to her in captivity, who have never met Dugard's family before, Napoletano said.
Dugard's reuniting with her family could also be likened to a soldier coming back from a "hellacious war," Lebow said.
When service members come home, they may find life "shallower," and feel that they are not the same people as when they left, she said.
Don't force the person who has been away to talk about their experiences, Napoletano said.
