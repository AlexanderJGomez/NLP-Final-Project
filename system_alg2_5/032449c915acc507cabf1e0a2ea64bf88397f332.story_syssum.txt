Los Angeles (CNN) -- The remaining plaintiff in the sexual battery lawsuit against John Travolta fired his lawyer, but the case could continue with another lawyer and another court, two lawyers told CNN on Thursday.
Allred said Tuesday that she and John Doe #1 would discuss if a new lawsuit would be filed against Travolta.
That dismissal was "without prejudice, which means that he is still legally entitled to file a lawsuit against John Travolta if he chooses," Allred said.
"John Doe 1 and John Doe 2 contacted my offices and neither I nor anyone in my law firm solicited either of these two clients.
"Clients come to me," Allred said.
"I will find out what's in that settlement and I will get my equitable share of that settlement, because I did the majority of the work to get to where we are," he said.
