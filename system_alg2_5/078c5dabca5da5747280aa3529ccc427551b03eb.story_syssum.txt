"Ghost Protocol," the fourth entry in the action franchise, has now cumulatively tallied $134.1 million, surpassing the final gross of "Mission: Impossible III" ($134 million).
In second place was "Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," which rose 9 percent for $22.1 million.
This is because the first "Sherlock Holmes" opened on Christmas weekend, thereby inflating its initial figures.
In its first full weekend, Steven Spielberg's equine epic "War Horse" finished fourth with $16.9 million.
Finally, in fifth, was David Fincher's "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo," which rose 28 percent for $16.3 million.
