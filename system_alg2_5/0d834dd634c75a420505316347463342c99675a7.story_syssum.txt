(CNN) -- Five-time world champions Brazil needed to come from two goals down to beat underdogs the United States 3-2 in the final of the Confederations Cup in South Africa on Sunday night.
But Bob Bradley's U.S. team, beaten 3-0 by Brazil in the group stage, took a shock lead when Dempsey found space in the penalty area to guide home Jonathan Spector's fierce right-wing cross for his third goal of the tournament.
Howard then saved a low angled shot from Fabiano, then the Sevilla forward headed over the bar 10 minutes before the interval.
Howard denied Fabiano when clear through on goal in the 70th minute, but soon after the forward was on hand to poach the leveler.
Coach Dunga has now presided over seven wins in 20 days, with five at the Confederations Cup and two in World Cup qualifiers.
