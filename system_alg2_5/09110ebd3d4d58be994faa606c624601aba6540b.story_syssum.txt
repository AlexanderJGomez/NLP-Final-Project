Washington (CNN) -- New documents made public this week about possible Secret Service misconduct include allegations of sexual abuse, domestic violence, drunken behavior and guns being accidentally discharged.
Another allegation made October 23, 2003, said that an agent forced a female acquaintance to have non-consensual sex with him at a hotel in Killeen, Texas.
According to the log note, the agent said he got a phone number "from a woman handing out fliers on the street and called it out of curiosity."
A redacted October 7, 2010, entry with no specifics says there was a report a Secret Service employee might have been involved in the leak of national security information.
He said all the hotline reports were noted and passed on to the Secret Service.
"While some of the allegations proved to be unfounded or frivolous, others appear to be legitimate, and that adds to my concern about apparent misconduct by some of the personnel of this vital law enforcement agency," said Collins, whose committee is investigating the Colombia incident.
Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan testified before Collins and other members of the committee last month that the behavior by employees in Colombia was the result of poor choices by a dozen agents who were drinking heavily.
Three others were cleared of serious misconduct.
