(CNN) -- Kyle White now has two pieces of metal to wear -- one, a bracelet inscribed with the names of his six comrades killed in an ambush in Afghanistan, the other, a Medal of Honor given to him for his valor that ensured that death toll wasn't higher.
"Kyle, members of Chosen Company, you did your duty," Obama said.
A high school freshman when the Twin Towers fell on September 11, 2001, White joined the Army and was just 20 years old and 21 months into his military service when he faced the ultimate test.
His service had, like many other members of the military, earned him a ticket to Afghanistan as his platoon's radio telephone operator.
Taking so much fire, members of his patrol were separated as they tried to take cover.
White administered first aid to one wounded soldier using the only cover available: a single tree.
White ran toward him, braving enemy fire.
White had to see, he said.
He was dead.
"I told myself from the beginning that I was going to be killed, you know... just the amount of fire ...
"I remember just red hot chunks of metal like the size of my palm just flinging by your head," he told Stars and Stripes.
"It's something you still think about every day," White said.
White first returned home and trained other paratrooopers.
Service members deserve a leader who is all in, he explained.
"Without the team," he said, "there could be no Medal of Honor.
