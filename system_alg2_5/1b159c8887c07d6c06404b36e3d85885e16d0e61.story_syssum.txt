Add Southwest Airlines to the list of U.S. airlines that have received Federal Aviation Administration approval to allow passengers to use many portable electronic devices in all phases of flight.
Other airlines are moving to get FAA approval to allow greater electronic use.
Spirit Airlines was less specific about its time frame.
Those airlines have to get their own FAA approval.
Some folks had a sense of humor about the device debate.
