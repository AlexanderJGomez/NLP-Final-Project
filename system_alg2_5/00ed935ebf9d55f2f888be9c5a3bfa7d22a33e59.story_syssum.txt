(CNN)  -- A Utah man trapped for more than 26 hours in a crevice of a popular cave tourist attraction died as rescuers struggled to save him, authorities said Thursday.
The crevice is about 150 feet below the surface and about 700 feet from the cave entrance, according to the sheriff's department.
"Getting people to him is very difficult," Cannon told KSL before Jones died.
Up to 5,000 people visit each year, the site said.
