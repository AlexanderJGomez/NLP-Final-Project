Chip Starnes, co-founder and president of Specialty Medical Supplies China, has been trapped in the company's suburban Beijing factory since Friday.
Starnes said the problem came when workers who already moved to another division also wanted severance packages.
There is no reason to be doing this other than bad information," he said.
I am in the process of trying to fix that, but the demands and the amount of money that it is taking to do that puts the company in a bad situation, so there has got to be some compromise."
Capella said the company has offered protesting employees a lesser severance package if they want to leave.
