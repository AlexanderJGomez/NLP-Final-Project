Hadiya was only 18 years old when she became interested in Hizb ut Tahrir, a radical Islamic group.
As a member of Hizb ut Tahir, Hadiya held regular talks and tried to recruit others to the group.
Sometime toward the end of her 10-year involvement with Hizb ut Tahrir, Hadiya began to question her work with the group and the message that was being sent out.
Recollecting the images of 7/7 bombings, Hadiya adds, "I think it was wake-up call for anyone in [Hizb ut Tahrir] who is living in Britain, whether they wanted to admit it or not."
Both Hadiya and her husband, Dawud, who also is a former member of Hizb ut Tahrir, now work toward building better understanding among religions and communities.
