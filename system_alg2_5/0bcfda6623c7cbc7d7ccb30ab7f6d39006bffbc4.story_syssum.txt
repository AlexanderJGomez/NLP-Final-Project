Graff said he would definitely take another Carnival cruise.
Carnival has a window of opportunity to convince customers its ships can sail without too much trouble, according to several travel agents and cruisers interviewed by CNN.com.
"Carnival has been in business for many years, and for a long time there's never been a hitch," said Zukerman, president of Worldview Travel.
In addition to Carnival Cruise Lines, the corporation's portfolio includes brands such as Holland America Line, Princess Cruises, Seabourn, Cunard and Costa Cruises.
"Despite considerable attention surrounding the Carnival Triumph, we had been encouraged to see booking volumes for Carnival Cruise Lines recover significantly in recent weeks," said Micky Arison, chief executive officer of Carnival Corp.
"For those who are consistent cruisers and know Carnival, I don't think it's going to change their buying habits.
It WILL hurt the cruise line."
Customers need to be reassured Carnival is doing everything it can to address its ships' issues, Wetty said.
Still, Connie Hammond is one of those Carnival fans who isn't giving up on the cruise line.
