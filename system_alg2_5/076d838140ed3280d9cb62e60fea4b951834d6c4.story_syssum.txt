"I just ended up realizing I had become this other person that I didn't like," McMillan said.
Her new book, "Who Asked You?," explores grandparents raising grandchildren -- a topic that has long fascinated her.
"A lot of the characters I write about aren't like me, with the exception there might be snippets or little particles of their personality that I might identify with," she said.
An edited transcript of the conversation follows:
This book is not necessarily a reflection of my own personal experiences.
What was the lesson you took away from that public divorce?
McMillan: You have to go through what you go through, regardless of what other people say.

McMillan: No.
The review was a short review, anyway; it was only two paragraphs.
It was anger in that first paragraph.
McMillan: That I'm a die-hard romantic.
Romantic love probably tops all of them.
