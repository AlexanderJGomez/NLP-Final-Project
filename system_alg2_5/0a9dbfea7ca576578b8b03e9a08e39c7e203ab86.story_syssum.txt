The legislation would require certain tax-exempt groups involved in political advertising -- which currently are not required to disclose the names of their donors -- to release the names of those who give donations of $10,000 or more.
Democrats say the requirement is a much-needed response to the U.S. Supreme Court's Citizen United decision, which opened the doors to large amounts of campaign spending by corporations, labor unions and other groups.
"This legislation is an unprecedented requirement for groups to publicly disclose their donors, stripping a protection recognized and solidified by the courts," said McConnell, who has advocated for more disclosure in the past so long as it applies to all big players in campaign financing, such as labor unions and trial lawyers.
However, the concern about labor unions appeared to sway key Republicans such as Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a longtime vocal advocate of campaign finance reform, who said he would vote against the bill for that reason.
