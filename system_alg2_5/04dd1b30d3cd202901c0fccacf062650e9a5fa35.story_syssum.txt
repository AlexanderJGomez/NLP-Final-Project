London (CNN) -- South African double-amputee sprinter Oscar Pistorius, who made headlines at the Olympics, set a world record on Saturday in London in defense of the first of his three Paralympic titles.
In the Paralympics, which are the also being held in London, Pistorius is also competing in the men's 100-meter-T44 (set for next Wednesday and Thursday) and the 400-meter-T44 (happening Friday and Saturday), both of which he won in Beijing four years ago.
Britain's Sarah Storey, wife of Barney Storey, made it a double gold for the household Saturday with victory in the women's individual C4-5 500-meter time trial, while U.S. cyclist Jennifer Schuble took silver.
The win gave Sarah Storey, who was born without a functioning left hand, her second gold of the Games and an impressive 20 Paralympic medals in total across the swimming and cycling disciplines.
British medal hope Ellie Simmonds, also 17, won her heat in a time a fraction faster than Arlen, the world record holder.
The complex system of disability classification, which ensures athletes compete against those who are similarly-abled, is considered an essential tool for the Paralympic movement.
