If I'm in the car, I can go from one place to another and see different backgrounds, different people and different surrounding -- and for me this is always interesting to show in my work.
I think it is always important to see the original Dubai, how it used to be, and a lot of it is still there.
Our job was to build more and I think Dubai has that balance where there are the old and the new areas.
I would take a traditional material and maybe wrap it around a Formula One car ... or fit it on an art platform in a new way.
I wanted to do something connected to the area, so just a couple of blocks away, if you walked through Bastakiya (one of the oldest most traditional districts of Dubai) you would see the fabric shops and I remembered the textile shops from my childhood.
I was also very interested in the wooden hand barrows that are used to take these fabrics from one shop to another.
But right now instead of having fabrics on that barrow, it has got an art piece on it made out of cardboard tubes.
This is an example of how I tend to do my work -- take something from our past that is still used in our present and then redesign it in a new form and give it a new function -- and most of the time it is an artistic function -- to reintroduce it again.
(British designer) Stuart Haygarth created a light sculpture out of palm leaves with the help of Emirati artisans (at the recent Abu Dhabi Art Fair.)
I think collaborations are very powerful because they mix the media from different backgrounds and when you put them together there are a lot of unexpected results.
