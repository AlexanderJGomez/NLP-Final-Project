Earlier this month, the same jurors took less than two hours to decide that Arias was "exceptionally cruel" in 2008 when she stabbed ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander 29 times, slit his neck from ear to ear and shot him in the face.
Now, the jury is weighing whether Arias, 32, should get the death penalty.
On Tuesday, she pleaded with jurors to spare her.
It was a stark reversal from two weeks ago, when she told a journalist she preferred death to life in prison.
"Please don't give up; please don't give up," Arias said she told her.
Arias told jurors that she had been a victim of abuse as an adult and as a child.
She told jurors Tuesday that she could teach people to read in prison and pledged to dedicate her life to good causes.
"I'm not going to become a mother because of my own terrible choices," she said.
"It matters that she hadn't done anything wrong in her life before that."
He argued that jurors should sentence Arias to death.
If Arias is given a sentence of death, she would be the fourth woman on death row in the state of Arizona.
They broke up in the summer of 2007, and Alexander began dating other women.
