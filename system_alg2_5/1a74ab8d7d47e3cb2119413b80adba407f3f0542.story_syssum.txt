Over the last week, thousands seeking free medical care have turned up at the mobile health care clinic set up by Remote Area Medical, a non-profit organization founded by Brock.
Remote Area Medical, better known as RAM, is a volunteer organization that brings free medical, dental and vision care to people around the world.
On the final day of the Los Angeles operation, Brock said crowds were still gathering with the hope of receiving care.
While limited access to health care is often associated with developing countries, it's a problem that faces patients around the world.
"We could have come to Los Angeles 15 years ago and I guarantee there would have been just as big of a turnout of patients," he told CNN.
RAM usually provides services in the Appalachia region of the U.S. where it's easier for volunteers to work, Brock said.
But it's a rewarding experience for volunteers when they get to see how much their efforts have been appreciated, he said.
