An alleged al Qaeda operative accused of playing a role in the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania pleaded not guilty Tuesday to terrorism charges brought against him in federal court in New York.
Al Libi means "from Libya."
In those paragraphs, authorities allege al Libi met with al Qaeda members about bombing the U.S. Embassy in Kenya, which ended up happening five years later in 1998.
Among the charges, he is accused of taking photos of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi in preparation for the attack.
U.S. Rep. Peter King, R-New York, said Monday that it was "unfortunate" that al Libi was on U.S. soil.
In 2009, Holder said five detainees with alleged ties to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks would be transferred from Guantanamo Bay to New York for trial in civilian court.
Al Libi's family members said they had received no news about him from the U.S. or Libyan governments and were shocked to learn that he had arrived in the United States.
His wife told CNN this month that al Libi has a severe case of hepatitis C and that she was worried about his health.
A senior Obama administration official said it wasn't possible to give Libya consular access to al Libi until he had arrived in the United States.
