Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Demonstrations that began with quiet determination on the internet more than three weeks ago erupted into riotous jubilation Friday evening, moments after it was announced that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was stepping aside.
"Freedom!"
On the front lines of the movement, protester and actor Khalid Abdallah, best known for his role in "The Kite Runner," expressed complete shock at Mubarak's decision to step down, but said Egyptians now feel like "destiny is in their hands," and he praised supporters of their struggle.
"Hold your head high," Abdallah said they chanted, "you're an Egyptian."
Erian said of the pro-democracy revolution that he said he believes will shape the future of Egypt.
"Life is great now.
I think I will have a much better future now.
"I just want to say to Hosni Mubarak and to Omar Suleiman and to all those people who thought that being in power means you can oppress people, you know, hard-luck guys, you know, at the end of the day, we have a choice and we've made our choice," he said.
Ghonim, who helped set up the initial Facebook page calling for protests, said it was time to celebrate, and said he has confidence that Egypt will not fall into dictatorship again.
"We have achieved what the people wanted," he said.
"Today is our time," a 46-year old woman told CNN.
"It will be the ballot box and the voice of the Egyptian people that will determine the direction of any future governments."
