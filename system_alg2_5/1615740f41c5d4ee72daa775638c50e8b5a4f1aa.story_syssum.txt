Today, unfortunately, many of our students are failing to learn American history, including our founding principles and values.
Among the survey's most frightening findings is our students' lack of knowledge in U.S. history.
As the author of three children's books on American history, I've visited many classrooms across the country to share the adventures of Ellis the Elephant, my time-traveling pachyderm, with children ages 4 to 8.
In writing "Yankee Doodle Dandy" (published this week, in which Ellis the Elephant discovers the American Revolution), I was reminded that the brave men and women who fought to win our freedom were surprisingly young.
With education surveys showing dismal results, we must find creative ways to teach our children American history.
And we are only beginning to see the potential of online systems like Khan Academy to revolutionize learning.
Yet we are for the first time in our history beginning to lose sight of our founders' sacrifice and wisdom.
