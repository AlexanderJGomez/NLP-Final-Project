San Diego, California (CNN) -- Nearly six years ago, I left Texas to move back home to California.
That will be second only to California, which has 55 electoral votes.
Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Utah, South Carolina and Washington all picked up one extra seat.
You go to Austin, Houston or San Antonio.
And it's the second-most populous state next to California.
But in terms of population growth, it's second to none.
Texas is still a red state, but there is some evidence that it's trending purple.
Second, much of the rest of Texas' population growth is tied to the phenomenal increase in the Hispanic population.
The data showing the racial/ethnic breakdown of the U.S. population won't be released until February.
There is no question that, as a result of the population shifts of the past 10 years, Texas and states out West are coming into their own and will have more power and influence to steer a new course for the country.
Or should I say, "Bienvenidos?"
