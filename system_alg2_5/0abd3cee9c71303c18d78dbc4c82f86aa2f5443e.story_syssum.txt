Virginia Tech spokesman Mark Owczarski said Thursday that Xin Yang's killing was the first on the campus since April 16, 2007, when a shooter killed 32 people before turning a gun on himself.
Zhu did not say anything to the arresting officers, said campus police Chief Wendell Flinchum.
He began studies at Virginia Tech in fall 2008, Hincker said.
Authorities say on April 16, 2007, Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 students and professors before killing himself.
