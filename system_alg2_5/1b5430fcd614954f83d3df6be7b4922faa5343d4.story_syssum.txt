Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- A federal judge in Georgia has been arrested on drug and weapons charges after federal agents say he bought drugs for a stripper with whom he was having an affair.
Before the sting that led to his arrest, he told her, "Let me pay him, because you've already got a record," the affidavit states.
"It's not a case of Judge Camp being a judge, it's a case of Judge Camp being a husband."
The dancer, who is not identified in court papers, had a prior drug-related federal felony conviction on her record and "recently began cooperating with the FBI," according to the charges -- but she began recording the judge before she became an informant, the affidavit states.
According to the affidavit, Camp pocketed the drugs and told the undercover agent, "We'll call you again."
