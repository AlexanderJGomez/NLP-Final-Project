Baghdad (CNN) -- At least 29 people were killed and more than 120 others wounded in a dozen car bomb explosions in Baghdad and Kirkuk on Wednesday, police said.
These attacks came amid growing tensions between Sunnis and Shiites, especially after an incident in Hawija in Kirkuk province, where Iraqi security forces raided a site used by Sunni protesters to demonstrate against the Shiite-led government.
Such turnouts include protests at al-Atisam Square in Hawija.
