When he arrived in New York on December 22, his suitcase with the instruments and materials he purchased in Morocco to make new instruments was not there.
A spokesperson from U.S. Customs and Border Protection said Razgui did not claim his bag at JFK.
The spokesperson said agriculture specialists did not find or destroy any instruments, only fresh bamboo.
The Customs spokesperson, however, said agriculture specialists neither found nor destroyed any instruments.
"I don't know what to do; I need my materials to make my living," he said.
He said he made all of the instruments himself.
"Right now I don't have a job; I don't know what to do."
