(CNN) -- A Florida jury awarded a 92-year-old man $1.9 million in compensatory damages for the death of his wife, a former two-pack-a-day Marlboro smoker who started when she was 16 and died in her 70s, attorneys said Thursday.
Philip Morris announced that it plans to appeal the case, one of thousands of "Engle progeny" cases, named after a 2006 Florida Supreme Court decision that decertified a class-action lawsuit against the tobacco industry.
So far, six of the eight Engle cases that have gone to trial have come back with a plaintiff's verdict, said Sweda.
Gdanski said his firm has more than 150 Engle cases.
