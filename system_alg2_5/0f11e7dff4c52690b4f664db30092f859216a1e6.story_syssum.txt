Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik said the Saturday attack at the Marriott Hotel "is the biggest attack, volume-wise" in Pakistan in seven years.

At a news conference in Islamabad on Sunday, Pakistani authorities released security video of the blast, showing a small explosion inside the truck before the larger, deadly explosion.
No arrests have been made in connection with the attack, Malik said Sunday, adding that militants in Pakistan's tribal regions are suspected of orchestrating the attack.
The blast also caused a natural gas leak that set the top floor of the five-story, 258-room hotel on fire, police said.
The blast occurred about 7:50 p.m., after the breaking of the fast during the holy month of Ramadan, Malik said.
A few hours after the attack, Zardari addressed the nation on television, saying he knows the pain of terrorism after his wife, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, was killed in December on the campaign trail.
These people are not Muslims," he said.
"We had taken all security measures," he said.
The British High Commission in Islamabad said six British nationals -- five adults and one minor -- were injured in the attack, including three commission members.
