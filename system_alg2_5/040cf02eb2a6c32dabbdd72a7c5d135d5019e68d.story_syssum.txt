In defiance of the country's moderate climate, the architects say they have devised a system to control the park's outdoor environment, using old and new farming technologies to simulate Mediterranean and tropical climates in an ecologically sustainable way.
Because this will also be a recreational space, our goal is to make it as open as possible, without using greenhouses," he said.
"Climate pylons" are a more modern method of trapping heat.
However, for tropical foods like mangoes and basmati rice, van Bergen says the park will need another layer of warmth.
"Because all the food in our supermarket will be grown on site we won't need a big processing factory to make packaging and we won't have to burn lots of fossil fuel to transport it across the globe," he said.
Canon is also concerned that the introduction of alien climates may also precipitate the introduction of alien pests.
I think creating tropical climates next to moderate ones could introduce a host of new diseases and pests to the region in quite an unpredictable way," she warned.
For van Bergen, this type of criticism misses the point, because he sees the Park Supermarket as just one of many possible alternatives to the existing system of food production.
