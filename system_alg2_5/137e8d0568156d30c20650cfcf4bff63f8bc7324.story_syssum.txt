Bobby Petrino is no longer calling Hogs at the University of Arkansas, because somebody by the handle of "hoggrad" on that popular woopig.net website for Razorback fans first reported that the Arkansas football coach wasn't exactly watching game film that evening.
"All of this (instant reporting of scandal) in regards to how it relates to the electronic media has certainly heightened the information and interest and lessened tolerance," said Georgia Tech athletics director Dan Radakovich, who has worked for big-time intercollegiate athletic programs for nearly three decades.
It's just that the Petrino situation and others have placed those on campuses in the forefront of it all.
You had to talk to a number of different people before you felt like -- or the organization felt like -- they had gathered enough information to be able to make a reasonable or rational decision," Radakovich added.
The Eustachy photo was the first in a string of high-profile sports scandals broken by a random person.
That same year, ESPN received an audiotape of a 2002 telephone conversation between the wife of Syracuse associate head basketball coach Bernie Fine and a former team ball boy.
It talked of parties and gifts for North Carolina football players, and those revelations led to the Tar Heels receiving NCAA probation, vacating two seasons worth of games and the firing of popular coach Butch Davis.
If the situation was bad enough back then, university bosses might deliver a private or public reprimand.
Petrino had a 21-5 record during the last two of his four years at Arkansas, and one of his Razorback teams earned a berth in the coveted Bowl Championship Series for the first time in school history.
And that Dorrell wasn't his wife or the mother of his four children.
Woopig.net surely did.
