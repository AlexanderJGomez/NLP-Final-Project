asks Ginger the Robot, haltingly throwing up its arms in its best impression of a real-life comedian.
The cute little machine's monotone voice has all the drama of a conveyer belt, while its expression is as vacant as a doll.
"I was looking for a way to do a performance with a robot, and I was like 'hey, what about a comedy routine on stage?'
"I don't feel pain," says blank-faced Ginger.
"People love when it goes all super-techy and acts like a real robot.
"Things like laughter, applause, these are symbolic things that we all do," says Knight.
"When the robot makes fun of me, it means I can tell you about my research and it's like my own self-deprecation," explained the bubbly engineer, and you get the feeling her popularity is not just down to Ginger, but her own charismatic stage presence.
Boom!
