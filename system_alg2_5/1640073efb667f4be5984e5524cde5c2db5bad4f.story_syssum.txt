Sherlock Holmes has the Sherlockians, scholars of the canon of books and short stories written by author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
"I liked it a lot more than I thought I would," said Andrew Peck, a United States magistrate judge.
He is tough.
The movie shows Watson as intelligent, able to be a good assistant; Watson, the doctor, concerned about his friend's well-being; and it shows his reasonable frustration with his friend's often thoughtless ways," said Julia Carlson Rosenblatt, a Baker Street Irregular since 1981 and co-author of "Dining With Sherlock Holmes."
Peck saw "Sherlock Holmes" at an early screening of the film on Tuesday in New York with a dozen other Sherlockians.
For instance, in this film, Watson introduces his fiancee, Mary Morstan, to Holmes for the first time.
"While she was called an adventuress in the story, she was not a criminal by any means, as she is portrayed in this movie," Peck said.
"When William Gillette, working on a Holmes play, asked Doyle if it was OK for Holmes to marry, Doyle is said to have replied, 'You may marry him, or murder him, or do anything you like to him.'
