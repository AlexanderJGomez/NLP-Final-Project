Freeman then was a breast cancer surgeon in Harlem, New York, trying to figure out why patients in his hospital had a five-year survival rate of 39% when it should have been closer to 85%.
"People got lost in the complex system," Freeman says.

If poor people don't have access to screening, diagnosis or treatment, you can create programs to concentrate on those one by one."
"I think when you go through things as a patient, you know, as a parent -- to be able to be treated with compassion and not just (as) another diagnosis is a gift," Trout says.
