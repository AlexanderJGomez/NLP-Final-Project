(CNN)  -- A controversial Colombian senator who has obtained the release of 16 hostages held by Marxist guerrillas is the leading candidate to receive this year's Nobel Peace Prize, which will be announced Friday, said an independent research institute in Norway.
The 50-year-old peace institute, which is often called PRIO, has no connection with the Nobel committee that awards the peace prize.
Since 2007, she has obtained the release of 16 hostages held by the FARC and has gotten commitments from the rebels for the release of several more.
"While it is the hostage releases that have brought Cordoba and her organization the most attention, her role as a principal proponent of peace negotiations and of long-term reconciliation is probably more important to her candidacy for the Nobel Peace Prize," PRIO said in a release.
Harpviken said Muhammad, an Islamic scholar known for trying to bridge gaps with other faiths, also is a leading candidate.
Two years later, Muhammad and other prominent Islamic scholars wrote a letter called "A Common Word Between Us and You" that urged mutual understanding and peace with Christians.
"He still has a way to go so that his ideas have an impact," Harpviken said.
Quang Do, 80, was awarded the annual human rights prize by the Rafto Foundation of Norway in 2006.
Azerbaijani journalist and human rights activist Malahat Nasibova was awarded the Rafto this year and also is considered a possible Nobel prize winner.
Before being arrested, he had publicly expressed concerns over human rights abuses by police in Beijing.
He was released in 1993 but arrested again within six months and sentenced to 14 years.
The peace prize is one of five awarded annually since 1901 by the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm, Sweden.
While the other prizes are awarded by committees based in Sweden, the peace prize is determined by a five-member panel appointed by the Norwegian parliament.
