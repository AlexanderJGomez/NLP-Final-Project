A Lowndes County, Georgia, assistant district attorney has ordered a communications company to hand over Internet records after investigators received an anonymous e-mail claiming an ex-schoolmate reportedly confessed to killing Kendrick Johnson.
According to an incident report provided to CNN by the sheriff's office, investigators interviewed two of four students identified by name in the anonymous e-mail on January 28.
Lowndes County sheriff's investigators concluded Johnson got stuck while reaching for a shoe at the center of the mat and that his death was accidental.
The sheriff's office has received many public comments regarding Johnson's death since it closed its case on May 2.
According to a Lowndes County Sheriff's Office incident report, the subpoena was faxed to Mediacom on February 7.
The U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, Michael Moore, launched the federal probe October 31.
