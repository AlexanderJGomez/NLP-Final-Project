(CNN) -- Whoever is running the social media strategy for the New York Police Department needs to be fired because that person has no idea how to follow the rules of social media.

Facebook users are a different demographic than Twitter users, just as Pinterest users are different from Instagram users.
If you need to control the conversation, use Facebook.
On Twitter, the users are in control.
It's better to monitor your reputation on Twitter using reputation management software and reply directly to people who tweet bad things about you.
If you want to use social media to promote a brand, either use the rules to pick the right platform and own the conversation or social media will own you.
NYPD should have solicited feel-good user generated photos through a contest on Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest and then published them on Facebook where they could delete the negative and sarcastic responses.
