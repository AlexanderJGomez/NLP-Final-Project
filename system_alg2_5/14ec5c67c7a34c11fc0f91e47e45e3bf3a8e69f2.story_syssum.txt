(CNN) -- Nintendo announced a November release date for its next-generation Wii U on Thursday while looking to shore up two key constituencies -- those still puzzling over the console's "second screen" controller and hardcore gamers who still view the Wii as geared toward families and kids.
While it's not certain how many new titles will be available at launch time, at least 50 games will be available for the Wii U by March, Fils-Aime said.
And while Thursday's events showcased new titles in venerable Nintendo franchises like "Mario Bros.," there was heavy focus on games favored by more hardcore and adult players.
Richard George, an executive editor at gaming site IGN who covers Nintendo, said Thursday's presentation may have been the moment the company finally hammered home the value of the new system.
"Loyal Nintendo fans will snatch this up like crazy," he said.
