Lebanon had maintained relative stability despite the full-tilt civil war that has torn apart its largest neighbor and former military occupier, Syria, for more than a year and a half.
Many in Lebanon immediately suspected al-Assad's regime in the assassination.
Lawmakers who are most opposed to Syria's influence inside Lebanon -- mostly through its Lebanese ally, Hezbollah -- are now calling for the government's resignation.
Lebanese officials said there was no doubt al-Hassan was the target of the attack.
Hezbollah is also an Iran-backed paramilitary group deemed a terrorist organization by the United States, whose agents inside Lebanon were indicted by the United Nations for Hariri's assassination.
"They're aware they're a weak government, and they're not keen on Lebanon becoming a staging point for the rebels to launch attacks on Syria," Phillips said.
Hezbollah was created in 1982 to oppose Israel's occupation of Lebanon.
That has not stopped it from amassing substantial political power inside Lebanon, according to author and journalist Thanassis Cambanis.
Have there been widespread protests in Lebanon?
Against what?
Lebanon has always struggled to maintain a balance among its religious and ethnic sects, and the current tensions mirror those in Syria: In both countries, the Shiite and Alawite Muslim sects (al-Assad is an Alawite) tend to support the Syrian regime, while support is growing among Sunni Muslims for Syrian rebels.
The core of the Syrian president's support in Lebanon is in the southern part of the country.
"There's been an assumption for several years that the Lebanese people are fed up and exhausted with civil war," Phillips said.
