BA said the talks would not affect its negotiations in Spanish airline Iberia, with which it is already discussing a revenue deal with American Airlines.
BA sold a remaining 18.25 percent stake in Qantas in 2004, according to the Herald.
BA and Qantas have for many years co-operated on the so-called "Kangaroo Route" including sharing revenues on UK-Australia routes, Quest said.
The merger moves come during troubled times for BA, which saw its pretax profits fall by 92 percent in the first half of this year, a loss it blamed on high oil prices and troubled financial markets.
