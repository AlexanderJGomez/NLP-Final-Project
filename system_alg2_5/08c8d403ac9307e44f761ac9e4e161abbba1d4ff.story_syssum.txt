Fashion's Night Out, which took place last night in New York and across the world, is not for the self-conscious.
The trademarked event started four years ago, when retail sales were anything but vibrant.
It was clear that something needed to happen to get people comfortable with shopping again and to remind them that their purchases were helping to support the economy and the lives of those around them that worked in fashion," said Susan Portnoy, vice president of media relations at Cond√© Nast.
Forty percent of the proceeds from branded products benefit the New York City AIDS Fund in the NY Community Trust.
Kriticos, who lives in New Jersey and is an aspiring accessories designer, met her best friend in New York City for the extravaganza.
"It's not only about the inspiration from all around and being in stores and seeing the new line and getting excited for Fashion Week, it's everyone coming together for a good cause," she said.
At designer Nicole Miller's SoHo boutique, assistant manager Fantcha Mendes bops along to the DJ with an enormous smile because, to her, Fashion's Night Out "encourages people to feel good about themselves."
Despite all the distractions, she's also smiling because Fashion's Night Out, at least for her boutique, achieved its original goal.
