Civilians and opposition rebel forces have been left frustrated by the coalition's narrow focus, lack of a clear agenda and apparent failure to take into consideration the dynamics of the wider Syrian conflict.
In the short term, the international coalition's counter-terrorism strategy may certainly be in the interests of the Assad regime.
Coalition strikes have not been targeting the Syrian government's military forces or infrastructure.
Although government forces have made slight advances in Aleppo, resource constraints have prevented the military from taking full advantage of the coalition strikes.
A strategic shift to target the Syrian government's military infrastructure is unlikely as many regional and international state actors have a stake in Syria.
Coalition training may gradually improve some of the Syrian rebel groups' military capabilities and strategic planning but the current balance of power between the government forces and various rebel and armed groups will likely continue.
