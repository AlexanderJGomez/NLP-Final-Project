Smiley cites government figures that nearly half of all Americans are living in or near poverty.
In 2011, the Census Bureau found that 49.7 million Americans were in actual poverty and the national poverty rate topped 16%.
A 2012 study by the Cato Institute estimates that the United States has spent roughly $15 trillion since then, and yet the poverty rate is close to where it was more than 40 years ago.
However, Smiley and some on the left think the problem is that the government has not gone far enough.
In a landmark study, the Brookings Institution found that young adults who finish high school, get a full-time job and wait until age 21 to get married and have children have just a 2% chance of falling into poverty and a 74% chance of ending up in the middle class.
In Washington, D.C., public schools, only 59% of high school students graduated on time in the 2010-2011 school year.
It should come as no surprise then that the poverty rate in Washington was 18.7% in 2011.
With the nucleus of the family in shambles, the fabric of American society is unraveling one thread at a time.
While we may disagree on economic solutions, Tavis Smiley acknowledges this much and I'm encouraged that with voices like his we can start building consensus around issues crucial to the upward mobility of many poor and disadvantaged Americans.
