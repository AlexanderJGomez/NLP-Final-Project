(CNN) -- An Arizona woman is accused of injecting feces-laced fluid into her 66-year-old husband's IV as the couple was alone in his recovery room following his surgery, police said.
After the IV monitor alarm sounded, the hospital staff entered the recovery room and found Vogel manipulating her husband's IV, police said.
A test revealed the fluid contained fecal matter, police said.
