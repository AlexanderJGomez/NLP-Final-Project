Khan said he boarded a New York-bound plane in Toronto on Friday when two U.S. immigration officials asked him to step outside.
The cricket legend said he suspects U.S. officials simply wanted to make him miss an anti-drone protest Khan was scheduled to lead in the United States, without realizing the protest had already been postponed because of the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha.
A State Department official acknowledged that Khan was "briefly delayed" before boarding the next flight to the United States.
Khan says people he has spoken to in the tribal region say most of the people killed are innocent civilians.
