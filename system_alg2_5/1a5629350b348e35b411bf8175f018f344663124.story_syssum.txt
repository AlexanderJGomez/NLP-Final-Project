The man who dazzled the world of golf by accumulating 14 majors by the age of 32 has now gone five seasons without a single one.
"Every year that I get a chance to compete and play in tournaments and major championships for as long as I decide to do it, every year's a big year, every year counts.
Woods won five PGA Tour titles in 2013 -- the tenth time in his illustrious career that he's done so.
If Woods needed a reminder of where his game used to be in the majors, he will get it this season.
"When you look at (Michael Jordan) when he first came out, he was able to dunk over everybody, but he got beat up by the Pistons three straight playoffs, he was out and next thing you know he built up his body and developed a fadeaway," Woods said.
You evolve as you age and I think I've done that so far."
