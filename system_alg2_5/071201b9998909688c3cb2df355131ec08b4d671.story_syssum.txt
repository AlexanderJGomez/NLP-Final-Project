While Obama spoke of the strong bonds, President Lee Myung-bak said he will win over American critics of the pact, which was approved by Congress Wednesday.
Obama and Lee earlier Thursday said the trade agreement is promising for both economies.
"This agreement will create more jobs, generate more trade and stimulate our economies.
Obama and Lee also said they will continue to cooperate on efforts with respect to North Korea.
Increased tension between the Koreas has prompted the United States and Seoul to delay until December 2015 the transfer of wartime operational control of troops on the Korean Peninsula to South Korea.
