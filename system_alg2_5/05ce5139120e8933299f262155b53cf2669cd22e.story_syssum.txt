Democrat Harry Reid, majority leader of the Senate?
No recent majority leader of either party has been saved the headache of trying to lead a Senate in which minorities can exploit the rules and stymie the chamber.
Twice this week, the Senate has opened debate with its party leaders engaged in a caustic battle over Reid's plans to seek changes to Senate rules in January.
Reform of the Senate is overdue.
A top priority should be to eliminate filibusters of the "motion to proceed" to a bill and the three motions that are required to send a bill to conference with the House.
Similarly, debate could be trimmed by banning filibusters on the three steps required to send a bill to conference with the House.
The first cloture vote would require 60 votes, as is required under Senate rules.
The Senate should consider new "fast-track" confirmation rules.

There's no easy path.
