Video of two sisters in India fighting back against men who allegedly harassed them has gone viral.
One lurched toward one of the men, thrashing what looks like a belt.
Aarti Kumar said that no one on the bus tried to help the sisters, and some passengers shouted for them to stop fighting the men and get off.
Kumar said her parents have been very supportive of her and her sister, also unusual because girls and women in some areas of India are often discouraged from reporting instances of harassment.
Police said at first that the suspects hanged their victims from a mango tree, but an investigation of their deaths concluded last week that the girls committed suicide.
