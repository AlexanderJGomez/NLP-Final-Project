The two-time world champion claimed his and Ferrari's first win since the Formula One season-opener in March, but motorsport's ruling body decided that the team had broken rules banning orders to drivers after Felipe Massa let Alonso through late in the race.
Massa's race engineer Rob Smedley told him: "Alonso is faster than you.
Massa held on for second place for his best result of the season since Bahrain, with German Vettel third and teammate Mark Webber sixth as Red Bull failed to follow up the latter's victory last time out at Silverstone.
Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said he believed Ferrari had broken the rules.
"The drivers should have been allowed to race.
But Schumacher, who finished ninth on his return to a race he has won four times, said he believed his former team made the right move.
Renault's Robert Kubica claimed seventh place at Hockenheim, but it was a disappointing day for Mercedes on the German team's home track as Nico Rosberg was eighth ahead of seven-time world champion Schumacher.
