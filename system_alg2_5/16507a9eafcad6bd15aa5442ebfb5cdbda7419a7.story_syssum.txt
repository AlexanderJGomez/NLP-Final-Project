"Romney's discussion of his promotion of women in his gubernatorial administration was ... problematic," said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University in Atlanta.

President Barack Obama was quick to use the "binders" line against Romney on the campaign trail Wednesday.
The "binders full of women" phrase was the third-fastest rising search on Google during the debate.
A USA Today/Gallup poll conducted last week showed Romney had closed the gap with women and was within one point among women who are likely voters, 48% for Romney and 49% for Obama.
After the debate, Democratic pundits criticized Romney's efforts to hire women.
Socarides gave Romney points for trying to hire women but said in doing so, "Romney demonstrates that he's living in another world."
Romney will now have to rebuff the Obama campaign's attempts to define him as someone who is anti-woman, political experts say.
