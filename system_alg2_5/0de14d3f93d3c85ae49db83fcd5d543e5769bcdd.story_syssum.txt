Los Angeles (CNN) -- Johnny Depp brought the biggest star power to the MTV Movie Awards on Sunday, taking the stage to play guitar while he was honored for his acting career.
"Thanks, you guys, for giving us best kiss again," Stewart said.
"Bridesmaid" star Melissa McCarthy won for best comedic performance.
"Right now, I have no idea what's going on," Woodley said backstage.
During a more serious part of the show, actress Emma Stone was brought to tears after she accepted the MTV Trailblazer Award.
"A lot of times, it's what makes you great," Stone said.
