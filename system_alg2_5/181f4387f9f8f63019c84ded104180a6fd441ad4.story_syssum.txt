The deal brokered by Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell does make good on President Obama's promise to bring a little more equity to the tax code by raising rates on wealthier Americans, and it temporarily averts the most draconian "sequestration" cuts.
Just as bad, or perhaps worse in terms of the day-to-day lives of average people, the bill only postpones the forced cuts of sequestration by two months, to precisely the moment the country will be engaged in another ruinous debate about lifting our national debt ceiling to ensure the country can pay its bills.
Next time around, the markets will not be so blasÃ© about congressional brinkmanship if the national credit rating and the stability of a bedrock of the international financial system are at stake.
The head of the AFL-CIO, Richard Trumka, said the deal "sets the stage for more hostage taking."
The deal that was hastily cobbled together actually increases our deficit, and it creates an even bigger potential crisis just weeks from now.
This question is based entirely on the illusion that there are two sides in our political battles.
One party speaks on behalf of one set of interests.
Both sides decided not to address it during the political campaign.
The fact that we even call the type of agreement that adequately starts to address our multiple needs a "grand bargain" as if it were some impossible dream reveals much about the current state of play in our nation's capital.
The two-party system is a boon for America when it is seen as providing a voice for two parts of a unified whole.
