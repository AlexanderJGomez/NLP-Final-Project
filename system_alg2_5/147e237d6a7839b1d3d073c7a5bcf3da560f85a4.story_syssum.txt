Havana, Cuba -- Alejandro Robaina, considered a legend among Cuban tobacco growers, died Saturday, according to Cuban cigar company Habanos S.A., which produced cigars named for him.
A box of premium Vegas Robaina cigars can fetch more than $500 on the international market.
Under Robaina, business flourished, and the plantation had some of the best yields in the region, producing highly-prized wrapper leaves used for the outer layer of cigars.
"For me tobacco growing had to be in the family, done with love.
Robaina said he'd been smoking cigars since he was 10 years old.
Robaina said in 2008 he hoped that policy would end during his lifetime.
Robaina will be buried Sunday, said Candia.
