Jackson, Mississippi (CNN) -- LaShawn Traylor was rushed to the hospital as Hurricane Katrina was carving its way through South Florida on August 25, 2005.
I thought we'd be back in a few days," Lionel Traylor said.
Nurses told Traylor her premature newborn was taken to another hospital for better care.
The bottom floors of Methodist Hospital filled with water.
Food and water was dwindling.
"I thought I was going to die," Traylor said.
"I thought Lorenzo was dead already," Traylor said.
LaShawn Traylor says, "a nurse told me she didn't think I was going to make it."
Traylor was in a line of female patients evacuated from the Methodist Hospital maternity ward.
I didn't want to leave the city without knowing where my baby was; I just thought that was weird," Traylor said.
"I thought Lorenzo was with her and when I first saw her she told me 'I don't know where the baby is' and that's when my heart sank," said Lionel Traylor.
The family tried to return to New Orleans, the city both LaShawn and Lionel Traylor had always called home.
"Going back to a city that needed to be rebuilt was just too much for the kids, leaving New Orleans was really hard," said LaShawn Traylor.
"Life is better now," says LaShawn Traylor.
