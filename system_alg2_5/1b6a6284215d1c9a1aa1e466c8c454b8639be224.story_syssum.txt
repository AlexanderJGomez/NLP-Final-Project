Oranjestad, Aruba (CNN) -- Aruban prosecutors plan to release Tuesday the results of tests conducted on a jawbone found on an island beach and disclose whether it belongs to missing U.S. teenager Natalee Holloway, officials said.
Dave believes it is Natalee," Miller said about Holloway's father, Dave Holloway.
Part of a jawbone with a tooth was found earlier this month by an American tourist near the Phoenix Hotel, a large resort on the western side of the island, Aruban prosecutor Peter Blanken said.
However, "it does not appear to be human," said Richard Roy, general manager of the Westin Hotel.
Her body was found in May in a hotel room registered to van der Sloot.
