"So I ran and tried to cover her body and pull her out," Suleiman said.
Suleiman is one of three people in the video interviewed by CNN, with one of them saying he was shot.
A CNN crew also witnessed the security force beatings and shootings and saw other women stripped of some of their clothing.
The images stirred worldwide outrage because of the beating and because she was partially stripped in a Muslim society where women cover themselves for modesty.
The beatings and the use of live ammunition against protesters, particularly women, have outraged Egyptians.
Others came to Suleiman's aid, such as businessman Ehab Hanna, who was also beaten up and shot after he tried to help the woman with the veil.
I tried to walk but fell to the ground, so they started beating me and Azza relentlessly," he told CNN.
He said he and other injured people were on the ground for about 30 minutes because ambulances weren't allowed into the area.
He told CNN that he is filing a complaint against military leaders because they "dragged, stripped and beat" women and journalists.
They even continued to beat her after her body was exposed."
Where is she?"
"If she comes from a military family then she reserved the right to be transferred to a military hospital even if her father is deceased," said Col. Islam Jaffar of the military's morals department.
