Although the costs of crew and luxury food aren't extremely cheap, it is expected this move will open up the recession-hit market to many more potential holiday-makers.
One of the company's mega-yachts, Katania -- a 100 foot vessel which  Hollywood actress Hilary Swank once chartered, now costs less than $3000 per day.
"Since we started chartering 10 years ago, we have been looking for a chance to provide our 'Expeditions to the Extraordinary' in the San Juan Islands at a price any luxury traveler can afford - this recession provides that opportunity," he said.
Tim Wiltshire, director and sales broker at international yacht company Burgess Yachts, said the charter market wasn't a complete disaster, so he was surprised to see such a discount.
He felt that other larger vessels still warranted their greater price tags.
