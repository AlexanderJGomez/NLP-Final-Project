The investigation into the actions of former NFL tight end Aaron Hernandez, who is accused of killing friend Odin Lloyd, has turned to Hernandez's fiancee as law enforcement searches for the .45 caliber gun used in the slaying.
The documents indicate investigators became suspicious of Shayanna Jenkins after they spoke with her sister Shaneah Jenkins.
The day after Lloyd's body was found, Shaneah Jenkins told authorities she was with her sister, Shayanna, and two uncles at Hernandez's home.
About an hour later, a home surveillance video shows Jenkins leaving the house carrying something "rigid" and "consistent to a lock box or safe" placed inside a garbage bag and covered with clothing, according to the documents.
Singleton, Hernandez' cousin, remained jailed on a contempt of court charge for failing to cooperate with a grand jury, according to two law enforcement sources.
