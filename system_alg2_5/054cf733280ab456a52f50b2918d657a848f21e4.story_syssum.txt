That's when Congress passed, and President Reagan signed into law, the Immigration Reform and Control Act, which married border control and the legalization of millions of illegal immigrants.
The Immigration Reform and Control Act, the bill resulting from the 1986 grand bargain, proved to be a spectacular failure.
Reformers today still try to link legalization of the vast majority of resident illegals with stronger enforcement mechanisms -- just as they did in 1986.
The way forward out of the stalemate should start the way all policy starts that benefits unpopular groups: Target the most deserving.
Similarly, immigration reformers must start with the strongest claims to legalization: students and soldiers.
Supporters of comprehensive reform and legalization worry that the DREAM act will take away the impetus for further reform and benefit only a fraction of the illegal immigrants in the United States.
Although it is true that the DREAM act will initially help only a few hundred-thousand, pro-Latino reformers should not forget the lesson of minority rights since the 1940s: Rights expand over time, covering more groups and more issues.
Here, then, is the mini-bargain.
The pursuit of a 1986-style grand bargain is blocking the path of potential patriotic soldiers and is failing good kids -- as well as America's future.
