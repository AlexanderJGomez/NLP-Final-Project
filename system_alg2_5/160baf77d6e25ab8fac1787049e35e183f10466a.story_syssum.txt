The controversial issue of team orders in Formula 1 has once again tested respect between teammates -- and ahead of Sunday's race Vettel said he would probably do it again given he felt Webber had not supported him in the past -- and raised question marks over the purity of the sport's racing.
"All the team wants to see is if one driver has a problem he will not make it difficult for his teammate.
"I don't think there's the same respect now for other drivers," British racing legend Stirling Moss told CNN.
"When a team had the lead, the number one driver would hold position and not pass him, says Moss.
"Because (Red Bull) had specifically said to (Vettel) let Webber have it, that made him a naughty boy but he felt, 'well dammit, why shouldn't I win?'
"In my case in Austria there were eight laps of conversation because they told me that I should do something that was not agreed," he explained.
But there wasn't, says Barrichello.
That career-defining moment for Barrichello also led to a decision by the sport's governing body, the FIA, to ban team orders that directly affected the outcome of a race.
Team orders have always existed in F1 because, in simple terms, teams also want to be happy -- and that often means making money.
"The team has always been the most important thing," said Moss.
"I don't think drivers accept that," says Barrichello.
"I suppose he was a naughty boy," Moss says, "but he is a racing driver who's paid to go fast.
Vettel, Webber and Red Bull will begin to find out how much crossing that line in Malaysia has hurt them when they reunite in Shanghai.
