New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Pakistan's prime minister, Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani, arrived in India Wednesday to watch a Cricket World Cup match between the two archrival teams as the nuclear neighbors try to repair ties wounded by the 2008 terror attacks on Mumbai.
In their talks Tuesday in New Delhi, Indian and Pakistani home secretaries also pledged to set up a "hotline" on terror threats.
"Dates for the visit of the judicial commission from Pakistan in connection with (the) Mumbai attack trial will be conveyed by India within four (to) six weeks," the statement read.
Some Hindu nationalists are now the key suspects in the 2007 firebombing on the Samjhauta (Friendship) Express train that left 68 passengers dead.
