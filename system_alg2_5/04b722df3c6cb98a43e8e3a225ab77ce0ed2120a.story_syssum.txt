(CNN) -- Evidence in the case of a Michigan boy who vanished for nearly two weeks before turning up in his father's basement will not be turned over to prosecutors until at least next week, authorities said Wednesday.
That same day, the boy's father allegedly told investigators that he used a PVC pipe to discipline him, leaving a scar on the boy's chest, according to a petition filed with the Wayne County Department of Health & Human Services.
The FBI interviewed the boy as part of the investigation.
The FBI declined comment beyond acknowledging that agents met with the child.
Police said the boy had snacks and a sports drink in the basement.
Charlie is staying with relatives, police said.
