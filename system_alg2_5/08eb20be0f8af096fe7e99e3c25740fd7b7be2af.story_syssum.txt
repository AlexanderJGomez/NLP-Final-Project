HAVANA, Cuba (CNN)  -- New Orleans, Louisiana, Mayor Ray Nagin arrived in Cuba late Friday on a mission to learn about how to deal with storms, a spokeswoman said.
Since Katrina, New Orleans has adjusted its disaster response with new evacuation plans.
As Hurricane Gustav threatened the city last year, officials evacuated more than 18,000 residents, the release said.
Nagin is the first New Orleans mayor to make an official visit to Cuba in 50 years.
