In their natural state, the barrier islands that line about half of the U.S. coast, including most of the region affected by Sandy, are mobile and change constantly in response to wind, waves, tides and sea level.
When dunes erode and fail, much of the sand is carried up onto the island as overwash.
This overwash sand instantly added several feet of elevation to the islands.
On a natural barrier island, this new elevation reduces the chance of inundation from the next storm.
Sea level has risen 6 to 9 inches along the New Jersey coast since the last big storm in 1962 (the Ash Wednesday storm).
What we know about storms, sea-level rise and barrier island response can be applied to redevelopment of the New Jersey coast.
There are difficult choices to be made in our response to Superstorm Sandy.
This requires identifying which areas can adapt best, prioritizing which will receive the most protection and which will receive the least, or even none.
