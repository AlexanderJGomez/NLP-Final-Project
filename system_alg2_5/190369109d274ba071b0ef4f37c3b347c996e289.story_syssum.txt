And with this, the story took a drastic and disturbing turn as an aggressive backlash took place.
This was not the first time such an attack was mounted against a woman advocating for gender equality.
In fact, weaponizing women's bodies -- whether by making rape threats or disseminating unwanted and compromising images of women's bodies -- are crimes, violations that are born of a deep-rooted hatred toward women and a drive to shame into submission any woman who dares to speak out.
These threats are not just happening to high profile women, but to women and girls everywhere.
It is a hate crime against women.
These bodies are presented as little more than that -- just bodies to be bought and sold, rented and brutalized.
It is time for the silencing of women stop.
