The United States and the European Union "stand with the people of Ukraine" in their fight for the right to choose alliances with countries other than Russia, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Saturday.
"Russia and other countries should not view the European integration of their neighbors as a zero-sum game," Kerry said.
European Council President Herman Van Rompuy also highlighted events in Ukraine as he opened the second day of the conference Saturday.
As people across the country are taking to the streets, Ukraine's political destiny is still in the balance."
The future of Ukraine belongs with the European Union."
Lavrov also said the United States and the European Union appeared to be trying to push their own ideas on Ukraine.
On Friday, Western leaders voiced growing concern over reports of the kidnap and torture of opposition activists in Ukraine.
"We are deeply concerned by increasing reports of protesters disappearing and being beaten and tortured, as well as by attacks on journalists," Carney said.
The clashes earlier this month were an escalation of weeks of largely peaceful public protests prompted by Yanukovych's decision in November to spurn a planned trade deal with the European Union and turn toward Russia.
