But the game today?
The game's at 4 p.m.
It's about time soccer caught on in the U.S.
When was the last time you saw the country unite behind one cause, gather in front of massive TV screens, and collectively bellow, "I believe that we will win"?
"The country is paying attention in a way that it's never done before, and we have a chance to make some history," said Sunil Gulati, the U.S. Soccer Federation president.
When the U.S. last played Belgium at the World Cup, it beat them 3-0.
That's because it isn't.
It qualified for the World Cup, winning eight out of 10 games.
At the tournament, it's won all three of its games, conceding only one goal.
Kompany is one of Belgium's key defenders.
Without those two, the goal scoring potential increases for the U.S.
And the U.S. has four players who are World Cup veterans (Howard, Dempsey, DaMarcus Beasley and Michael Bradley.)
The last time they were at a World Cup was 14 years ago.
Why?
And it's the country that we beat in the last second of the last World Cup."
"It is looking for excuses ahead of the match," Belgian coach Wilmots said.
Today, the natural tendency of the team might be to hunker down, ward off the inevitable Belgian onslaught, and make a run for the goal when chances open up.
Fun fact #1: Before he became Belgium's coach, Marc Wilmots served in the country's senate for two years.
Fun fact #3: Waffle House is calling for a ban on Belgian waffles.
Fun fact #5: Clint Dempsey has another goal: to make it as rapper Deuce.
