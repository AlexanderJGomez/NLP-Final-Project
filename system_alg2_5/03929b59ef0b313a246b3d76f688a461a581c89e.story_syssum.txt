This year, according to the College Board, average published in-state tuition and fee plus room/board charges exceed $17,000 at four-year public institutions, a 6% increase from only one year earlier.
Whereas private businesses cut prices for consumers and costs to themselves through efficiencies that increase profits and incomes, universities lack those incentives.
Indeed, the typical successful university president views his or her key constituencies not to be the customer (students and their parents who pay tuition charges or the granters of research funds), but rather others -- the faculty, important alumni, key administrators, trustees and occasionally politicians.
Like health care, prices are rising rapidly for higher education because of the predominant role of third-party payments -- federal student loans and grants, state government support for institutions and students, private philanthropic gifts and endowment income.
And the nonprofit nature of institutions reduces incentives for colleges and universities to be efficient.
Even basic financial information on how colleges spend money is often not fully shared with trustees or key politicians who help fund or oversee college operations.
If information and incentives are provided, innovation will come.
According to my analysis of the data, more than 17 million college graduates were "underemployed" in 2008.
Necessity is the mother of invention.
