A man shot four men with whom he had worked -- two of them fatally -- in northern Florida on Saturday before shooting and killing himself, the Union County sheriff said.
Whitehead knew Allen for 40 years, and said he'd just talked to him just last week.
The Union County Sheriff's Office said Allen went to a Lake Butler farm owned by Pritchett, where he fatally shot Gonzalez-Delgado.
Allen traveled to Pritchett Trucking Inc. and shot a third co-worker, 44-year old David Griffis, in the stomach, officials said.
The company employs "well over 400 people and is apportioned in all 48 states and Canada."
