"We were going to go look for her," said Kami Baker, 16, a junior at the school.
Baker was one of many people connected to the school and the community who lashed out at officials at a public safety hearing Wednesday.
"I looked outside of the gym and I saw 12 to 15 guys, sitting there, with no IDs," Baker said at the hearing.
I am friends with the girl," Baker said.
The court described Morales as under 16, and did not give an age for Peter.
As many as 10 people were involved in the assault in a dimly lit back alley at the school, police have said.
Another 10 people watched, without calling 911, police said.
