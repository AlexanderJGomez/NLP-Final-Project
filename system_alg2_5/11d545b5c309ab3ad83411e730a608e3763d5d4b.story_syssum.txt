My thesis was that attitudes toward motherhood changed as the care of children became the exclusive responsibility of mothers.
Modern motherhood is a cultural invention, I argued, not biological destiny.
Why?
Mayer's decision was portrayed as limiting work-life flexibility for mothers, who may need to be at home -- or prefer to be at home -- with their children.
Maternal employment continues to pose a threat to our strongly held belief about motherhood -- it is natural for mothers, not fathers, to have primary responsibility for raising children.
When women are pregnant, people ask them, but not the fathers of their children, whether they plan to return to work.
The cost to women is great in lost opportunity.
By encouraging women to "lean in," some, such as Slaughter, say Sandberg is placing undue burden on individual women.
Our implicit biases limit the aspirations of men and women alike.
Only then will we change our culture.
