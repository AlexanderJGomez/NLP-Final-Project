Frances Townsend says the director of the CIA is not a post for on-the-job training.
Mr. Panetta is a seasoned political operative and a proven manager -- both of which would be useful to him as CIA director -- but more is required.
Because of the critical role the intelligence community plays in protecting our nation, the director of the CIA is not a position for on-the-job training.
Mr. Brennan's loyalty was to the mission and role of the intelligence community in protecting our nation.
Before abrogating Bush Administration policies on interrogation and detention, the new CIA director must learn: what is legal; what is effective; and how have these policies been implemented.
Tools that the Justice Department deem legal and the intelligence community determines are effective must not be taken away because they are politically unpopular.
If Mr. Panetta is to be the next CIA director, he will need to earn the trust, confidence and respect of career intelligence officials.
