LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN) -- Police and soldiers killed at least 133 people during two days of riots between Muslims and Christians in Nigeria last year, Human Rights Watch alleged Monday.
"I saw them enter one house just across the street from us," the unnamed witness said.
A third said he saw an unarmed shopkeeper plead for his life.
Police then returned and shot tear gas into the neighbor's house, he testified.
The shopkeeper "died a short time later," the neighbor said.
The rights group said the state commission examining the riots should investigate and call for the prosecution of security forces involved.
Human Rights Watch estimates that more than 1,000 people were killed in riots in 2001.
