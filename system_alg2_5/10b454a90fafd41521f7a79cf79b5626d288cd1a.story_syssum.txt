(CNN) -- It was a day of firsts at the World Cup as France got a boost from technology and Bosnia and Herzegovina scored a groundbreaking goal.
Messi scored a sublime goal in the 65th minute, on a give-and-go with Gonzalo Higuain that led to a strong left foot off the inside of the post.
But entering this year's World Cup, much of the focus lay on Messi's lack of goal scoring in the 2010 tournament, which ended with a 4-0 Argentine loss to Germany in the quarterfinals.
Seferovic's 93rd minute goal was the latest anyone has ever scored in World Cup group play, according to ESPN.
A player leaps high but just can't quite get to a cross.
A shot hits the post and ends up barely over the goal line.
It was the first goal confirmed by goal line technology -- introduced at this World Cup by FIFA.
Only?
Ok, we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves; there are 52 matches left.
