Subway Tokyo has an incredibly efficient subway, but the 13 lines are run by two different companies, Toei Subways and Tokyo Metro, meaning a bewildering variety of day passes are available.
Taxis During the day traffic can be gridlocked, but in the evening, when traffic is lighter, taxis are reasonably alternative to the subway.
ATMs Although Tokyo is ultra-modern, you may have to revert to carrying travelers' checks for the duration of your stay.
Metropolis and Tokyo Notice Board are two of the best -- and they're both free.
