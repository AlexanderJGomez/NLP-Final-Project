Naturally, California has many such hotels, but movie star hotels are scattered all over the world.
The Timberline Lodge was used as the exterior of the Overlook Hotel for the 1980 Stephen King and Stanley Kubrick movie "The Shining," starring Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall.
It turns out the hotel is haunted, driving the father (Nicholson's character, Jack Torrance) insane.
The hotel was used in 1994's "Dumb and Dumber" and called Hotel Danbury.
The Aqua Star Pool, the largest heated pool in Beverly Hills, is surrounded by cabana guest rooms for easy access to the Southern California sunshine.
Another Beverly Hills hotel featured in movies is the Beverly Wilshire, just around the corner from Rodeo Drive.
The hotel is so associated with the film that many Los Angelenos simply point it out as the "Pretty Woman" hotel.
The resort has 36 Ralph Lauren-designed rooms in its main building, called the Pineapple House, along with 27 private villas, the type of room Stella stayed in.
Plenty of hotels have been used as James Bond locations, yet few are said to have helped inspire the character.
While many remember dramatic Swiss Alps ski scenes with machine guns setting off avalanches, "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" opens on the beaches of Portugal, with James Bond staying at the Hotel Palacio overlooking the Bay of Cascais.
