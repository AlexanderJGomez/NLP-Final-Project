They simply did not happen," Cain insisted of the accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior, and at least one incident of alleged sexual groping, when he was head of the National Restaurant Association from 1996 to 1999.
Ain't going to happen," Cain said.
The restaurant association said at the time that it investigated the accusations and Cain denied them, Bennett noted.
At the news conference, Cain said the only complaint he could recall regarding Kraushaar involved a comment he made that she was about the same height as his wife, as he held his hand up to his chin.
Bennett told CNN that Gloria Allred and Bialek have agreed to participate.
Bialek said earlier Tuesday that a reason she came forward with her account of Cain's alleged misbehavior 14 years after the fact was encouragement from her 13-year-old son.
"He said, 'Mom, I think you need to do the right thing.
Bialek said Cain told her, "You want a job, right?"
She didn't file a complaint at the time because she no longer worked for the association, said Bialek, who also denied wanting any money for going public, despite a bankruptcy stemming from costs related to her late mother's medical bills.
Bialek's bombshell came as Cain was in his second week of battling the sexual harassment allegations that have overwhelmed his front-running campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.
Mitt Romney atop the polls, and his campaign said it raised $2 million in the week since the sexual harassment accusations first surfaced in an October 30 report by Politico.
"This isn't for fun.
In denying all the allegations, Cain said Tuesday that he still has the support of his wife of more than 40 years.
"He needs to be upfront, forthright and get this story behind him," said Bob Vander Plaats, a leading Iowa Republican activist.
"You cannot let this dominate the campaign," Vander Plaats said, a sentiment echoed by other analysts.
She told CNN Tuesday that Cain and the women should testify under oath.
