Spencer Elden, 17, recreates his pose from 1991's Nirvana "Nevermind" album.
"Stuff happens like random cool situations where I get paid $500 just to go hang out," Elden said.
Like Nirvana, Elden hopes to entertain us.
A Hollywood film role might be in the works, but Elden and his father, who is also a designer and artist, aren't revealing any details.
Really, all he wants is a guest spot on the "Howard Stern Show."

"Nevermind" essentially sowed the seeds for music that defined the 1990s, said Tom Moon, author of  "1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die."
Nirvana's promise was cut short in 1994 by Cobain's suicide at age 27 in his Seattle, Washington, home.
But the band's success opened the flood gates for flannel-clad, angst-ridden rockers including Pearl Jam, Soundgarden and others.
