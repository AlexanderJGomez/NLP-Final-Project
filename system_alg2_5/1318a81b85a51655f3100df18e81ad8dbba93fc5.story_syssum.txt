First lady Michelle Obama dazzled in a Jason Wu original gown.
Wu, one of America's leading young designers, debuted his first collection in February 2006 and has since earned accolades such as Fashion Group International's Rising Star Award.
They include Cuban-American designers Isabel Toledo, who designed her yellow lace inauguration ensemble; Narciso Rodriguez, designer of the red and black dress she wore on election night; and designer Thakoon Panichgul, originally from Thailand, who designed the floral dress she wore the evening her husband accepted the Democratic nomination for president.
"This is a J.Crew ensemble," she told the host.
"Michelle Obama has a specific style that works for her.
It's all about looking polished, like you know what you're doing."
