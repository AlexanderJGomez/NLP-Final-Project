(CNN) -- Johan Friso, the 43-year-old Dutch prince who was injured in an avalanche at an Austrian ski resort last week, has suffered brain damage, his doctor said Friday.
He was skiing outside the bounds of the ski resort with friends at the resort of Lech am Arlberg when he was hit by an avalanche, a spokesman for the state of Vorarlberg said.
"We have hoped that Prince Friso will recover again," said Mayor Ludwig Muxel.
It cited new snowfall on top of a packed layer of snow that could cause snow slabs to slide off.
