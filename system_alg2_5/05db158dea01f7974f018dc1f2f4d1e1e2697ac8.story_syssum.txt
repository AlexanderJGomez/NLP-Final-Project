The eurozone fiscal pact has to be ratified by 12 participating nations.
• The current European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), the money-lending safety net created by the eurozone last year to combat the crisis, will be phased out in mid-2013.
• The implementation of the eurozone's permanent bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), brought forward to 2012, will run alongside the existing fund for about a year.
The ESM will get €700 billion in funds paid in by eurozone countries relative to the size of their economies.
The €200 billion earmarked for the IMF will come from Europe's national central banks.
No.
Some say this will result in a two-tier European Union.
This leaves Britain, under Prime Minister David Cameron, alone among the 27 European Union nations to point-blank refuse to sign.
With Britain forcing the treaty to operate outside EU mechanisms, there could be an appetite among the rest of Europe to cold shoulder the UK and concentrate resources within their new club.
The new treaty was not due to be finalized until March this year -- after which it will have to be ratified by all participating countries.
This could lead to an evaporation of investor confidence, the collapse of debt-exposed banks, an emptying of government coffers, a nosedive by share markets, and bleak prospects for the euro.
