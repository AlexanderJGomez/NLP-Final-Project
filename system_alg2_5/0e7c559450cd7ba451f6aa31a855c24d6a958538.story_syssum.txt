(Rolling Stone) -- Denver's stately Ellie Caulkins Opera House hosted the kickoff of Death Cab for Cutie's intimate theater tour last night, beginning a 22-date jaunt that finds the indie-pop band collaborating with San Francisco's Magik*Magik Orchestra.
Gibbard isn't known for burying his emotions, at least in song, but it was reassuring to hear him gush over Death Cab's slowcore opening act, "Low," who delivered a typically monk-like set of calm harmony and clanging guitar.
"Jason looks like he stole that drum kit from Tito Puente," Gibbard quipped, in one of the night's few unscripted moments.
An unusually vulnerable "I Will Follow You Into the Dark" highlighted the six-song appendage, contrasted by another one of the night's few moments of abandon, a cacophonous "Transatlanticism" that gave the sleepy show the slap it needed to continue on for another 20-plus dates.
