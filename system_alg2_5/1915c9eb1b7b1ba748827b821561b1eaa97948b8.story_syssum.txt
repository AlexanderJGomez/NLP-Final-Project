BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Samar Saed Abdullah's entire body trembles as she speaks about her impending execution.
The 27-year-old Iraqi woman is sentenced to die in connection with the slayings of three relatives in January 2005.
Samar was sentenced to death by hanging for being an accessory to murder in the killings of her uncle, aunt and cousin -- slayings that she says were carried out at their home by her husband-to-be, who remains on the loose.
Samar has now been moved a step closer to death: to Baghdad's maximum-security prison, where there are more than 500 prisoners waiting to be executed.
"I think about it every day, every hour.
It all happened in just two months."
The Iraqi police picked Samar up the next day, after Saif dumped her in front of her house and disappeared.
"And now I am here in prison, and he is out on the streets, happy."
"They kept beating me, and they told me, 'Say whatever we want you to say, and do not say anything else, and say yes, I was an accomplice to this crime.'
But it did not.
And they say that what makes implementing capital punishment even more disturbing is that the Iraqi judicial system does not guarantee a fair trial.
...
Local organizations like the Organization for Women's Freedom in Iraq have for years been fighting to get the death penalty abolished in Iraq, especially when it comes to flawed trials and women being put to death.
"As a human rights organization in Iraq, we find that we need some backup from abroad to put pressure on our government as a first step to stop the executions of these women, some of whom we know are innocent."
Me?
I just want to stay with my parents."
Samar feels betrayed, both by the man she once loved and by a judicial system that is about to send her to her death.
