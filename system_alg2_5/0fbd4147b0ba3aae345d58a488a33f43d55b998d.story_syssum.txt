First responders could still have problems communicating with one another, and there is confusion in some communities about who would be in charge, Hamilton told the House Homeland Security Committee.
Tom Ridge, the first secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said competing measures to deal with the problem are being considered by the House and Senate, while police and fire departments are waiting for some kind of action.
Hamilton said another concern is knowing who is in charge in the event of a disaster.
Ridge said the United States has been able to thwart many terror plots, but in some instances it was because the bombers made mistakes and were ineffective.
