The ban would have included sodas, energy drinks, fruit drinks and sweetened teas.
In fact, the Board of Health has the power, indeed the responsibility, to regulate sugary drinks for the sake of city residents, particularly the poor.
Why?
This works, even if a person can take an additional portion.
So, there is good reason to believe New York's portion control would work.
Why doesn't the ban apply to milky drinks, why can 7-Eleven sell large sugary drinks, and why not ban refills?
Consider one of the judge's major arguments: balancing public health and economic considerations is "impermissible."
But the Board of Health has authority to act in cases where there is an imminent threat to health.
In any event, the Board of Health has authority over the food supply and chronic disease, which is exactly what it has used in this case.
The fingerprints of the food and restaurant industries, with their clear economic conflicts of interest, are all over the public and judicial campaign to block the soda ban.
Most New Yorkers oppose the portion ban, while politicians in other states are scrambling to show their disapproval.
If consumers really want, they can buy several smaller drinks.
Because when it is shown to be successful in New York, it will be emulated in major cities in America and worldwide.
