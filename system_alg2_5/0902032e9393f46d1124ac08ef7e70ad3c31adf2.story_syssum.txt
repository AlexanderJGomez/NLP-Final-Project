Haifa, Israel (CNN) -- Israeli police said Friday that they suspect arson in the wildfire that has killed at least 41 people and injured 17 in northern Israel over the past two days.
Forty of the fatalities were cadets in Israel's prison service who were en route Thursday to help evacuate 500 inmates from Damon prison near Haifa when their bus became engulfed in the fast-moving blaze, the Jerusalem Post reported.
The fire has also threatened a sensitive ecological area near the Hai Bar nature reserve.
"On the way here, we flew over Carmel, where we heard and saw the Greek aircraft fighting the fire," Netanyahu said.
Chemicals to suppress the flames -- including 45 metric tons of fire retardant and 12,000 liters of foam -- will arrive this weekend through the U.S. Agency for International Development, that agency said, with teams of U.S.-based firefighting specialists also on their way.
"I appreciate this much in a time of a humanitarian and ecological crisis.
