For the Vietnamese-Americans living in the Gulf Coast region, the oil disaster is especially complicated.
About 6,000 live within a two-mile radius in the neighborhood of New Orleans East -- distinguishing it, the area's priest says, as the greatest concentration of Vietnamese people outside of Vietnam.
He worries about the lack of job training and opportunities for a people who've worked in an industry that may suffer for God knows how long.
About 80 percent of Vietnamese-Americans in the Gulf region are connected to the seafood industry through jobs that include fishing, shucking oysters, packing shrimp, and running stores and restaurants, the priest and others say.
They'd already uprooted themselves and started over with nothing in 1954, when their country divided into North and South and they, as the Catholic minority living in Vietnam, ran from the Communist rule that took over the North.

The shrimp being unloaded off their boat amounts to a third of what they usually bring in, says Nguyen, 27.
But Rep. Cao holds out hope that the Vietnamese community in the Gulf will pull through -- because it always has.
"It's an obstacle in life, and we will overcome it.
