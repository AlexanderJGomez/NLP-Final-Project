"I could have done this last year, not this hero stuff," said Ramsey.
He ran from his living room, clutching a half-eaten McDonald's Big Mac, to the house and helped free a woman identified as Amanda Berry.
"She's like, 'This (expletive) kidnapped me and my daughter,'" he told the 911 operator, according to WEWS.
Ramsey told CNN he is no hero and should not receive any reward.
Explaining that he had no idea Ariel Castro, his neighbor, may have had other people inside his home, Ramsey said, "I've been here a year.
You see what I'm saying?
"Because we see this dude every day.
#hero."
"You give him something to do, and he'll do more," he said.
Ramsey said he was raised to help women in distress, said Walsh.
"Hey bro," Ramsey tells the 911 operator.
She's like, 'This m--------r done kidnapped me and my daughter ...  She said her name is Linda Berry or some s--t. I don't know who the f--k that is, I just moved over here, bro.
Like I said, I just came from McDonald's."
The operator then asks him to check whether Berry needs an ambulance.
