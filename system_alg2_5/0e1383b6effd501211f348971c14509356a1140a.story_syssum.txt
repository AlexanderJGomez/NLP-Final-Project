(CNN) -- Residents of large swaths of central and Southern California and Arizona shivered Saturday as plummeting temperatures prompted freeze warnings.
No injuries were immediately reported.
"Basically we will be back to normal temperatures," Stellman told CNN.
According to CNN affiliate KCAL, freeze warnings were expected to be in effect through 9 a.m. Sunday for most of Southern California, with a freeze watch posted for Sunday night through Monday morning.
Overnight freezing temperatures will continue through Tuesday.
Fire officials said homeowners set up a heat lamp and blankets on their back patio.
