Western education is a sin in the eyes of the terror group --- and nowhere has that message more clearly hit home than in their recent horrific attack on Chibok Girls Secondary School.
Daniel Muvia, a resident of Chibok who witnessed the attack on his village, says he is too scared to take his daughters to school.
"No one can afford losing their daughter," he says.
"If in Chibok, I'll never go again," she says.
"When I see all these people doing their jobs, I have the desire -- or the hope -- that I want my children to be like them," he says.
