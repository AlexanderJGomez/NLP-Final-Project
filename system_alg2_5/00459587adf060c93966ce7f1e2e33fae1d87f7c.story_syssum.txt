(CNN) -- A Florida judge sentenced Rachel Wade, the 20-year-old woman convicted of second-degree murder for fatally stabbing her romantic rival in a fight last year, to 27 years in prison Friday.
TruTV's "In Session" correspondent Beth Karas spoke to Wade days before her sentencing.
"I just don't think this was a case that called for life," said Jay Hebert.
"I don't think we can appreciate how young people talk," he said.
"There's no face-to-face interaction."
