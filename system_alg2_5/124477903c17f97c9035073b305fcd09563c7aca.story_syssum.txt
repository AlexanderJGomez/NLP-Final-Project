The new PlayStation hit stores a week before Microsoft's Xbox One does the same, touching off a new round in the fight for the hearts of console gamers.
Matt said he's more of a sports gamer and really wants to see what next year's "Madden" will be like when it is designed specifically for the new console.
Andrew House, president and group CEO of Sony Entertainment, said building this next-generation console took nearly seven years and that Sony had specific goals in mind to reach today's launch date.
"They were making extra trips to the store just to make sure they had everything they wanted for when they got their new PS4."
"I just like the experience of standing in line, meeting new people, sharing gamer tags," Gergen said.
But Lockhart said she wasn't getting the PS4 for herself.
Over the next few months, PlayStation 4 consoles will go on sale in other countries around the world, with the final launch date set for February in Japan.
