As the Opening Ceremony was under way, Georgia's president said that his country was under attack by Russian tanks and warplanes.
This version of the Olympics brings with it controversy, discord that began in 2001 when the 2008 Games were awarded to Beijing.
Political leaders do not attend Olympic opening ceremonies as a matter of protocol -- Bush is the first American president to attend them outside the United States -- but China seemed determined to have as many there as possible.
The first medals will be awarded Saturday, and China hoped to claim the first gold of the Games.
Government officials have said they expect nothing less than a repeat gold medal from 110-meter hurdler Liu Xiang.
