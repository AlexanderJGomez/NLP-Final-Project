Anneke van Woudenberg, senior researcher with Human Rights Watch, told Christiane Amanpour that 200,000 women and girls have been raped in Eastern Congo since 1998, and the condition of women has become more dire as the Congolese army has pressed a military campaign against armed groups in the countryside.
While the war formally ended six years ago, fighting persists in eastern Congo, and women are paying a high price.
It's protecting them from rape," van Woudenberg said.
"I think they've got to start holding to account the generals and colonels who are either themselves responsible or who allow their troops to rape.
The army has also started a zero-tolerance campaign in which commanders have emphasized to troops that they must respect human rights and protect civilians from harm, according to the U.N.
Jean-Marie Guehenno, the former head of U.N. peacekeeping, told Amanpour that the international forces face a serious problem: Too few troops assigned to the vast inaccessible reaches of eastern Congo.
"The violence in the Kivu, the violence in Ituri, it is the result of a vacuum, the fact that there is no administration, there is no credible state, there is no justice.
My hope is that the women and girls of -- of eastern Congo in particular -- will continue to speak out.
