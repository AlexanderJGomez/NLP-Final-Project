Wenjian Liu was remembered Saturday at Aievoli Funeral Home in Brooklyn, where Mayor Bill de Blasio, Police Commissioner William Bratton, local officials and throngs of uniformed police officers and firefighters gathered at his wake in a sign of the diversity and unity of the nation's largest city.
On Sunday, a sea of dark blue drawn from the police forces of New York and beyond is expected to find its way to the funeral home for Liu's funeral at 11 a.m.
On Saturday, several officers saluted de Blasio when he arrived at the funeral home.
But for Sunday's funeral, Bratton is putting his foot down at a potential repeat by some officers.
The last display put all NYPD officers in a bad light, he said.
Ramos and Liu were sitting in their squad car in Brooklyn when Ismaaiyl Brinsley ambushed them with a gun December 20.
Liu's family came to the United States from Canton, China, in search of a better life.
His family was waiting for family to come from China.
Ramos saw his work as a police officer as a ministry and was posthumously appointed honorary NYPD chaplain.
Andrew Cuomo, de Blasio and Bratton delivered eulogies at his funeral.
