Sebelius became the 44th governor of the state of Kansas in 2003.
But the governor has paid her political dues, with stints as a Kansas state representative and state insurance commissioner.
Most of the national political figures to come out of Kansas have been Republicans, like President Dwight Eisenhower and former Sen. Bob Dole.
Sebelius has won two gubernatorial elections in a state with roughly twice as many registered Republicans as Democrats.
But she has begun to have an impact beyond the Midwest.
If Sen. Hillary Clinton fails to capture the presidential nomination this year, many Democrats say Sebelius will remain high on any vice presidential short list.
