The number of pilots reporting being targeted by lasers nearly doubled last year to 2,836, up from 1,527 the previous year, the FAA said.
In the past, the FAA has used the regulation against passengers on board aircraft who interfere with an aircraft's crew.
"We will not hesitate to take tough action against anyone who threatens the safety of our passengers, pilots and air transportation system."
Last year, Los Angeles International Airport recorded 102 laser events -- the highest number of laser events in the country for a single airport.
The Food and Drug Administration, which regulates lasers, required outdoor laser light show operators to notify the FAA of proposed laser operations and resolve any objections that the FAA may have.
