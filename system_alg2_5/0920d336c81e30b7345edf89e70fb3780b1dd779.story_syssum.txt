Now 19-year-old Yaasmeen Castanada is fighting for her life inside a California hospital's burn unit, suffering from an allergic reaction that's so severe she has large open wounds all over her body.
"When she took the medication, she started having a hard time breathing, and she told her mom that her lips were burning, her throat, her eyes, they got so red that she couldn't talk.
"Just unreal, just watching your daughter burn in front of you, literally, burn in front of you," her mother, Laura Corona, told KABC.
And I can't take her home.
Don't offer medication," she said.
At first, doctors diagnosed Castanada with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, which refers to a condition where between 10% and 30% of the skin on the body is affected, Joe said.
"We are trying to prevent that from happening."
As part of her treatment for the disease, doctors have wrapped her body in a special dressing, Joe said.
The fact that you can get a life-threatening situation from taking a medication.
It's almost over.'"
