Boston (CNN)Hillary Clinton stood with those protesting the deaths of two unarmed black males at the hands of law enforcement on Thursday, telling an audience in Boston that "our country deserves a full and fair accounting" of what happened.
"We all know there are decent, honorable, brave police officers out in our communities every single day," Clinton said, before telling the audience the fact that African-American males are more likely to end up in prison than their white counterparts was a byproduct of an "out of balance" criminal justice system.
"Each of us has to grapple with some hard truths about race and justice in America," Clinton said.
"Nobody wants to see our streets look like a war zone, not in America.
In a hall the size of multiple football fields, 10,000 women ate lunch and listened to Clinton talk at the Massachusetts Conference for Women.
Around the hall, there was excitement for Clinton.
Clinton was not the only high-profile speaker on the stage Thursday.
