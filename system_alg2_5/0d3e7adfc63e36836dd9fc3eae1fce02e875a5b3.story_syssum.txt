At its December open meeting, the Federal Communications Commission may vote on a proposed rule that would mandate automatic data-roaming agreements between carriers and address consumer worries by requiring reasonable prices for this service.
Network neutrality -- the contentious principle that broadband providers should maintain equal Web access to all and not offer favorable delivery speeds to certain clients -- may be at stake with this vote.
To impose the rule, the FCC would need to change the legal framework that governs broadband services -- an idea pushed by net neutrality advocates but vehemently opposed by many Republicans and internet providers.
The carriers also have a more fundamental objection to the proposed data-roaming rule: They claim the FCC does not have the authority to regulate the data side of their business.
The agenda for the December FCC open meeting has not yet been published.
