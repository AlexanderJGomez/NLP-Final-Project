One hundred Labor caucus members had been due to vote, but in the end, no votes were cast because there were no candidates beyond Gillard for prime minister, and Wayne Swan as her deputy.
Gillard called the vote for 4:30 p.m. local time (1:30 a.m.
Before the vote, Crean said he wouldn't be nominating himself as leader, but would take the job of deputy.
An uneasy tension has existed between Rudd and Gillard since his former deputy staged a successful bid to replace him in June 2010.
In January, Gillard surprised the country by calling an election for September 14, the longest lead time for an Australian election in history.
