(CNN) -- A federal court jury in Detroit has awarded a $4.5 million judgment to the University of Michigan's first openly gay student body president in his suit against a former Michigan assistant attorney general who had written disparagingly about him on the Internet, the student's lawyer said.
Shirvell also referred to Armstrong as "Satan's representative" on the Michigan Student Assembly, she said.
Gordon said that Shirvell's claim is without merit.
"Defamation refers to statements that are false that you say about another person.
Gordon said the multimillion-dollar judgment "is probably not collectable" at this time, since Shirvell has no job.
She said Armstrong has graduated and is currently employed, but did not want to divulge for whom he is working.
