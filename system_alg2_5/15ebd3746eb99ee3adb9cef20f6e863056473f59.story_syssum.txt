Senator Bennett Johnston, a Democrat who beat back a challenge from Duke in 1990, said even he didn't know that  EURO as "a racist organization."
"While it is sometimes fun to see Republicans in trouble, you'd be wrong to blame Representative Steve Scalise for being racist on account of addressing a (EURO) meeting."
Scalise called the appearance at European-American Unity and Rights Organization (EURO), a white supremacist group founded by Duke, a former Klu Klux Klan grand wizard, a "mistake I regret" and said the group was one of many he addressed when he was a state senator crisscrossing the state to drum up support for a piece of legislation.
"One of the many groups that I spoke to regarding this critical legislation was a group whose views I wholeheartedly condemn," Scalise said Tuesday in a statement.
