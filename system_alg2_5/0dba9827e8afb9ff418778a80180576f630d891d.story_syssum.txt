HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- It's small, affluent, tech-savvy and it has a very obvious pollution problem -- Hong Kong is arguably an ideal destination for electric cars.
Hong Kong still hasn't got its act together when it comes to electric vehicles (EVs), according to the chief executive of MyCar's manufacturer, EuAuto Technology, Chung Sin-ling.
Hong Kong is not without EVs though.
But Masset says the political will is still not there to promote EVs in the city.
And education needs to come from the government, he says.
Hong Kongers are not familiar with EVs he says, and are concerned about the technology so they need to be shown that EVs are just as good as petrol cars.
"Taxis, minibuses, buses can be forced to go electric but the government isn't doing anything," says Cheng.
Cheng says the amount of money his department received to design MyCar was nowhere near enough and to him, it told him how important the government view EVs.
How can we build a new generation of EVs for Hong Kong?
In the meantime Chung is making plans to sell MyCar in London, her first stop the London Motor Show in July to stir up some more interest.
"We want to come here -- as long as the policy is there to make it happen," says Chung.
