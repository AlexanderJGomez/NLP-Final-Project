Although he was known for many things, Baker's most enduring moment came in the middle of the Watergate scandal, when he asked: "What did the president know and when did he know it?"
Americans could never look at government the same way again.
For Democrats, who many thought would have been the beneficiaries of a scandal that brought down a Republican president, the level of distrust that the scandal generated among the public has been an ongoing challenge.
Their programs have, likewise, been subject to constant scrutiny as a result of the lingering distrust from Watergate.
Republicans have pushed for expanding the military budget and since 9/11 many have called for an aggressive response to terrorism that includes sweeping surveillance programs and enhanced interrogation techniques.
The worst effect of Watergate is that it created a climate where Americans fundamentally don't trust their government.
It is extremely difficult for government to do its job or for voters to have the kind of faith in government, which is necessary for a healthy society.
Until we take those kinds of steps, voters will always be seeing the shadow of Richard Nixon when they look at their elected leaders.
