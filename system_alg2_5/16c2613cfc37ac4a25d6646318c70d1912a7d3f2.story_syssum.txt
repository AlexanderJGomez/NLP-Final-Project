(CNN) -- Olympic hero Michael Phelps was suspended from competitive swimming for three months on Thursday -- just hours after one of his sponsors announced it would not renew his contract after a photo surfaced of him smoking from a bong.
Norwitz said Kellogg's relationship with Phelps began with the company's support of the U.S. Olympic team.
On Thursday, before the decisions by USA Swimming and Kellogg were announced, Phelps told CNN affiliate WBAL that the incident was a result of "bad judgment."
"I think it's hard to really be ready for any of this.
The U.S. Olympic Committee also issued a statement that said in part: "Michael has acknowledged that he made a mistake and apologized for his actions.
He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 18 months probation.
