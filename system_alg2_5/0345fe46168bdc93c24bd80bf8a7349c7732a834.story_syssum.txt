The incident occurred at the Exchange Place station in Jersey City, and the three injured and taken to hospitals had possible back or neck injuries, according to Ron Marsico, spokesman for the Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) service.
"You could hear people screaming, people were jumping off the sides," said Rodriguez.
"As a precaution, PATH has suspended escalator service at Exchange Place through (Tuesday) morning," said Marsico.
"To see something like that happen was really icing on the cake," he said.
