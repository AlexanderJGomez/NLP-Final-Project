(CNN) -- A journalist who has criticized NBC's coverage of the London Olympics has been suspended from Twitter after using the site to publish a network executive's private e-mail address and urge followers to message him.
"When I logged on, I was presented with a message saying it had been 'suspended,' " Adams wrote in a post for the Independent.
Twitter spokeswoman Rachael Horowitz said the company doesn't "comment on individual users for privacy reasons."
Twitter does say that posting information that's already been published online doesn't violate its terms.
Adams has used Twitter and his articles to fire withering criticism at NBC over how it has handled Olympic coverage.
"If criticizing NBC over how it's handled the Olympic coverage were cause for suspension Twitter would pretty much be empty right about now," wrote tech industry analyst Michael Gartenberg.
