It's an unmanned aerial vehicle -- commonly called a UAV or a drone -- and it's coming to deliver your order right to your front door.
Foreign governments have quickly embraced its potential and have passed safety rules allowing a diverse array of commercial users to operate UAVs.
But the United States has fallen behind in the race to explore where this new technology can take us.
Yet while other countries acted quickly to do so -- in some instances, years ago -- the commercial use of drones in the United States has remained illegal with the exception of a small handful of commercial users who have successfully filed for waivers at the Federal Aviation Administration.
Imagine a firefighter using a UAV to gain a bird's-eye view of emergencies and use that new perspective to contain flames better.
Whether it's a UAV or something yet unimagined, emerging technologies are transforming the way the world works in the 21st century, providing businesses, individuals and governments with potentially game-changing opportunities.
