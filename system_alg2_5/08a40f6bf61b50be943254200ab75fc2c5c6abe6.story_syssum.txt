Woods had another solid day Friday, moving to a tie for the lead with Jim Furyk and David Toms.
McIlroy finished 10 over.
"You really have to be so precise out there, and if you're not, you're going to get punished," McIlroy told reporters.
The grouping of Woods, Phil Mickelson and Watson was billed as the marquee pairing of popular champions, but Woods was the only one who lived up to the billing.
Donald said his game was off both Thursday and Friday.
Casey Martin, playing his first major since the U.S. Open at the same venue in 1998, missed the cut by one shot.
He was the first golfer to use a cart in a major 14 years ago, causing controversy and sparking a law suit by the PGA Tour.
