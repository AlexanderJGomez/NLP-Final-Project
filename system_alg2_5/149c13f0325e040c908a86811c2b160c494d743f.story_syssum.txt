GameStop executives thinks the Grand Theft Auto IV release could net them $100 million in one week.
Times are good, with double digit growth expected for sales of games this calendar year as well as for the hardware that's used to play those games.
"By any barometer," one company executive said in a conference call with analysts, "[it's been] another outstanding year for GameStop."
Hickey said today he expects that the release of Grand Theft Auto IV could net the company more than $100 million--in a single week.
The first World of Warcraft expansion pack released last year sold 2.4 million copies in 24 hours and 3.5 million copies in the first month, Hickey says.
