(CNN)The Department of Homeland Security is increasing security checks at American airports because of concerns over new bomb-making instructions released by al Qaeda in Yemen (AQAP), the terrorist group which U.S. intelligence agencies believe may have been behind the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris, U.S. officials tell CNN.
The main charge -- a white powdery explosive called PETN which airport security scanners at Amsterdam airport did not detect -- failed to detonate as the plane approached Detroit.
That recipe was downloaded and used by the Boston bombers and several other extremists in plots on both sides of the Atlantic.
Nor is it clear if the device would have any chance of getting through explosive scanners at airport security.
Counterterrorism officials on both sides of the Atlantic been concerned about technical instruction provided by Inspire magazine for several years.
We judge that it significantly enhanced the capability of individuals in four of these 10 attack plots."
