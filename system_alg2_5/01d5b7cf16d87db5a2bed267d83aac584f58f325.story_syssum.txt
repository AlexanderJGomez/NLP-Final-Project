Washington (CNN) -- The chairman of the Republican Party and a leading GOP senator called on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to give up his post Sunday, following the publication of remarks he made about President Obama's race in 2008.
Tim Kaine of Virginia, chairman of the Democratic Party, said "the case is closed" following Reid's round of apologies.
Democrats rejected the calls for Reid's dismissal, and Reid's office made clear he has no plans to step down.
I was a proud and enthusiastic supporter of Barack Obama during the campaign and have worked as hard as I can to advance President Obama's legislative agenda," Reid said.
And the senate leader called Obama on Saturday afternoon to apologize for the remarks.
Steele, the GOP's first African-American chairman, was asked about the remarks on both "Meet the Press" and "Fox News Sunday."
Cornyn, in his statement, also accused Democrats of following a "double standard," and noted that they had pushed Lott to step down.
"Anybody looking at Trent Lott's statements praising somebody who had been a pro-segregation candidate for president will see that there is no comparison between those comments and those of Sen. Reid," Kaine told NBC.
"Fox News Sunday" host Chris Wallace noted that lawmakers from both parties have called that a racial slur.
I wasn't intending to say a racial slur at all," Steele said.
