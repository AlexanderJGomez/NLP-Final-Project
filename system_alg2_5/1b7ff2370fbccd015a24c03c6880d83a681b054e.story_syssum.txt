It's just a coincidence that the release of the Michael Jackson King of Pop slot game on Tuesday is occurring along with the trial of the performer's physician, Conrad Murray, who's charged with involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death, said a spokesman for Bally Technologies.
A University of Nevada Las Vegas gaming analyst who reviewed the machine Friday predicted it is "going to be a popular game for a lot of people" -- though it is "unfortunate" that the game is being unveiled during the manslaughter trial, the analyst said.
Bally plans to show 150 games in total, with the Jackson slot machine among its top features, the firm said.
The game emphasizes an immersion experience in which players sit in a chair with Jackson's music piped into speakers behind the headrest, and the tunes are intensified with subwoofers and thumpers, said Bally video game designer David Schultz.
The game targets people who grew up to MTV and recall Jackson's original videos, Bally executives said.
Because the game will be networked with other Jackson machines across Nevada -- a so-called wide-area progressive game -- the jackpots will start at $750,000 and extend into the millions, Bally officials said.
That's why I think it's going to be a popular game for a lot of people.
