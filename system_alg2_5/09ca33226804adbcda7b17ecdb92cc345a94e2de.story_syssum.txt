London, England (CNN) -- Lockerbie bomber Abdelbeset al-Megrahi is "a very sick man," but there is no way to tell how long he will live, according to the father of one of the people who died in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.
"At three months, just over half [of people with his cancer] would be dead," Swire said.
Swire thinks al-Megrahi feels guilty about having withdrawn his appeal, since it leaves him with no way to clear his name or for those -- like Swire -- who think he is innocent to have the case reviewed.
"If he were to die, the the situation would change," and Swire might be able to get the case reopened, he said.
Menendez noted that on August 20, 2009, al-Megrahi stepped off a plane into the arms of a cheering throng in Libya.
The case has outraged many on both sides of the Atlantic and led U.S. senators to demand answers from Scotland about the details of his release.
