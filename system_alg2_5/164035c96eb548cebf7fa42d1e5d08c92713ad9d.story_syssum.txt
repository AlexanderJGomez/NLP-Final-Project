Do you: A) Change the name of your business?
Businesses across the United States are facing this very dilemma because the word "ISIS" is part of their corporate name or product.
The most common reaction from business owners is option "A," dropping the ISIS reference.
Last week the owners of "CafÃ© ISIS" in the United Kingdom felt compelled to change their restaurant's name.
Who actually looks at the name of a business with the word ISIS in it and thinks: "Wow, that terrorist group from the Middle East now opened up a cafe in the neighborhood!"
Or the 1970s children's TV show the "Shazam!-Isis Hour."
(My apologies to any "ISIL CafÃ©" owners out there.)
Why allow a terrorist group to tell you what you can call your business?
