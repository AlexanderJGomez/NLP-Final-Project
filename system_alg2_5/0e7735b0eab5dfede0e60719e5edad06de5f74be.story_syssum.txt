With her story still ringing in my head, I set off to a small village near Chandrapur in India's Maharashtra state on International Youth Day at the behest of UNICEF to visit a new generation of strong young Indian women with some very inspiring stories.
The program is determined to challenge the difficulties many girls face across India, providing them with the knowledge and skills required to become strong financially independent women and also very importantly, to become the agents for change and development in their communities.
We need to urgently invest in their future and help them realize their potential and I am determined to help make that happen.
If we can educate more girls, provide them with employment opportunities and give them the right life skills, their world will open up!
I was invited to their marketplace to see the businesses some of the girls have set up with their new found business and saving skills -- making bags, saris and sanitary napkins -- each a story of a girl transformed, taking charge of her life and starting something of larger social relevance.
How can we make sure that "all girls and boys can make their own name and fate and be independent," as one girl told me.
Walking along a path in this quiet village in the middle of nowhere, it is easy to see how a girl can get lost -- lost for life.
Today Sadhana provides for her parents and her family by saving and building a tailoring business herself, as well as doing much good in her village.
With programs like Building Young Futures, these positive stories and messages will only grow in number.
