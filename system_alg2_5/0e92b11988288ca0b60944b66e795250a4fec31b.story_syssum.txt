(CNN) -- After 25 years, Robin Thomas had just about lost hope.
Bliss says his hope was for the makeover to provide a start down a new path.
Thomas says Wolf has started on that path before.
Thomas says Wolf trained to deploy with an infantry unit but never deployed.
Neither Thomas nor Bliss seemed surprised or anxious when Wolf was arrested shortly after the video was released.
She knows he is not the same big brother who was there for her growing up.
Wolf was recently interviewed for a spot at a long-term residential treatment facility and received a complete physical, Thomas said.
He did not view it as a life-changing event, Thomas says.
I think he's hopeless.
"I may have almost lost hope, but I will never give up."
