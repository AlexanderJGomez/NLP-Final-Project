In early January, the fianc√©e, Shayanna Jenkins, met with Bristol County, Massachusetts, prosecutors in what court documents call an immunity meeting, but the results of that meeting are secret, even from the Hernandez defense team.
He has also pleaded not guilty to weapons charges.
Prosecutors suspect Jenkins of following instructions from Hernandez to get rid of the murder weapon from their home by removing the gun inside a box, putting it in a black trash bag, and borrowing her sister's car to take the bag to a dumpster and throw it away.
She faces possible jail time if found guilty of perjury charges.
Search warrants said Hernandez asked Jenkins to get something out of their basement.
Jenkins told a grand jury she threw the item in a dumpster but couldn't remember where, according to prosecutors.
"I mean, who knows?"
"The jury is going to look at that and say, 'You know something?
Callan suggested that if Jenkins is put on the stand as a prosecution witness and repeats her grand jury testimony that she threw out the item without knowing what was inside and can't remember where she disposed of it, she could put herself in greater legal jeopardy.
