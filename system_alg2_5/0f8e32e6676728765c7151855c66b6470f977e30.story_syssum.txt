A backlash from Democrats over add-ons to a massive government spending bill is throwing passage of the measure into doubt and once again raising concerns about a government shutdown.
Pelosi's position is critical because House Republicans need Democratic support for the measure to pass.
Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the second ranking Democrats who is in charge of counting votes, said he didn't know if he would support the compromise or how many Democrats would.
That has been one of their passions, second only to repealing the Affordable Care Act, and it means that the Wall Street interests -- the big banks, you know -- they're back on top as far as the House Republicans are concerned," he said.
On the campaign finance matter, House Speaker John Boehner said larger individual donations to the parties are needed because Congress had recently eliminated taxpayer funds for political conventions.
Democratic aides say it's still early to gauge how many members will vote no on Thursday, but acknowledge that the deal was brokered by Democrats and Republicans over several weeks.
McCarthy said about those Democrats vowing to oppose the spending measure.
Still Republicans insist that there won't be a shutdown over this issue, and indicated they would consider a short-term funding bill through early next year -- when they will have full control of Congress -- if this bill fails.
