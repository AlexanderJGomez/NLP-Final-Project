(RollingStone.com) -- Paul Reubens is dusting off his red bow-tie once more for a film revival of his iconic character Pee-wee Herman.
"Steven Spielberg?"
The script was written by Reubens and comedian Paul Rust â€” whose writing credits also include "Arrested Development" and "Comedy Bang!
A film sequel, "Big Top Pee-wee," was released in 1988, though was a critical disaster and relative commercial flop.
In 2007, the actor appeared in character at Spike TV's Guy's Choice Awards, marking Pee-wee's first public appearance since 1992; then in 2011, Reubens appeared as Pee-wee in a "Saturday Night Live" segment opposite cast member Andy Samberg.
