(CNN) -- Anna Hazare, the 74-year-old Indian activist set to begin a 15-day hunger strike at a public venue, delivered a message Thursday to the thousands who have taken to the streets in support of his anti-corruption crusade.
The public will continue to be on the streets as long as this Lokpal isn't created."

He accepted a police proposal that will allow him to fast in New Delhi for two weeks.
Hazare's detention appears to have added to his popularity, because it makes it look like the government is going after the messenger rather than offering solutions.
As a result, Hazare was detained, as were 1,300 supporters who planned to join Hazare at a protest site.
The group had refused to leave the prison office until they are allowed to hold their hunger strike without the conditions, the jail spokesman said.
"Our government acknowledges the right of citizens to hold peaceful protests," he said, adding that Hazare and his supporters would have been allowed to hold their protest fast if they had accepted the conditions.
In fact, we will have to act simultaneously on many fronts," Singh said.
"I tell these young people: As long as the Lokpal isn't created, the jails will never be empty."
"We have no demands of the government," he said.
