(Tribune Media Services) -- We don't know where to look first.
Antoni Gaudi's Sagrada Familia is Barcelona's most famous site and Spain's most visited.
Luckily, Gaudi had made plaster models of the church (we see them in the museum at the site) and though they were also smashed, his supporters were able to painstakingly put them back together so the work could continue.
Sometimes, you have to know when to call it quits, even at incredible sites like this one.
Unfortunately, no one in Barcelona gravitated toward the idea.
Barcelona, home to the 1992 Summer Olympics, is a city that appeals to kids (especially teens) and parents.
And with such friendly locals, there's no better place for the kids to practice their Spanish.
Walk off your jet lag by taking in all the chic couples walking along the beach, the city's famous art nouveau architecture, the art, (Picasso lived here as a teen), the ancient Gothic Quarter and the street entertainers along the mile-long Las Ramblas.
We're holing up overnight at the Hotel Arts Barcelona, a Ritz Carlton, a famous icon of the Barcelona skyline and a short walk from the beach and many of the city sites.
It's housed in three spectacular stone mansions in the historic quarter of the city and showcases works from the artist's early years, his Blue Period and early works from Barcelona.
The bull, of course, is the national symbol of Spain.
We are in Barcelona after all.
Erica unfortunately isn't.
We dig into our paella.
