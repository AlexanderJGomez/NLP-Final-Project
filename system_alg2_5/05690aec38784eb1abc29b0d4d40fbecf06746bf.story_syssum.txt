Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- After years of trying to put the past behind it, Brazil has created a truth commission to investigate crimes committed during a painful period in history known as the dirty war.
"Brazil deserves the truth.
Amelia Teles was jailed in 1972 along with her husband at a Sao Paulo police station once known as OBAN, a notorious torture center.
" Teles said.
The seven-member truth commission has been given two years to investigate human rights crimes.
The government has had to overcome outright hostility from retired military brass, and the commission is now grappling with the possibility that some of the archives may have been destroyed.
But Pinheiro is optimistic the commission will help Brazil come to terms with its past and a legacy of impunity in some institutions.
But Herzog said he believes his father, Vladimir Herzog, was tortured and killed, a theory that archives have supported.
"These people who are living the good life like nothing happened, I want to see them excluded," Herzog said.
