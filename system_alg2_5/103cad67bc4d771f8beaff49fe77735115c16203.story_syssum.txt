Fey will always be known as the woman who gave us the quirky character of Liz Lemon on "30 Rock."

Poehler is one of the co-founders of New York's Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre, which sprang from the original improv group in Chicago where she got her start.

But while Fey has two daughters, Poehler has two sons.
