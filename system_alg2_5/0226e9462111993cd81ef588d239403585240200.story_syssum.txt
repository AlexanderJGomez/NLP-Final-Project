The number of reported AIDS cases in the United States was nearing 80,000 and rising rapidly.
For those of us caring for people with AIDS, it was a dark time.
Scientifically proven prevention approaches -- education and outreach to at-risk populations, voluntary HIV testing and counseling, condom distribution, prevention of HIV transmission from mother to baby, harm reduction approaches for drug abusers, mass-media campaigns and the screening of donated blood -- have been deployed with great success in the United States and many other countries.
Much has been accomplished in the fight against HIV/AIDS from scientific, medical and public health standpoints.
In the United States, more than 1 million people are living with HIV.
In low- and middle-income countries, less than one-third of people in need of anti-HIV therapy are receiving it, and only one in five people at risk of HIV infection have access to prevention services.
Here in the United States, more than one-fifth of people living with HIV are unaware of their infection and not receiving appropriate care for their own health or the prevention services that would help them avoid transmitting the virus to others.
Multiple clinical studies of PrEP are under way in the United States and in populations around the world.
Historically, it has taken decades to find effective vaccines to combat most infectious diseases.
On this World AIDS Day, we should be proud of the many scientific advances that have been made in the fight against HIV/AIDS.
