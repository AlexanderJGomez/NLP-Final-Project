Mangue writes about her children on a blog she originally started in memory of her 16-year-old daughter, who died in a car accident in 2004.
Mangue and Ebel's father kept in close contact, sending letters, cards and visiting their son when they could.
The family kept her for 15 years.

He never liked being told what to do and his time in isolation really only compacted that," Frey said.
