In addition to capital murder in Caylee's death, Casey Anthony, now 25, faces six other charges, including aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter of a child and providing false information to authorities.
Also testifying Thursday was Ricardo Morales, who dated Anthony briefly in early 2008 before she met Lazzaro.
At no time did she mention that her daughter was missing or had been kidnapped, he testified, and he saw no change in her demeanor.
Morales was one of numerous people, including Lazzaro, his roommates and other acquaintances, who said Anthony did not mention Caylee's disappearance between June 16, 2008, the day the little girl was last seen, until the evening of July 15, when Anthony's mother, Cindy, reported her missing to authorities.
England also testified that Anthony received a call and told some other friends that she had car trouble and couldn't go out with them.
Lazzaro and his roommates said that when they asked where Caylee was, Anthony told them she was with her nanny, mentioning that the nanny was taking her to Universal Studios and to the beach.
Anthony told him "she was in Sanford on a playdate with one of her girlfriends who also had a child."
George Anthony testified Thursday that he owns several shovels.
In his earlier testimony, George Anthony denied ever sexually abusing his daughter or that he found Caylee dead in his pool.
