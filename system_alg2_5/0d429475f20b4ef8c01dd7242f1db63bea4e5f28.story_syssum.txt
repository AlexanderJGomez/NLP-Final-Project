My first game was in 1961 when Burnley were reigning league champions.
10?
Bertie Ahern [Taoiseach of Ireland at the time] was a big Manchester United fan and he had tickets for a game the next day.
We had to win a game against Leyton Orient in 1987 to stay in the Football League.
Our wage bill is the smallest in the league by a mile, we've got a small stadium, we've got the smallest squad and we're the smallest town that has ever produced a Premier League football club, so with all that it's quite an uphill battle to stay up but I think we will, and by playing good football.
Beating Leeds 4-1 away when Don Revie was in charge of them, is right up there.
I've got loads of bad memories too, but I think it's the bad memories are what make the good memories even more special.
