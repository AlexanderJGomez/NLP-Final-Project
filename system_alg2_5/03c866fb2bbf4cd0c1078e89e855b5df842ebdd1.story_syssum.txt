"He was just everything," said T.J. Jackson, who shares guardianship of Michael Jackson's children -- Prince, Paris and Blanket -- with their grandmother.
"Do you believe your uncle was murdered?"
T.J. Jackson had earlier testified that his mother, Delores Jackson, was the victim of murder 19 years ago.

"Wherever my uncle was, Blanket was a foot away, My uncle was everything to Blanket."
Prince said he has "a hard time sleeping" since his father's death in 2009.
"He's very strong, he's very smart," he testified.
"It's awful."
