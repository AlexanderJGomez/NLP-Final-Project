BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) -- Thailand's Constitutional Court Tuesday fired the country's prime minister, Samak Sundaravej, for violating the constitution by hosting a TV cooking show while in office.
The 73-year-old Samak continued to appear sporadically on the show "Tasting while Grumbling" after he became prime minister in February.
I said, 'No, I checked the constitution already.
"It depends on the constitutional court to decide whether receiving money to appear in the programs on the television could be considered an employee of any employer or not," he said.
The protesters are demanding that Samak step down.
Thaksin, who was ousted in a coup in 2006, returned to England last month just as he was to appear in court in a corruption case.
