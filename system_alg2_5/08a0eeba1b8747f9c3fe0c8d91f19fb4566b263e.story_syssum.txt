"I've decided to come to Hong Kong because opportunities in my country aren't very promising," former Spanish La Liga player Lander Panera told CNN.
Ken Ng, head of Hong Kong Kitchee, one of the top local teams, has been working with former Spanish athletes for years to develop local players.
"It's all about youth development, youth training, and hopefully in six, or eight, or 10 years time we'll have a much better group of youngsters coming through our program, and that will help Hong Kong be one of the strongest teams in Asia," Ng told CNN.
"We will give them a view of the world," Ng told CNN, "every year we will take them to Spain."
"If things don't improve in my country, in Europe, I wouldn't have a problem [staying in Hong Kong]," Panera told CNN.
