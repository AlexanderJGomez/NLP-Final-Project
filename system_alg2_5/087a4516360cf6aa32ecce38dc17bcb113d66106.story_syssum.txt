(CNN) -- The growth of e-commerce in China has outpaced that of western countries during the past five years.
In the five years since its launch in July 2008, Yihaodian has increased its selection from 3,000 stock-keeping units to over 2 million, fulfillment centers from one in Shanghai to 17 in seven cities, revenue from 4 million yuan to over 6 billion yuan, and employees from 40 people to over 9,000.

Cash on delivery (COD) is still a popular means of payment due to lack of trust in both online payment systems and the e-commerce providers themselves.
Many large e-commerce companies have chosen to build their own last mile delivery capabilities to ensure a better customer experience and to facilitate faster growth.
This has further helped us reduce our last mile delivery costs.
Chinese shoppers' behavior is quite different from western countries.

Reasons include: a) Insufficient understanding of Chinese consumers' shopping behavior, simply copying global business models to fit China's market; b) Management is not localized, not adapting for local competition; c) Higher operational cost than local companies due to compliance and operational overhead; d) Improper organizational structure, resulting in low decision efficiency.

Consumers using mobile apps exhibit different buying behavior from those using personal computers.
E-commerce in China is also rapidly penetrating third and fourth tier cities, predominantly due to growing Internet penetration, a local shortage of shopping malls and supermarkets, and an overall lack of available products.
Yihaodian started social commerce five years ago by embedding our website into a well-know social networking site Tianya.
Online sales reached 30% of total national retail, a number that will no doubt become the norm in the near future.
