This time last year it took the American three days to win his record-breaking clash with Nicolas Mahut on court No.
"I was thinking if I lost that set we probably wouldn't be able to finish, and then it would have been the match going into a second day and people would have been talking about maybe a third.
After the first set went to a tie-break, it looked as if another titanic serving battle was on the cards.
Mahut had the chance to reduce the deficit after breaking in the third game of the third set, but Isner repaid the favor and had the edge in the tie-break to win it in 50 minutes.
Isner will hope he has more in reserve for his second-round match than last year at Wimbledon, where he predictably wilted in straights sets against Dutchman Thiemo de Bakker after his marathon effort.
