The discovery of a slain Palestinian teen in Jerusalem early Wednesday further inflamed tensions in a region already unsettled over the killings of three Israeli teens, not to mention decades of entrenched enmity between all sides.
Israeli authorities are probing Wednesday's death, with police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld tweeting this effort will try to determine if it is a "criminal or nationalistic" act -- the latter term referring to a politically motivated act in retaliation for the Israeli  teens' killings.
Israel is a country of law and everyone is ordered to act according to the law."
But it didn't happen in isolation.
The Israeli military destroyed the homes of the two suspects in the killings of the three Israeli teens.
"There's no difference between a Jewish resident of Jerusalem or an Arab resident of Jerusalem," the spokesman said.
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who heads the Fatah party and is based in the West Bank, called Mohammad Abu Khedair's father and promised that those behind his abduction and death will be brought to justice, WAFA, the Palestinian state news agency, reported.
Some protesters attacked two Palestinians whom they mistook for undercover Israeli police, The Jerusalem Post reported.
But his father said Thursday he was still waiting to hear from Israeli authorities when the body would be handed over to the family.
Three hit a Hamas intelligence building in Gaza city, while at least one struck the Qassam training camp in Beit Hanoun.
Israel Defense Forces said the airstrikes -- going after 15 Hamas targets -- were in response to the firing of more than 20 rockets into Israel since Wednesday.
