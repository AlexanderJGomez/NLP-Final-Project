LONDON, England (CNN) -- Michael Martin, the speaker of Britain's House of Commons, said Tuesday he would resign in the face of widespread public anger over expense claims by lawmakers.
He proposed a review of expense claims of the past few years by an independent panel, and the introduction of an outside agency to regulate expense reimbursements, which Parliament currently does itself.
There has got to be a proper audit."

The police had not yet decided whether to investigate whether politicians broke the law in their expense claims, the statement added.
