(CNN) -- Authorities have obtained an arrest warrant for Jesse Matthew, charging him with abduction with the intent to defile, in the case of missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo told reporters Tuesday.
Matthew willingly went to a police station over the weekend, along with several family members, walking through the front door and asking for a lawyer, Longo said.
About 12:45 a.m. on September 13, a surveillance camera caught her outside a pub, about three-quarters of a mile from the apartment complex.
Ten minutes later, she is seen running past a gas station -- no one appears to be pursuing her -- and witnesses say they saw her five minutes later roughly four blocks from the gas station, WVIR reported.
She and a man were seen having drinks at a bar between 1:30 and 2 a.m., WVIR said.
"Hannah is beyond precious to us," her parents said in a statement released shortly after her disappearance.
