This seems unremarkable today other than the fact that strong women were not exactly well-supported in those days in the music business.
So Whitney's decency was noticed and her joy for singing was infectious.
As with many famous people, the celebrity she achieved came with public attention beyond imagination -- and some of it wasn't always very kind.
At the same time, the adulation of her fans around the world was huge.
And of course, then there is addiction.
As experts know, no matter how much consciousness you develop about your drug habit and no matter how much you want to quit, the chemical attraction is incredibly powerful and beckons over and over again.
Like Billie Holiday, Judy Garland, Elvis and others before her, that inner voice of doubt that we all feel sometimes just could never keep up with the public adulation.
Whitney Houston's music legacy will be an inspiration to young artists for years to come.
