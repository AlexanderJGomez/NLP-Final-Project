Biden used his years of experience cutting deals in the Senate to work out a compromise with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell: He found the "dance partner" he was looking for in Biden and skillfully worked behind the scenes with the vice president to broker a deal that got overwhelming Republican support in the Senate.
He didn't get the big deal that he set out for and some progressives think that he gave too much away, but getting Republican votes to raise taxes on the wealthy is significant.
The employed: The two-year payroll tax holiday is over, so take-home pay will go down -- around $2,000 less a year for the average wage earner as the rate went from 4.2% to 6.2%.
Really, who would want this job?
The can: That poor sucker gets a couple more dents and a few more scuffs as it gets kicked down the road again.
