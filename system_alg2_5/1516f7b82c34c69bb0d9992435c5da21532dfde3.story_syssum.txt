Singer-songwriter Regina Spektor has just released her third album.
And in the music video for her peppy song "Dance Anthem of The '80s" she gets her face so close to the camera that at times you think she's going to gobble it up.
Watch an interview with Regina Spektor Â»
Regina Spektor: Yeah.
Spektor: I'm not really thinking that much of anything.
I think it's more of a feel state than a think state.
But I just love the fun of it.
Spektor: No.
I like things that are just all over the place.
I just sort of play it over and over again until it's cemented in my head.
Spektor: I feel that feeling all the time that I need to record before I forget it.
Spektor: Well (with) some of them I'm very involved.
Spektor: No I've never been that not involved.
And I just got to come in and be directed more, be part of his take on a song, and that was really fun, too.
I don't know.
