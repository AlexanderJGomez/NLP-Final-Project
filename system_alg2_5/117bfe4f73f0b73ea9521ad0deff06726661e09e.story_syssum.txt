Sarah Palin, Wasilla, Alaska's former mayor, is under fire for a sports complex she fought hard for.
But the city never obtained clear property to the title until this year, after a lengthy court battle with developer Gary Lundgren, who owned part of the land on which the complex sits.
"When they started building, the title to the land was in my name," said Lundgren, who now lives in Panama.
After Palin left office, the city sought to obtain the tract it needed for the sports complex through eminent domain, leading to another court battle.
"They said they needed more than 20 acres," he said.
Palin's successor as mayor, Diane Keller, said the project has brought in more than $3 million in revenue for local businesses.
It may have been a part of Sarah Palin's dream, but it wasn't only her dream," Keller said.
