The Pentagon was responding to a list of weapons systems whose secrets had been compromised by Chinese cyberespionage, which the Washington Post says was in a confidential report by the Defense Science Board.
But James Lewis, a cyberexpert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that China could use such cyberespionage in several ways that could put American fighters at risk: to copy weapons technology, counter American weapons based on that knowledge or even disrupt their operation by interfering with the software that runs them.
"It costs billions and billions of dollars extra to try to make sure that we're staying ahead of our adversaries with technology.
One American official, while acknowledging cyberintrusions from China, said the claims of design details being compromised were overstated.
"There's a lot of engineering that gets done in an academic setting," he said.
But in the past, Chinese officials have said China does not conduct cyberespionage on U.S. agencies or companies.
