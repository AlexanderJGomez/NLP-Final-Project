(EW.com) -- This weekend, "Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters" hunted down the No.
3-D showings of "Hansel and Gretel" accounted for 55 percent of its weekend gross, while IMAX made up 11 percent of the total.
Last weekend's box office champ, Mama, dropped 55 percent into second place with $12.9 million.
"Zero Dark Thirty," meanwhile, fell by a steeper 38 percent to $9.8 million and $69.9 million total in its sixth weekend.
Parker opened short of Statham's last three leading efforts, Safe ($7.9 million debut), Killer Elite, ($9.3 million), and The Mechanic ($11.4 million), and it will likely finish below $20 million domestically.
