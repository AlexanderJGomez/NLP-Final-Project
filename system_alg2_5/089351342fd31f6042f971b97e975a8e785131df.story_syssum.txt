I don't know if Hillary Clinton is going to run again.
It is to support the president's agenda and it is to support Democratic candidates up and down the ticket in 2013 and 2014.
A: No.
Q: Let's talk money.
When it comes to money are there concerns that you won't have the cash to do what you need to do and how will you retire that debt?
We are going to have what we need to accomplish our goals this cycle, but we're still working to retire that debt and Democrats can help us out by going to Democrats.Org and giving what they can.
We want to win seats in the House and we want to win governorships.
There are going to be a lot of competitive races where we can pick up seats, we think.
And based on what I'm seeing I think we feel comfortable that we can pick up seats in the House.
I don't know if Hillary Clinton is going to run again.
That's why I'm over here.
We've got a lot of important races in 2014.
