The search will go on at least all day Wednesday, the Coast Guard said.
The Learjet 35 -- carrying a doctor, nurse and two pilots, all of them Mexican citizens -- crashed shortly after one of the pilots reported apparent engine failure shortly after takeoff Tuesday evening from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.
It then began to turn toward shore, Rayner said.
The two medical staff members worked for Air Evac International, said Albert Carson, the company's director of operations.
Carson said many of its patients are tourists.
