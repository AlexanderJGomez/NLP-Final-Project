(CNN) -- Los Angeles Clippers co-owner Shelly Sterling is "moving quickly" to sell the embattled NBA franchise, with a source familiar with the situation saying she and her representatives would like to make a deal this week.
A source close to the situation said roughly two weeks ago that Donald Sterling -- who repeatedly denied he's a racist in a CNN interview -- wouldn't pay the fine, would reject the ban and might sue the NBA.
His remarks were made in the heat of an argument, and while they were not justified, they were not meant to harm the NBA, the response says.
By filing the document, Donald Sterling is protecting his legal options but, at the same time, he realizes selling the team is the most likely outcome.
CNN's source on the potential sale said it was a busy Memorial Day weekend for Shelly Sterling.
Johnson called the whole situation sad in his own interview with CNN, in which he urged Sterling to sell the team.
The same source said Shelly Sterling will accept offers this week for the Clippers.
But late last week, the Sterlings agreed that Shelly would try to sell the NBA franchise voluntarily even as the league prepares a vote on terminating their franchise rights.
