(CNN) -- First it was McLaren, now it's the turn of Ferrari to unveil the car they hope will speed them to victory in the forthcoming Formula One season.
"We both want to win and time will tell what will happen and if we can bring the championship back to Ferrari," Raikkonen told the Ferrari F1 website.
Jonathan Neale, managing director of McLaren Racing said in a statement: "We've never had such significant new regulations before; reacting to them, and managing those changes, while still pushing the performance limits, has been an extremely tough job.
"I'm very keen to learn all about the new formula and our new car, and I want us to be in a position where we head to the opening flyaways feeling comfortable with our package, yet still ready to absorb and learn more as we go," Button said in a statement.
