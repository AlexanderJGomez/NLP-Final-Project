Savana Redding was 13 when administrators suspected that she was carrying banned drugs.
Whether the school district would be liable was not an issue before the high court.
During an investigation into pills found at the school, a student told the vice principal that Redding had given her prescription-strength 400-milligram ibuprofen pills.
A search of Redding's backpack found nothing.
But when no contraband was found, the officials went too far by continuing the search of her underwear.
That court said the school went too far in its effort to create a drug- and crime-free classroom.
In 1985, the high court allowed the search of a student's purse after she was suspected of hiding cigarettes.
"When parents send their kids to school, they can now breathe a sigh of relief they will not end up naked before school officials," Wolf said .
Redding, now 19, said she has never gotten over her experience.
