This 60-foot sailboat, the Plastiki, is being built from more than 12,000 recycled plastic bottles.
Everything will be recycled.
De Rothschild's vessel, scheduled to set sail from San Francisco in April, is called the Plastiki.
The Plastiki is expected to stop in Hawaii, Tuvalu and Fiji on its way to Sydney, a trip estimated to take more than 100 days.
"This actually is the same material that is made out of bottles," said de Rothschild of the PET fabric.
Only about 10 percent of the Plastiki will be made from new materials, de Rothschild said.
It's infinitely recyclable."
"But it strikes me as a long way to go.
This trip strikes me as kind of dangerous."
