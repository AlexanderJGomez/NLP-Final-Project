Jorge Barahona, 53, already faces a charge of aggravated child abuse for injuries to the dead girl's twin, Victor, who was also found in the truck, which was parked on the side of I-95 near West Palm Beach, Florida, officials said.

Barahona told police that he doused himself with gasoline and inadvertently got some on the boy, Police Capt.
Scott said the chemicals were so potent that staff caring for the boy at the hospital became ill as well, he said.
Olsen said police would decide how to charge Barahona further once the autopsy on his daughter determines her cause of death.
The story was corroborated by interviews with the other two children in the home, officials said in court.
Instead, she said, she had left the family's house after speaking with Carmen Barahona, planning to return on Monday.
