A U.S. sailor stands accused of ringing doorbells in the middle of the night and breaking into a 72-year-old woman's property while drunk, say police in Yokosuka, Japan.
Police say they later discovered Silva on the elderly woman's property.
"The U.S. Navy takes this incident seriously," said USS George Washington spokesman Derrick Ingle.
Tens of thousands of Okinawans took to the streets at the time demanding that the United States leave the island.
