(CNN) -- Since the July 3 military coup, Egypt has been witness to the rise of a new military dictatorship led by Field Marshal Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.
Indeed, el-Sisi's Gulf counterparts view him as a "savior" not only from Islamists but more importantly from the very existential threat to their thrones: democracy.
Surprisingly, or maybe not, the international community remains in limbo watching the manufacturing of a new dictatorship in Egypt while doing nothing to prevent the possibility of such a scenario.
The U.S. policymakers believe that Egypt's military is the only force capable of retaining stability and maintaining security.
El-Sisi, Egypt's most likely post-coup president, will not be able to bring stability or security to the country.
The past three years have shown the volatility of the Egyptian public mood which can shift dramatically overnight particularly if el-Sisi doesn't quickly and appropriately fix Egypt's ailing economic and societal problems.
Surely, el-Sisi's Gulf backers will likely continue their "lifeline" of support, at least for a while.
Therefore, it is important that the international community, particularly the U.S. and EU, do not lend credibility to the bogus elections that will bring him to power.
