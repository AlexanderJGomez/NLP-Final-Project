LONDON, England -- A Colombian sculptor has created a mystery at London's Tate Modern gallery by refusing to reveal how she seemingly managed to crack open a concrete floor.
The making of it is not important," she said.
Tate director Nicholas Serota insisted the work was no optical illusion.
He declined to elaborate further.
Salcedo said of the work: "It represents borders, the experience of immigrants, the experience of segregation, the experience of racial hatred.
And so this piece is a negative space."
