Washington (CNN) -- With just days to go until a self-imposed deadline, fixes to the problem-plagued Obamacare website are "definitely on track," Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said Tuesday.
At the same time, he defended the overall goal of Obamacare to make make affordable health coverage available to millions of previously uninsured or under-insured Americans.
Now some states have reported stronger numbers, and Sebelius said Tuesday that more people were signing up daily.
According to a CNN count based on available figures, just over 200,000 people have signed up for new private health insurance under Obamacare -- either through the national system or networks set up in 14 states and the District of Columbia.
