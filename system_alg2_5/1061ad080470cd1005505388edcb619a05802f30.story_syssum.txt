NEW YORK (CNN) -- Ben Folds didn't realize how great his music was until he heard a bunch of college students singing it.
And so an idea was born: Folds would travel to university campuses around the country and record an entire album of a cappella covers.
And sometimes they're not thinking about the song that much, which I think is kind of cool."
Ben Folds spoke to CNN about his youthful-sounding new release, why being married four times isn't much of a drama and why he faked an album leak.
...
I was really into the field recording idea.
I think that people have a natural tuning mechanism.
There's always something new.
Folds: Well, I think that we get very uptight when it comes time to record because there's a process, an imminent process that has to do with just selling the record, mostly.
So while I thought it was funny, I really liked the idea of going into the studio and making six songs in one day.
Folds: Well, it wasn't a lot of drama, really.
...
Folds: Yeah, that's heavy, dude.
Folds: Oh, that too.
