Husien Shehada, at left with his brother, Samer, was shot dead by Miami Beach police on June 14.
Although it is not yet clear whether Tavss fired one of the shots that killed McCoy, questions are being raised as to whether the officer was cleared for patrol duty too soon after the first shooting.
The families of Shehada and McCoy are asking the Justice Department to investigate.
Miami Beach Police Chief Carlos Noriega has defended both shootings.
Each of the nation's 20,000 police departments sets its own policy for police involved in shootings and fatalities.
A study by the Justice Department's National Institute of Justice found that officers involved in fatal shootings can be affected for months afterward.
In some cases, the study found, officers could not recall firing their weapons.
Husien Shehada and his brother, Samer, had come from Virginia to spend a long weekend with their girlfriends in Miami Beach.
In a color security camera tape released by the Miami Beach Police Department, it appears that one of the brothers was carrying something under his shirt, holding it with his left hand.
Samer Shehada said he and his brother were cooperating.

Samer Shehada said that neither he nor his brother was carrying a coat hanger, much less a gun.
McCoy was shot dead by police.
Police found a gun several days later in Biscayne Bay, but they say they don't know if it belonged to McCoy.
Contini said Tavss should be in jail.
