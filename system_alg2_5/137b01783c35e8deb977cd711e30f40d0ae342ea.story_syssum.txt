British rider Cavendish, who won six stages last year, had a better day after struggling in the wet and on the cobble stones of previous runs but will be disappointed after being forced out of contention at the final sprint.
Hushovd retained the sprinters' green points jersey that he won overall last year and in 2005, but had his margin trimmed to 10 points by Petacchi and acknowledged the threat posed by the 36-year-old -- back at the Tour for the first time since 2004.
"I think I spent too much energy to fight with Cavendish and, when Petacchi went on the left, I just couldn't sprint.
I know he's a good, strong rider but to come back to the Tour de France like he has is impressive."
We needed something like this after tough, hard, nervous, and stressful opening stages," he said.
