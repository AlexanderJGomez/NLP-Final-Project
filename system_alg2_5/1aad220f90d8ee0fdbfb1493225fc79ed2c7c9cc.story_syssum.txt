In the city's busy Covent Garden shopping piazza, a building floated above the ground.
When I meet with Chinneck at his psychiatric ward-turned-apartment in Hackney (seriously), Take My Lighting, But Don't Steal my Thunder -- the polystyrene building floating above Covent Garden -- has just been taken down after its three-week run.
The floating building is part of what Chinneck calls the "architectural chapter" of his career, which has born four large-scale installations that use the materials, language and shapes associated with the craft.
The floating building looks like a part of the 184-year-old market has just been plucked and suspended in mid air.
This last phrase seems to sum up his installations well.
Along with comments on-site, Chinneck says he regularly receives emails, tweets and links to articles from people who have enjoyed his installations.
"With art, and I think really a lot of public art, you create it and then you have to abandon it a little bit, distance yourself from it, because it's not really yours anymore," he says.
With the melting house now a pile of hardened goo being scraped off a pebbled lot (the installation finished Sunday), and the floating building broken down and hauled away, Chinneck is focusing on the future.
