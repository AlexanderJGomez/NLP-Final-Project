Mohammed Asif Mohseni is said to be behind the law.
He is said to be the man behind the controversial Shia state law, a law critics say strips Afghan Shia women of many rights.
They were apologetic; one even asked me to zip up my sweater higher because too much of my neck was exposed.
He looked at the two men who brought us in and said, "These aren't the two I was waiting for."
But it didn't take long for Mohseni to warm up and explain why Shia state law is just and a part of Islam.
We give women more in this law."
He continued: "It is natural that women (wear makeup).
Women should put make-up on for their husbands as it will increase the love and attraction between the two."
It's the same here.
However, it's not just people in the West who are opposed to this law.
Clear-cut.
"If she doesn't (put on make-up), will the husband go complain to the police that she didn't put (on) the lipstick?
And none of the state institutions, ministry of justice, parliament, senate and the office of the president, really didn't look at the law as serious as they should," she said.
