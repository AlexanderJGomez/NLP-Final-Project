Video from the patrol car of North Charleston's Michael Slager shows an initial traffic stop and early interactions between the officer and Scott.
The passenger's identity was not given in a police report obtained by CNN, but another officer responding to the incident said in the report that the passenger was detained and placed in the back seat of a police vehicle.
Scott family attorney Chris Stewart told CNN the man with Scott was a co-worker and friend.
Many questions remain about what happened on Saturday when Officer Slager pulled Scott over for what police have said was a broken taillight.

The video shows Slager shooting eight times at Scott as Scott runs away.
It's unknown whether Scott took the officer's Taser or whether the officer picked the object up and moved it closer to the body.
Scott's shooting stirred memories of the Michael Brown case in Ferguson, Missouri, where an unarmed black teenager was killed by a white police officer.
"He has his family, and Mr. Scott also has his family," he told Holt.
"I have watched the video, and I was sickened by what I saw," North Charleston police Chief Eddie Driggers told reporters Wednesday.
Summey said that the city has ordered an additional 150 body cameras "so every officer on the street" in the city will have one.
"We can't get into the brain of another individual, so we can't state that," Scott family attorney Stewart said.
"There was not a struggle for the Taser," Anthony Scott said.
To  Anthony Scott, the videotape shows his brother was "running for his life" away from the officer.
"He cared about his family and ... no matter what happens, it will not replace my son."
