While at the car repair facility, look for certifications displayed on the wall.
I get the same question from my readers over and over: "How do I find a good auto repair shop?!
Before I start, I want to emphasize that the question "How do I find a good auto repair shop?"

Don't be short-sighted!
Some people think that the cost of repair varies with the size of the shop (a large shop or dealership is probably more expensive).
These days, with the high cost of equipment, training, and information systems, the cost of repair at dealerships, large repair facilities and small shops is balancing out.
Pick your repair facility like you would your family doctor.
