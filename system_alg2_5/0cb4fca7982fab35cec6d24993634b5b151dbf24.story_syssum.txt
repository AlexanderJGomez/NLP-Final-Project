(CNN) -- The FBI's Ten Most Wanted list now includes a man suspected of killing a young New York mother and her toddler son execution-style in 2010.
The FBI said a romantic entanglement and gang rivalries lay at the heart of slayings.
There, they were met by two co-conspirators -- members of Mara Salvatrucha -- and Argueta was murdered in front of her son.
