In a two-year mission likely to start in May, New Zealand personnel will  train Iraq security forces at the Taji Military Complex north of Baghdad, Key said.
In a statement, Key referred to New Zealanders as "prolific travelers" who were not immune from the risk posed by ISIS.
"ISIL's brutality has only worsened and its outrageous actions have united an international coalition of around 62 countries to fight and degrade the group," he said.
Key said the government had carefully considered New Zealand's contribution to the coalition.
The deployment came at the request of the Iraqi government and was likely to be a joint training mission with neighboring Australia, Key said.
"The secondary risk is that New Zealand involvement in the international effort will radicalize people in New Zealand and or Australia.
Jackson warned that the conflict would likely escalate and said that New Zealand had no clear exit strategy.
It suits their agenda."
"It's quite possible that the government felt that it could get wider public support if this was just a training mission, but it hasn't been able to convince the opposition," Ayson said.
"For the opposition this is like 'let's not repeat 2003 [the Iraq invasion].'
"As one of our partners in the coalition, New Zealand has already provided substantial humanitarian assistance to Iraq and Syria.
