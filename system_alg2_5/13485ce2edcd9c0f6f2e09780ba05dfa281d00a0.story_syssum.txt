You eat too much sugar.
We're talking about added sugar here, the sugar in processed and manufactured foods -- sugary drinks, sodas and juices, cakes and cookies, candy, processed cereals, salad dressings and breads.
About one in 10 adults took in 25% or more of calories from added sugar.
That's before your afternoon snack or big dinner.
As a doctor, I see the consequences of excessive sugar intake every day.
In the study, those who consumed approximately 17% to 21% of calories from added sugar had a 38% higher risk of cardiovascular disease mortality  -- that means death because of heart or blood vessel failure -- than those who consumed approximately 8% of calories from added sugar.
Real life is another.
Limit your intake of soda and other sugary drinks such as fruit juices.
Look for yourself to see how much sugar is in the foods that you are eating.
