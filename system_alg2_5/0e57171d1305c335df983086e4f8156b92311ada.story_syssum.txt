(CNN) -- The Guatemalan army stole at least 333 children and sold them for adoption in other countries during the Central American nation's 36-year civil war, a government report has concluded.
Of 672 records investigators looked at, Alvarez said, they determined that 333 children had been stolen.
About 5,000 of those were children, the ministry said.
Alvarez said he has attended several reunions of abducted children -- now adults -- and family members.
Guatemala has the world's highest per capita rate of adoption and is one of the leading providers of adoptive children for the United States.
Alvarez said corrupt lawyers and notaries were the driving force behind many of the army abductions of children.
"We have to tell the truth about what happened," he said.
