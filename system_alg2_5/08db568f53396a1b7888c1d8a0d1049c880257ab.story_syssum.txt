It's among 17 "concept cars" on exhibit at Atlanta, Georgia's High Museum of Art.
When you first walk into the exhibit, it's clear these cars aren't designed for mere mortals.
Concept cars are marketing tools designed to trigger buzz and spur sales.

The Atlanta museum is by no means the first to celebrate automobile design.
More recently, Gross says, the idea has become a national trend, taking hold in places like Nashville, Tennessee, and Raleigh, North Carolina.
