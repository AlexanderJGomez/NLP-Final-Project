Just over half the public says that it's bad for the country that the GOP controls the House of Representatives, according to a new national poll conducted after the end of the partial government shutdown.
There's plenty of time for Republicans to work on the brand, but they've taken a bit of a beating here.
We just didn't win," Boehner said at the end of the shutdown.
Only 12% of those questioned say they approve of the job Congress is doing, just two points higher than the historic low in CNN polling.
According to the survey, 44% also say they have more confidence in Obama rather than the GOP in Congress to deal with the major issues facing the country today, a 5-point drop from last year; 31% say they have more confidence in congressional Republicans, unchanged from last December.
But of those opposed, 38% say they are against the law because they think it's too liberal and 12% say it's not liberal enough.
The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
