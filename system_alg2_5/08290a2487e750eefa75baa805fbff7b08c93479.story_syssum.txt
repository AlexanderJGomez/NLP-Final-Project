(CNN) -- A copyright dispute over royalties from an acclaimed film, "Raging Bull," can go the distance after the Supreme Court on Monday allowed a lawsuit to move ahead.
With new electronic outlets emerging for a range of entertainment and literary properties, those companies may have to rethink their strategy when negotiating not only rights to the original creative property, but such retooled content as merchandising, spinoffs, and video games.
Federal copyright law gave Paula Petrella the sole right to renew the copyrights before the term expired, which she did in 1991.
Paula Petrella claims she is the sole owner of the book and the original screenplay, and that the subsequent film infringes on those copyrights.
The companies say having an open-ended period to file copyright claims makes it hard to make future business decisions.
Copyright experts say the high court's ruling will make it easier to press decades-old copyright claims.
"Raging Bull" won two Oscars, including best actor for De Niro, who portrayed the boxer.
The case is Petrella v. MGM, Inc. (12-1315).
