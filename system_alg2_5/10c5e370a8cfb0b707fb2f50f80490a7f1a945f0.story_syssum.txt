"People thought it was not possible to break the monopoly of the existing company that was there, because it has been there for 80 years," says Karanja, who launched her company's first beer product, called Summit, in 2008.
"People thought it was normal for us to have only one company in this country," she adds.
But instead of bowing out of the industry, Karanja came up with a new product.
"The support of the Kenyans has kept me going all this time because I think that without their support it would have been very hard for anybody to continue doing the business," adds Karanja.
Karanja, a mother of four, says that startups are common in Kenya, but few survive the harsh business environment.
"I thought it would motivate the people, the Kenyans, and show them that even if you work very hard, struggle, meet all those challenges, at the end of it there'll be somebody who will recognize you."
