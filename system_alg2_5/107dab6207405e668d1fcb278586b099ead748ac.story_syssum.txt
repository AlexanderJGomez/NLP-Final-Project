Saleh has threatened to withdraw all members of his party from the national government and warned the prime minister he could face imprisonment.
Prime Minister Mohammed Saleh Basendowah recently attended a ceremony at Change Square in Sanaa and condemned the old regime's attacks against unarmed youth protesters.
Saleh threatened to withdraw all members of his party from the national government to protest the way Hadi's administration is dealing with the political crisis in the country, embroiled in discord and violence.
Saleh is still the president of the largest party in the country and must be treated with respect," said a senior GPC aide who asked to remain anonymous.
The GPC have to choose between joining the government under President Hadi or standing with a person who lost all legitimacy to power in Yemen," Qahtan said.
