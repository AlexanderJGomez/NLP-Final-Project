(CNN) -- First, let's be clear: No one can blame voters if they a) are turned off by this election, b) are worried more about other things in their lives and c) don't think that it matters much who controls the Senate, which is what is up for grabs this year.
Except for this: When the show is over, and if control of the Senate changes to the Republicans, it could matter.
In a midterm election, that can work: Obama is unpopular, tie all candidates to Obama.
He's got a legacy to think about, and he'll be thinking about it, you can be sure.
The issue that comes to mind, of course, is immigration reform—which has been hanging out there so long it just gets messier and messier.
But if the GOP actually wants to win a presidential election, author Nate Cohn writes, "the Republicans will need a substantial number of Hispanic votes."
There's one logic that rules midterm elections--in which GOP candidates have political reasons to rail against immigration reform.
Sure, it depends on the GOP candidate.
And it also depends on President Obama.
And one of the biggest is whether Republicans—after more than four years out of the White House—have learned how tough it is to run the country from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.
