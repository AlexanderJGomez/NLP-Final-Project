(CNN) -- Eleven people died as Hurricane Sandy pummeled Cuba on Thursday, state media reported.
We have never had a storm hit like this," said a woman named Dulce, a doctor in the city of Santiago.
It was just a matter of time before the lights went out again, and "then we will play gin by candlelight," the iReporter said from her home on New Providence Island.
It is a "small storm" with "mediocre wind," he said.
As of 8 p.m.
Think there could be some debris, but in Nassau things are not as bad as they may be in the outer islands," CNN iReporter Cynthia Russell, an administration manager, said.
The "Perfect Storm" was the result of a nor'easter and Hurricane Grace combining into a one storm.
"I went in the water, I did about three somersaults ... strong rip current," he told CNN affiliate WSVN.
On Friday, more high waves and rip currents are likely along the coastal beaches of Florida's east coast and into southern Georgia, as well as tropical storm force wind gusts up to 50 mph.
Sandy also claimed two lives before reaching Cuba.
"I'd say 70% of the streets in Santo Domingo are flooded," he said.
