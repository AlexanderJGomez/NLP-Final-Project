WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama on Friday resumed -- with expanded legal protections -- the Bush administration's controversial system of military trials for some Guantanamo Bay detainees.
He said he plans to enhance due process rights for detainees held at the U.S. facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in order to improve the widely criticized approach created by his predecessor.
"Today's announcement is a step -- but only a step -- toward a comprehensive detainee policy that will deal with the detainees held at Guantanamo and elsewhere in a fashion that both accords with our values and protects our national security," McCain said in a written statement.
" he said.
Obama suspended the military commissions by signing an executive order on his third day in office, the same day he signed an order to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo within a year and announced a 120-day review of the whole process.
The next year, it opened the Guantanamo facility, saying suspects were treated properly and received due process through the system.
"The military commissions are fundamentally flawed and can't be fixed," said Army Maj. Jon S. Jackson, a lawyer for Mustafa al-Hawsawi, one of five 9/11 defendants charged in the military commission process.
