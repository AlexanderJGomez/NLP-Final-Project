Her stage career began in 1951 in her native Sydney in a production of "Judith" by Eugene Goossens, according to a spokesman with her recording company, Decca Records.
Her record company credits her with rising to international stardom in 1959 when she appeared in Franco Zefirelli's Covent Garden production of Donizetti's "Lucia di Lammermoor."
During the late 1950s and 1960s, she and Bonynge, whom she married in 1954, were at the forefront of a Handel revival.
She is survived by her husband; her son Adam and daughter-in-law Helen; and two grandchildren, Natasha and Vanya.
