Teens at Camp Ayandeh learn how to blend their parents' history and culture with their contemporary lifestyles.
Like many attending Camp Ayandeh -- or "future" in Farsi -- Ramin has parents who were born in Tehran and immigrated to the United States after the Iranian revolution in 1979.
"We're really becoming mindful of how we define things," said Natasha Sallahi, a first-time counselor and aspiring filmmaker.
'He is what I can do.
"
"One day I would come into school very dressed up thinking, 'I'm looking Iranian.'
Nearly three decades later, a new generation of Iranian-American youths are struggling to define themselves in these "hyphenated" communities.
But with campers rediscovering pride in their cultural heritage, these teens are learning how to blend their parents' history and culture with their contemporary lifestyles.
Unlike many of the American-born campers, Behnam immigrated to the United States at 5 after being born in Tehran.
Twelve years after arriving in the U.S., Behnam is part of a loyal following that returns to Camp Ayandeh each year.
