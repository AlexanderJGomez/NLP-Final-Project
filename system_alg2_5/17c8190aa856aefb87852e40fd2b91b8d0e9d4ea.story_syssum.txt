Former Finland President Martii Ahtisaari twice worked to find a solution in Kosovo.
He also worked with others this year to find a peaceful solution to the problems in Iraq, the committee said.
The peace prize is one of five Nobel prizes awarded annually.
The others -- for physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, and literature -- were announced this week and will be awarded in Stockholm, Sweden later this year.
