(CNN) -- Back in the pool for the first time since 2012, Michael Phelps was close to his peerless best.
Phelps retired after winning an unprecedented 22nd Olympic medal on 4 August 2012 and embarked on a year of travel and golfing with little mention of a return to swimming.
Taking to the pool in competition for the first time in 628 days, he had cruised through his qualifying heat with the fastest time of 52.84 seconds, just ahead of Lochte who went on to win the final in the second fastest time in the world this year.
I do know what I need to do if I want to continue and swim faster."
But Phelps says he is taking "one step at a time."
