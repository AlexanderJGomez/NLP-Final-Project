(CNN) -- Work to restore Egyptian artifacts damaged during anti-government protests began on Sunday, according to the nation's newly appointed minister of antiquities.
The museum will remain closed until Egyptian authorities lift overnight curfews, he said.
She and other Egyptologists said they were staying online as much as possible and keeping in touch with other Egyptologists to try to share information.
Hawass previously was secretary-general of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities.
On January 28, as the protests were under way, a group of people broke into the museum in Cairo, Hawass has said.
But, Hawass wrote in a blog post on Saturday, "The two mummies that were reported as damaged at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo were in fact unidentified skulls dating to the Late Period; these two skulls are not royal mummies."
"Today in Tahrir Square there are about 3,000 young people, and I hope they will go home today, so that life in Egypt can go back to normal," he wrote.
