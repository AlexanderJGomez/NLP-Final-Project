Former flight engineer George Hopkins says he remembers vividly being hijacked to Cuba in 1968.
"The guy comes to the cockpit and he's got a knife.
"There was no doubt in my mind he would pull the trigger if I'd have done something very foolish," he said.
With the plane now heading to Cuba, the hijacker lowered his gun.
"He said don't worry about it, we've done this before," Hopkins said.
According to a December 1968 indictment, Soltren and three others -- Jose Rafael Rios Cruz, Miguel Castro and Alejandro Figueroa -- conspired to hijack the flight.
Hopkins wonders now whether he would even recognize Pena Soltren.
Your mind is able to flush things once in awhile, until something happens and then you recall it."
