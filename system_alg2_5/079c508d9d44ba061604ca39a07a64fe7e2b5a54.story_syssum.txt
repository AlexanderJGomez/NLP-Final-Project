(CNN) -- U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin is considered a rising GOP star and the Republican Party's leader on fiscal and budgetary issues.
It's not the time to think about it," he told The Wall Street Journal in April.
In the House, Ryan is also a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee.
"It would be a bold choice," CNN senior analyst David Gergen said earlier of a Romney-Ryan ticket.
"I think he does get Wisconsin," Green said.
This is the "bold" debate conservatives pushing Ryan want, but other Republicans worry it could steer the campaign focus away from the president and onto GOP proposals.
In light of the Sarah Palin 2008 pick, some will question whether the House member is ready to be commander-in-chief.
