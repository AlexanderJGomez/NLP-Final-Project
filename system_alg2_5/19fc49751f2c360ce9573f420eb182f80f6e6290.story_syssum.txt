Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara, said after the hearing that his client was responding to an interview in which Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, said she wanted to hear from the man who shot her son.
Martin's parents were "completely devastated" over the decision to allow Zimmerman to post bond and eventually go free, attorney Benjamin Crump said.
Prosecutors had asked that Zimmerman remain in jail without bond or that Judge Kenneth R. Lester Jr. set bond at $1 million -- an amount O'Mara said the family would be unable to handle.
De la Rionda said no decision has been made on whether to allow Zimmerman to leave the state.
"He said, 'Mom, if I don't go, they don't have nobody,' " she said.
According to authorities, Zimmerman has said he killed Martin in self-defense after the teenager accosted him, knocking him to the ground and bashing his head against the concrete.
In the call, Zimmerman said he was following Martin after the teen started to run, prompting the dispatcher to tell him, "We don't need you to do that."
A police report indicated he was bleeding from the nose and the back of his head.
But he said evidence in the case is not consistent with Zimmerman's account that he was able to move away from the sidewalk just before being shot.
But he said there's more to come when the case comes to trial.
Crump said Martin's father, Tracy Martin, wept through much of Friday hearing, and the family was distraught at the prospect of Zimmerman being able to reunite with his family.
