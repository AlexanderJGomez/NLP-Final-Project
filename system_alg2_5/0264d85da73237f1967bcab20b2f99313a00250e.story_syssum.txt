North Korea and Somalia rank equal-worst of 174 countries with a score of just eight.
The Corruption Perceptions Index highlights the problems that emerging economies have with public sector corruption, misappropriation of funds and bribery, said Jose Ugaz, the chair of Transparency International, in a press release.
Despite his warnings, and attempts to address the issue, the report finds that perceptions of public sector corruption in China are worsening.
"China's fight against corruption focuses on prosecution, a very top-down way of fighting corruption," he told CNN.
"The 2014 Corruption Perceptions Index shows that economic growth is undermined and efforts to stop corruption fade when leaders and high level officials abuse power to appropriate public funds for personal gain," Ugaz said in a statement.
