Luciano, deployed to the Egyptian border town of Sallum to help shuttle people out, said his agency was working with the embassies of nations involved as well as the companies that hired the migrant workers to return them home safely.

"As we know, Egypt is also under a lot of stress now politically," said Hovig Etyemezian, a field officer with the U.N. refugee agency.
"The biggest priority is to take people out of the country," Etyemezian said.
Police and soldiers watched, as young Tunisian volunteers used sticks to beat back people trying to jump over a wall next to the border gate into Tunisia.
Tunisian authorities told the agency that about 75,000 people have streamed into Tunisia.
CNN's Ivan Watson reported from the Libya-Tunisia border and Moni Basu reported from Atlanta.
