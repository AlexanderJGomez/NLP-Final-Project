Four people died when they contracted listeriosis after consuming celery that had been processed at the SanGar plant, said Carrie Williams, a department spokeswoman.
Six of those cases -- in Bexar, Travis and Hidalgo counties -- were linked to chopped celery processed at the SanGar plant, the state health services department said.
"The FDA and the state have not turned over to us the documentation supporting their findings," Galvan said.
"We're not going the litigation route."
State health inspectors said they believe the bacteria found in the chopped celery may have contaminated other products at the company's plant.
It can get into vegetables from soil or manure that is used as fertilizer.
The Texas health department is taking the lead in the investigation, with assistance from the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC.
