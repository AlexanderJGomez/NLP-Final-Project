New York (CNN) -- Northeast Florida State Attorney Angela Corey has made it clear that she alone will decide whether George Zimmerman will be charged in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.
In short, they said that their client had gone rogue.
Not surprisingly, within hours of the now-infamous withdrawal, Corey issued a statement saying she would be holding her own news conference within 72 hours "to release new information regarding the Trayvon Martin shooting death investigation."
Many suspect that the announcement that Zimmerman had gone rogue forced the special prosecutor's hand.
In discussing the investigation into the shooting death of Martin she said, "What we are asking people to do is take a step back.
And I look forward to meeting with them to try to help them on this journey.
Manslaughter would not be difficult to prove but for Florida's "stand your ground" law.
Florida's law states that a person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force ... to prevent death or great bodily harm.
Former Florida State Rep. Dennis Baxley, the co-sponsor of the law, told me by phone that the law doesn't apply to Zimmerman if he pursued Martin and was the initial aggressor.
Martin was 17 years old, Zimmerman, 28.
Zimmerman tells the dispatcher he is following Martin.
Martin asks Zimmerman why he is following him.
The screams for help stop.
A tenet of our legal system is that when there is conflicting evidence, let a jury decide.
