(CNN) -- A Tijuana, Mexico, police officer will appear in a U.S. federal court next week after being arrested on a charge of possession with intent to distribute almost 20 pounds of heroin and methamphetamine.
The Border Patrol agents pulled alongside the car and noticed a single key in the ignition, which can be a sign that a car contains contraband, the affidavit said.
He told the agents he had a valid visa and was nervous about being pulled over, the affidavit said.
He also told agents that he had driven the car over the border himself and that the vehicle belonged to his friend, whom he knew only as "Eduardo," the affidavit said.
The square ones tested positive for heroin and the misshapen ones tested positive for methamphetamine, the agents said in an affidavit.
