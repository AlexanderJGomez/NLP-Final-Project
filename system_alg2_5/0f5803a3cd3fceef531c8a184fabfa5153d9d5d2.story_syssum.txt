(Rolling Stone) -- Jack White left his Radio City Music Hall audience confused and angry on Saturday night when he abruptly left the stage and ended the show after only playing for about 55 minutes.
(Later, he asked the crowd to quiet down, "because I can't hear myself think."
According to the New York Observer, the ushers at the concert seemed equally mystified by its early ending, and a member of the security team later offered an explanation to the reporter.
The paper also noted that White had several "angry exchanges" with a shirtless fan in the front row who was removed by security.
