(The Frisky) -- Dan had a big grin in his profile picture, like he'd just said something super funny.
!
Understated sexy 30-something outfit, yes!
It was.
he asked me, twice.
he asked, shoving pasta in his face.
The waiter came over.
"Surely a strong, modern woman like you would like to pay?"
Dan asked.
I sighed and mentally scribed the "thanks, but no thanks" message I'd write to him tomorrow.
But--
As is often the case in this fallen world, there is more that at least one of us--me--must say.
So.
Dear Dan, There are so many things I'd like to tell you.
Yeah, thanks for sending me that message.
Thanks.
P.S.
Dan doesn't deserve my heated words, or the three minutes of my life it'd take to write them.
