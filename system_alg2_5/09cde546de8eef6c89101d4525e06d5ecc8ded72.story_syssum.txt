(CNN) -- President Obama rallied U.S. troops and pledged continued partnership with Afghanistan during a previously unannounced trip to the country Sunday.
Earlier, Obama met with Afghan President Hamid Karzai at the Presidential Palace to discuss progress by the Afghan government in strengthening its ability to run the country and provide security for its people.
"All of that makes America safer, and we are going to keep them on the run," he said.
Following his speech to the troops, Obama met with U.S.
Obama then flew on a helicopter to the Presidential Palace to meet with Karzai.
U.S. officials said the two leaders planned to first meet along with key aides, and then bring in Karzai's cabinet.
The president previously postponed a trip to Indonesia and Australia planned for March 21-26 in order to see through passage of the health care bill.
U.S. officials said Sunday there were nearly 80,000 U.S. troops now on the ground in Afghanistan, and the surge announced by Obama would increase the total to 98,000 once fully implemented by the end of the year.
The trip is Obama's second to Afghanistan.
On that visit, part of a broader trip to the Middle East, Obama traveled to eastern Afghanistan to meet with U.S. forces and also met with Karzai.
