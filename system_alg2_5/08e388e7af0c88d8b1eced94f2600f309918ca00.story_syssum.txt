Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- The unflinching account from a defector revealed how he picked corn kernels out of cow manure to eat as he competed with his family for food at one of North Korea's notorious prison camps.
"The existence of prison camps in the North should be known to the people around the world," Shin said.
In March, the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva agreed to examine what it called "grave, widespread and systematic" violations of human rights in North Korea, including the use of prison camps.
"I'm grateful for people who are paying attention to the North Korean human rights situation," Shin said.
"And personally, I want to escape my past.
The single photo resonated with him as "an outcry from the prison camp" that pressed the world for help.
The evidence of the North Korean prisons are overwhelming as more than 60 people have given detailed, consistent accounts, Harden said.
Shin was a product of a reward marriage in the prison camp.
Shin's testimony has encouraged the world to "grapple with the suffering," rather than just lampoon North Korea as a punchline, Harden said.
