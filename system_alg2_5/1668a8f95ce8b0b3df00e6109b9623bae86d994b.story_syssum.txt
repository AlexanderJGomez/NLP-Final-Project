But adversity has made him wise beyond his years, and Malek knows better.
It was while he was in the hospital that an American visitor noticed Malek and paid for him to go the United States and get prosthetic limbs made.
"I don't have any coach or any trainer to teach me how to swim, how to prepare for the games, so I'm doing by myself, because I love swimming," says Malek.
Nikpai, who was swimming in the same pool as Malek when we visited, is keenly aware how difficult it is to excel in athletics in Afghanistan.
"They want to bring medals back home.
Nikpai is very happy to see Malek make progress.
Friends and family also find hope in him -- something they say is missing in a country torn apart by far too many years of war.
Malek knows that whatever happens, in a sense, he's already won.
