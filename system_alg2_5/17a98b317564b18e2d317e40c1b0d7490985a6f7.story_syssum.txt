International inspectors are trying to ensure that Syria eliminates its chemical weapons stockpile by the middle of next year.
One of the monitoring groups, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, said Thursday that Syria has destroyed all its declared chemical weapons mixing, filling and production facilities, and all of the chemical weapons at inspected sites have been placed under seal.
The chemical weapons equipment there was moved to other sites, which were inspected.
