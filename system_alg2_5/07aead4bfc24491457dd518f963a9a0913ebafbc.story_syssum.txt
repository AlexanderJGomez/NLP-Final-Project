(CNN) -- Young women at a party attended by about 50 Central Washington University students and other young people were the primary target of spiked drinks, authorities said Saturday.
Ferguson would not comment on the type of drug placed in the beverages.
She exhibited signs of having ingested a spiked drink, Ferguson said, and was taken to the hospital and later released.
None of the underage people who overdosed meant to get high or unconscious, said Ferguson, and none had more than one or two drinks, KOMO reported.
The owner of the home was not at the party, police said.
Police interviewed about 35 others who attended the party, which they said was organized by a Central Washington student.
