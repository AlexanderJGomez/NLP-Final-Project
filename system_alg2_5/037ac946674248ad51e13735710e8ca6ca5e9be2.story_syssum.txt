As is often the case with best-laid plans, however, I soon discovered an unexpected goal within my temporary career: the pursuit of excellence as a way of life.
"People treat temps like dirt," they scoffed.
No one seemed to notice the sign until several days into the job, when I set up a videotape for a troubleshooting meeting.
"They aren't being excellent to each other!"
"Be excellent to each other!"
They opened up more to others when I inquired about their weekend and actually listened to their responses.
As a longtime Zen student, I had been taught to appreciate small, mundane moments -- moments opportune for practicing excellence in the workplace.
During mundane moments, I came to understand that excellence wasn't about being perfect or about being nice so people would like me.
There were other people no amount of excellence could save, like the typist who would rather be treated as a victim than receive any kind of help.
I was given the opportunity to test this commitment when my best friend and my father died within the same year and I was called upon to devote full-time hospice care to them both.
Now, instead of a sign, I carry excellence within me as a mantra, as a presence.
