"We've said all along, we'll wait for the votes to be counted," Murkowski Campaign Manager Kevin Sweeney told CNN.
Currently, Alaska's Division of Elections is counting 100,868 votes for Murkowski versus 90,448 for Miller.
If the outcome stands in the face of legal challenges, despite a count of any outstanding ballots or a potential recount from Miller, it would be only the second time a person won a write-in campaign for the Senate.
He said he may request a recount, that he wants to ensure that some military ballots were mailed out, and that the difference between his votes and Murkowski's may shift if a "consistent standard" for evaluating the write-in ballots is applied.
Palin endorsed Miller over Murkowski for the state's GOP Senate primary, and the national Tea Party group followed suit.
Murkowski lost the primary in August -- and conceded the race.
