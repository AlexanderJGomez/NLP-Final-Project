The 75 soldiers were identified by name, Australian defense officials said Wednesday.
The battle of Fromelles remains the most fatal 24-hour period in Australian military history, Australian defense officials have said.
"All but one of the soldiers have been reburied in individual graves in the purpose-built Fromelles (Pheasant Wood) Military Cemetery," said Alan Griffin, Australia's minister for veterans affairs.
The Australian Department of Defence released photographs of some of the 75 men whose remains were identified.
About 800 people from Britain and Australia who think they may have a relative buried at Fromelles have donated DNA to try to identify the bodies, said Peter Jones, the DNA consultant on the project.
Personal items found with the bodies have also helped experts identify them.
A full list of the soldiers identified and also their photos is available on the Australian Department of Defence Web site.
