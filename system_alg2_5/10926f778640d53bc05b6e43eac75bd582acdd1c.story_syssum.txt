The weather here is spectacular.
San Francisco must surely be the most beautiful of cities.
But the president (and the country) must listen closely to the trends coming from here, because what starts in California often ends up spreading across the country.
There is a state budget deficit which would make even the eurozone blush.
In the past, when California fell on hard times, it could rely on a rising national economy to pick up the slack.
California is as much a victim of this as any European country.
What I am suggesting is that the European austerity, which so far has not hit most of America, has well and truly arrived.
