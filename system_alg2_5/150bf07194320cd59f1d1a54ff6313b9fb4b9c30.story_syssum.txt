London (CNN) -- Female drivers in Formula One are few and far between, but one woman aiming to change this is Susie Wolff.
It was never about him wanting to beat his little sister.
Big break: The Young Driver of The Year award is a very prestigious award in Great Britain and I was the first ever female to make the final six.
That got me noticed by Mercedes Benz.
Now, they are giving me the chance to be a development driver -- not just a one year deal, a proper chance to show what I can do.
Blazing a trail: I don't race to prove how good women can be against men.
Don't get me wrong, I see these little girls all dressed in pink with Susie t-shirts on, and that's fantastic.
Bikinis: It's a very fine line: I'm representing a car manufacturer and all the sponsors so of course you have to make an effort to look nice at the racetrack.
They never said to me, 'You're doing something unusual.'
Hardest lesson: In 2005, I couldn't get enough sponsorship to do Formula Three.
I was trying to get a drive in with Renault and got dropped by them at the last minute.
Sometimes there's not a lot of people around who believe in you, but you must always be willing to strive for your goals and never give up, even when things get really tough.
I'm much harder.
Away from the racetrack, I'm a normal wife.
