Island County, Washington (CNN) -- Colton Harris-Moore returned Thursday to a setting with which he is all-too-acquainted: a Washington State courtroom.
The records instead show Harris-Moore running from his demons and what a psychologist's report called "a home situation marked by instability, loss and alcohol abuse."
"He was let down," Harris-Moore's aunt Sandra Puttmann told CNN.
But in a handwritten letter in Harris-Moore's court file, Kohler wrote, "This boy has had many disappointments all his life.
According to court records, Kohler said Colton's father left when he was "four to five years old."
In a May 2003 incident, court records say that Colton Harris-Moore, then 12, called 911 after his father allegedly pushed him to the ground and gripped his hand around the boy's throat.
According to court records, Pamela Kohler blamed her son for the incident.

In 2007 as her son faced sentencing on burglary charges, Harris-Moore's mother wrote the court, saying "Colt has had mental problems since about age 2.
Kohler stated, according to court records.
Harris-Moore's then-attorney Rachel Miyoshi said she ordered the psychological review to show that he "wasn't dangerous, wasn't violent.
With Harris-Moore facing 23 charges, Miyoshi negotiated a deal where Harris-Moore plead guilty to three charges of burglary and was sentenced to three years in a juvenile detention home "I love that boy like one of my own kids," Harris-Moore's aunt Sandra Puttmann wrote, the judge in the case.
Puttmann said she pleaded with the young fugitive to turn himself in.
