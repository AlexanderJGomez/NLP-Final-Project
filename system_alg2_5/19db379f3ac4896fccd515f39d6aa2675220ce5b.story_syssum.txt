Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Amy Windom says a "MacGyver" moment helped alert authorities after a terrifying incident Tuesday.
"I dragged my laptop over and with my feet I pried it open," she said.
Campos said an investigation into the incident is under way.
"I don't have the world's prettiest feet, but I think I'll keep them," she said.
