(CNN)  -- Two people were found dead and a third person is still believed missing in a North Carolina food plant heavily damaged in a morning explosion, police said Tuesday night.
Four burn victims -- two males and two females -- were undergoing critical care at the North Carolina Jaycees Burn Center, said Dr. Charles Cairns, director of emergency medicine for UNC Hospitals.
More than 300 people were in the plant when the explosion happened, authorities said.
The search crews were moving slowly in part because the building is very unstable, officials said.
Gail Ruffin, a ConAgra worker who was in the plant when the explosion happened, told WRAL she heard a boom.
