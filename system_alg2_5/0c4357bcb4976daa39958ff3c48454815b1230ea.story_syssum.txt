Welcome to an Eastern European style salt cave which claims to rid asthma and allergy sufferers of their breathing problems through "salt therapy," also known as halotherapy.
Salt therapy claims to work by clearing the airways of mucus and reducing inflammation triggered by allergies to dust, pollen or pollution.
The study found that it was a safe and effective additional therapy for patients.
Have you used the salt cave?
I had heard so many stories of how salt caves had treated friends' problems, so I decided to open one in London," the 30-year-old told CNN.
Ideally, treatment lasts one to two weeks and patients need to be in the cave for one to two hours every day, Benke says.
Dr Elaine Vickers of Asthma UK, said: "It's currently impossible for us to say whether or not salt caves are beneficial for people with asthma.
The reason for this is because their symptoms were no longer present after undergoing salt therapy, she said.
