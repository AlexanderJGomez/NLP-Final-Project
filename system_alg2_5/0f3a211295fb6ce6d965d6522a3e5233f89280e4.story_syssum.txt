The aviation giant has partnered with billionaire businessman Larry Ellison's sailing team to create what it hopes will be an unbeatable high-tech yacht in the next edition of the race in 2017.
"If you look at it closer, sailing and flying share a common DNA," said Airbus President and CEO, Fabrice BrÃ©gie.
"The America's Cup is a boat race, but the design technology and engineering are very often the winning factor," said team skipper Jimmy Spithill, who knows what he's talking about -- he also has a pilot's license.
Back across the Atlantic, work has already begun collecting data on the Team USA boat, with over 300 on-board sensors providing real time information to a main server.
Much like its planes, Airbus will be analyzing the data closely.
And somewhere between sky and sea, the next America's Cup will take place.
