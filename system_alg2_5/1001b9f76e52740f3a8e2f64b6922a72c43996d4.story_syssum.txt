"I truly believe Brittany had a major purpose in this life," Cathy Reidy of New York wrote in the guest book on Maynard's obituary on Legacy.com.
Maggie Karner, a woman with the same brain cancer, posted an October 29 open letter to Maynard on YouTube.
In an article published October 10 on the Federalist website, Karner wrote that Maynard may have wanted to control when she died but "As for my cancer journey, circumstances out of my control are not the worst thing that can happen to me.
"My question is: Who has the right to tell me that I don't deserve this choice?
"It is people who pause to appreciate life and give thanks who are happiest," she wrote in her final message.
"Suicide has been an answer to some in my situation," Couvrette wrote.
Another Reddit poster questioned the use of the word "brave" to describe Maynard.
I kind of understand the sentiment, but at the end of the day, when you think about it, why can't both decisions be brave?
tweeted Jesse Joseph Realmo.
