Authorities confirmed three civilian injuries from a growing blaze known as the Station fire burning through the Angeles National Forest-La Canada Flintridge.
"The fire has been very active on all fronts," U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Randi Jorgensen said.
The fire threatened about 10,000 homes in Los Angeles County and 900 homes were evacuated, she said.
The blaze, called the Cottonwood fire, started Thursday afternoon about 10 miles from the southern California city of Hemet, officials reported.
Another fire in the Angeles National Forest had burned more than 2,100 acres.
That fire was about 85 percent contained Friday evening, officials said.
