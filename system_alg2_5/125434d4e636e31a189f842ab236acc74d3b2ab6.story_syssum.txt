(CNN) -- Bea Arthur, the actress best known for her roles as television's "Maude" and the sardonic Dorothy on "The Golden Girls," has died of cancer, a family spokesman said Saturday.
But many saw Maude as an enduring icon for women's liberation -- a big deal for the shy, Jewish girl born Bernice Frankel in New York City.
The young Bea Arthur earned a living singing and doing stage work on Broadway and off-Broadway.
Arthur left "Maude" in 1978, making television and some film appearances afterward.
The role earned Arthur a second Emmy -- the first was for "Maude."
Her last stage appearance was in 2006.
