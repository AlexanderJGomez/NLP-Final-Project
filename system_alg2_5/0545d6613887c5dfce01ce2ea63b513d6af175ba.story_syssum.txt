It's not like Aasif didn't know anything about being a Muslim before he was hired by "The Daily Show" in 2006.
Jon Stewart made Aasif more Muslim-ish.
It's not like Jon Stewart intentionally wanted us to become more Muslim.
There he encountered a woman opposed to the mosque who told him that, "one in five Muslims were terrorists."
These Daily Show experiences "radicalized" Aasif, turning him into, as he calls himself in the book, "the jihadist of irony."
First, the last comedy film Jon had been in was "Death to Smoochy."
Stewart called Aasif on the phone -- which was the first time Jon ever had called him -- and asked, "How would you feel about talking about the issue on the show as Muslim?
Aasif's father's words came immediately rushing back to him.
That is what Stewart did to us.
