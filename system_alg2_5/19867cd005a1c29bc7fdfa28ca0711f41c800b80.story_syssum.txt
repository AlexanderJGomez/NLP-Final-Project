Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic (CNN) -- Dominican lawmaker Danilo Medina declared victory in the nation's presidential elections in a series of Twitter posts Monday, but his closest competitor has yet to concede.
In an interview with CNN en EspaÃ±ol on Monday, Medina vowed to address drug trafficking, education and incomes in a country where more than one-third of the population lives in poverty.
Mejia represents the left-leaning Dominican Revolutionary Party.
Mejia, 71, the former president, has a background in agriculture.
He also served as president of the country's House of Representatives.
