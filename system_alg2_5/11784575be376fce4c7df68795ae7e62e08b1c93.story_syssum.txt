As kick-off draws the cacophony of noise grows ever louder
"I've been to many, many sporting events across the world," says Sean Foley, vice president of sport and media at the Raptor Group -- which is headed up by Roma's American owner James Pallotta.
In partnership with Google, Roma is attempting to transport the match-day experience across the globe, using the latest technology and the power of social media to attract new fans from every corner of the world.
So back on the sofa, those iPad fans will watch a YouTube livestream following the Roma team bus as it journeys to the stadium, with drones flying above the crowd to give an altogether different perspective to viewers watching the big game.
The Raptor Group's involvements in sport, technology and social media, as Foley explains, means Roma is uniquely positioned to exploit new technologies.
"When people tell you there are 3.5 billion football fans in the world, as a way to engage people on our platforms, it's certainly something for us to look at," says Max Goldstein, sports partnerships manager for Google.
"If you look across all social media platforms, there's a huge amount of interest in football," says Goldstein.
By bringing new tools to the table -- "bringing people closer to the game through technology," as Goldstein puts it -- Google is intent on becoming an integral part of the football landscape.
Tomkins has been involved with football and Liverpool as a fan, season ticket holder, journalist and author and has seen social media change how rival supporters interact with each other.
It's more about other people's misfortune."
Tomkins also doubts whether increasing a club's social media popularity necessarily translate into creating true football fans.
I don't know whether social media is part of gaining true fans or just gaining 'likes' on Facebook.
Google and Roma will be hoping that the football fans of tomorrow disagree.
