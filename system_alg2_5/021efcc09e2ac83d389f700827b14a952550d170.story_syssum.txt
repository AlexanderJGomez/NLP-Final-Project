Zachary Quinto, who plays Spock in the re-booted feature film incarnation of "Trek," is excellent in the role.
Spock is Nimoy.
In the years before and since, he carried his character's legacy with the grace and class he exhibited in other areas of his life.
Nimoy did.
I got to meet him when the latter film opened.
He was Nimoy and he was Spock.
