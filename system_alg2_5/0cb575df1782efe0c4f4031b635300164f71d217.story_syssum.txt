Sunday's season four premiere of the upstairs-downstairs drama on PBS surpassed the comparable ratings for every previous episode.
But even last season's "Downton" premiere was described as one of the highest-rated events in the history of the public broadcasting network; analysts said PBS hadn't seen numbers this high since the premiere of the "Civil War" documentary series in 1990.
But the season four premiere affirms that "Downton" is making history for the network.
Last year 8.2 million viewers tuned in on the night of the season three finale, and more than 4 million tuned in later, for a total of 12.3 million.
