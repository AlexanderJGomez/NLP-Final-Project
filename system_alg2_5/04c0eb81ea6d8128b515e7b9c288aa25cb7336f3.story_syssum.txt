On Thursday, to deal with some of the grousing about canceled insurance plans, President Obama announced an administrative fix to allow people to keep those crummy plans (that they think they like) for up to a year.
On Wednesday, the Obama administration announced that just more than 106,000 Americans had enrolled in health insurance plans through Obamacare exchanges, and another 975,000 people had shopped for plans but not enrolled in a selection yet.
Looking for an analog to what Obamacare enrollment might look like nationwide?
Also, choosing among the many options in the Obamacare exchanges does take time â€” which might explain, for instance, why almost 1 million people have logged into the exchange but not yet chosen an insurance option.
Finally, yes, Obama will implement an administrative fix so people can keep their lousy insurance plans for another year if they want to.
But insurance companies will now be required to tell people they have other (and in many cases, probably better) options in the new exchanges.
And the administrative fix announced on Thursday will, incidentally, ease the transition period to new plans while probably keeping enrollment numbers even lower since people can now keep their current plans an extra year.
When Obamacare is finally, fully implemented, our families, our health care system and our economy will all be better off.
