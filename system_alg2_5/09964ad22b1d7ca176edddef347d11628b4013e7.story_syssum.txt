With relaxing visions of mobile convenience in mind, I thought traveling from London to Rome using only apps would be stress-free and easy, but it didn't quite work out that way.
Again with pre-registered credit card details it only took a couple of minutes to book my ticket.
Feeling quite pleased with the journey so far, my bubble was truly burst when I attempted to check-in with the BA app.
Then, just as my passport was going to be swiped at a check-in desk, the screen on my phone started refreshing and then suddenly -- my boarding pass appeared.
Coming out of arrivals at Rome FCO, I didn't even have to look at my phone as I recognized Fabio, my Uber driver from the photo provided.
It was!
I wish there had also been more time to try out some of the city guide apps as well as the Rome MVR app -- which allows you to see monuments like the Coliseum in their former glory.
To avoid disappoint and expensive data roaming charges -- in the end I had spent $160 -- I would use apps that are quick and easy.
