Several veteran shows were among the nominees for best drama series, including "Mad Men" -- which has won this category four years running -- "Boardwalk Empire," "Breaking Bad" and "Game of Thrones."
PBS' breakout hit "Downton Abbey," which was nominated in the miniseries category last year, joined the crew for best drama, as did Showtime's "Homeland."
The show's defenders, on the other hand, applaud Dunham for showing her characters in less-than-flattering lights and observe that "Girls" isn't the first series to take place in a perceived vacuum.
NBC's "Parks and Recreation" missed out on best comedy series as well, though star Amy Poehler got a nomination.
Don Cheadle, whose Showtime series "House of Lies" received an uneven reception upon its January premiere, earned a nomination for best actor in a comedy series.
(Her comedy series, "Hot in Cleveland," also got recognition, with two nominations.)
The nominations were announced by Kerry Washington, star of ABC's "Scandal," and late-night host Jimmy Kimmel.
The 64th Primetime Emmy Awards will take place September 23.
