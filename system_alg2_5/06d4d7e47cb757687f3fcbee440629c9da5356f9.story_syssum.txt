(CNN) -- A one-time American-based Islamic group cannot sue the government over claims it was targeted by the government's once-secret Terrorist Surveillance Program, a federal court has ruled.
Federal officials later publicly acknowledged the existence of the program, which was then officially authorized by Congress in 2008.
The appeals court said Congress had never waived immunity for government officials over alleged state eavesdropping, even if constitutional rights were violated as a result of improper government conduct.
