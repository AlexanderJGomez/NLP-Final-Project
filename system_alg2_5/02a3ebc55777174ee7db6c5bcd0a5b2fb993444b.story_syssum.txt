RAWALPINDI, Pakistan (CNN) -- The office of Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas has a bank of six flat-screen televisions covering most of one wall, showing all the main international English-language news channels, and several local ones besides.
Whatever Abbas thinks of CNN, he is more than willing to explain how the Pakistan army sees the broad picture as it fights in the Swat Valley.
The United States should "stop worrying about the nukes and start worrying about the weapons lost in Afghanistan," he says.
When I ask what that means, he smiles and says he can't elaborate -- declining to repeat the speculation in the press here that India, Pakistan's traditional rival, may be somehow involved in stirring up trouble on Pakistan's northwestern border.
The military wants to get done in Swat as soon as possible, but the general acknowledges its troops will be there for some time.
But they are also prepared for the conflict to be taken to other parts of Pakistan.
He describes the conflict in Swat as "an existential threat" -- a fight for the very existence of Pakistan in its current form.
And he seems acutely aware that the portrayal of that conflict to the West will be critical.
