Among the items going under the hammer at Henry Aldridge & Son is a canvas bag that might have been used to lift the infant Dean from a lifeboat to a rescue ship, said Alan Aldridge of the auction house.
After her rescue, Dean, her mother and her brother returned to England with a canvas sack, among other possessions.
Given that the auctioneer cannot prove Dean was rescued in the bag, "we expect it to fetch £3,000 ($4,480).
She's paying £3,000 a month in nursing home fees," he said -- the amount he hopes her canvas bag will sell for.
Dean's previous sale, in October, raised just over £30,000, Aldridge said.
The auction, in Devizes, southwest England, will also include a collection of letters from the estate of Titanic survivor Barbara Dainton-West, estimated to fetch £40,000 to £60,000 ($60,000 to $90,000).
Dainton-West, who was 10 months old when the ship went down, died in October 2007, the auctioneer said.
