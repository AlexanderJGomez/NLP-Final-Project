Madonna, that is.
And then I look at this week's Billboard chart and I see I thought wrong.
I'm not saying she's better, but clearly she's done -- correction -- doing more.
The two pop icons released debut albums within two years of each other, Madonna in 1983 and Houston in 1985.
Who would've thunk it?
While MDNA is about three songs too long for my taste, I will tell you the first five songs make it very difficult not to want to dance, and that the track "Gang Bang" is pure genius.
"Seriously... like your Madonna?"
But then again, it wouldn't be Madonna if a song like that was.
