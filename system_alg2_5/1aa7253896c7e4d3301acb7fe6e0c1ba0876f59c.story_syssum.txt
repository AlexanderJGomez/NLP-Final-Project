Woods is four short of leader Nicklaus on that all-time list but has not won a major since the 2008 U.S. Open after his career stalled through injury and well chronicled problems in his personal life.
The Greenbrier course in West Virginia is closely associated with Snead, who lived in the area and Woods said he was "excited" about the prospect of claiming a fourth win this season to draw nearer to the legendary golfer.
"I think he's the only guy to win three tournaments on tour this year -- on three different golf courses," Van Pelt said.
Australia's Adam Scott finished in third place at five-under-par 279.
