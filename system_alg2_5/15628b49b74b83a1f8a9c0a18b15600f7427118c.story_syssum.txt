(CNN) -- The new iPhone 5S's performance upgrades and 64-bit processing chip will make the smartphone more responsive and faster.
Technical director Geremy Mustard said the new power in the iPhone 5S has allowed his team to craft the ultimate "Infinity Blade" experience.
The new chip with 64-bit capabilities and improved graphics has developers salivating.
Both Donald and Geremy said they did not have early access to iOS 7 or the new iPhone 5S when they were building "Infinity Blade III," but they design their games with future tech in mind.
The new "parallax effect" included in iOS 7 will create depth on what has traditionally been a flat display for the iPhone and game controller support will offer a new way to play games on the go with the smartphone.
Mobile gaming will definitely get a boost from the new technology available to developers.
"For the first time we can imagine adapting our console game development knowledge for mobile devices without sacrificing a lot in the process."
Donald Mustard said the younger generation is growing up with mobile devices and they are the ones who are going to spur the mobile gaming proliferation in terms of quality and power.
