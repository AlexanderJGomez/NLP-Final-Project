The ship captain accused of causing the deaths of 32 people in last year's Costa Concordia cruise disaster asked for a plea bargain Wednesday as his trial got under way in Italy.
Four crew members and an officer for Costa Cruises who were originally co-defendants with Schettino have already asked for a plea bargain trial.
Schettino was in court with his lawyers for Wednesday's hearing, the start of a process that will be closely watched in Italy and elsewhere.
The case centers on several questions, including why it allegedly took Schettino more than an hour to issue an order to abandon ship and why he allegedly left the vessel before all passengers had abandoned it.
This means more than 250 civil parties are also represented in court.
There, they had to slip into the sea using a rope ladder, with no life jackets and holding the children in their arms.
The civil plaintiffs also include the Costa cruise line, which is suing Schettino for causing the accident and destroying its ship.
I'm very disappointed that Schettino is the only defendant," Domnica Cemortan, a Moldavian dancer who was on the bridge the night of the shipwreck and is a civil plaintiff in the case, told CNN outside the court.
Titan and Costa Cruises said last week they hope to be able to rotate the vessel to a vertical position in September.
