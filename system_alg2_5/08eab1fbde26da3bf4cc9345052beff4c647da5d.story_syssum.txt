Manama, Bahrain (CNN) -- Security forces in Bahrain stormed the main hospital, beating doctors, and attacked demonstrators in Manama's Pearl Roundabout on Wednesday, witnesses in the Bahraini capital said.
The crackdown comes a day after Bahrain's King Hamad imposed a three-month state of emergency and two days after Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates dispatched troops to the Persian Gulf island nation to "protect the safety of citizens," the Bahraini government said.
Security forces blocked highways leading to the capital and formed a ring around the country's main hospital, Salmaniya Medical Complex, not letting people enter or leave, witnesses said.
Security forces then stormed the hospital and beat staffers, several doctors there said.
"This is a government hospital.
The Bahraini government expelled CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom from the country Wednesday without explanation.
We could see tear gas being dispersed," Jamjoom said.
Calls made to various hospitals turned up multiple accounts of witnesses being attacked, including medical staff and doctors, Jamjoom said.
At least two protesters were killed, and at least 150 people were wounded, according to medical officials on the scene.
"The world is watching to see whether Bahrain will respect the basic rights of all its citizens."
