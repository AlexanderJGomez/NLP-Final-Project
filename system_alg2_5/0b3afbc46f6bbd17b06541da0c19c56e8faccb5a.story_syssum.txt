To veto or not to veto: It's up to Arizona Gov.
The bill was sent to Brewer on Monday and she has five days to sign it, veto it, or do nothing and it would become law.
And if that's any indication, the measure could very well become law.
Just over a year into her tenure, Brewer rose to national prominence after signing SB1070 into law, a strict immigration measure also known as the "show me your papers" law that allows law enforcement to ask people for legal documents, which critics say leads to racial profiling of Latinos.
But her conservative credentials took a bit of a beating last year when she said Arizona would participate in the controversial expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.
Brewer said the state couldn't afford it, and she defended her decision in court.
Some influential business groups in Arizona oppose SB1062, the "religious freedom bill."
And Brewer is well liked in the business community.
Brewer is also facing growing support for a veto.
While the measure is not about same-sex marriage, a likely indicator of where Arizonans stand on the SB1062 is a Behavior Research Center's Rocky Mountain Poll from last year.
"Our policies emphasize tolerance and inclusiveness, and prohibit discrimination based on age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or any other improper standard," Brian McCarthy said.
