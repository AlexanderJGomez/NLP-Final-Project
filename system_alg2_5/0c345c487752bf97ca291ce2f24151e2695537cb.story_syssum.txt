Los Angeles (CNN) -- A father and mother showed heroism when a gunman opened fired inside their California home before dawn Saturday, but two members of the family couldn't overcome their wounds, Inglewood police said.
Both were in critical but stable condition, police said.
That rear house was also set afire, believed to have been ignited by the gunman, police said.
