(CNN) -- More than eight years after a Utah teenager disappeared from her bedroom on a summer night, the man authorities believe masterminded her kidnapping is set to stand trial in federal court.
But in July 2005, a Utah district court judge ruled him incompetent to stand trial, leaving him in custody at the Utah State Hospital.
Barzee, 64, pleaded guilty in November 2009 to kidnapping and unlawful transportation of a minor in federal court and was sentenced in May to 15 years in federal prison.
Mitchell's attorneys attempted to move his trial, saying it should be held outside of Utah because publicity in the case had prejudiced the pool of potential jurors against him and jeopardized his right to a fair trial.
"It is possible that a jury could be seated where all the jurors would satisfy Mr. Mitchell's view of impartiality," the 10th Circuit ruling said.
The federal court summoned 600 jurors to fill out a preliminary juror questionnaire in the case, according to court documents.
