(CNN) -- For 460 days, they held her captive.
They took Lindhout, her photographer Nigel Brennan, their drivers and fixer.
"I spent 460 days in captivity," Amanda told CNN.
"I don't want to die here and I'm afraid I'll die of a disease if I don't get help soon," she said in the call.
Lindhout says the organization is working to change the environment the children of Somalia grow up in, so that the cycle of violence ends.
The foundation's goal, Lindhout says, is to bring growth -- and peace.
