So what's next for the much maligned people featured on the hit site Rich Kids of Instagram?
Many of the images featured on the Tumblr were tagged with keywords on Instagram that made them easy to find, like #wealth, #mansion and #yacht.
The blog's creators said they've had requests from people who want to be featured on the site.
"They seem to have huge personalities and would be amazing on TV," said Lexi Shoemaker, a casting agent who has worked on hits like "The Biggest Loser" and Bravo's "Tabatha's Salon Takeover."
"I would consider doing a reality show, it would be a very smart businessÂ decision," said Ierna, who said he has been offered a spot on a reality TV show in the past but turned it down.
Alexa Dell, daughter of Dell CEO Michael Dell, had her social media presence quickly scrubbed from the Internet after a photo of her brother on a private plane to Fiji, feasting on a spread of fruit 3-feet deep, made it to the RKOI blog.
"Aviation is my life," Morales told CNN.
He's also proud of his lifestyle.
Morales thinks the interest in the Rich Kids of Instagram blog is because "people cant find anything else to do with their lives so they stalk other people's photos and make a big deal out of it."
"I think it accurately represents my lifestyle to some extent," said Ierna of his photos.
