"Ms. Huskins' whereabouts are unknown, and we are treating this matter as a kidnap for ransom," Park told reporters.
A cousin of Huskins, Amy Mattison, told CNN affiliate KPIX that the 30-year-old man is Huskins' boyfriend and she was abducted from his residence.
Authorities don't know when her vehicle was moved, police said.
"All I can tell is there was a ransom demand," Park said.
