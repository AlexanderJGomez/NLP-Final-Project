(CNN) -- We learned a few things on Monday night, those of us watching Anderson Cooper on "AC360," about Alex Teves, one of the people who died in the gunfire at theater 9 in the Century 16 multiplex in Aurora, Colorado.
Teves had something to say to the news media, too, something impossible to ignore: "And if we don't stop talking about the gunman -- so somebody took a gun and went in and shot a 6-year-old girl?
He went on: "I would like to see CNN come out with a policy that said, 'Moving forward, we're not going to talk about the gunman.
The mass killings certainly dominated the news, quickly becoming one of the biggest stories of 2012.
Even Tom Teves went to court to see his face.
Like Teves, many people suspect that some sort of media glory is part of the payoff for these mass killers.
The problem, unfortunately, is that people still jump on ball fields.
News media speculation about the motive isn't helpful to anyone.
News outlets should never glorify killers in any way.
As Teves said, "You know, Alex would have expected us to live.
There are wolves, and we have questions: How many wolves?
Tell us about the wolves.
