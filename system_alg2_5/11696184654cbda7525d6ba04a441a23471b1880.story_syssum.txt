The 7-2 majority said the state's voter-approved Proposition 200 interfered with federal law designed to make voter registration easier.
The Obama Justice Department opposed the Arizona law, which went beyond what other states have done to ensure integrity in the registration system.
It requires states to have any application for a driver's license treated also as a voter registration -- the "motor voter."
A federal Election Assistance Commission was created to produce a nationally uniform voter application form, which states must use.
The state said they had prosecuted cases of noncitizens registering to vote.
Among those bringing suit was Jesus Gonzalez, a public school employee in Yuma, Arizona, who tried to register to vote the day he became a citizen.
The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which helped bring the original lawsuit against the state regulations, said 31,000 potential voters had their applications rejected in the two years after the Arizona law took effect.
But Proposition 200 supporters say the state needs the power to keep illegal immigrants and those ineligible to vote in the U.S. from getting a ballot.
"I believe we must go out of our way to protect the integrity of America's elections, to avoid the fraud we see regularly in other nations, and which if not checked will rise up here in the United States," said Russell Pearce, a former state Senate president, who helped spearhead Proposition 200's passage.
As a retired justice, she can sit on lower appeals court cases, and she was part of a 9-2 majority to rule in 2010 that Arizona's citizenship requirement conflicted with federal law.
