Family friend Ellis Cropper, who is serving as a spokesman for Aguilar's mother, told CNN on Monday that police reviewed the journal after the mother called police to file a missing person report.
Police have offered no motive for the shooting.

Cory Brown, the co-owner, said Aguilar walked in with a friend and after spending about 30 minutes in the store, he was approved to purchase the Mossberg 500.
"He came in and asked for something he can use for home defense.
Brown said Aguilar came back just before Christmas with the same friend and purchased another box of shotgun shells.
Police said Cody Cousins, 23, an engineering student, killed Andrew Boldt, 21, of West Bend, Wisconsin.
