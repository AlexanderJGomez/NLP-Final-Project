Pastor Ted Haggard acknowledged on CNN's "Larry King Live" that he had a second relationship with a man.
Controversy involving Haggard first erupted in November 2006, when a former prostitute, Mike Jones, said the pastor had paid him for sex over three years and had used methamphetamine in his presence.
The assertions received widespread news coverage and sparked charges of hypocrisy, particularly because Haggard had condemned homosexual sex.
I'm very grateful to him," Haggard said.
"Many of the charges against me are exaggerated, but it doesn't matter," Haggard told Larry King.
Haggard said he had thought that focusing on his spiritual life would help, but found that it did not.
"The first said, 'You are a heterosexual with homosexual attachments.'
"I really do love this man," she told CNN when asked why she did not leave.
"I knew that Ted had some struggles in this area, particularly in his thoughts.
"He had lived so long on a pedestal," Marcus Haggard said about his famous father.
Asked if he wants to return to the pulpit, Haggard said, "I think Gail and I both want to tell our story to the degree that it's helpful to other people.
