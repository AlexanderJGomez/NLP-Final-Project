By looking at a total population sample in South Korea, the study authors estimate that 1 in 38 children in the country -- or 2.64% -- has some form of autism.
In this new study, researchers looked at all 55,000 school children in a large metropolitan community of Seoul, which they say is representative not only of South Korea, but also many other developed nations.
Using mathematical algorithms, researchers estimate 1 in 38 children in South Korea have an autism spectrum disorder.
The study doesn't mean that suddenly many more children have autism, Kim said.
He said when the study began in 2005, South Koreans believed that autism was rare in their country.
At that same time, the CDC estimated autism prevalence to be about 1 in 150 children and Australian researchers believed it to be around 1 in 160 children.
What makes Monday's study different from other autism studies is that researchers sought out children in regular schools.
"I think many children with autism can do well in that highly structured situation and may not get flagged as having a particular problem," Grinker said.
This may explain why many children with autism in South Korea may go unnoticed and may explain a significant difference with children in the United States.
