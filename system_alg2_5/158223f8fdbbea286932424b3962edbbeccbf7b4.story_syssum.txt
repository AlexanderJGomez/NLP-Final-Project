Gonzaga University, a private, four-year university in Spokane, Washington, says the students violated the school's weapons policy by having firearms in their apartment, which is in a complex near the campus.
McIntosh said he came to the door with his pistol drawn, and the students said the man turned and ran away.
Dean Chuang, attorney for Fagan and McIntosh, said the shotgun is owned by Fagan, who uses it to hunt periodically, and it wasn't used in the incident.
In a disciplinary board hearing on Friday, the board, made up of three faculty members and two students, found Fagan and McIntosh guilty of two infractions -- possessing weapons on school grounds and putting others in danger by the use of weapons, according to Chuang.
Meantime, Fagan and McIntosh have asked university security to return their firearms, but that hasn't yet happened.
McCulloh's statement said he has asked the Vice President for Student Development to work with several campus organizations to "facilitate a campus dialogue focused on this issue."
