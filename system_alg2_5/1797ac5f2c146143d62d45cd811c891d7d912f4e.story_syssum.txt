(WIRED)  -- When Microsoft and Facebook announced that they were partnering to integrate Facebook and Bing for social network-powered search, it confirmed something I thought Monday: Windows Phone 7 is the real Facebook phone.
Every aspect of Windows Phone 7 is geared to social networks: phone, contacts, gaming, photos, even Office.
Microsoft tried to explicitly build a social networking phone featuring Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and MySpace with the Kin.
Even before the Bing announcement, Facebook was a conspicuous part of the WP7 presentation.
It's the exact strategy that Zuckerberg outlined in his interview with Michael Arrington, where he explained why Facebook wasn't building its own phone.
In order to do that, Zuckerberg explained, you need to find a company that was willing to incorporate social networking from the operating system up -- not just adding a layer on top of it was already doing, but making that the focus of the device and its services.
Microsoft may be the underdog in search and phones, but it's actually been ahead of the curve in terms of incorporating social layers into its products.
And Bing is already embedded in Facebook, in the form of maps and search results.
And search is one of just three buttons on every WP7 phone.
The Office people demonstrated how to use Windows Live to stream a PowerPoint presentation from a Windows PC to a Mac.
The only places where Microsoft and Facebook are "underdogs" are search and smartphones.
