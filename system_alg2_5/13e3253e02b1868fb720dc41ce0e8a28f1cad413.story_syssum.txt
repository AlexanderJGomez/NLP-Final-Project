"When a big rain would come, she'd always get out and dance in the rain," the teen's mother, Auliea Hanlon, said.
"If the world wasn't entertaining enough, she would entertain herself with the world.
And she had the most beautiful laugh," Hanlon said.
As Rambold's case traversed the court system -- during which the teacher confessed to repeatedly raping the girl in his home, car and office in 2007 -- Hanlon came home one day to find Cherice in Hanlon's bed, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
He would recant and apologize later, but Judge G. Todd Baugh defended the sentence at the time by saying that Cherice looked older than her age and that the 14-year-old was as much in control of the situation as Rambold.
In many ways Cherice was a typical kid.
Mother and daughter were always introducing each other to new things.
Hanlon enjoyed listening to Puddle of Mudd, Will Smith and Cherice's favorite band, Nickelback, while her daughter grew to love Pink Floyd and Melissa Etheridge.
Cherice also loved the outdoors.
She was insatiably curious, and if she didn't know the answer to something, "she was the type who was going to look it up," her mother said.
She also enjoyed poetry, and Hanlon described her daughter's style as "darker," reminiscent of Edgar Allan Poe.
Her daughter asked what she wanted for Christmas, and Hanlon replied that she'd like a poem.
