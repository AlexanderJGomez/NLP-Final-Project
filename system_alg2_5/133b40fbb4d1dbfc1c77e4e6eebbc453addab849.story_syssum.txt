Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)After days of turmoil and talks of a coup in Yemen, the government and Houthi rebels reached a tentative deal Wednesday.
One government minister called it "the completion of a coup," but rebels said they had not asked the president to step down.

Parts of the government (were) dysfunctional, but we did not reach the point of no return," he told CNN's "The Situation Room."
In return for these government concessions, the rebels basically agree to withdraw their fighters from the capital.
A Houthi official said the rebels will abide by the deal if the President follows a timeline specified in the negotiations.
In September, they signed a ceasefire deal with the government, and Houthis have since installed themselves in key positions in the government and financial institutions.
Two Houthi field commanders told CNN that rebels had seized control of a massive weapons depot belonging to the government brigade that provides presidential personal security.
The installation is not under control of the rebels, but they have it surrounded, the field commanders and two government officials said.
