So many are now imagining an end to the energy crisis.
We need to innovate alternative energy sources now more than ever ... and our choices are limited.
All need time-consuming innovations so we cannot afford to hesitate; research must be ramped up across the board and government must keep up the pace.
It is not easy to build a device that runs at ten times the temperature of the Sun, but it is possible.
Called ITER -- it is designed to reach a self-sustaining fusion burn -- the last scientific hurdle to fusion power.
There are other approaches to fusion -- for example the laser experiments at the National Ignition Facility in California -- but for many of us in the scientific trenches, the fusion burn on ITER is expected to be the defining moment.
If we continue to starve the technological research agenda of funds, however, we risk delaying fusion power and ceding technological leadership to China and Korea.
Fusion research including ITER construction is less than â‚¬1.5 billion ($2 billion) a year -- not even 0.05% of the market.
Only if we sufficiently fund alternative energy research now.
