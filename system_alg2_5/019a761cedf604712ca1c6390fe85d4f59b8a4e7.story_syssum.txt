Just three weeks ago, Fowle -- like his fellow Americans, Bae and Miller -- was detained in North Korea.
No more.
"Kenneth Bae and Matthew Miller should have been released before I was," Fowle told CNN.
Euna Lee, who was released from North Korea in 2009 after being detained for 140 days, said she wanted to return not just to her home, but to normal.
The following May, he was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for "hostile acts" against the Communist nation, and spent time in a labor camp, as well as a hospital.
While also accused of "perpetrating hostile acts," and while he -- like Bae and Miller -- told CNN he signed documents admitting his guilt, Fowle said he didn't spend time in a jail or at a labor camp.
If past releases are any indication, they'll soon be hugging and kissing family members back in the United States, then going off to spend time with loved ones.
Fowle said that his transition home was eased by the fact he got his old job back home in Ohio.
