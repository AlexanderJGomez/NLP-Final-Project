U.S. veterans are dying because of delays in diagnosis and treatment at VA hospitals.
"The problem was getting worse and I was having more pain," Coates said, talking about one specific VA doctor who he saw every few months.
"I had already been in pain and suffering from this problem for over six months and it wasn't getting better," Coates said.
Coates waited months, even begging for an appointment to have his colonoscopy.

According to the document obtained by CNN, 10 veterans are confirmed to have died in the South Carolina and Georgia region alone.
In the Florida region, five veterans are dead, and 14 vets or their families were sent the disclosures, notified that they suffered "adverse events" because of delayed or denied care or diagnosis, according to the exclusive document.
As CNN has previously reported,  as many as 7,000 veterans were on a backlog list -- waiting too long for colonscopies or endoscopies -- at VA facilities in Columbia, South Carolina and Augusta, Georgia.
The VA said the backlog at those two hospitals has been solved, but that is not a good enough explanation for Rep. Jeff Miller, the chair of the House Veterans Affairs Committee.
Miller said the VA, from the top down, has consistently ignored his committee's requests to find out who is responsible.
...There were many people involved' "  said Miller.
The VA did issue a written statement from Dr. Robert Petzel, the Under Secretary for Health at the department of Veterans Affairs.
We take seriously any issue that occurs at any one of the more than 1,700 VA health care facilities across the country."
"No veteran should have to fill out a 23-page claim to get care, or wait months -- even years -- to get an appointment at the VA," said then-candidate Obama.
But Coates said for him the speech is an empty promise.
