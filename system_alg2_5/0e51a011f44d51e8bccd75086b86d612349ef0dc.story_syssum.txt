(CNN) -- In an attempt to reduce open street prostitution and to improve security for sex workers, Switzerland's largest city, Zurich, is opening "sex drive-ins" Monday.
The drive-ins are more discreet and safer."
Sex workers have to pay 5 Swiss francs per night to make use of the so-called "sex boxes," but customers don't have to pay an entrance fee.
There are also showers, toilets, a kitchen and washing machines for the women to use, as well as an advice center where they can seek help from social workers.
"We are trying to promote the independence and self-determination of the sex workers," he said.
We went to Utrecht in the Netherlands and Cologne and Essen in Germany, where similar projects exist, to speak to organizers.
