(CNN) -- Lionel Messi scored his 91st and final goal of 2012 on Saturday as Barcelona enjoyed a comfortable 3-1 win over Real Valladolid at the Estadio Jose Zorrilla.
Caretaker boss Jordi Roura, who watched Barcelona beat Valladolid, will continue in Vilanova's absence.
But two goals in three minutes from substitute Roque Santa Cruz consigned Madrid to defeat.
Benat gave the home side the lead in the fifth minute before strikes from Victor on the half-hour mark and a 47th minute penalty from Javi Marquez sealed three points to lift Mallorca out of the relegation zone.
