Police also announced the arrest of the man they say killed Anjelica and dumped her body along the Henry Hudson Parkway.
Detectives from the New York Police Department's Cold Case Apprehension Squad never stopped searching for answers in the case.
Police arrested Juarez after questioning him near the Manhattan restaurant where he worked as a dishwasher, Kelly said.
Juarez admitted to the crime Saturday morning, Kelly said.
When the girl went motionless, Juarez told police, he summoned his sister from another room.
It was the sister who told Juarez to get rid of the body and who provided the cooler, Kelly said.
Jerry Giorgio, who worked on the case from the start, said he was "elated" at news of the arrest.
From there, investigators constructed a family tree, and the trail led them to Juarez, Kelly said.
"They were unrelenting," he said.
