The county medical examiner ruled Brancheau "most likely died from multiple traumatic injuries and drowning after one of the park's killer whales pulled her into a pool behind Shamu Stadium," the sheriff's office said in a statement.
Orange County Sheriff's Office spokesman Jim Solomons said Brancheau slipped into the tank.
The Orange County Sheriff's Office said the man apparently hid in the park until after it closed, then climbed into the tank.
Because of Tilikum's history, as well as his size, trainers did not get into the water with him, Tompkins told CNN.
Tilikum could have been trying to play with Brancheau or get her attention or companionship, said Nancy Black, a marine biologist who has studied whales for 20 years.
"I don't believe the killer whale purposely intended to kill the woman," she said.
She said Tilikum had a "flopped fin," something seen in captivity but not much in the wild.
"This is the first time in 46 years that we've ever had an incident like this with a trainer," he said.
