(CNN) -- Four Nigerian farmers and the environmental group Friends of the Earth took oil giant Shell to court Thursday in the Netherlands to demand a proper cleanup and compensation for pollution in the Niger Delta.
The campaign group says this is the first time a Dutch company has been brought before a court in the Netherlands over environmental damage caused abroad.
French said that Shell had cleaned up three leaks at three locations, from 2004 to 2007, which were caused by sabotage.
A report by the U.N. Environmental Program last year found that pollution from more than 50 years of oil operations in the Ogoniland region, by Shell and other companies, was more far-reaching than thought.
Shell has previously accepted responsibility for two oil spills in Ogoniland in 2008 and 2009.
