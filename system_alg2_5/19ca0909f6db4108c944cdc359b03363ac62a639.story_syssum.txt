The former Barcelona striker is now a member of the Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB) and, despite having relatively little political experience, won a seat in the country's lower congress with the sixth-highest number of votes in the city.
Both have said they want to improve participation in sport as well as the lot of the poor in their country, and voters seem willing to back the unconventional politicians despite their lack of experience.
"Romario and Bebeto are very popular footballers, so most people don't even care about their proposals -- their popularity is enough," she said.
George Brock, a former International editor of British newspaper The Times, thinks the political climate in developing countries like Brazil also contributes to footballers and other candidates from the world of sport being voted into office.
"Coming from outside the political class works as an advantage.
Other footballers who have enjoyed notable political careers include Albert Gudmundsson, the first professional footballer from Iceland, who in the 1980s served as his country's minister of finance and minister of industry.
Back in Brazil, only time will tell whether the duo of Romario and Bebeto can enjoy the same success in politics as they did on the football pitch.
The people can rest assured I will score a lot of goals in Brazil."
