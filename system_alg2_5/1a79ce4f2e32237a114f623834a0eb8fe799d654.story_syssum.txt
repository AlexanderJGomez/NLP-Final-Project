Herschend said the company is investigating and assisting fire and police officials.
Asked by reporters Thursday whether the barge was at fault, Herschend said, "I don't want to speculate.

The boat is upright on the bottom of the river, Blackburn said.
One passenger suffered a broken jaw, Gaitlin said.
