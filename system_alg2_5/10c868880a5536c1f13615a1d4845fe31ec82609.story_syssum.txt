Jones said Hinckley had told him he'd explained to CB he planned to spend more time visiting his mother's home in Virginia and would be spending less time with her.
According to Jones, another doctor told Hinckley the relationship was ill-advised and eventually Hinckley ended it.
Jones said Hinckley has had some difficulties.
Jones said Hinckley, when in Williamsburg, had not been interested in going to a gym or participating in certain sports like golf or tennis, either because of arthritis or because he finds the activities unappealing.

Chasson said Secret Service agents will testify they kept an eye on Hinckley in Williamsburg during the short periods of time earlier this year when he was allowed free time on his own.
According to Chasson, the agents will testify about several occasions when Hinckley deviated from agreed-upon plans for how he would spend his time.
