New York (CNN) -- Judson Box has never known exactly how his son, Gary, died on September 11, 2001.
But it was not Gary.
"I was out of out control, emotionally," Box said.
Several months later, the museum gave him the e-mail address of Erik Troelson, a Danish businessman who was stranded in the tunnel on his way to a meeting when he snapped the picture of Gary.
"Gary Box was one of the guys."
"I think I said about 300 times thank you and God bless you, that's all I could say," Box said.
Nine years after September 11, Box said he still feels the pain of that day.
