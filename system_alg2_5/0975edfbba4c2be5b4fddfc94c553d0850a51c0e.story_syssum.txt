But Louis Schlamowitz, for one, is grateful to postmen, who over the years have dropped thousands of envelopes into the mailbox of his cramped apartment in the Canarsie neighborhood of Brooklyn, where he has spent all his life.
Fidel Castro.
Schlamowitz's collection -- he says he has more than 6,000 letters and autographed photos -- had been written about before, but after Gadhafi died, everyone became curious about why an 81-year-old American corresponded with the despot.
But his friend insisted he mail it.
When he saw someone in the news, he looked up the person's address and dropped a letter in the mail.
Schlamowitz, a devout Jew, even received a Christmas card from the Muslim Gadhafi.
Gadhafi wrote several times more; one letter attacked America for practicing terrorism with its support of Israel -- not what a Jewish man who also had letters from Israel's Golda Meir, Yitzhak Rabin and Moshe Dayan would want to read.
After the Libyan uprising was well under way, Schlamowitz felt an urge to write again.
"He should have stepped down like the president of Egypt," Schlamowitz says.
That he just wanted to write to them and maybe get a photo to hang on his otherwise drab walls.
"It's a hell of a hobby you have, Schlamowitz."
Schlamowitz wasn't going to take that chance.
"You must be sick," Schlamowitz told him.
"I'm nobody special," he says.
An ordinary guy with an extraordinary collection.
