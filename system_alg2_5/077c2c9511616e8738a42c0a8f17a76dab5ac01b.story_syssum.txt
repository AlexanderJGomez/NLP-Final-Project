In exchange for that flexibility, those states "have agreed to raise standards, improve accountability, and undertake essential reforms to improve teacher effectiveness," the White House said in a statement Thursday morning.
New Mexico also requested such flexibility from the No Child Left Behind law, and the Obama administration is working closely with that state.
"This is good news for our kids, it's good news for our country," the president said of the waivers, adding that one approach may work well in one part of the country while another may better suit another place.
Georgia State School Superintendent John Barge described the waiver for his state as "wonderful news for Georgia's students, educators and parents.
"The waiver will make for a fairer system and one that focuses on what matters most: getting the whole system to perform better in terms of student learning," he said in a statement.
Secretary Duncan says the law drives down standards, weakens accountability, causes narrowing of the curriculum and labels too many schools as failing, the White House said in its news release.
To get the waivers, states had to adopt and have a plan to implement "college and career-ready standards," the White House said.
"This is going to take some time, but we can get it done."
