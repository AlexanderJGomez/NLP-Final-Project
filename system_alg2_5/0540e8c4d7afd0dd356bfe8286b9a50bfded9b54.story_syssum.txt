"Brady Bunch" actress Florence Henderson founded a service to help older adults learn about computers.
She spoke with CNN's Josh Levs about her inspiration, her grandkids and "Brady Bunch" rumors as the show celebrates its 40th anniversary.

Henderson: You know what, Josh?
And now I can actually see them.

Henderson: You know what, Josh?
And I love people.
Henderson: The real story is that he always had a crush on me and he asked me to go on a date with him.
But it was so sweet and so innocent.
