The money came from two funds managed by the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, also known as the Claims Conference, a nonprofit that was established almost 60 years ago to assist those harmed by Nazis.
Bharara said some 5,000 fraudulent applications worth $18 million were processed through the fund.
Bharara said that this fund had processed over 650 fraudulent applications worth more than $25.5 million.
Bharara said the investigation continues and that some of the thousands of applicants also might be charged.
