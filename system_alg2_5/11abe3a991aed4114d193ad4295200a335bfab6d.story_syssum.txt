He also is accused of harming state security because of what he said during the meeting, Oureto said.
Akoun, the current deputy chief of the party, was heading to a party rally when the nation's gendarmerie -- a paramilitary force -- arrested him and transferred him to Abidjan, said Augustin Guehoun, the head of communication for the party.
Ivory Coast's authorities say Gbagbo's supporters are behind the attacks, intended to destabilize the West African country, which is recovering from a five-month post-election crisis that killed more than 3,000 people last year.
He said the reasons for the recent attacks have to be investigated in light of the failing process of disarmament and reassimilation of former fighters.
Justin Kone Katinan, a spokesman for Gbagbo during last year's standoff and the ex-budget minister, was arrested on August 24 in neighboring Ghana, where he sought refuge after the collapse of Gbagbo's administration in April 2011.
Ivory Coast's government issued international arrest warrants last year against two dozen military and political officials loyal to Gbagbo, including Katinan, who is accused of economic crimes.
