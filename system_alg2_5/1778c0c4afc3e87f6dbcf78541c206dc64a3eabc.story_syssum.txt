(CNN) -- "No one's ever asked to see my birth certificate.
But what, exactly, did Romney reveal with this pre-meditated "offhand" remark?
We already know that because he appears on media friendly to the right but limits the number and kind of questions reporters can ask him, and then responds with dodging answers.
It is sad that a campaign stretch that began with his asking Obama to stop apologizing for America (something fact checkers noted the president never did) and roundly debunked welfare attack ad ended with a xenophobic and roundly debunked birther reference.
His birth certificate dog-whistles are not just desperate, they are deliberate.
How we respond to Romney's remark will reveal a lot about us, as well.
The media, too, will reveal a lot about itself by its response.
Trying to pretend that somehow Obama is not an American-born leader, or questioning his patrioism, or his values by using the Big Lie often speaks in code.
It's not where you were born -- in a cabin or a mansion -- or how you were raised -- in poverty by a single parent or with money and privilege -- that matters.
