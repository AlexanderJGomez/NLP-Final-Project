But now that he appears to be poised to take executive action to fix some of what's broken with the country's immigration system, Republicans in Congress sound like they're about to overreact and join him in that failure.
Obama broke his campaign promise to make reform a top issue and eroded trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement by expanding 100-fold the program known as Secure Communities, which ropes local police into enforcing federal immigration law.
A few months ago, I said this would never happen and now it looks like it might.
But the same thing can't be said of their parents, who did intentionally break the law.
Besides, if Obama offers deferred action to parents, it will validate what conservatives have always insisted about how the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants can be used to keep their parents from being deported.
Now, if he goes too far, Obama could prove them right.
This isn't reform.
In the post 9/11 era, conservatives shouldn't need a reminder of something they've been telling us for years: how sweeping can be the executive power of the president.
Besides, Republicans like to talk tough about illegal immigration and the need to uphold the "rule of law" but that slogan would mean more coming from them if they didn't always run away from enforcing those laws that target the root of illegal immigration: U.S. employers who hire the undocumented, many of whom contribute to the re-election campaigns of Republican lawmakers.
But it does have the advantage of being true.
