Until it all came crashing down Saturday morning, when North Charleston police Officer Michael Slager pulled Scott over, reportedly for a faulty brake light.
Dash cam video released Thursday shows the two talking, then shows Scott get out of his car and run.
According to a police report, Scott did not comply with an officer's demands and tried to grab Slager's stun gun.
Anthony Scott said he watched the video that showed his brother getting shot dead, footage that has traumatized the family.
"It was a great celebration," Anthony Scott said.
