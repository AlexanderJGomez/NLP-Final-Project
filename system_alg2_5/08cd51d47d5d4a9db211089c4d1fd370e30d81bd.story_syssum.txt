LONDON, England (CNN) -- A fan of English football club Arsenal has been injured after the bus he and other supporters were traveling in was ambushed before the sides' Champions League clash in Rome, Wednesday night.
Police were quick to arrive and the bus managed to move on to safety, where the fan was treated for the wound, he said.
The victims were traveling supporters of the Ocean Boys Football Club in Nigeria.
In 2003 five England fans suffered gunshot wounds during a violent incident in Zurich, Switzerland, before the side played a Euro 2004 qualifier with Liechtenstein.
