Her mother gave birth to her in a makeshift shelter in the besieged Syrian city of Homs, the heart of the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad's regime.
Fatime's father may live to see her, but two great-uncles will not, her grandmother says.
Baby Fatime is one of at least two dozen children holed up with mothers, grandmothers and other relatives in this makeshift shelter in the Homs neighborhood of Baba Amr.
One woman says her son has been detained since the end of August.
"I have to keep going," she says.
His blood is still in the streets," says Umm Khidir, one of the mothers.
I can't bring his daddy back," she says, demanding to know why the world is not coming to their aid.
