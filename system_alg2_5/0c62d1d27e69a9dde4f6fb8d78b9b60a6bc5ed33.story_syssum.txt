Robertson asked Meshaal why Hamas is firing rockets from civilian neighborhoods.
"How many Israeli civilians have our rockets killed?
Sixty-four Israeli soldiers and three civilians in Israel had been killed, according to Israeli officials.)
Meshaal said Israel has a powerful military but the Palestinians will triumph.
For us to kill their soldiers while they kill our civilians is also a victory for the Palestinian cause and Hamas."
Robertson pressed Meshaal on the point, asking how this can be a victory for Hamas and its cause when so many Palestinians are dying.
We're ready to stop this war."
"Regardless what the others' positions (are), we stated that we are ready to go as a Palestinian delegation to Cairo in order to talk to the Egyptians so they can hold indirect talks between us and the Israelis, so we can reach an agreement that will address our Palestinian demands, headed by ending the siege of Gaza.
"We the Palestinian people have, since 1948, have listened to the international community and U.N. and international regulations, in the hope they end the aggression against us.
