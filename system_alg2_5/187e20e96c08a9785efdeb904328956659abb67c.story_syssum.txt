Schmidt-Jones is just one of a growing number of professors and teachers who are using the Web site Connexions (cnx.org) to reach potential students.
"The access was going to be limited -- it would only be available to just a few students from the United States," he told CNN.
"I realized that there was a better way that was enabled by information technology, where we could author textbooks as a community and make them free and open for people to use and reuse," he explained.
On the Connexions Web site, authors can upload bite-sized chunks of learning materials called "modules."
"So we can lower the cost for everybody, sometimes to zero for materials that are online."
And as the site grows, Baraniuk is seeing a rise in the number of people using its modules, especially in the arts and humanities, for informal learning.
"My particular book in Connexions is fairly popular," Baraniuk explains, "But I was translated by three volunteer engineering students in University of Texas, El Paso and my book is far more popular in Spanish than it is in English.
"I don't think any publisher of music textbooks would even have looked at my material," Schmidt-Jones told CNN.
Thanks," reads one example.
Schmidt-Jones currently has 167 modules available through Connexions.
"She is just the tip of the iceberg of a new community of authors who are going to be able to really enrich and enliven educational material for everyone," he told CNN.
