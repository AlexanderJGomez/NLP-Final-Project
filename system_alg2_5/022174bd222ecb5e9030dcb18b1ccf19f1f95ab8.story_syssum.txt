Susan, aka "Ginormica," has to save the world in "Monsters vs.
Who doesn't want to see a 50-foot woman careening through San Francisco on skates that turn out to be automobiles -- the ultimate demolition roller derby?
Roller skates work because they have fixed wheels.
High concepts, top-notch voice talent and scattershot pop cultural references are no compensation for a coherent script.
That may be good politics or at least a sound marketing decision from the studio's perspective -- it's been awhile since a family animated feature produced a genuinely strong female character (unless you count "Coraline," which was way too scary for my family) -- but Susan's self-esteem is an awfully long time coming.
