The government has erected three massive pillars and completed a $1.2 billion, five-story bridge nearby where pilgrims can toss stones.
"It is an immense responsibility that we had to deal with.
As a measure to alleviate harm, according to Muslim traditions, the elderly and the handicapped can appoint someone else to stone for them.
According to authorities, the bridge is 950 meters (1,039 yards) long and 80 meters (87 yards) wide.
The stoning ritual is done over at least two days, where pilgrims stone three pillars at Mina -- believed to be where the Prophet Abraham stoned the devil when he tried to dissuade him from obeying God's orders to slaughter his son.
