Bogota, Tennessee (CNN) -- Those who say no man is an island never met Danny Hayes.
Could flip over," Hayes said, standing on the trailer's small porch.
Whatever comes, Hayes said he will not be moved.
The homes around Hayes' trailer sit empty, but as he waits out the flood, he is hardly alone.
"It's illegal to kill snakes in Tennessee," he said with a serious look before breaking into a wide smile.
But his and his neighbors' homes are safe, Hayes said, while he patrols his small "island."
So stubborn he married and divorced the same woman three times before they finally called it quits.
Asked what he will do while the floodwaters retreat, Hayes replied with a ready joke.
