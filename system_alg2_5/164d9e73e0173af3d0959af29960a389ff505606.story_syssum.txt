The Band Perry joins a long list that includes the Jackson 5, the Bee Gees, the Pointer Sisters, even the Von Trapp Family Singers.
The three siblings -- Kimberly, Neil and Reid -- have been performing together for 14 years.
"The most nerve-racking moment was releasing 'You Lie,'" Kimberly said of the band's success since the first single.
"So many of the families were struggling financially anyway, the food bank really helped them get back on their feet," Kimberly said.
Reid, 23, and Neil, 21, speak only when they can get a word in edgewise.
"We do have to sleep with one eye open when we're out on the road," Kimberly said.
"He's a great guy to be out on the road with," Kimberly said.
The Band Perry is headed back to the studio to record their second album.
