Los Angeles (CNN) -- Comedienne Joan Rivers says she will "stand behind" what she told a paparazzo about not feeling sadness for civilians killed in Gaza.
You're dead.
"The media, as usual, has decided to only quote the most out of context and inflammatory non sequitur rather than giving an accurate account of what my intentions were behind the statement," Rivers said.
"What I said and stand behind is, war is hell and unfortunately civilians are victims of political conflicts," Rivers said.
Israeli officials have said 64 Israeli soldiers and three civilians in Israel died.
