For Remy Cordonnier, director of the medieval and early modern collection at the library in Saint-Omer, the moment he realized what he held in his hands was one of excitement -- and disbelief.
"I am not an expert myself on Shakespeare's pieces, so I wanted to have the opinion of an expert," said Cordonnier.
The Saint-Omer library was home to a Shakespeare's First Folio.
The library still plans to make the First Folio part of the Anglo-Saxon exhibition, but it will not be put on display.
