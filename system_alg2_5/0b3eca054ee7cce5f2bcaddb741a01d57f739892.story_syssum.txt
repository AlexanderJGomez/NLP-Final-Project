1 ranking without lifting a club after Ryder Cup teammate Luke Donald finished down the field in 37th at the RBC Heritage on Sunday.
Donald and McIlroy have swapped places three times this year already.
"Is it a concern?
Nice week off now," tweeted Donald, who lost out to Brandt Snedeker in a playoff at last year's tournament.
Pettersson, meanwhile, began the final round with a one-shot lead over Colt Knost and finished with a confident two-under 69 to move clear of the field for his fifth PGA Tour title.
