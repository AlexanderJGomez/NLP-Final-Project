In Ohio, the unemployment rate was 10.6%.
What Obama did not say, however, was that the nation shed 4.3 million jobs during the early days of his term, and that the net gain since he took the oath of office in January 2009 is just 125,000 jobs.
Also during the debate, GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney said that 23 million people are out of work in the nation.
That means that, while the nation has replaced lost jobs, many of those new jobs pay less than the old ones did.
In August, the U.S. unemployment rate was 8.1%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
