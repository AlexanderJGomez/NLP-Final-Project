Monday is the first day that users will be required to upgrade to the latest version of of Yahoo's e-mail service, which according to various assessments is either the second or third most popular on the Web.
In a Yahoo Help post the company noted that upgrading requires users to agree to terms including "automated content scanning."
The changes to the latest version of Yahoo Mail include removing some of the boxes that filled the page in the Web version and offering thumbnail images of attachments, presumably to help avoid clicking on scams, spam and other unwanted content.
The Yahoo help post offers options for disgruntled users, including how to download your content and access it through another client and how to delete your account.
