(CNN) -- Iran has threatened that it will retaliate against the Obama administration's proposed new economic sanctions on Iran's oil exports by blocking the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf.
The Obama administration has ruled out military strikes to stop Iran's nuclear program in favor of tougher sanctions, which, once signed by the president, and if fully implemented, would sharply reduce Iran's oil revenue.
But it is not clear whether Saudi Arabia actually would increase production to compensate for the loss of Iranian oil.
Iran notes that Western economies are under stress and predicts they could not afford higher oil prices.
Economies from India to China would be impacted by a Persian Gulf oil cutoff and higher energy prices.
Iran hopes its saber-rattling will persuade Asia's economic powerhouses and Persian Gulf emirates to pressure Washington to back away from the new sanctions.
