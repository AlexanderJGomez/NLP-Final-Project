In a biting sketch on Saturday's episode, Christina Applegate hosts a fake talk show in which three tech bloggers voice complaints about the iPhone 5: Its new maps are glitchy, its camera takes purple-tinged photos, its casing scratches too easily, and so on.
"Oh, Twitter real slow?
says another worker.
On "SNL," the three bloggers grow more apologetic and uncomfortable until the skit ends with Applegate inviting the Chinese workers to complain about an American product.
