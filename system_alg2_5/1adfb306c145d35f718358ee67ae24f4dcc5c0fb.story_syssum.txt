(CNN) -- iPads will soon be ubiquitous in American Airlines cockpits, but don't expect pilots to be playing "Angry Birds" instead of paying attention to the flight path.
Clark says the initiative is designed to not only save American money but, since each flight bag is made up of thousands of pages that must be updated constantly, to be a valuable time-saver as well.
"It takes me anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour, an hour and a half, for revisions to take out the old page and put new pages in.
"Each kitbag can weigh 35 to 45 pounds," Clark said.
It's unclear if or how soon United will match American in getting the FAA's approval for iPad use during all phases of flight.
"It's a game-changer," Clark said.
And our pilots are good at that.
