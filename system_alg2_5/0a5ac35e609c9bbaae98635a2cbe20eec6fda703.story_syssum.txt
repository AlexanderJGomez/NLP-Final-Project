Although the role that synthetic marijuana played in Emily's medical condition is not yet clear, what is clear is that these new chemicals might not even exist if it weren't for the prohibition of marijuana, a plant that has been widely consumed throughout the world for thousands of years.
Almost no one would touch this synthetic stuff -- actually, it wouldn't even exist -- if it weren't for the criminalization of the marijuana plant itself.
The synthetic marijuana that Emily Bauer consumed was likely one of the "second generation" of synthetic marijuana chemicals.
After decades of marijuana prohibition, elected officials and the public are finally realizing that regulating the production and sale of marijuana is the best way to reduce the harms of the illicit marijuana market and the harms of marijuana use itself.
And the evidence clearly shows that effective, legal regulation reduces the harm of drugs better than prohibition ever does.
Product labeling requirements, as well as marketing, branding and retail display restrictions, are proven to reduce youth access to tobacco products and impulse tobacco purchases.
Prohibition simply creates new public health problems and maximizes the harm associated with illegal drug use.
