(CNN) -- Most Americans don't think that midterm elections really matter.
The 1938 midterm elections created a conservative coalition of southern Democrats and Republicans that stifled Franklin Roosevelt and subsequent Democratic presidents for decades to come.
While Republicans will certainly retain control of the House, it is unclear whether Democrats will continue to control a majority of the Senate.
If Republicans gain control of the Senate in November, he won't have that check to point to anymore and we can see the GOP shift even further to the right.
Immigration reform is dead for the rest of the Congress, but it is an issue people are still talking about and proposals will be back on the table if Democrats have their say about it.
If Republicans gain control of the Senate, the White House will be in big trouble with its appointments.
The midterms are a big deal.
What happens to the Senate will play a very important role in the direction of U.S. politics in the coming years, even if Congress remains in its current dysfunctional state.
