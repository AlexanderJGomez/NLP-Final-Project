"It's very, very important to keep that place open, giving good services" to the people of Juarez, De La Vega says.
Nearly 2,000 people have been killed so far this year, including 34 members of the municipal police.
Despite the violence, De La Vega's hospital and its staff -- which treats about 900 patients daily, regardless of their ability to pay -- have remained unharmed.
Why would they be against that?
De La Vega says she has lost friends and neighbors in the conflict, but she insists she's not afraid -- and she's determined to help the people of Juarez continue receiving the medical care they need.
She partnered with community health volunteers called "promotoras" in villages across Mexico to help educate women about family planning and support maternal and infant health.
One of De La Vega's first clinics was built in the early '70s where the Hospital de la Familia sits today.
With a staff of 144 doctors and 192 nurses, Hospital de la Familia performs emergency care as well as routine and specialized surgeries for adults and children.
The Hospital de la Familia is just one of the organization's many health care facilities.
This is what gives me meaning to my life."
