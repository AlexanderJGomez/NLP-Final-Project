Refugee Agency accompanied South Sudanese supermodel Alek Wek to her native country during the one-year anniversary of its independence.
"I went home for the independence with an open mind and to see how the returnees and refugees were doing," Wek said.
"I am so impressed by UNHCR staff who live and work side by side with the refugees," Wek said.
UNHCR is assisting more than 330,000 South Sudanese who returned home from Khartoum, Sudan, and neighboring countries.
While talking with a mother who was sharing her joy over finally coming home, Wek also learned that programs to help people restart their lives are at risk of being cut because of competing needs in the country.
Similarly, $55 can buy five mosquito nets to protect children from the deadly threat of malaria.
Wek plans to work with UNHCR not only on generating awareness for the emergency but also by helping the agency generate funds to support the returnees and their access to education.
