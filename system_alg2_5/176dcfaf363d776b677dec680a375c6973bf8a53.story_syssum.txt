Aqsa gave a lingering farewell to her bedridden grandmother, and that's when Khalida, her mother, knew something was wrong.
Her father says when he spoke to her about coming home, she said that she would see her family on Judgment Day and would like to be a martyr.
She has been prolific on social media, advocating ISIS and Islamic caliphate beliefs, and calling for attacks to be carried out in Western countries.
Aqsa is said to be influenced by watching sermons online and coming in contact with people through social media that helped her make the trek from Glasgow to Syria.
We just don't know what happened to her.
She was very friendly.
On her desk, colorful loom bands and bracelets hung from a goosenecked lamp, a dog-eared copy of "The Hunger Games" nearby.
We all went together," Muzaffar says.
I can't believe this," Khalida tearfully says, explaining the shock the family feels about her daughter's decision.
Her mother says Aqsa never complained despite being asked to help with housework.
We have to get married here.
Obviously, no Muslim approves this."
The family hopes and prays that Aqsa will come home.
In a special message to Aqsa through CNN, her parents made a personal appeal to their daughter.
Looking directly into the camera, Khalida said, "Aqsa, my dear daughter, please come back.
Your sisters and brother miss you a lot.
I love you, my dear daughter.
Anwar, the lawyer, says Aqsa is not directly responsible for committing any crimes and is safe to return home.
Both parents are worried that time is running out for Aqsa to safely return home.
