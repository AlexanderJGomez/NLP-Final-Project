(CNN) -- Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso fears Formula One is in danger of becoming a "lottery" and says it could lose its credibility.
We cannot lose that the best teams, the best drivers, the best strategies win the races, because at the moment from the outside it seems that in every race anyone can win.
"They seemed to work but even if we are happy now with the position and with the points we achieved, we still know and are honest with ourselves knowing that we are not quick enough at the moment still.
Formula One is dominated by aerodynamics and we had some areas of the car that were not working exactly as they were designed, so we did some tweaks there," he said.
But as I said it's not enough, we know that and we will keep doing upgrades to the car."
"But he has the talent, he has full support from our bosses, from me, from everybody in the team and we know the talent from Felipe.
Every year in Ferrari it is like this," Alonso said.
I think we will be there.
I don't know if we will be champions but we will fight until the last race, I am sure."
