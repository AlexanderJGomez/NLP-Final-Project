Such cooperation sounds unthinkable.
Only the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and its al Qaeda backers would want that, it seems.
Shiite majority Iran seeks to protect Shia interests and power in Iraq, while the United States wants to see a stable Iraq after pulling its troops out of the country in 2011 to end its eight-year campaign that began by toppling Saddam Hussein from power.
Then, the United States and Iran held "very brief discussions" about Iraq and the threat posed by ISIS on the sidelines of nuclear negotiations in Vienna, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said.
Even a conservative member of Congress who once advocated military strikes on Iran said Washington may need Tehran's help.
Whether the United States likes it or not, working with Iran on the Iraq crisis might be a necessary evil, retired Maj. Gen. James "Spider" Marks said.
House Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday that the United States should "absolutely not" talk to Iranians about the  Iraq crisis.
A senior security official in Baghdad said Iran has already sent about 500 Revolutionary Guard troops to help fight the ISIS militants.
"If we start flying airplanes, it makes some sense to talk to the Iranians about what we're doing so they don't shoot us down and we don't bomb them," he said.
