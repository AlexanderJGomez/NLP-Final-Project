(CNN)Marco Rubio is all in.
And unless he can offer new ideas, his climb to the Republican nomination will be steep.
Meanwhile, both the Deferred Action program and President Obama's executive action on immigration are overwhelmingly favored by Hispanics.
But when it comes to Cuba policy, Rubio himself seems firmly stuck in the past.
Immigration and Cuba policy aside, Rubio's political philosophy will be a tough sell to Hispanics.
And though Rubio doubts that climate change is caused by humans, The New York Times has noted that Latinos view global warming as a problem and favor government action on the issue.
Consider that his fellow contender for the GOP presidential nomination, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, has been willing to present new ideas to the Republican base, such as reforming the criminal justice system and legalizing medical marijuana.
By comparison, Rubio seems cautious and ill-suited to the task of rousing Republican voters.
