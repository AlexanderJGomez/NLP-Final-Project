(CNN) -- When I moved back home, I knew what I was in for.
According to a recent Pew poll, 39% of 18- to 34-year-olds are living with their parents or have moved back in with their parents temporarily because of the sluggish economy.
Moving back home has not been easy to swallow.
After spending my adolescence stressing out over AP classes and college admissions, then dealing with the rigors of university course work, I doffed my graduation cap only to find that somewhere along the line a good education stopped being the finish line.
With extra time on my hands, I also began to intern at R&B Records, a nearby music store.
Most of my friends are pursuing internships or graduate study.
And still, we wonder: Will this be enough?
While my friends and I have enjoyed our experiences, the current job market has brought a feeling of uncertainty, which has been unsettling.
I would say that my friends are all more enriched individuals.
My mother and I are both excited.
I'm thrilled that soon I'll get to make a room of my own.
