"These are isolated incidents of misconduct and we're working every day to correct our behavior," Pierson told reporters Tuesday after leaving a closed meeting with top senators on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.
Chairman Tom Carper of Delaware said just a "handful" of Secret Service members are "shaming and smearing" the agency, which employs thousands of people.
"I have made clear to the entire workforce that I will not tolerate unprofessional behavior or misconduct at any level -- both on and off duty," Pierson told the senators, according to prepared remarks released by the Secret Service.
Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, the top Republican on the committee, told CNN the senators outlined in the meeting suggestions to the agency to deal with problem but he wouldn't say what those suggestions were.
