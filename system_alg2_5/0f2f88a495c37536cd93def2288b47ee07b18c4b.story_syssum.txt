(CNN) -- The U.S. government claims he's the mastermind of a huge online fraud operation with multiple identities and a history of breaking the law and evading arrest, but his lawyer says he's a law-abiding entrepreneur committed to raising his young family in New Zealand.
Dotcom holds one German passport, under the name of Kim Schmitz, and two Finnish passports, under the names of Kim Tim Jim Vestor and Kim Dotcom.
His lawyers have countered that Dotcom thought the Finnish passport under the name of Kim Tim Jim Vestor had been canceled, and that the reason he had 25 credit cards in his possession at the time of his arrest was that he is a "collector" of credit cards.
The judge also expressed concern about the existence of a firearm found near Dotcom at the time of his arrest last week.
It was also disclosed in court that Dotcom suffers from diabetes and hypertension.
He has also been receiving treatment for a slipped disc.
