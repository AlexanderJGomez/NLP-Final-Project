(CNN) -- I rarely get to experience fine dining.
Most people don't know that.
And it's partly because people leave their kids at home.
This particular fine dining incident all started when the couple brought their 8-month-old baby into one of Chicago's swankiest restaurants, Alinea, which has the incredibly rare distinction of being awarded three stars by a renowned tire company.
The head chef of Alinea, Grant Achatz, later took to Twitter after diners began complaining when the aforementioned 8-month-old baby starting crying.
Tll ppl no kids?
"OK, Snickers.
I do.
So, yes, I understand that I don't understand what it's like to have children.

And in response to the pop-up Twitter account for @AlineaBaby, he tweeted a photo of two giant fish heads and wrote: Definitely not baby food...
