James McClamrock returned late Thursday to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, the most recent deaths of the war in Iraq.
Ironically, Jenkins and McClamrock were killed by an Iraqi soldier.
Al-Askari said Rahman got into a fight with U.S. soldiers, and then pulled his weapon and fired on them before he was fatally shot.
The bodies of Jenkins and McClamrock arrived at Dover on a cool, clear night, along with the bodies of two Marines killed in Afghanistan.
