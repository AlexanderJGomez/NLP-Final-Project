(CNN) -- The winner of the 82nd annual Scripps National Spelling Bee said Friday she is "pretty excited" but a little tired.
In an event that has seen contestants crack under the strain of the national spotlight, Kavya -- competing in her fourth national finals -- appeared composed throughout.
Kavya said she would miss competing in the spelling bee, as the rules do not permit her to enter next year.
"If my [little] sister gets to D.C. sometime soon, I'd really love to help and coach her," she said.
