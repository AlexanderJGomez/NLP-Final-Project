(CNN) -- Six inches of snow in Chicago.
Many drought-stricken states need a foot of rain, not snow.
"All of the snow that has fallen over the winter by and large remains on top of the landscape," said Minnesota's state climatologist Greg Spoden.
Comparatively, Minnesota doesn't have it that bad, according to U.S. Drought Monitor.
But the state is still plagued by "severe," "extreme" and "exceptional" drought, U.S. Drought Monitor said.
At the same time, the storms that sweep the United States should grow more intense, said meteorologist Marshall Shepherd from the University of Georgia.
Snowfall has bolstered water levels on the Mississippi River, which had dropped due to drought, said Ann McCulloch, spokeswoman for American Waterways Operators.
But by the time the storm gets there, it could turn to rain.
In the parched Plains states, snow hasn't helped enough.
