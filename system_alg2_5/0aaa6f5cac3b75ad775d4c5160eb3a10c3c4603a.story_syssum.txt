WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The servers hosting the Web sites of the House of Representatives and its members have been overwhelmed with millions of e-mails in the past few days, forcing administrators to implement the "digital version of a traffic cop" to handle the overload.
As millions of people tried to look at the details of the bailout plan, the House.gov system became overwhelmed and many people saw notices on their computer screens saying "this page does not appear."
"This was a massive digital busy signal," he said.
We had hoped we didn't have to."
"We monitored the situation all night long, and technicians and engineers saw that we were facing the same demand as yesterday," Ventura said.
Ventura said the House.gov Web site experienced a very high number of hits when the 9/11 commission released its final report on the September 11, 2001, terror attacks against the United States, but nothing like what the site has seen in the past few days.
