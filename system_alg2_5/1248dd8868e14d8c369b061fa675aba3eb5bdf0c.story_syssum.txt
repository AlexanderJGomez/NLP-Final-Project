(CNN) -- As water levels already at or above flood stage continue rising in rivers in southwestern Louisiana, the weather forecast says more rain is on the way.
There were no initial reports of injuries.
The National Weather Service said at least two EF-1 tornadoes struck Thursday, one of which damaged 50 homes in St. Martin Parish.
Much of the region is hilly and not as prone to flooding.
Both have the same root cause, said CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri.
