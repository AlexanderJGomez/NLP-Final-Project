This is according to a new threat report from Lookout Mobile Security.
Cybercriminals aren't simply targeting Android devices more often, they're also getting sneakier about it.
How can mobile malware harm you?
Why is Android a bigger mobile security concern?
Users of Apple and BlackBerry mobile devices are not immune to mobile security threats.
Android users especially are starting to get more discerning."
Kevin Mahaffey, Lookout's CTO and co-founder, explained that spotting malware on mobile devices is a bigger technical challenge than on computers.
Mahaffey notes that if your phone is running an older version of the Android operating system, you face greater mobile security risks.
Unless you've rooted your Android phone to gain complete control over it, it's up to the carrier and manufacturer, not you, when your phone will get a system update.
So some cheaper phones simply are not able to run the latest version of Android well, or at all.
"If your battery suddenly starts draining really fast, consider that it might be malware," Mahaffey said.
