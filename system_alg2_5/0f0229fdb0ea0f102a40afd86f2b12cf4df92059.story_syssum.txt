NEW YORK (CNN) -- A 15-year-old girl with a 500-texts-a-day texting habit thumbed her way to the $50,000 grand prize at the L.G.
Another round quizzed contestants' knowledge of texting acronyms.
Riffing off texters' sometimes dangerous tendency to text while performing other tasks, another round required contestants to complete an obstacle course while firing off difficult-to-type texts.
Faced with a do-or-die situation in the second round, Moore seemed to bet on accuracy over speed, finishing well behind her opponent but winning the round.
Nor does Moore's mother have to foot an appallingly large phone bill each month, because her daughter is on an unlimited texting plan.
Moments after her victory, Moore agreed to an exclusive text message interview with CNN.
