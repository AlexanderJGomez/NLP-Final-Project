(CNN) -- The opening race of the Formula One season, the Bahrain Grand Prix, has been axed due to ongoing political unrest in the country.
The Crown Prince said he was deeply sorry for the deaths in an interview with CNN.
British newspaper The Times reported that it cost Bahrain race organizers $40 million to secure a place in this year's calendar, plus another $20 million to ensure it was the first of the season.
He said: "The recent situation in Bahrain has been difficult for the country.
We feel the decision taken by the Crown Prince is wise and we fully support it.
