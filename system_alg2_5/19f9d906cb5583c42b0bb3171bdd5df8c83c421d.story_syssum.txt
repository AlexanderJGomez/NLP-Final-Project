(CNN) -- Gun control supporting candidates facing tight races for governor in Connecticut and Maryland are the beneficiaries of a last-minute ad buy from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
"The NRA praises Tom Foley, calling him pro-gun," a voice in a new Connecticut ad says.
Loeser said these ad buys represent an attempt to make sure gun control stays on the agenda in these states.
The group has plans to spend $1.7 million in the state in its support for Malloy, who signed a gun control law in 2013 which expanded background checks and banned sales of some weapons like the AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, which was used in the Sandy Hook massacre.
In Maryland, Brown holds a substantial lead over his opponent, Republican Larry Hogan.
"We take these elections one at a time," Loeser said.
