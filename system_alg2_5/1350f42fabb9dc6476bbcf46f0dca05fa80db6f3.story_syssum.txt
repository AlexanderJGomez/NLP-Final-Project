Copenhagen (CNN)Denmark was on edge Tuesday, as it emerged that the suspected gunman in the weekend terror attacks in Copenhagen apparently swore allegiance to ISIS' leader, and armed police responded to a bomb scare at the scene of one of the shootings.
The gunman opened fire at a free-speech forum at the cafe before shooting several people outside a synagogue, and then firing at police.
While police haven't formally released the name of the gunman, they said he was a 22-year-old man born in Denmark.
Charges have been filed against two men who are accused of helping to hide the gunman, the men's attorney said Monday.
We will stand together and continue the everyday life we know.
He escaped unharmed and told CNN on Monday he has gone into hiding.
The Jewish Society of Denmark identified the deceased as Dan Uzan, 37.
CNN's Karl Penhaul and Dominique Van Heerden in Copenhagen contributed to this report, as did CNN's Ralph Ellis, Holly Yan and Hamdi Alkhshali.
