Etan Patz, who disappeared in 1979, was the first missing child featured in the milk carton campaigns of the 1980s.
Etan, like any 6-year-old, argued that all of his friends walked to the bus stop alone, and his parents relented.
When no one had seen Etan, she called police and filed a missing person's report.
Etan's case was the first of the milk carton campaigns of the mid-1980s.
They noticed that they looked a lot like Etan Patz, according to author Lisa R Cohen's book about the case, "After Etan: The Missing Child Case that Held America Captive."
GraBois said he learned in 1988 that Ramos had  been arrested and convicted of child molestation and was serving time in a Pennsylvania prison.
"Etan did not have an aunt in Washington Heights,"  GraBois said.
GraBois said he had Ramos transferred to a federal prison, and planted informants as his cell mates.
Anyone with information on the whereabouts of Etan Patz or that leads to the arrest and conviction of the individual responsible for his disappearance is asked to call the FBI/NYPD Etan Patz hotline: 212-384-2200.
