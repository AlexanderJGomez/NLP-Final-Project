They were joined in the last 16 by Manchester City, who thrashed CSKA Moscow 5-2 to remain in second place in the same group with nine points.
It was the sixth successive time Bayern have made it to the last 16, while City were making it for the first time after two previous attempts.
City's neighbors Manchester United stayed top of Group A after a goalless draw at Real Sociedad, but had Marouaune Fellaini sent off in the second half.
Galatasaray must also next travel to Real, who are all but mathematically assured of their place in the knockout stages.
Paris Saint Germain must also wait to progress from Group C and needed Zlatan Ibrahimovic's equalizer to secure a 1-1 home draw against Anderlecht.
