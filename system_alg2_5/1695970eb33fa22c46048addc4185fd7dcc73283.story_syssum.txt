Washington (CNN)The U.S. said Tuesday that deploying warships to Yemen to monitor nearby Iranian vessels has given America "options" for how it could react to Iran's behavior in the region.
But it would be an extraordinary step and certainly not a foregone conclusion that the U.S. would attempt to board an Iranian ship if it entered Yemeni waters, U.S. officials said.
The Obama administration and U.S. defense officials maintain the primary purpose of positioning additional U.S. warships in the region is to ensure the free flow of commerce through established international shipping lanes and to ensure maritime security in the region.
This official stressed that the repositioning of U.S. ships in the region was taken in order to assure the freedom of navigation through established international shipping lanes and ensuring maritime security and not to interdict Iranian ships.
"The United States alongside the international community, including the United Nations, is serious about the Iranians not providing weapons to the Houthis," White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Tuesday.
U.S. warships from the carrier group of the Roosevelt are joining allied vessels from Saudi Arabia, Egypt and other partner nations prepared to intercept a convoy of seven to nine Iranian vessels believed headed for Yemen.
U.S. ships do not have authority to forcibly board Iranian-flagged ships.
The U.S. warships come to a region seeing a good deal of U.S. military activity.
"It was very obvious to many of us that this did not have to happen," McCain said.
It is a symptom of our failure throughout the Middle East."
