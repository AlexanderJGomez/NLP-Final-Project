Erika Murray was arraigned September 12 on a bevy of charges stemming from the discovery of the dead infants at her home the day before, but she has not been charged in their deaths.
Rivera also "presumably" did not know about the ones that had died, at least according to the account Murray has told authorities, Halpern said.
"It's a mystery to me how he could have failed to realize that there were two children living under the same roof as him, and he didn't know about it."
Why?
The state's removal of the four living children at the home last month was the result of the filing of what's called a 51A report in Massachusetts, according to Alec Loftus, a spokesman for the state's office of Health and Human Services.
This was not the first time a 51A had been filed when it came to that home, according to a Massachusetts Department of Children and Families spokeswoman.
"Our investigation will continue for quite some time," said Joseph Early, the Worcester County District Attorney.
