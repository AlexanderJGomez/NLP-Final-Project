BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Their faces and darker skins make them look different.
"We told our people, Inshalla, God willing, Obama is going to win, and if he wins, it will be a victory for all black people in the world," he recalls.
When news broke that Obama had won the election, it was early in the morning of November 5 in Basra -- but Thijeel excitedly called a fellow member of his political party.
Many Iraqis still call blacks "abed," an Arabic word that means "slave."
In Basra, many black Iraqis have menial jobs.
Foremost is that the government recognize blacks as an official minority in Iraq.
The movement also wants laws to combat racial discrimination.
But Thijeel, quoting Barack Obama, says it's time for change.
