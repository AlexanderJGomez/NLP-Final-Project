In another of the group's songs entitled "Nefsy Afagar" ("I Want To Explode") Eid sings: "A new order, just like the old one.
"We have many fans that will get very angry if we didn't release these songs," says Eid, who claims the band speaks the mind of many Egyptians.
Sitting at the makeshift studio within Eid's family apartment in which the band recorded most of their songs for the past 10 years, they insist they are not political.
"The revolution is not politics.
We didn't sing about politics, but we sing about basic human rights," says Eid.
(We) work very slowly, but we never go back... Look at the past three years, regimes changed and we continued the revolution," says Eid.
