Tesla unveils its Model S sedan, with a base price of $57,400.
That's less than half the price of its first model, the Roadster.
The promise of a high-performance, all-electric vehicle became a reality with the startup's first model, the Tesla Roadster, a car with the look, speed and price tag -- a steep $109,000 and up -- that rivals other high-end, high-performance vehicles.
That would make it more of a mass-market vehicle than the Roadster; only 1,200 of which are produced yearly.
