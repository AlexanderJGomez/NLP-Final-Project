(CNN) -- A shark attack Friday killed a 19-year-old college student off a beach on Vandenberg Air Force Base, said authorities in Santa Barbara County, California.
Surf Beach is one of three that sit on the coastal military base, and officials closed all three beaches at 9:46 a.m. Pacific (12:46 p.m.
ET), shortly after the shark attack, an air base spokesman said.
The Santa Barbara County Parks Department is posting warning signs at beaches in the Jalama and Guadalupe beach areas, authorities said.
