New York (CNN) -- In her "uniform" of a crisp, classic white shirt, Carolina Herrera exudes the kind of elegance and easy grace that has defined her fashion label for more than 30 years.
Here, Herrera speaks exclusively to CNN about style, business, family and getting ahead in a man's world.
(Fashion is) a very difficult business, as you know, because fashion is a business.
If you ask me to take care of that side, I would be sitting there crying because I don't know what to do.
On style ...
We women manage to do many things at the same time.
Men do one thing at a time.

I think women in Carolina Herrera ...
Sometimes you see women that don't realize that age is changing your style, and they don't change.
The white shirt is one of the easiest things to wear, because you can dress it up or you can wear it with jeans or you can wear it with a ball gown.
When I don't know what to wear, I say a white blouse.
The inspiration comes from things that you have seen all your life.
It's the way you put it together that makes it modern ...
I believe that you have to treat the people who work with you like your family.
You have to have perseverance.
