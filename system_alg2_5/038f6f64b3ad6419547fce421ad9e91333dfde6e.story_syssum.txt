Well, here's your chance to add some prehistoric chic to your urban warehouse conversion.
"Misty" is the first complete skeleton of a large dinosaur to come up for sale at auction in Europe, but she hails from the U.S. state of Wyoming.
She was named Misty, Fuller said, after the site itself was branded the "mysterious quarry" because it had gone from being an area of which not much had been expected to one of great potential.
It would take two or three people about a day to take it down and another to put it up again and Summers Place could arrange supervision of this, Fuller said.
That said, Misty in her entirety is "colossal," Fuller says.
"If I was a rich man, I could actually have a fossil dinosaur... that would impress my friends much more than a Ferrari and it would cost me just a fraction of Â£18 million," he said.
Evolution will open for viewing on November 23, ahead of the November 27 auction.
