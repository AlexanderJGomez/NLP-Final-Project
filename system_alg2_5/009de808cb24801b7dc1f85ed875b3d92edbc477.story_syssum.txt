And more than half of those attacks were carried out by suspected Somali pirates, an international maritime watchdog group said Wednesday.
Of the incidents this year, Somali pirates accounted for 54 percent: they launched 168 attacks.
But because of the presence of naval vessels, the success rate of the pirates have decreased," Mody said.
They don night-vision goggles, carry rocket launchers and navigate with global positioning devices.
Those who have tracked pirate activity say it started in Somalia in the 1980s, when the pirates claimed they were aiming to stop the rampant illegal fishing and dumping that continues to this day off the Somali coast.
With the ransoms they collect, pirates can earn up to $40,000 a year, analysts say.
But at the same time, from the owner's point of view, there is no other way currently to secure the safe release of the vessel along with the crew and the cargo," Mody said.
