Hong Kong (CNN) -- Featuring everything from hand-painted heels to a live (and semi-naked) woman, Hong Kong's latest art fair wrapped Sunday with sales topping HK$39 million ($5 million) -- up 50% on last year's inaugural event.
Organizers say it's up to the artists and galleries to set a price for each artwork, as long as it does not exceed HK$100,000 (roughly $13,000).
Organizers of Affordable Art Fair say price is just a small part of their mission.
"People are very intimidated by the idea of going to galleries and each city we go to we help to break down those perceived barriers and get people understanding that there's art out there that they can afford -- and that art can be for everyone," he adds.
