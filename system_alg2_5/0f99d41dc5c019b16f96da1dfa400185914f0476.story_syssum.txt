Farmer John Carillo says he was turned down for a USDA loan because of discrimination.
The class could have included 20,000 farmers, the government said in court.
The Justice Department also is not interested in settling the case, government attorney Lisa Ann Olson told a federal district court judge in an August hearing.
The farmers also point out that former Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman testified before Congress in 1997 that the USDA had a long history of discrimination.
It's all gone now.
