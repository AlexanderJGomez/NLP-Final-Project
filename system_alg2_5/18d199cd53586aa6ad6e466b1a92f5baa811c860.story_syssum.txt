The pet supplement market has grown into a $1.3 billion business.
Pendleton caught on to pet supplements a few years ago when she noticed that her 13-year-old cat, Sierra, wasn't up to her usual antics.
Now, Pendleton is a believer in pet supplements.
The pet supplement market has grown about 15 percent annually since 2000 and is now a $1.3 billion business, according to the National Animal Supplement Council.
