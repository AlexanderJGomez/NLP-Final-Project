The ruling that Kerviel must pay â‚¬4.9 billion (about $6.3 billion) in damages to the bank, Societe Generale, was also upheld.
The bank was pleased with the original conviction because it placed responsibility for the rogue trades on Kerviel and not the bank.
Kerviel had pleaded guilty to the charge of computer abuse, but his attorney at the time, Olivier Metzner, had asked jurors in his closing arguments to acquit his client of the charges of breach of trust and forgery.
Metzner filed the appeal against the sentence, but Kerviel switched to Koubbi as his attorney in March this year.
