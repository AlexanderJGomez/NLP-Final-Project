In 2004, I traveled to North Korea to see the country, even though many people warned me not to take the risk.
On Monday, three American citizens, Kenneth Bae, Matthew Todd Miller and Jeffrey Edward Fowle, all held captive in North Korea, were interviewed by CNN in a Pyongyang hotel room.
After I watched the interviews with the three Americans, it was clear that it was a coordinated message to ask for a high-level U.S. envoy to be sent.
Many North Korean refugees we sheltered in China told us how brutal the regime can be.
North Korea has played this game before.
People are hacking their radios to receive signals from the outside world.
North Korea wants control.
In the world, it has neither.
