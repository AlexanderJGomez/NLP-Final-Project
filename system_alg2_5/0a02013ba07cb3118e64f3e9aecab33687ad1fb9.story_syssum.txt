This music even has the ability to make us like our old Aunt Emily.
In 1843, Charles Dickens gave us "A Christmas Carol."
Then there's one that the marketers made sure really goes for the heart -- "I'll Be Home for Christmas" -- and the line, "if only in my dreams."
(Even if we never really liked her -- but then, it's Christmas.)
Let it Snow!
Of course, Christmas is children.
Then there are Jimmy Boyd's "All I Want For Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth", The Singing Dogs version of "Jingle Bells" and Homer and Jethro's "Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer."
Somebody please explain why anybody would buy that song.
I realized a while ago that indeed we all need a little Christmas.
So deck the halls and please stop leaving Santa those fattening chocolate chip cookies -- he's gained a lot of weight during the past 200-plus years.
