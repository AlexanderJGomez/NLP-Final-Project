Reputation is co-created by individuals having experiences.
Search Yelp reviews and see what people who have already dined at a place have to say about it.
For Airbnb hosts and Uber and Lyft drivers, positive ratings are paramount to their success.
Even though these reputation systems have been created for the specific company -- imagine how powerful it would be to have your reputation in one place.
While we will create reputation on individual platforms, there will be an increasing demand for fluid exchange of reputation and ratings from one system to another.
We may even see reputation system APIs developed to enable the transfer of your reputation to new platforms.
We'll see more of personal reputation integrated in person-to-person transactions, which will enable deeper transactions in the resource sharing economy.
This is an excerpt of a report on reputation currencies, written by Heather Schlegel and commissioned by the Institute of Customer Experience.
