NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN)  -- Former Sen. John Edwards dropped out of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination Wednesday, leaving his voters up for grabs.
Edwards, who had collected 26 delegates, did not plan to endorse Clinton or Obama yet, but he may do so in the future, an aide said.
You could also make the argument that there's a lot of support out there amongst people that will go to Hillary," he said.
Edwards announced he was dropping out Wednesday afternoon in New Orleans, the same city where he declared his run for the 2008 Democratic presidential race.
Campaign money was not an issue, the aide said.
Clinton called Edwards a champion of the American people.
"John Edwards ended his campaign today in the same way he started it -- by standing with the people who are too often left behind and nearly always left out of our national debate," Clinton said in a statement.
One Edwards aide said he is not dropping out of the race because of his wife's health.
