(CNN) -- Much of the country has turned up the heat during the deep freeze this week, but for some, the icy chill is on its way out.
An Arctic air mass over the Plains will cause severe wind chills through Saturday morning, the National Weather Service reported.
The citrus growing regions in Florida and Texas will have to keep an eye on their crops as the cold air remains in the area, Meyers said.
Flakes are expected Saturday and may fall in the coming days on a swath of land ranging from British Columbia to the northern Sierras of California, Meyers said.
The most snow -- about 10 feet -- is expected to fall in Canada's Whistler Blackcomb, the venue for the Olympic Alpine skiing event.
