Jakes says the church must sound the alarm to wake America from its slumber.
However, its relevance and vision must go beyond its community and reach the world for which Christ died.
I personally wish the distinctions of the church by ethnicity would one day become an antiquated idea.
The church I have read about in the media -- a church filled with divisiveness, a lack of tolerance for other ethnic groups, a church not focused on helping the downtrodden and less fortunate, a church filled with hostility -- does not remotely resemble the churches that I grew up around and have loved for more than 50 years.
The predominantly African-American church may be founded by an African American, it may be led on Sunday by an African American, but as you look through the crowd of these beacons of hope and faith, you will see an increasing audience that is much more reflective of our world than many would have you to believe.
Gradually race fades into the fabric of faith and becomes less central to the overarching core of human needs in general.
But the core message is not one that enrages, but one that encourages people to change and grow, and any other depiction is distorted and inaccurate.
As a child, I grew up in a neighborhood back in West Virginia where blacks and whites helped each other in times of need and despair.
I am wondering who will get the message that our nation's citizens are by and large looking for a voice that will unite us, clothe our naked, feed the poor and help our diminishing middle class before we self-destruct like many great empires of the past.
To be sure, there is still work to do to defeat racism and to attain justice in our country for all.
The tare of a hate-filled church image is a tactical distraction planted to divert our attention from choosing our next president.
My hope is that the church remains a vibrant part of our process, sounding the alarm that warns: America, please wake up out of our sleep!
