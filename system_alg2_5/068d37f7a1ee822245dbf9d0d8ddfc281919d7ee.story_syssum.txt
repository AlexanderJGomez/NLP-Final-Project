Capable of soaring leaps and flawless turns, Tetsuya "Teddy" Kumakawa has thrilled audiences the world over.
Meister encouraged him to travel and recommended that he attend the Royal Ballet School (RBS) in London or the Canadian National Ballet School.
In June he won the Classical Ballet Prize at the Eurovision Young Dancer of the Year competition held in Paris.
He quickly became a Soloist, dancing the Act 1 pas de trois in Tchaikovsky's 'Swan Lake' and completed a memorable performance as the Bronze Idol in La Bayad√®re -- a cameo role that showcased his extraordinary jumping ability.
In 1998 he left the Royal Ballet to found his own company -- the K-Ballet -- back home in Tokyo.
In 2004, Kumakawa established the K-Ballet School.
In the meantime, Kumakawa -- who continues to enjoy pop star status in Japan -- continues to pass on his expertise to a new generation of dancers.
