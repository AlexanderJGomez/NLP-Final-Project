Resources on A Platform for Good can help guide conversations with teens about their digital reputation.
Parents "should encourage their kids to be up-standers and not bystanders when they see something as negative as what was happening to Jada," Balkam said.
"Yes, I feel like a heroine, because it takes courage to speak out and show your face, " she said.
