The plea deal may include prison time, but the NFL has not yet decided what football sanctions, if any, it should impose on Vick, a spokesman said.
For anyone thinking he should be let off easy for admitting his guilt -- think again.
Patricia Reese of Paola, Kansas Yes, I think Mr. Vick should be allowed to play football again.
Debbie Clayton of Greensboro, North Carolina He should never be allowed to play [in the] NFL or earn a dime associated with the NFL.
Smoking pot is against the law, but he's been given a number of chances, and STILL isn't banned from the NFL!
Josh Hebert of Loganville, Georgia He should take whatever punishment our government gives him, but when he has done his time (if he does do time) he should be able to continue playing football.
Kelly Koch of Holland, Michigan The NFL and all sponsors should refrain from any future contact with Michael Vick.
Unless we make a policy that all players who are convicted of a felony are banned from the league, then Vick should be allowed to play after a suspension.
Playing in the NFL is not a right.
Not by his fame, nor his race.
Lance G. of Dearborn Heights, Michigan First off, I am an African-American ... this is NOT a race issue.
Leah Perry of Chelmsford, Massachusetts I don't think Vick should be allowed to play football, nor should he get off easy.
I do not think he should be banned for life.
Kids looked up to him and how many of them will think that abuse is OK now?
Debbie Connor of Whitesville, Kentucky No, he should not be granted the right to play pro football again!
He's through.
John Brandon of Old Hickory, Tennessee To make a long story short -- my family will never watch a game with Michael Vick in attendance.
