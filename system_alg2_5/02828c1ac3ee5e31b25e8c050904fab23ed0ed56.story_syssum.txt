(CNN) -- A federal judge Friday ruled in favor of a former UCLA college basketball star who sued to end the NCAA's control over the rights to college athletes' names, images and likenesses.
"Before the court in this case is only whether the NCAA violates antitrust law by agreeing with its member schools to restrain their ability to compensate Division I men's basketball and FBS football players any more than the current association rules allow," Wilken wrote.
NCAA chief legal officer Donald Remy said: "We disagree with the court's decision that NCAA rules violate antitrust laws.
"The ruling says the NCAA was operating illegally and college athletes do have rights," said Huma, who helped find players to join the case.
The judge wrote that the injunction will not affect student-athletes who enroll in college before July 1, 2016.
When athletes commit to a university, players are required to sign a waiver that relinquishes their right to their own likenesses in every form.
Instead, Texas A&M will sell the number 12 jersey, in keeping with its 12th man tradition; and Arizona will sell jerseys with numbers that correspond to the year of competition -- 14 for this year, according to a school spokesman.
The NCAA's argument in both the ongoing O'Bannon suit and another one filed by former quarterback Sam Keller, also in federal court in Oakland, is that it is trying to protect the amateur model of college sports.
