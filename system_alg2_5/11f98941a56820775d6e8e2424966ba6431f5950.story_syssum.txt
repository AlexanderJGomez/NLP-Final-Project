Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN) -- Just taking a sip of water or walking to the bathroom is excruciatingly painful for 15-year-old Michael Brewer, who was burned over 65 percent of his body after being set on fire, allegedly by a group of teenagers.
The teen faces a lifelong recovery from his injuries, Schulman told CNN's Harris.
Physical therapy, she said, is "incredibly painful.
They give him painkillers for that, but it's incredibly painful and it breaks my heart every time they have to do it.
Police were able to interview Brewer on Monday for the first time since the incident.
Difficult for us to listen to," she said of the interview.
Bent allegedly encouraged the attack, police said.
He has not been interviewed by police or prosecutors, Schneider said.
He described his client was a good friend of Brewer, and said the boy is troubled by Brewer's injuries as well as by his brother facing criminal charges that could land him in an adult prison if convicted.
We don't need any negative energy coming into the recovery so we just stay away from it, period.
Her son's recovery has been filled with ups and downs, she said.
