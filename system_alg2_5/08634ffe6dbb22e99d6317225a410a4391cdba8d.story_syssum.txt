Michael Brewer, who suffered burns over 65 percent of his body, will have his own skin transplanted onto the burned areas of his back and buttocks, said Lorraine Nelson, a spokeswoman at the University of Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center.
Prosecutors say the three boys were in a gang that poured alcohol over Brewer, then set him ablaze in a dispute over $40, a video game and a bicycle.
Detectives say eyewitnesses told them that Mendez used a lighter to set fire to Brewer after Jarvis allegedly poured alcohol over him.
Detectives with the Broward County Sheriff's Office have been unable to interview Brewer.
Doctors say Brewer is improving but his condition is tenuous because of the severity of his burns and the possibility of infections.
"And he'll say, 'Am I going to be OK?'
You're going to be just fine,' " she said.
They'll get theirs is all we can say.
A court-appointed psychologist who has examined two of the five boys allegedly involved in the attack told CNN they are competent to take part in legal proceedings and assist their attorney.
Psychologists also must evaluate whether the defendants can talk about what happened and communicate effectively with defense attorneys.
