Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN) -- The children keep asking when their mother is coming home.
He was her first boyfriend.
An 18-year Malaysia Airlines veteran, she loved to fly around the world.
While many of the passengers' families are staying together in hotels, Lee remains at his home waiting for information about the missing flight.
"The airline management only call us or have some briefing with us, you know, and then they tell us the same thing again as what the press conference told," he complained.
Lee wants the truth about what happened to MH370.
Most of all he wants his wife to come home.
