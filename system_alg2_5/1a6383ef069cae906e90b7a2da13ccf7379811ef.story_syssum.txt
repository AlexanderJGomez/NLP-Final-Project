The court's 5-4 ruling threw out congressionally mandated limits on the total one can give to all federal candidates in an election cycle.
"It has been on a slow but steady march towards deregulation, towards saying that restrictions on your spending money -- say, in expenditures or in contributions to candidates -- that is a free speech right."
"Because individuals' direct contributions are limited, would-be donors may turn to other avenues for political speech" than direct contributions to office-seekers, said Roberts.
"The government may no more restrict how many candidates or causes a donor may support than it may tell a newspaper how many candidates it may endorse," he said.
McCutcheon says he has a constitutional right to donate more than that amount to as many office seekers as he wants, so long as no one candidate gets more than the $2,600 per election limit.
"The reason we have limitations on the dollars an individual can give is to create some sense of fairness, so that if we do have a campaign finance system driven by donations, we have as many opportunities for as many people as possible to participate," said Robert Zimmerman, a prominent Democratic fundraiser.
That and a subsequent decision from a federal appeals court in Washington have led to a proliferation of so-called "super PACs"-- separate political action committees that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of cash from businesses, unions, and advocacy groups.
Limits on direct contributions to candidates by corporations and individuals remain in place, the focus in part of the current McCutcheon appeal.
Regular PACs may also give limited donations to federal candidates and political parties, while super PACs cannot.
But the Supreme Court has never in its history overturned a federal contribution limit.
And political parties certainly will have more money to spend.
The case is McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission (12-536).
