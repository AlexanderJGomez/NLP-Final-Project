Los Angeles (CNN) -- Zsa Zsa Gabor's Bel Air mansion, which offers an expansive -- and expensive -- view of Los Angeles, officially hits the real estate market for sale Tuesday, according to the realtor who is listing the property.
Gabor moved into the home about 35 years ago, about 10 years before she married von Anhalt, who is her ninth husband.
Maintaining the large house and paying for its staff, including nurses for his wife, cost about $35,000 a month, he said.
Hilton, who has not been allowed by von Anhalt to see her mother in several months, said Gabor would never want to leave her house for a condo.
