Dakar, Senegal (CNN) -- A colorful platter steams with heat, rising from seasoned fish and an assortment of fresh vegetables all on a plush bed of rice.
These traditional boats are hand painted and crafted by teams of men working in this busy fishing community.
Young boys run up to the boats, placing rollers underneath as the men hand off large coolers of fresh fish, proceeding to push the boat inland.
The entire process happens in two waves each and every day, each family member with their own essential role.
The key is to only use the best, freshest vegetables; because they will become a stuffing for the fish.
Once we return to N'Dour's seaside restaurant, he hands me a deep wooden pot with a long, rounded, wooden handle.
I push them in each chuck of fish.
The appearance may look quite messy but as I've learned in Dakar looks can be deceiving.
