On Thursday, workers in Indiana and Kentucky finished sliding a new nearly half-mile-long, 30 million-pound bridge from one set of piers to another, making it the "longest bridge in North America -- and perhaps the world" -- to slide laterally into place, according to the Indiana Department of Transportation.
Bridge geeks call this a steel truss bridge.
The old Milton-Madison Bridge was only one of more than a half-million aging bridges nationwide.
About 25% of them are classified as deficient, according to a 2013 report by the Federal Highway Administration.
