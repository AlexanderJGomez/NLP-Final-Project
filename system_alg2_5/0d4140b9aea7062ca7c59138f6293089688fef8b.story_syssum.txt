That's when it kind of hit me that there was no place for women to go for a great blowout in a great space.
With over 2,000 stylists I can't do it myself anymore but I train a team that does it so I'll do a lot of demos for them too, which I love, to get my hands back in hair because I have such a strong passion for hair.
W: We have so many, like "life is too short to be somewhere lame," "pretty is as pretty does," I heard that my whole life growing up.
I like to pop in unannounced and make sure everything is running smoothly but it just kind of depends on the day.
I do work in the office a lot too because we have so much going on there but I really try to get out in the field and make surprise visits just so I can see what's going on, stay connected, get a blowout, whatever.
Women really get into it, a lot of chatter on Instagram about you know, what style did you get?
