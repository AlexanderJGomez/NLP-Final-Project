The arrests came ahead of Saturday night's Eurovision Song Contest, which is being held in Moscow.
The contest has a strong following among the gay and lesbian community.
We are defending the often violated human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Russians.
The Eurovision Song Contest, which began in 1956, sees singers and groups from a short list of European nations perform a specially written song before telephone votes from each nation decide the winner.
In recent years, however, eastern European nations, which take the contest much more seriously, have come to dominate.
The organizers of the contest estimate it is watched by 100 million people worldwide.
