Two goals from Steven Gerrard, both from the penalty spot and a Luis Suarez strike, condemned United to defeat and gave yet more credence that Liverpool is a serious title contender.
The Manchester United defense will not have had a harder game than against our strikers today.
Last season, United finished 28 points clear of Liverpool on its way to winning the Premier League title.
On Wednesday, United meets Greek side Olympiakos in the second leg of its last 16 Champions League tie needing to overturn a two-goal deficit to progress.
Liverpool dominated the opening 45 minutes and went ahead when Rafael, already on a yellow card, handled inside the penalty area.
Van Persie sent a header wide of the post as the home side attempted to gain a foothold in the game.
Sturridge attempted a shot from the edge of the penalty area and when the ball was deflected into Suarez's path, the forward coolly slotted the ball home.
"We're going to win the league," sang the Liverpool supporters.
The victory moves Arsenal to within four points of leader Chelsea with a game in hand.
