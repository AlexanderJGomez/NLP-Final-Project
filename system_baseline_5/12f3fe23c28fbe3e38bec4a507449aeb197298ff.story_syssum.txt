On Sunday, Europe inflicted an identical comeback on Davis Love III's Americans as Martin Kaymer held his nerve to hole the most dramatic of putts and ensure a 14 1/2 - 13 1/2 point victory for Jose Maria Olazabal's team.
"When I saw we had a chance this afternoon coming down the stretch, I was very emotional, I started thinking about the possibility of winning.
"Ollie said to us at the start of the week, Ryder Cup is what memories and dreams are made of, and he's been awesome," explained an emotional Poulter.
We were all square.
Big-hitter Dustin Johnson got the first point of the day for the U.S. following a 3&2 win over the equally powerful Nicolas Colsaerts of Belgium.
Rose was trailing going into the 17th, but holed a stunning putt to level before sneaking beyond Mickelson at the last for a 2 up victory.
Germany's Kaymer took a one-shot lead on the 17th and then produced the defining moment of the 39th Ryder Cup -- holing the crucial putt on the last to defeat Steve Stricker and ensure the U.S. could not reach the winning target of 14 1/2 points.
That left Europe on 14 points and Italian Francesco Molinari secured the half point needed to win the cup outright after finishing level with 14-time major winner Tiger Woods.
We had a lot of guys who got beat today, I don't know if they played badly but they didn't win.
