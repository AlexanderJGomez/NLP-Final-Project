San Diego (CNN) -- Some elections are fueled by passion.
GOP officials would like to convince Americans that they have an embarrassment of riches on their hands, but many of us can see that they're only half right.
As recently noted by The Wall Street Journal, a recent Gallup poll of Republicans put support for Romney at 24%, and last month, his level of support floated between 22% and 25%.
Many of those who voted for Barack Obama in 2008 don't seem all that eager to give him an encore.
Just 37% of those surveyed -- Republicans, Democrats and independents --- are certain they want to give Obama another term.
The problem is the same kind of enthusiasm gap that Romney is facing with Republican voters.
According to a new Ipsos-Telemundo poll, the president's support among Latinos continues to plummet.
Add all this up, and this could be an election with one of the lowest turnouts in history -- for Republicans and Democrats.
