People in more than 170 communities -- from Anchorage to Allakaket -- are planning to hold public "Choose Respect" rallies in honor of survivors of sexual and intimate partner violence.
"We have extremely high rates of domestic violence and sexual violence in Alaska," said Katie TePas, a senior policy adviser to the governor.
After spending more than two weeks in Alaska, I published a series of stories about why the rates of sexual violence are so shockingly high there -- and what could be done to change that.
I hope CNN readers will join the state in demanding an end to the violence there and elsewhere.
As for his kind words about the series, CNN shares the credit with the brave people in Alaska who told me their stories -- and with the dozens of readers and viewers who shared their stories of survival in solidarity with Alaskans.
Fifty-nine percent of women in Alaska face intimate partner or sexual violence in their lifetimes, including threats of violence.
They will be with the people of Nunam Iqua, Alaska, which is one of a reported 75 communities that do not have any local law enforcement presence.
The state troopers have told me they're having difficulty finding someone who would take the job in Nunam Iqua.
And, finally, my thoughts will be with Erin Merryn, a victim of child sexual assault from Illinois who, I'm told by a local lawmaker, will be traveling Alaska this week campaigning for a bill that would require state school districts to teach about the warning signs of child sexual abuse.
The bill -- "Erin's Law," which has been passed in ten other states, according to the group's Facebook page -- is expected to come before the Alaska House education committee on Friday.
I don't want to paint Alaska as an awful or isolated place.
Alaska is also a beautiful place full of strong people.
And this week, all of us will get a chance to see them -- and, hopefully, you -- demanding a safer future.
