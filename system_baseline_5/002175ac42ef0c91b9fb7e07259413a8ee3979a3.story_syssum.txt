Qena, Egypt (CNN) -- In a deserted playground a few hundred miles south of Cairo, 13-year-old Asmaa Ashraf fiddles with a broken rusted slide.
"Teachers will show up and we'll be allowed to ask questions.
And as the government struggles to wade through the country's protracted political problems, Egypt's festering education system is orphaned -- even though, with a growing youth population, it's key to the country's future.
Students and teachers seem to be on the verge of exhaustion rather than bursting with inspiration.
To make up for the gaps in education, millions of middle-class Egyptian families spend a large part of their income -- sometimes as much as 25% -- on private tutoring.
"There are too many issues to deal with," said one 32-year-old teacher in Asmaa's village.
Egypt's final secondary school exams are a rite of passage for students.
Also, 70% of young women in Upper Egypt are jobless.
"This is a generation that desperately needs to learn how to critically think, to learn how to be in the 21st century," said Malak Zalouk, director of the Middle East Institute for Higher Education at the American University in Cairo.
However, as Egypt's public education system founders, a few innovative ideas have emerged.
Another innovative initiative is Teach for Egypt, a start-up created by Nada Ramadan, a 24-year-old Egyptian who's a graduate student at Georgetown University in Washington.
Ramadan says she's running into problems, however, while trying to implement her idea.
But until those solutions are offered, Asmaa -- and a whole generation in waiting -- will continue to linger near broken slides, daydreaming about the future.
