(CNN) -- Rapper Heavy D died of a blood clot in his lung and other conditions, a coroner's report revealed Tuesday.
His last album, "Love Opus," was released this year.
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are serious medical conditions that are often undiagnosed, but they are preventable, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
People may recover from having a small clot, but a large one can stop blood from reaching the lungs and is fatal.
