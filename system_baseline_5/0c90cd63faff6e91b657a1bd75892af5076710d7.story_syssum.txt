On Monday, many grisly details of what happened could be presented in a Colorado court at a preliminary hearing for the shooting suspect, James Holmes.
One was that Holmes had colored his hair red and told police he was "the Joker," one of Batman's archenemies, according to a federal law enforcement source with detailed knowledge of the investigation.
Holmes had been a patient of a University of Colorado psychiatrist, according to a court document filed by his lawyers.
The horror Holmes allegedly unleashed inside the movie theater has been better documented, thanks to accounts from survivors and law enforcement sources.
It was a scene "straight out of a horror film," said Chris Ramos, who was inside the theater.
Holmes surrendered without resistance within seven minutes of the first calls from panicked moviegoers reporting the shooting, Aurora Police Chief Dan Oates said.
