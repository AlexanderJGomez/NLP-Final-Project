Woodward, an associate editor of The Washington Post, says in "The War Within: A Secret White House History 2006-2008" that the assassination program, not the 2007 increase in U.S. forces in the war zone known as "the surge," is primarily responsible for the reduction of violence in Iraq.
I mean, the U.S. subcontracted out an assassination program against al Qaeda way back in early 2006.
Then when America put 100,000-plus insurgents on the U.S. government payroll, including members of al Qaeda, that not only took them out of the field, but it also let them run their own assassination programs against the Iranian-backed militias.
Ware: It does work together.
This is your American militia, the counterbalance to the Iranian militias.
