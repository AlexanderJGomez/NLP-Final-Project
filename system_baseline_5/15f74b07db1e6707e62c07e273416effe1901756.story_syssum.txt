Paris (CNN) -- A librarian in northern France made what may be the discovery of his lifetime when he uncovered a rare Shakespeare's First Folio in his library's collection.
"I am not an expert myself on Shakespeare's pieces, so I wanted to have the opinion of an expert," said Cordonnier.
The Saint-Omer library was home to a Shakespeare's First Folio.
The library still plans to make the First Folio part of the Anglo-Saxon exhibition, but it will not be put on display.
The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, with 82 First Folios, has the single largest collection of the books, representing one-third of the world's existing copies.
