Calvert County, Maryland (CNN) -- Getting out of her car, the wife of a furloughed government worker walked toward a small building full of free food.
"These folks (furloughed government employees) don't know how to be poor," said Rev.
And if the government shutdown continues, Hahn said he anticipates his group will continue this sort of offering.
Still, the woman said she is struggling to put food on the table.
"The biggest thing (people are feeling) is fear," said Hahn.
Hahn, who has worked for Chesapeake Church for 20 years, said many of the men and women he saw collect food on Monday were new faces who had never sought their help in the past.
"I would say this to the president and Congress, your job is to solve problems, not to create problems," Hahn said.
