And now during the Biennale contemporary artworks and installations are scattered around the city.
During the Biennale it's hosting a show curated by Germano Celant, one of the leading figures of the 1960s anti-formal art movement Arte Povera.
It's both raw and historical - unlike any other contemporary art space in the world - with ornaments, carvings and rich details.
This art installation, titled "Forever" by Ai Weiwei is part of the exhibition Genius Loci, brought to Venice by the Lisson Gallery.
This exhibition suggests that genius loci 'the special spirit' can be found in the urban space through artworks, materials and forms; a departure from the modernist obsession with functionality.
Behind the church, an exquisitely crafted pavilion has been erected in the garden of the Stanze del Vetro glass museum.
Installed inside a cedar wood fenced garden, the glass pavilion will also be the setting for a traditional tea ceremony, a performance which exemplifies the delicacy in Japanese culture.
