"We want to cover the top of nearly every building in the city with trees," said Melki.
"Even planting just one on each would result in as many trees as there are in New York's Central Park," he said.
They say that as well as making a sizable dent in the level of carbon dioxide in the air, the trees would also create a rooftop canopy, casting shadows on the streets and helping to keep the city cool.
Melki estimates the total cost of the project at $3.5-4 million and is currently lobbying for the Wonder Forest via NGO ReAct and a Facebook page.
"Just imagine: The world's first rooftop garden city."
