The confirmed death toll reached four when Boulder County officials recovered the body of a woman who had been swept away after getting out of her vehicle Thursday, Sheriff Joe Pelle said.
On Friday, National Guard troops using "high-profile" trucks to wade through water were evacuating the entire Boulder County town of Lyons, which had been cut off since the flooding began Wednesday night.
She said, "I just felt like I was trapped.
Four helicopters were being used for rescues in Boulder County Friday, Pelle said.
The sheriff said helicopters also may have to be used indefinitely to deliver food and water to residents along damaged rural roads.
Some people remain stranded in homes there, he said, adding, "How we're going to get them out -- it's going to take a damn long time."
However, he said the break in the rain Friday allowed school buses to begin evacuating students who had been stranded at a school.
John Hickenlooper said.
Some people in Lyons still were awaiting rescue, evacuees said, and some residents had chosen to stay.
Both were saved after traveling two blocks in the water, police said on Twitter.
"All residents are warned to go to higher ground immediately due to the potential for flash flooding along the creek," Boulder's Office of Emergency Management said.
"This is not going to get fixed in a week," he said.
