The network is now negotiating with Leno and its current late-night hosts, Conan O'Brien and Jimmy Fallon, to decide who ends up with which time slot, Gaspin said.
Gaspin said the plan now is for Leno to host a new, half-hour show at 11:35 p.m.
Network spokeswoman Rebecca Marks said last week that Leno performed "exactly as we anticipated on the network."
While NBC appeared to be fine with Leno's numbers, the affiliates "kind of revolted and said we have to have better ratings," Levine said.
"My guess is down the road, they will give back Leno the 'Tonight Show,' leave it on at 11:35 p.m., and Conan will move to Fox," he said.
