Dushanbe, Tajikistan (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton thanked Tajikistan's president Saturday for his country's support of efforts to defeat al-Qaeda and bring security to neighboring Afghanistan.
Several reporters have been arrested in Tajikistan for reporting on corruption or the arrests of religious activists, a senior U.S. State Department official said.
It shares a 1,400-kilometer border with Afghanistan, "large parts of which are quite porous," making the country vulnerable to extremists, a senior state department official said.
Clinton told Karimov that improvements were needed in the area of human rights, the official said.
