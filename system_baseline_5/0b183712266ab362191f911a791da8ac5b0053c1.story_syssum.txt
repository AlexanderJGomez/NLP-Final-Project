JERUSALEM (CNN)  -- Israeli officials are seeking a meeting with Turkey's ambassador to protest a show on Turkish television that reportedly depicts Israeli soldiers murdering Palestinian children.
"Such a series which bears no connection whatsoever to reality, presenting IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers as murderers of innocent children, should not be broadcast even in hostile states -- and certainly not in a state that maintains full diplomatic relations with Israel," Lieberman said.
On Tuesday, a senior U.S. military official said Turkey's decision this week to postpone a NATO war exercise appears to have been a political decision intended to exclude the Israelis.

Alon Liel, Israel's top diplomat in Turkey during the 1980s, said he believes the relations between the two countries are in crisis.
