In a controversy that echoes the ordeal of South African runner Caster Semenya, the 27-year-old is facing accusations about her gender.
Park took to social media to give her side of the story.
"The demand from coaches from six different clubs to test the gender of Park again is double jeopardy.
The mayor of the capital Seoul, Park Won-soon, tweeted: "As the father of a daughter, I will do my best to protect Park Eun-seon's human rights," local media reported.
