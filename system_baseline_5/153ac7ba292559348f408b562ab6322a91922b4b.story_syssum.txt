As evacuees from last year's Fukushima nuclear disaster, Mikio and Hamako lost everything: their home, their jobs, and any hope for the future.
TEPCO, or the Tokyo Electric Power Company, owns the Fukushima nuclear plant.
In a landmark case, Watanabe filed a lawsuit last month against TEPCO, blaming the utility company for his wife's suicide.
Watanabe says his wife's depression happened gradually, after they evacuated out of their home into a cramped temporary housing unit.
Watanabe went to bed with his wife, feeling happier and more comfortable than he had in many weeks.
"The next morning, I woke up early around 4 a.m.
Watanabe continued to weed around his house and went inside to take a shower.
Watanabe says it's strange what you remember in trauma.
This wasn't supposed to happen, says Watanabe.
"We lost everything," he says.
"Watanabe's case is very symbolic," says his attorney Tsugio Hirota.
"I feel an unspeakable rage," says Watanabe.
