Enter the Powerbag, a line of battery-equipped shoulder bags and backpacks made by RFA Brands.
I tested the Powerbag messenger bag for about a month, and I also spent a brief time using the backpack, which is very similar.
The battery is stored in a zippered pocket at the bottom of the bag.
Now I need to charge my shoulder bag, too?
An iPod can be tucked into one zippered pocket while a BlackBerry can go into another, each filling with juice simultaneously.
The cap and charging port located on the side of the bag snapped off a few days after I started testing it, and so from then on, I had to take the battery out and plug the cord in directly whenever I needed to refuel.
The RFA spokesman said this was only an issue with pre-production models, like the one I tested, and that it's been fixed for the bags sold in stores.
The Powerbag, designed by Ful, is stylish as well as useful, making it a good companion for gadgetheads who don't want to advertise their geekiness.
