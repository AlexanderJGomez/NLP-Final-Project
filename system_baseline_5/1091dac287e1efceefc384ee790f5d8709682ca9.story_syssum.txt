Tension was building throughout the game, Eid said, as Port Said fans threw bottles and rocks at players.
Many Al-Ahly fans were trapped in the bleachers during Wednesday's fighting, Eid said, because police did not open gates that would have allowed them to exit the stadium.
Egypt's military deployed two planes to transport the Al-Ahly team, some of its fans and some of the injured back to Cairo, he said.
We will not let this one go," Al-Ahly fan Ahmed Tabaei said.
The head of Egypt's military ruling council declared three days of national mourning, starting Thursday, and said those behind the clashes would be punished.

Such a catastrophic situation is unimaginable and should not happen," Blatter said in a statement.
