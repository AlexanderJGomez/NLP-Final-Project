Most of these cases -- 208, to be specific -- have been linked to Ohio State University in Columbus, the city's health department said.
The outbreak originated in February with a cluster of cases at Ohio State.
Those affected range in age between 4 months and 80 years old, with about 60% being female.
Mumps isn't the only infectious disease outbreak that Ohio is dealing with.
Earlier this week, authorities reported 68 people had come down with measles in the state, part of what is already an 18-year high of measles cases in the United States.
