Washington (CNN) -- In what one member of Congress called "a charade," a couple that showed up at President Obama's first state dinner -- uninvited, the White House claims -- declined to answer questions surrounding the event before a House committee Wednesday.
"The Constitution protects fools," Lungren said.
"I think today's procedure is a charade," Rep. Mark Souder, R-Indiana, said in the hearing, referring to the Salahis' refusal to answer questions.
"Were you there?"
After conferring with his attorney, Salahi said, "Yes, but you didn't offer us any legal protection."
Best said after the hearing the couple received "representations that they relied upon" that they were invited guests.

Tareq Salahi also said the couple has provided phone records, e-mails and other documentary evidence to the committee.
"I don't know what the White House is trying to hide," King said.
"They are Americans," he said.
