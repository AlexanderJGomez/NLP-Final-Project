At the far end of a long driveway lies a colossal complex and one single word that has come to define Anren: museums.
His family and staff also prospered in the 1930s and 40s, enabling them to build 40 connecting mansions in the center of Anren.
Twenty seven mansions survived the turbulent years of revolution and now make up the heart of Anren old town, mostly in the form of hotels or restaurants.
The accessible buildings have now become a major attraction for wedding parties and mansion feasts.
Despite its colourful history, Anren didn't evolve as a museum town until Jianchuan Fan, a real estate developer-turned-collector-and-curator, decided to open a private museum here in 2003.
There are currently 24 exhibition spaces open, covering 100,000 square meters (1.1 million square feet) and housing more than eight million items including historical artefacts, commissioned artworks and reproduced photographs, themed around the Sino-Japanese war, the Mao-era, Chinese culture and the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.
Ticketed exhibits follow themes -- there's the War Series, the Red Series, the Earthquake Series and the Folk Series.
The Earthquake Series and the Folk Series are smaller.
The estates are split into four main areas: the Liu Family Old Manor, Liu Family's Historic Home, Precious Artefacts Gallery and Rent Collection Hall.
The Precious Artefacts Gallery is is now home to the items that once sat in the now mostly bare rooms of the Old Manor.
The Film Museum is free to enter but tickets to movie showings cost RMB$10 ($1.6).
Galleries, mostly displaying traditional art, are free to enter.
