Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- There have been several points in my career as a producer and camera operator where I've realized that I have one of the best jobs in the world.
I'd been on the Santa Clarita, California, set of "Jackass 3D" for about two hours, watching two gigantic cranes catapult a Port-O-Potty containing star Steve-O and gallons of fecal matter 10 stories in the air when the feeling struck me again.
By mid-morning of my first day onset, Steve-O had been launched hundreds of feet in the air and the crew -- along with maybe $1 million worth of 3-D camera equipment -- had been coated with a fine spray of human and animal waste.
I went from having the feeling that I had one the best jobs in the world to being pretty sure the cast and crew from Jackass had it all figured out.
