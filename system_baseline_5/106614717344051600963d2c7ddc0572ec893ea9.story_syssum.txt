At 21, Angie Sanclemente Valencia was crowned as Colombia's "Queen of Coffee."
But Sanclemente's career came to a screeching halt in May of 2010 when she was arrested in Argentina and charged with drug trafficking.
I'm innocent of all of the accusations.
It was all a big misunderstanding," Sanclemente said.
She says her Argentinian boyfriend and his uncle, who are also in prison, were indeed involved in drug trafficking, but not her.
Moving to Argentina from Mexico, Sanclemente says in retrospect, was a big mistake.
"I'm very capricious and a lot of [bad] things have happened to me for not listening to my mother," Sanclemente says.
