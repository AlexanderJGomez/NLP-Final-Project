"It's the first time I can remember that second practice has really gone well for me," Mercedes' Hamilton was quoted as saying by Formula One's website.
The only driver with half-a-chance of catching Vettel, Fernando Alonso, was a distant seventh in the second session.
"There is every probability that, again here, we can expect to struggle in the race," Ferrari's Alonso told Formula One's website.
"It is not really surgery, but for sure we are probably going to do something," said Raikkonen.
