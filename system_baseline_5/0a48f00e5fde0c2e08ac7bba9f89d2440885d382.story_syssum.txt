After celebrity gossip site TMZ released footage of Baldwin shouting profanity at an aggressive videographer (with muffled audio that may or may not have contained a gay slur), Baldwin published a bitter "goodbye to public life" essay in New York Magazine.
In fact, Baldwin was on the cusp of discovering a new weapon â€” he just didn't realize it.
This kind of world is too much for Baldwin, who is prone to losing his temper.
Does that sound like too much trouble?
Go about your daily life, but have a trusted and well-paid photographer at your side, documenting just how rude, invasive, and aggressive the celebrity chasers can be.
All of this might sound extreme.
It may be too late for Baldwin, but not for other celebrities.
Don't disappear from public life just to spite the paparazzi.
