Ibrahim Abdel-Wahab Abdel-Azeem is one of the last traditional craftsmen in Egypt making the oud, the guitar-like instrument heard in so much Arabic music.
Abdel-Azeem was only 14 when his father died and he took over his workshop.
"Oud is the Sultan of music and songs," said Abdel-Azeem.
"If it continues this way this profession will die.
They don't teach oud anymore except in colleges of music."
He left his native Iraq during Saddam Hussein's rule and moved to Cairo where he now runs a "House of Oud" music school with branches in Egypt, Algeria and the United Arab Emirates.
"I need to change the life in Arab world, but if we need to change we need to start with the boys, with the small girls, with the culture in the beginning," he said.
