WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Obama declared Monday that his stimulus plan is "starting to work" and that 2,000 transportation projects -- costing much less than expected -- are under way.
"Our recovery dollars can go further, and we can do more projects," said Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said.
The president said the 2,000th transportation project to receive stimulus funds is one to widen and add an overpass to a stretch of Interstate 94 near Portage, Michigan.
Obama said the highway projects from the stimulus bill will create or save 150,000 jobs by the end of next year.
