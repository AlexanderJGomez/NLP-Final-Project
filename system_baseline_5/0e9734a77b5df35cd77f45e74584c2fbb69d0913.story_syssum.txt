And with everything that goes into achieving a "best-dressed"-worthy look, attendees are lucky they have an entire season to perfect their red carpet style.
The Academy Awards calls for classic, formal attire, she said, but celebrities can have a little more fun with the Golden Globes, the Screen Actors Guild Awards and the Grammy Awards, which allow for edgier ensembles.
But red carpet couture isn't about setting a trend.
It's about wearing something flattering in a style you love, said the new mom, who hasn't outfitted anyone this awards season.
"The red carpet is a very intense situation, and you want to be comfortable out there," Chavez said.
Even for the Academy Awards, which calls for mostly floor-length gowns, "shoes are still in the game," she said.
And with so much focus on the dress, shoes become a way for celebrities to experiment, and maybe take a fashion risk.
"But will you be excoriated on the red carpet for that?
The saturated, rich jewel tones are all over the red carpet this season, like the jade green Oscar de la Renta dress Emily Blunt wore to the SAG Awards, or the fuchsia Marchesa gown Sofia Vergara donned the same night.
Chavez said she expects to see a mix of vibrant, nude and sherbet colors take over at the Academy Awards.
But the fashionistas who push the envelope are the ones we'll be talking about long after awards season.
