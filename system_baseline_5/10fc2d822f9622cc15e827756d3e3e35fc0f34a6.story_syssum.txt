(CNN) -- Maurice Sendak, author of the classic children's book "Where the Wild Things Are," has died, a spokeswoman for HarperCollins Publishers said Tuesday.
The book stirred controversy when it was first published in 1963.
"Where the Wild Things Are" won the Caldecott Medal in 1964, considered the most prestigious award for illustrated children's books.
His books became children's classics, but in an interview with The Atlantic last year, Sendak said he didn't set out to be known as a writer for children.
I don't even know what a children's book is.
"Children can distort, and play with figures and ideas, with a fluidity that strains us -- which we grow out of," he said.
