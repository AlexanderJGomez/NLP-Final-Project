(CNN) -- My participation in the British Invasion came as a total surprise to me.
Suddenly, I was juggling two careers and a family.
I loved performing to American audiences, and I still do.
Of course "Downtown" was only the beginning.
I seemed to be constantly bouncing around between the United States and Europe and was jet-lagged most of the time!
For me, the buzz was and still is all about the music and being around people who feel the same way.
The British Invasion came and went, but left behind a body of music that lives on today.
