(CNN) -- Well, so much for the idea that Americans don't care about soccer.
Soccer used to be their game -- the Europeans, the South Americans, the Africans.
Even after the U.S. hosted the World Cup for the first time in 1994 -- setting attendance records that still stand today -- many still dismissed soccer as somehow not quite American.
Why?
Between 1990 and today, the number of players registered in organized youth soccer programs doubled to 4 million, according to the U.S. Soccer Federation, the governing body for the game in the United States.
Soccer is the team sport with the highest growth rate over the past decade.
The U.S. Men's National team has qualified for seven consecutive World Cups.
At the professional level, Major League Soccer has expanded to 22 markets and there is more soccer on television in the U.S. than any other country in the world.
The U.S. Soccer Foundation is working to provide thousands of children and families in under-resourced communities with easy and affordable access to quality soccer programming and safe places to play.
