(CNN) -- More than 40 years after pingpong diplomacy led to a thaw in Sino-American relations, it was on display again -- in rudimentary form -- as Michelle Obama visited a Beijing high school during her family's first full day of a visit to China.
"Don't be nervous," Obama said.
The first lady spoke with a number of students, asking a 16-year-old what she wanted to do after high school.
"OK, we're going to get this," Obama said.
"My husband plays," she said.
As the members of the first family departed the school, 33 American exchange students -- one of them from Sidwell Friends, the Washington school attended by Malia -- lined up in front of the red carpet and across from their Chinese counterparts to shake hands with the family before they left for their next stop, the Forbidden City.
U.S. President Barack Obama is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at next week's Nuclear Security Summit at The Hague, Netherlands.
China is the fifth most popular country for U.S. students studying abroad, and more students from China study in the United States than from any other country.
