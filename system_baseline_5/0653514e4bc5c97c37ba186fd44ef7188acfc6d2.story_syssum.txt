Supreme champion on the court, battler for equality off it, King took on the male-dominated tennis establishment and won.
The men had formed their own union -- the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) in 1972 -- and King was convinced it needed to be replicated for women.
It made such a difference," King told CNN.
Seeing an opportunity to make more money, Riggs challenged both Court and King, claiming that even in middle age -- he was 55 -- he could beat the top women players.
King ignored him at first, but Court took up the challenge and played him in a match in California on May 13, 1973.

King and Riggs embraced at the end, and became friends off the court until his death in 1995 of prostate cancer.
"Before that, young women were not getting anything, there was gender quotas -- like 5% in the medical school at Harvard -- there were really terrible gender quotas and also women could not get an athletic scholarship in the States," said King.
King was to play competitive singles for 10 more years after her 1973 heroics on and off the court, but injuries took their toll.
For King, the whole ethos of the event sums up her attitude to life and equality.
King shows no sign of slowing up, with her commitments to World Team Tennis and various foundations.
He told me when I met him for the first time," added King, who was honored for her work advocating for the rights of women and the lesbian and gay community.
I really wanted to spend the rest of my life fighting for equal rights and opportunities for boys and girls, men and women," said King.
But it's been a journey that has taken its toll even on someone as outwardly tough as King.
I'm really scared a lot," she revealed.
