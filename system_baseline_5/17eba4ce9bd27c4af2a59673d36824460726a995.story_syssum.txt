(CNN) -- Any minute, the Duchess of Cambridge will birth a new heir to the British throne.
Will you be the first to know?
This will be the first chance for the nation and those watching around the world to find out whether the new baby is a boy or a girl.
Scientists say the baby is slightly more likely to be a girl.
The child will be next in line to the British throne after William, whose father, Charles, is first in line.
But first, the child will be ... well, a child.
This baby might win the day all around because its mother is the first commoner to marry into the royal family since the 17th century.
"It freshens up the gene pool."
