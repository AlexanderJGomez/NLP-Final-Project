Paris, France (CNN)Joy Monroe, a tourist from Montana, has come to Paris's Pont des Arts bridge on a mission of love.
"I understand that this is a modern expression of love and it's cool, but history should not be compromised," says Anselmo.
"We just want to give back to the city we love and protect its heritage and beauty," says Anselmo.
Olivier Passelecq, the deputy mayor of the Parisian neighborhood that includes the Pont des Arts, agrees that the locks have become invasive.
"Travelers want to leave their mark on Paris -- it's touching and we understand that," Anselmo says.
