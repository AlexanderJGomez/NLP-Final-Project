New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- My dad died when I was 2, so my mother raised us [Smith and his sister] and exposed us to different things.
On holidays, we would go to work with her.
I just started playing around.
I might have looked at other recipes and didn't think we had the ingredients, and I certainly didn't have money to go buy them.
We went to Mass once a week, while in school, as well as on Sundays.
It was something I was going to do out of high school, and I put it off.
I didn't wake up one morning and just sit up in bed and stretch and say, "Well, I think I'll try the priesthood."
I have a spiritual director I work with, and I started out with that at first.
I will miss the people.
The cooking aspects, I definitely will miss.
I want to give all of myself, and I don't think you can do that when you have a lot of baggage.
I want to donate it to a school.
The prayer life, the rules that a priest is supposed to live by, that really excites me.
