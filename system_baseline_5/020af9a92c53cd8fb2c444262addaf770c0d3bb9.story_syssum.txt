Below is an excerpt from CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta's new book,  "Cheating Death: The Doctors and Medical Miracles that Are Saving Life Against All Odds" published by Wellness Central, an imprint of Grand Central Publishing.
A trim fifty-nine years old, Mertz enjoyed a two- or three-mile run several days a week.
Corey Ash, a UPS driver, was making deliveries that Wednesday afternoon, when he heard a terrible engine noise.
The only thing keeping it in place was a stucco wall a few feet from the tree; the car was wedged between the two.
After dialing 911, Ash started CPR the way he'd learned during an Air National Guard training exercise just two months before.
As fellow firefighters scrambled down, Florez thumped an urgent rhythm on Mertz' chest, two hundred compressions over two minutes, before a medic stepped in and delivered an electric shock from the paddles of a defibrillator.
Then came another two hundred compressions, then shock, two hundred compressions, then shock.
In reality, survival from cardiac arrest outside the hospital is rare.
The experiment sprang from two lines of thinking: animal studies aimed at modifying CPR technique and a public health effort to train more people in CPR.
Published studies put the rate of bystander CPR at around 20 percent.
But how?
