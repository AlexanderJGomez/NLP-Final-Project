(CNN) -- A Florida exterminator and father of four children adopted from Florida's foster care system has told police that a body found in the pest-control truck he was driving is one of them -- his 10-year-old daughter, authorities said Wednesday.
Barahona said he didn't go through with his suicide plan because his son was with him, the document added.
Barahona told police that he doused himself with gasoline and inadvertently got some on the boy, Police Capt.
Scott said the chemicals were so potent that staff caring for the boy at the hospital became ill as well, he said.
Olsen said police would decide how to charge Barahona further once the autopsy on his daughter determines her cause of death.
The story was corroborated by interviews with the other two children in the home, officials said in court.
Instead, she said, she had left the family's house after speaking with Carmen Barahona, planning to return on Monday.
