In a video posted on YouTube, Prince Jan Zylinski said he was fed up with discrimination against Poles living in Britain.
So what I'd like to do, Mr. Farage, is to challenge you to a duel," he said.
Farage -- who is on the campaign trail ahead of Britain's general elections on May 7 -- said he did not intend to cross swords with the prince.
"Alternatively, if you don't agree or if your sword is a little bit rusty, Mr. Farage, we can meet for a different kind of duel -- a duel with words in a TV studio in the run-up to the elections," Zylinski suggested.
"We are often more loyal to Britain than many British people I know," he said.
We would like you to be grateful too.
