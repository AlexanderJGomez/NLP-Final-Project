Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reflected that tension this week when she urged Islamist parties in Egypt to "embrace democratic norms and rules" by creating a government that respects the full range of human rights.
The Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist party widely seen as being relatively moderate, won more than 40% of the vote, according to initial election results.
"The old formula is not going to work and if we want to be in a position to influence, it will depend on our credibility and the strength of our support for the processes of change," said Steven Heydemann, senior adviser for Middle East Initiatives for the United States Institute of Peace, an independent conflict management think tank created and funded by the U.S. Congress.
Criticisms such as Shaath's show how little influence the United States has over what's happening in Egypt, and how little it has to gain even if it supports democratic movements there, Ottaway said.
Should the United States pull back from its support for democratization in the region, it will lose all credibility among the Egyptian people, Ottaway said.
But the only way these parties can retain their popularity once in power is to govern effectively, he said.
But it won't be a quick process, Heydemann said.
"Across a broad spectrum of issues, we face a long period of uncertainty," he said.
