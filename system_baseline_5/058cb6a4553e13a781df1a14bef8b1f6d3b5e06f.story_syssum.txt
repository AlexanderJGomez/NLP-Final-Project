Radamel Falcao Garcia Zarate, Falcao for short, is a Colombian soccer star.
Falcao is good enough to improve any team, but United hardly needed another attacking player.
United is yet to win this season and recently suffered a humiliating 4-0 defeat to third division team MK Dons in the League Cup.
A new star was born, and Rodriguez is now strutting his stuff at Real Madrid having also left Monaco.
As well as Falcao and Rodriguez, Mendes brokered the deal to bring Di Maria to Old Trafford and Eliaquim Mangala to Manchester City.
He's a big guy...
Monaco did qualify for the Champions League, even if Falcao missed most of last season through injury.
Now Falcao junior has a similar mission to help United qualify for Europe's top competition.
