BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- More than half the Christian population has fled the northern Iraqi city of Mosul in reaction to a campaign of killings and intimidation, according to the United Nations.
No Christian family has left the city over the past seven days, and at least 100 families returned to their homes in and around Mosul during that time, Goran said.
Violence has declined as a result, Iraqi officials said.
In other violence Tuesday in Mosul, four police officers were killed and four wounded when gunmen opened fire on their vehicle, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said.
Also Tuesday in Baghdad, six civilians died and 23 were hurt in four bombings, the official said.
The first blast hurt four civilians, while the second wounded three, the official said.
