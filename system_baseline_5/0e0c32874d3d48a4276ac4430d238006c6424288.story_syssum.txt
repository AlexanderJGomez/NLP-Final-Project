This newest quarantine has us wondering again how far the government can restrain individuals for the common good.
For over a hundred years, the Supreme Court and other tribunals have upheld the right of states to enact compulsory laws related to health care issues such as vaccination.
The Supreme Court actually said that.
Since then, the court has specifically recognized that the general health and welfare of the public may require adults be dealt with by compulsory treatment including quarantine, confinement or sequestration.
For example, most of us are aware on some level of the individual right to refuse medical treatment.
The court cases that protect these liberties may leave the public with a strong and perhaps unrealistic impression about what constitute unassailable, bedrock "rights."
She may be right if the medical evidence supports her view.
What undoubtedly feels to Hickox like a violation of "basic human rights" may not automatically be the same as the "fundamental rights" closely guarded and scrutinized by the Supreme Court.
The individual's liberty can still theoretically outweigh public safety, but practically, you're talking about convincing a court that your right to walk to the corner store outweighs the risk of an epidemic.
