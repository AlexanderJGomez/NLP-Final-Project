Tuscaloosa, Alabama (CNN) -- The pounding of hammers inside his home is probably the sweetest sound in the world to Tuscaloosa resident Gary Limmroth.
Fifty-three people were killed in the city that day.
The storm cut a six-mile-long path through the city, destroying or damaging about 12% of it, Tuscaloosa officials say.
Today, a year later, a huge weed-filled lot now sits where one Tuscaloosa neighborhood used to be -- part of the huge mile-wide swath that the tornado cut through town at McFarland Boulevard and 15th Street.
"As bad as disasters are, a lot of people benefit from them, from easier loans, lower loans and stuff like that," Smith said.
It's about building back in such a way that people are going to have confidence that we're going to have a better tomorrow."
"The message is this: We are coming back," Tuscaloosa County Probate Judge Hardy McCollum said during the Friday ceremony.

There were a lot of people across the lake that have decided they just can't take it.
