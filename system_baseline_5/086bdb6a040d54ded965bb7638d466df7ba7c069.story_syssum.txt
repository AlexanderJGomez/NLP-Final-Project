For French football clubs it's a new punitive tax law that's worrying them to death.
If it goes ahead it would France's first football "strike" since 1972.
Since world-class players have their choice of what countries they play in, French teams would have to absorb the increased taxes themselves if they want to attract top talent.
"The high-income tax of 75%, which was included in the 2013 draft budget of France, will have a disastrous effect on the competitiveness of French football," said the Professional Union of Football Clubs (UCPF) in a statement.
French football has a strong tradition of developing young players through its academy system, but a French club hasn't won the Champions League -- Europe's top competition -- for over 20 years, though last season PSG reached the quarterfinals.
A survey by pollster OpinionWay in October suggested 85% of voters did not think football clubs should be exempted from the high tax rate, which requires approval from the French parliament.
"I'm not totally for (the strike) personally, what worries me of course is that there is this tax, but, all French people suffer from having to pay taxes.
