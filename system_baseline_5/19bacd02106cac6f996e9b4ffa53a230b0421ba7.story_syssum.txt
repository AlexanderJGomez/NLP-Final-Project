Fox recently announced a new show airing soon -- "Take Me Out" -- from the producers of "American Idol" and "X Factor."
The U.S. edition of the world's favorite car show has been gaining in viewership on History, yet continues to be a point of controversy with hardcore fans of the British original, which airs here on BBC America.
The American version of "The Office" didn't click until it worked through the original scripts and settled into its own routine.
But the recipe is delicate.
"Top Gear" host Richard Hammond is even filming a new show -- in America, for America -- as part of an original-programming experiment by BBC America.
Multiple channels are importing original British programming.
Speaking of translated transatlantic comedy, the industry is in on the joke: Matt LeBlanc -- currently the fastest Star in a Reasonably Priced Car on the British "Top Gear" -- won a Golden Globe for Showtime's "Episodes" which is a series about the American bastardization of a popular British sitcom.
