Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- The man accused of killing 77 people in a bomb-and-gun rampage in Norway last summer said his actions were justified to save the country from multicultural forces as he went on trial Monday.
Breivik says his rampage was meant to save Norway from being taken over by multicultural forces and to prevent ethnic cleansing of Norwegians, said his lawyer, Geir Lippestad.
Breivik sat in court without restraints, behind a bulletproof glass barrier set up to protect him during the six hours of proceedings.
The police were so close," said Jorn Overby, who rescued some 15 people from the waters off Utoya during the massacre.
It is important to Breivik that he be considered sane, Lippestad said after the hearing.
Prosecutors said he had "no job, no salary, no money from the government" and was "living off his savings."
But lawyers for the victims said: "No one thought he was crying for the victims."
In a report released this month, two court-appointed psychiatric experts said Breivik was sane at the time of the killings.
The victims on Utoya Island were among 700 mostly young people attending a Labour Party camp, the same camp Stoltenberg said he had attended every summer since 1974.
That's part of our democratic society," Stoltenberg said.
