(Mental Floss) -- Major League Baseball's umpires are all over the news after a spate of, er, questionable calls throughout this postseason.
A National Football League ref can make anywhere from $25,000 to $70,000 a season, although since most of the games are on Sundays, they can also have other jobs during the week.
• Baseball.
According to MLB.com, MLB umpires get around $120,000 when they start out in the big leagues, and senior umps can earn upwards of $300,000.
• Basketball.
• Hockey.
Since NFL refs only work one day each week, they can have "real" jobs to supplement what they earn on any given Sunday.
• Walter Anderson became an official in the league in 1996 and got the promotion to referee in 2003.
• Ron Winter's not just a ref, he's also an associate professor in Western Michigan University's phys.
• And when Ed Hochuli isn't officiating a game (or working out), you might find him in a courtroom.
Eventually, he became an NFL side judge in 1990 and received a promotion to NFL referee, the pinnacle of football officiating, in 1995.
In a recent op-ed in The New York Times, former baseball commissioner Fay Vincent cited the paltry salaries for minor-league umps: just $9500 for a five-month season for junior umpires, and only $20,000 a season for guys who have risen all the way to Triple A ball.
