(CNN) -- My dad was an avid sports fan and a great athlete in his day.
I thought about him yesterday as I read about Jason Collins coming out as the first openly gay player in NBA history.
Can he play?
It's still news because the stereotype of gay men as being effete, weak, uncoordinated (except where it comes to Lady Gaga impersonations) and otherwise "girly" is still so strong.
It shouldn't be.
This is why an openly gay NBA player should be news, because it busts stereotypes, normalizes homosexuality and gives kids of all orientations a positive role model of self-love and professional excellence.
"Yeah, but can the dude play?"
Yes, he can play.
Jason Collins is gay.
For decades, the argument had been that having openly gay people in the military would impair unit cohesion.
First, it was the military, now it's pro sports being forced to realize that there is no "us" and "them" when it comes to sexuality.
I think my dad would agree.
