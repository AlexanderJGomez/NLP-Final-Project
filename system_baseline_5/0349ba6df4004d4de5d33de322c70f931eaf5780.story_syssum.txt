And now -- due in part to the abundance of social media and the intense interest in Spider-Man's alter ego, Peter Parker -- a firestorm has erupted, after Marvel revealed that Parker will die, and the role of Spider-Man will be taken over by his archenemy, Doctor Octopus.
When issue #700 was leaked early, fan reaction -- both positive and negative -- went into overdrive, with a few death threats directed at the issue's writer, Dan Slott.
Dan Slott: When we first met Peter Parker, he was a teenage bespectacled nerd who resented all the other kids.
If Peter had never learned the lesson of "great power and great responsibility," there's every chance he would have become a supervillain.
So what if we flipped it?
It wasn't originally going to be in the 700th issue, but as the story grew, we realized maybe it was time to change up the makeup of Spider-Man for good, to make a permanent change.
Wacker: The fan reaction never really surprises me.
You find people of all stripes reacting -- people who have been reading it for 50 years and love it, and others who say they're quitting Marvel forever.
No one has a middling review.
I got an angry tweet saying, "I don't like seeing bad things happen to good people."
Slott: We have the most passionate fans in the world!
In the world of comics, thanks to (newspaper publisher) J. Jonah Jameson, everyone thinks he's a menace.
This is going to be the most meta Spider-Man of them all!
