(CNN) -- Former U.S. Marine Dan Hottle knew he had found his dream job at Yellowstone National Park.
"Where I had just come from was so austere," he said.
Hottle is one of many military veterans who have worked for the National Park Service and at Yellowstone, the nation's first national park, established in 1872.
"It's pretty rural and only packed with visitors in the summer," he said.
"I saw an injured bison on the road, and I know it's going to be food for a grizzly bear later this afternoon.
Park stats: Yellowstone National Park was the fourth-most-visited national park (PDF) in 2012, with 3.4 million visitors last year.
While Old Faithful Geyser is the big draw for first-time visitors to Yellowstone, it can take the whole day to enjoy and get around the geyser basin where it's located.
"I think it's the prettiest part of the park," Hottle said.
"The vibrancy of the colors around the spring are created by natural bacteria," Hottle said.
It's in the northeast corner of the park, just outside Lamar Valley and near Cooke City, Montana.
Early in the morning or later in the evening, when he's driving the only car on the road, Hottle likes to stop at a pullout about halfway to Lamar Valley, where he can sometimes hear wolves howling.
Most magical moment in the park: He remembers a moment with a five-point bull elk at Phantom Lake in 2011.
Funniest moment at the park: Moments after he spotted that bull elk, a tourist asked him, "Where's the wildlife?"
"You can drive around for two weeks and not see a bear, and then three show up in my front yard," he said.
"We have so many vehicle accidents here because (people) are trying to see the whole thing through their windshields while they're driving," Hottle said.
"Female elk with calves can take people out," Hottle said.
"It's just spectacular," he said.
