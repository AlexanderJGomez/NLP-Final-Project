Edinburgh, Scotland (CNN) -- Let's not pretend Queen Elizabeth doesn't have opinions.
This is a rare moment of candor for someone who's well aware that anything she says to a member of the public has the potential to be picked up by reporters, who she also knows have the referendum at the forefront of their minds.
The Queen has come under pressure from some politicians to step into the debate but that idea was given short shrift.
The Queen's role in Scotland isn't actually at any immediate risk.
The frontman of the pro-independence campaign, Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, says he looks forward to the Queen remaining as "Queen of Scots" in an independent Scotland.
Breaking up the United Kingdom now would prompt an identity crisis for Queen and country.
She said: "I cannot forget that I was crowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
It's personal and professional for her.
