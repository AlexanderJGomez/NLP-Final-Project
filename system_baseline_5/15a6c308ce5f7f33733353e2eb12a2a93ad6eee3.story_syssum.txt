Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Myanmar's military rulers marked the country's independence day by commuting sentences and apparently releasing more than 30 prisoners, but opposition activists said Wednesday that the moves were unsatisfactory.
"We have received information from Myanmar there are about 33 prisoners released yesterday," Aung Myo Thein, a spokesman for AAPP, said Wednesday.
He said the actions by the government were not enough, noting that some political prisoners had merely had sentences of more than 100 years reduced to 60 years.
The United States has tried to encourage an opening with Myanmar in recent years.
