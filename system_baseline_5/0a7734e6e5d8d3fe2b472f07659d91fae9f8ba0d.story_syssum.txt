(CNN) -- In an ever-evolving, increasingly crowded beverage market, Starbucks is waking up and smelling the coffee.
Then there is the other American coffee titan, Maxwell House, which is a Kraft Foods brand.
Additionally, Starbucks wants to capture a larger share of the U.S. brewed coffee market by leaning on its VIA Ready Brew line and Seattle's Best coffee brand to increase the number of distribution points.
Starbucks acquired its former competitor, Seattle's Best Coffee, seven years ago.
Despite all this, Starbucks CEO Schultz said the expanding marketplace might just be an advantage to all of its players.
