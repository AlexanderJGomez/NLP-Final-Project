(CNN) -- Brazil might be the biggest country most of the world doesn't know a whole heckuva a lot about.
Now that Brazil will be hosting the World Cup next year and the Olympics in 2016 (massive public expenditures that many here deeply oppose), it's time for a crash course in all things Brazilian.
Not many Brazilians speak English, particularly outside Rio de Janeiro or Sao Paulo.
(How are you?
Maybe because they're surrounded by so many varieties of exotic fruits the rest of us have never heard of -- caju, camu-camu, pitanga -- Brazilians are experts in the creation of especially tasty fruit drinks, or sucos.
The Brazilian banana is the tastiest in the world, far superior to the bland Central American version (say Brazilians), and it makes for super savory drinks.
One of the largest wetlands in the world, the Pantanal, spans 70,000 square miles in southwestern Brazil.
Some 6% of Brazilians live in the favelas (slums), according to the 2010 census.
Why make products as far away from the point of sale as you can get in Brazil?
Brazilians produce two of the biggest bashes the world has known in Carnival and the New Year's Reveillon celebration.
The Northeast of Brazil has a lot of festivals.
The Northeast of Brazil has its own country-style beats -- embolada, baio, xote and forro, which is also a hugely popular dance in Brazil.
A day heavy in meet-and-greets can lead to a lot of cheek nuzzling, which for some makes Brazil a wonderful thing and for others a place of more colds and flus.
It's burned indelibly into every movie fan's mind -- the fiendish feeding frenzy of piranha stripping a human down to dental work.
Piranha live in the major river basins of South America, and the Amazon tributaries of Brazil are well-stocked with them.
