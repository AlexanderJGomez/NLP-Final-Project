That seems to be the lesson young athletes learn from the latest steroids scandal.
The problem is, for every Braun and A-Rod, a thousand young men will never make the majors -- but are willing to risk their health, even their lives, by taking PEDs.
These young athletes need to hear more about Taylor Hooton than Ryan Braun.
That's what we have here.
Teenagers know how to find just what they think they need on YouTube, eBay and other websites that parents haven't even heard of.
Many teenagers have credit cards, which can be easily used to purchase PEDs online.
It's a sad fact that if they play high school or college sports, these youths probably already know of someone who has taken PEDs.
But the real risk for young athletes is their health.
When they use PEDs, they are risking their lives and their health.
