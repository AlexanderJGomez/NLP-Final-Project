Either way, South Korean defense officials said on Friday they were sure that they came from North Korea and that they were up to no good.
Scientists found a "smoking gun that all three were sent from North Korea and are programmed to return to North Korea," South Korean defense spokesman Kim Min-soek said.
The planes were not capable of transmitting images back to North Korea in real time, and the photos themselves were no better than what one might see on a service akin to Google Earth, Kim said in a previous briefing.
There is little danger the drones could have made it far into South Korea.
The Korean drones are nowhere near as sophisticated as those used by the United States in Pakistan, Yemen and Afghanistan, he said.
Video footage shows North Korean exercises using them as missiles, but it's an expensive way to build a bomb, he said.
The drones would fit well into that category, since they slipped through South Korean air defenses.
South Korea's defense ministry called the intrusion by the drones a violation of the truce that ended the bloody conflict between North and South Korea in 1953.
