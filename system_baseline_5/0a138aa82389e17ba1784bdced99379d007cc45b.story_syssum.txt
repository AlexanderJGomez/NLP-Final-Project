Rick Perry's decision to send up to 1,000 National Guard troops to the southern border is the latest move in a controversy over the influx of migrant youths from Central America, many unaccompanied, streaming into the United States.
The National Guard will be a "force multiplier" to aid state law enforcement to reduce crime from cartels, traffickers and criminals crossing the border, Perry said.
So what will the border patrol do?
What won't they do?
The former head of the National Guard and a former commissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection bureau have said Perry's plan is limited in scope.
Aguilar said one thing that will help relieve the workload of border patrol agents is to relieve CBP from being the sole government agency to process and care for the unaccompanied youth in the immediate aftermath of their detention.
Perry is asking the federal government to hire and train an additional 3,000 border patrol agents to replace the National Guard.
Perry has some reconciling to do within a Republican Party that has used the current border crisis to move to the right on the issue.
Has the National Guard been sent to the border before?
At the same time, resources for border security have steadily increased: More than 18,000 agents patrolled the border in 2013 compared to 10,000 a decade ago.
And the amount spent on border security has more than doubled.
