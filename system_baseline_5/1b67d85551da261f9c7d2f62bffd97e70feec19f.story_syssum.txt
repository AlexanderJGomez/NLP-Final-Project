Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Smoke billowed into the sky over Egypt's capital Wednesday from a fire at the Interior Ministry compound, a blaze witnesses say was set by protesters upset about labor issues.
State-run media reported Wednesday that there have been about 1,300 official complaints lodged against former Egyptian ministers and government officials.
As CNN correspondent Ivan Watson was filming the aftermath of the fire outside the Interior Ministry Wednesday, an Egyptian military officer with two stars on his epaulets grabbed Watson and demanded he turn over his camera.
Eventually, another officer intervened, and escorted CNN journalists from the scene.
