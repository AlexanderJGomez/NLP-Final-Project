(CNN) -- The 15-year-old Mexican youth who was shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent had a history of involvement with human smuggling and was on a list of repeat juvenile offenders, U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman Mark Qualia told CNN Thursday.
In the distance, a U.S. Border Patrol officer on a bicycle can be seen making his way toward the area.
This happened on the U.S. side of the border.
"They're throwing rocks," witnesses screaming in Spanish can be heard in the background of the video as the officer opens fire.
The FBI has been studying videos of the incident and said some of the video does show rocks being thrown at the Border Patrol agents, the official said.
Belmonte said Hernandez was shot in the head.
Local politicians were expected to attend.
Reports that the Mexican military may have drawn weapons on U.S. Border Patrol agents, which surfaced earlier Wednesday, could not be immediately confirmed.
The body was found on the Mexican side of the border, Simmons said.
"The growing frequency of this type of event reflects a worrisome increment in the use of excessive force on the part of some border authorities," the Mexican Foreign Ministry said.
Earlier, Qualia, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman, said he could not comment because he does not know where the Mexican government obtained its statistics.
