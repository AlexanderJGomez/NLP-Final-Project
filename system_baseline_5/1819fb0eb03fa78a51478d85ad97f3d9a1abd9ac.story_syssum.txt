Postal Service has outraged some stamp enthusiasts.
As the former head of the American Philatelic Society (that's a stamp collecting society to the rest of us) noted:  "Harry Potter is not American.
Look, I understand that one of the mandates of the Postal Service is, "portraying the American experience to a world audience through the issuance of postage stamps."
Plus Harry Potter and his cast of cohorts are not the first non-U.S. citizens to grace our stamps.
Why?
This very issue has caused friction between the Postal Service and the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee -- a body established in 1957 to evaluate and recommend to the USPS what should be chosen for stamps.
So I say it's time for the Postal Service to roll out stamps that will make money.
