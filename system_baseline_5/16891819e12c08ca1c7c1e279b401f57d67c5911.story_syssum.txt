Savage and her neighbors say they had no clue that Thurmond, 36, had a wife, let alone four kids; they were also oblivious that Thurmond may have held the five hostage in the three-bedroom mobile home for three years.
Thurmond kindly told Savage he hadn't seen anything suspicious.
She remembers Thurmond was a polite fellow.
"I never saw them outside, never," she said.
Lt. Missy Collins, the investigator who had Thurmond arrested Tuesday after a two-week investigation, said her husband used to work with Thurmond at a pump-manufacturing facility in nearby Toccoa.
"They said they had a mother and four kids, and apparently they'd been kept at home, and there was some abuse allegations and the dad wouldn't let them leave," Collins said.
Collins said police are not sure if padlocks were the only way Thurmond imprisoned his family.
Collins said Thurmond had once allegedly raped his wife with the children in the next room.
Collins said she is not certain exactly what emboldened the family to flee the filthy trailer, but the mother told police that Thurmond had said he was leaving her for another woman.
When Collins interviewed the family, all but one of the children were pale and thin, she said.
On August 6, after Thurmond hadn't responded to a notice on his door threatening eviction, Medina sent her maintenance man to the mobile home.
Heavy, brown stains covered both toilets.
Collins said she went behind an adjacent mobile home and vomited when she and another officer first opened the door.
Collins said rebuilding the family may take more work.
" Collins said.
"He didn't even ask until he was behind bars."
