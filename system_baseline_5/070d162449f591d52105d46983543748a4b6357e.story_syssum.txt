Malik, editor Kabeer Sharma said, posed nude.
But the magazine has already incensed Malik.
FHM, Bilawala said, violated its agreement with the Pakistani model that stipulated that Malik would be shown the photos from the shoot before they were published.
Malik said she never agreed to pose nude, the prospect of which sparked outrage in her homeland.
But I didn't agree to this and they are wrong.
"I am not bothered about what they think," she said.
"My fans and many Pakistanis support me and believe (in) me."
