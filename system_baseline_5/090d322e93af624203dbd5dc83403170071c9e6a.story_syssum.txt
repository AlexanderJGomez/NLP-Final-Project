Much of the praise has gone to Heath Ledger's dark and disturbing portrayal of the Joker.
Itson saw the first "Batman" movie, but wasn't a big fan of the series, or Heath Ledger, but said her friend wanted to go.
"I've never left a movie shaking before," she said.
"It was amazing, there were no words for it, it was so good, it was probably the best movie I've ever seen," she said.
And I'm also a big movie fan, and we tend to go to a lot of movie openings."

The Dark Knight lived up to the hype, especially Heath Ledger's role as The Joker.
See it soon and see it often.
Heath Ledger is AWESOME as the Joker.
Zandz: We went to the premiere of this movie last night and thought the movie was only good.
The makeup artists also did a great job on this Joker's face.
