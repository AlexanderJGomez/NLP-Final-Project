(CNN) -- Four days after a U.S. civilian-operated cargo jet plunged into the ground shortly after takeoff from Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, killing all seven people aboard, one expert said that a number of factors likely were involved in the incident.
National said the aircraft had landed uneventfully in Bagram and no additional cargo or people were taken on there, it said.
It bears the date 2013/02/01, but date stamps can easily be inaccurate.
If the takeoff had been rougher than usual, "it could have caused the cargo in the back of the plane to become loose," Rosenberg said.
"The light person is never going to get the heavy person off the ground," he said.
"Upon takeoff, we'll be looking back at the cargo until we get off the ground, making sure none of the chains break or pop out," Airman 1st Class Michael Brown says in the airfield's story.
But Rosenberg said he considered the last possibility to be the least likely, given the redundancy built into the four-engine jet.
"It's a fantastic plane," he said.
In its statement, National Air Cargo said it "will not speculate as to the cause of the accident," and that it was fully cooperating with authorities as the investigation continues.
