Technological advances are giving rise to huge amounts of data -- about consumers, supply chains and world events -- that businesses can use to make better decisions and gain a competitive edge.
"Big data is the new oil," says Andy Cutler, director of strategy at SAS, a consulting firm specializing in big data analytics.
Major banks including HSBC use big data to monitor and predict fraud -- both by cardholders and staff -- by setting up data-mining systems that collect patterns and look for anomalies.
Meanwhile major supermarkets in the UK are turning to big data analytics to help them provide same-day grocery delivery services -- a huge logistical challenge involving predicting what customers are likely to want before they order it, and ensuring coordinated delivery times that protect supermarkets' already-thin profit margins.
Professor Thierry Chaussalet, who runs a business intelligence and analytics masters course at the University of Westminster in London, says many businesses simply don't understand the big data technology now available and what it has to offer.
