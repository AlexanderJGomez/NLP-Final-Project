NEW YORK (CNN) -- After a nearly year-long investigation, police say they now believe 10 sets of human remains uncovered along a desolate stretch of Long Island, New York, beach are linked to a single killer.
Authorities have sifted through more than 1,000 tips related to the case.
At least 10 sets of human remains have been found in Nassau and Suffolk counties since December.
Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas Spota said in May that the newly found remains were not believed to be connected to the first four victims.
Authorities at the time said the evidence suggested two other killers dumped bodies along Ocean Parkway in Gilgo Beach, about 40 miles east of New York City.
