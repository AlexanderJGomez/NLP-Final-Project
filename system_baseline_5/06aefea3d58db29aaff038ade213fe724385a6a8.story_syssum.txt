Speaking at the TED Global conference, Assange said that "we are overwhelmed by our growth" and the site can't keep up with the volume of the new material because it doesn't have enough people to verify it.
He said WikiLeaks is providing legal assistance to Manning without saying if he was the source of the video.
The site said the video "clearly shows the unprovoked slaying of a wounded Reuters employee and his rescuers."
Assange denied reports that WikiLeaks had received hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. cables in addition to the Iraq video.
Assange said some information, including a patient's medical records, should legitimately be kept secret.
"I received advice from figures like [investigative reporter] Sy Hersh to exercise caution," Assange said, adding that U.S. officials have now adopted a "reasonable" attitude in private.
