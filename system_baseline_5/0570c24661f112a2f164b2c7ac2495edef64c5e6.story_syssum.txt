I wasn't sure what to expect, but I did not want that experience to influence how I approached the country and its people.
When I was assigned to Rwanda 18 years later, my first thought was the genocide -- this is probably true for most people.
When you get to Rwanda, you are hit by the incongruity that strikes so many: How could such a horrible thing have happened in such a beautiful country?
For anyone who has spent time in Africa, it's incredible to see people actually wearing helmets on motorcycles, drivers and passengers alike, both in Kigali and in the countryside.
During the last Saturday of each month, citizens do some type of community work in their neighborhood, like picking up garbage or cutting the grass.
Four months after my arrival, I was ready to see the Kigali Genocide Memorial.
You almost weep when you realize they will never identify them all.
But I know from what I had seen, and from my organization's work, that it is possible.
Looking at Rwandans today with a certainty that such an atrocity can never happen again, you wonder "How did this ever happen in the first place?"
When Rwandans say "never again," I believe them.
My time in Rwanda has shown me the limitations of what the international community will do in situations like this, but also taught me lessons and given me hope.
Peace is possible.
