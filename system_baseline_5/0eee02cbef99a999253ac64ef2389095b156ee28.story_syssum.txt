(CNN) -- We moved to suburban Akron in January 2003, just months before LeBron James graduated from St. Vincent-St. Mary High School and was drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers.
James Sr. played basketball with the middle school boys when the school opened a new gym.
You see, my sons like James.
Friday's announcement that James is returning to northeast Ohio capped off a spectacular week of Cleveland in the national spotlight.
The Cleveland Browns have a hopeful new star and the prodigal son is coming home.
Yes, Cleveland was heartbroken when James announced his decision to go to Miami.
Still, James' departure stung.
Months later, I wrote a personal letter to James that I never mailed.
I wanted him to know there were still boys in Copley, Bath and Akron who were looking up to him.
As political analysts second-guessed this week's RNC choice rather than the selection of Dallas and as sports analysts complained about having to spend more time working in Cleveland rather than sipping mojitos on South Beach, the people who live here have a deeply affectionate relationship with the city.
On Friday, LeBron James stood up for Cleveland, for Akron, for northeast Ohio.
Welcome home LeBron.
