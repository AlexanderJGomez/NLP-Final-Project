(CNN) -- The crane operator facing charges over a deadly building collapse was denied bail Sunday.
Grey told reporters Saturday that while his client feels "extremely sympathetic and remorseful," he is not guilty.
"This was an accident, but Mr. Benschop was not responsible," Grey said, in remarks captured by CNN affiliate WPVI.
"Justice will only be served if Sean Benschop receives a sentence that buries him in a jailhouse forever, just like his victims were buried on Wednesday," Nutter said.
