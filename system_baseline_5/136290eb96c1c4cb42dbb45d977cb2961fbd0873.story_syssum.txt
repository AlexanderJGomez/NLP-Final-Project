EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy told the Republican-led committee that the agency cannot access some e-mails belonging to a biologist who worked on a controversial mining project assessment.
With the EPA, the committee is investigating whether the biologist involved, or anyone else at the agency, colluded with environmentalists to produce a negative assessment of a mining proposal in Alaska.
McCarthy insisted the agency is trying to recover the biologists' missing e-mails, but also tried to downplay his role in the mine assessment.
Meadows pressed McCarthy on whether the agency broke federal records-keeping law.
"You have not complied with the subpoena," he told McCarthy.
"I hope that over the next few days our folks and your folks can resolve this with all the e-mails," Issa concluded.
