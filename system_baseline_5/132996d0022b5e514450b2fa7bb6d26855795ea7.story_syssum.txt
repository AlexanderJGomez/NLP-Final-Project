Believing that access to their archives can promote French culture, the city of Lyon's library has signed an agreement with Google, hoping to scan as many as 500,000 books in 10 years.
Under the Lyon Library contract, Google will scan its books and manuscripts for free.
"By putting them on the Internet, much larger circles of society, including non-specialists, can read these works and enjoy them and find them useful," Bazin added.

Currently Google has seven library partners in Europe, including Lyon.
