He also accused the Damascus regime of collaborating with al Qaeda militants against opponents both in Syria and in neighboring Iraq.
"I was at the top of the Syrian regime," Fares said in his first interview with a U.S.-based TV network since his defection.
Photographs on Syrian government websites as well as from Fares' personal collection show that on more than one occasion, this native of the eastern city of Deir Ezzor reported directly to the Syrian president.
"The regime in Syria is a totalitarian regime and a dictatorship.
Syrian opposition leaders applauded the very public departure of such a high-ranking Syrian official because it clearly embarrasses and weakens the Damascus regime.
...
There is friendship between us," said Fares.
"The secret police were encouraging enthusiastic young people in Syria to go for jihad in Iraq and join al Qaeda," Fares continued.
One of these "safe havens," Fares said, was the Syrian border village of al Sukariya, near the border city of Abu Kamal.
"This was a hiding place for al-Qaeda on the border with Iraq, and it was under the control of Assif Shawkat, the brother-in-law of the president," Fares said.
Fares went on to repeat a long-stated Syrian opposition accusation: that the Syrian government is staging al Qaeda-style attacks in Syria as a fear-mongering tactic.
There is still time," Fares said.
... History will curse you for the crimes you committed in Syria."
