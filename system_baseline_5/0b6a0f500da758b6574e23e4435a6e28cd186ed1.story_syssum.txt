(CNN) -- A widespread outbreak of severe weather across the Deep South may be one for the record books, as the National Weather Service received reports of more than 150 tornadoes.
"It was certainly a rare day that there were so many tornadoes that caused so much damage in populated areas," CNN Meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said.
"It is tornado season, but an intensive event like this only will occur maybe once or twice a year," Morris said.
"When you have a storm all by itself like we saw yesterday, that's when you get this structure," he added.
"We may finish out April with more than 300 tornadoes," Carbin said.
