The one movie I wrote in my mind a hundred times and on paper nine or 10 times, though, was "42."
Well, once upon a time, I was encouraged to bring Robinson's life story to the screen, only to be discouraged by the way reel life turns out.
Jackie's widow, Rachel Robinson, 90, was guest of honor at a recent White House showing where Michelle Robinson Obama said, "We think everybody in this country needs to watch this movie."

I know writer-director Brian Helgeland made it and Chadwick Boseman made it and Harrison Ford made it, but you made it.
I give it thumbs-up and, hey, I haven't even seen it.
