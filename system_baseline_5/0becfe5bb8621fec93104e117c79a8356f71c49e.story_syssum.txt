(CNN) -- Johan Friso, the 43-year-old Dutch prince who was injured in an avalanche at an Austrian ski resort last week, has suffered brain damage, his doctor said Friday.
The prince was under the snow for a "short period of time," the spokesman said.
"We have hoped that Prince Friso will recover again," said Mayor Ludwig Muxel.
It cited new snowfall on top of a packed layer of snow that could cause snow slabs to slide off.
