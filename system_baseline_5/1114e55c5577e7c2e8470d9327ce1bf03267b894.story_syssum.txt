NEW YORK (CNN) -- Two George Washington Bridge security guards photographed sleeping on the job have been fired, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
Lepore said he was moved to photograph the slumbering sentries after witnessing the same guard napping on three occasions.
Lepore said he later approached the guard, told him he had caught him asleep at his post three times, and said he had the photos to prove it.
The sleeping guards were employees of FJC Security, a security contractor used by the Port Authority, which operates the George Washington Bridge along with all other bridges leading into Manhattan.
The Port Authority welcomes the public's vigilance on matters of safety and security and we encourage our customers to contact us if they encounter anything out of the ordinary," the agency said.
