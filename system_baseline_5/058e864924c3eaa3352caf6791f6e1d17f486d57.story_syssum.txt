Stern made his prime time debut this year as a judge on "America's Got Talent;" Harvey hosts "Family Feud" and his daytime talk show, "The Steve Harvey Show," is set to premiere on September 4.
Katie Couric and Ricki Lake will debut new shows this fall, and mainstays Ellen DeGeneres and Wendy Williams have been renewed through 2014.
That personality goes a long way, said Premiere Networks President Julie Talbott whose company syndicates "The Steve Harvey Show" on radio across the country to 7 million listeners.
As one of "The Original Kings of Comedy," he is used to trying to connect with audiences, but he recently retired from stand-up, claiming, "Comedy isn't what it used to be.
I don't want to be one of the ones where people say 'Man, whatever happened to so and so?'
"I've never done a talk show.
I don't know how it's going to go, but I also know that God didn't bring me this far to leave me, so He causes things to happen."
