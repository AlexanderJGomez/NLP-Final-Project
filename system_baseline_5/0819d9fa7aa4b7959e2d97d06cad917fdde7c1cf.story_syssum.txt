On the TV show, Nev Schulman, a photographer, guides others who suspect that their online loves are not what they seem.
Nev Schulman said in an interview with Iamrogue.
In one episode, "Tyler" wants to meet "Amanda" after months of corresponding via Facebook.
"For many people the life that they lead on the Internet, which can be exciting, interesting, and can be filled with hopes and dreams that are perhaps outside of the actual range of their situation, is a big distraction and keeps them from living their real lives," Schulman said in the Iamrogue interview.
