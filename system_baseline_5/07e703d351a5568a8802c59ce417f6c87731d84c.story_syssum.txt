Doctors knew the mother was HIV positive and administered the drugs in hopes of controlling the virus.
"We didn't have the opportunity to treat the mom during the pregnancy as we would like to be able do to prevent transmission to the baby," said Dr. Hannah Gay, a pediatric HIV specialist at the University of Mississippi Medical Center.
Once it was determined the Mississippi mother was HIV positive, Gay immediately began giving the infant antiretroviral drugs upon the baby's delivery in an attempt to control HIV infection.
Within a couple of days, Gay confirmed the child was HIV positive.
HIV-positive mothers given appropriate treatment pass the virus on in less than 2% of cases, Luzuriaga said.
Investigators said the Mississippi case may change that practice because it highlights the potential for cure with early standard antiretroviral therapy, or ART.
The early treatment likely led to the infant's cure, she said.
Researchers say the only other documented case of an HIV cure is that of Timothy Brown, known as the "Berlin patient."
In 2007, Brown, an HIV-positive American living in Germany, was battling both leukemia and HIV when he underwent a bone marrow transplant that cured not only his cancer but his HIV.
Even then, some HIV experts said that doesn't matter, that he's been cured.
In fact, many AIDS experts said they believe Brown has experienced what's called a "sterilizing" cure, meaning the virus has been eliminated from the body entirely.
