He recalls with fondness those childhood days when he used to race go-karts -- the precursor to his enormous success on the Formula One circuit -- free of any pressure.
"My father was the one to introduce the adrenaline and the passion for racing into the family," Alonso says.
"First it was to study," he says.
"I felt that this was a good moment and I would keep this trophy all my life because you never think that you will continue," says Alonso, a cycling enthusiast, too, who hopes to have his own team.
"I didn't know if I would race anymore in go-karts or if my family would take me to the next weekend's race.
Alonso made his Formula One debut with Minardi in 2001 but wasn't thinking of winning that day in Melbourne.
"It was just ready for the first race.
"When you're world champion, there are many memories from the past, 20 years in different motorsports," says Alonso.
"When I was 10 years old to 15 years old, in my room when I opened the door to get clothes, I had a photo of Ayrton with a car.
This season Alonso is joined at the Italian team's Maranello headquarters by Kimi Raikkonen -- the last driver to win the championship for the Scuderia back in 2007.
I will tell you that two championships are more than I could dream of -- I never thought I'd become a Formula One driver, I never thought I'd win one grand prix.
I'm extremely proud and extremely happy with my career," Alonso says.
