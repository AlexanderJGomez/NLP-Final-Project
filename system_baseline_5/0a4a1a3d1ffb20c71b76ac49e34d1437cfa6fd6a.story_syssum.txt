Weeks said that the boys' father, John Skelton, told police that he dropped the boys off Friday morning with a woman he identified as Joann Taylor -- in part to ensure they didn't see him while and after he tried to commit suicide.
"We have not been able to locate a Joann Taylor or confirm that she even exists," Weeks told reporters Saturday evening.
Still, Weeks reiterated that they have yet to confirm she is real and, if so, if she is with the boys.
The alert notes that Tanner is 3 feet, 6 inches tall, has strawberry blond hair, has blue eyes and weighs about 40 pounds.
