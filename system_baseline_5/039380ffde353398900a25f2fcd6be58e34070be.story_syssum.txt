Factory allows small start-ups to work on the same campus as more established tech companies, providing a "playground for entrepreneurs and innovators."
The big and important difference between other work spaces and us is that we're stage agnostic so we have later-stage companies or established companies like Mozilla, local heroes like Soundcloud or Wunderkinder, which are role models for younger founders to look up to.
SS: I think what you should do is look at the individual stages of development of the company.
I think it's always important to have that visually in front of you, to be aware of what it really means to be a small, flexible team.
So for anyone who wants to be part of that movement, it would make sense to be here.
