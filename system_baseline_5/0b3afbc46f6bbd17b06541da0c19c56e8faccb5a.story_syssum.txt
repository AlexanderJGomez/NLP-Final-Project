Jan Brewer.
The bill was sent to Brewer on Monday and she has five days to sign it, veto it, or do nothing and it would become law.
As secretary of state, Brewer landed the gubernatorial gig in 2009 after previous Gov.
Just over a year into her tenure, Brewer rose to national prominence after signing SB1070 into law, a strict immigration measure also known as the "show me your papers" law that allows law enforcement to ask people for legal documents, which critics say leads to racial profiling of Latinos.
While she vetoed a similar measure last year, it had nothing to do with the content of the bill, but political power plays inside the Arizona state Capitol.
Brewer said the state couldn't afford it, and she defended her decision in court.
A letter that numerous business leaders sent Brewer on Monday encouraged her to oppose it.
And Brewer is well liked in the business community.
Brewer is also facing growing support for a veto.
And according to the local newspaper in Prescott, state Sen. Steve Pierce, who voted for the measure, is now urging Brewer to pick up her veto pen.
"Our policies emphasize tolerance and inclusiveness, and prohibit discrimination based on age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or any other improper standard," Brian McCarthy said.
