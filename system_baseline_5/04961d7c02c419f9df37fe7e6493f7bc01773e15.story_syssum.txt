Now the estate of Marshall is releasing some of the never-before-seen photos of the band in a new book "The Rolling Stones 1972" (Chronicle Books), out on August 15.
Amelia Davis, a photographer who worked as Marshall's assistant, is the sole owner of Jim Marshall Photography.
"He really was everywhere with the musicians on the tour bus or offstage," Davis said.
Marshall's ability to camouflage without disturbing the band's dynamic also allowed him to experience the touring life of the Rolling Stones, Davis said.
Davis said that Marshall's strong personality, fierce passion for music and his drive to get the best pictures while maintaining a sense of camaraderie made him relatable to musicians such as Richards.
"Mick was very business-oriented," Davis said.
Davis said that while Marshall spent a short time following the Stones, it was enough to create a bond with some of the members, especially Richards.
He said, 'I was a historian with a camera and I didn't know it.'
