The man who dazzled the world of golf by accumulating 14 majors by the age of 32 has now gone five seasons without a single one.
"I view it as every year's a big year," 38-year-old Woods told a press conference.
Woods won five PGA Tour titles in 2013 -- the tenth time in his illustrious career that he's done so.
If Woods needed a reminder of where his game used to be in the majors, he will get it this season.
The British Open returns to Royal Liverpool -- where Woods won in 2006 -- before the final major of the season, the PGA Championship, is staged at Valhalla in Kentucky, where Woods took the title in 2000.
You evolve as you age and I think I've done that so far."
