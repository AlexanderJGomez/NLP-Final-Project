In particular, one area where life seems to be imitating art is the fledgling field of 'swarm robotics', in which scientists are creating teams of robots that can work together toward a single goal -- from mending a leak to clearing mines -- with minimal or no input from humans.
Recently, researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) unveiled 'M-blocks' - robots that can assemble themselves into different shapes to perform a range of basic tasks, without input from a human controller.
At the moment researchers are still working to make teams of robots complete more basic tasks.
Aaron Becker, a postdoctoral researcher at Rice University has been working on an experiment (that you can join in here) to test different ways swarm robots can be deployed, with a view to seeing 'nano-robots' eventually used in medical operations.
Other researchers are investigating ways to use swarming robots in diagnosis, so that problems are detected before they become life threatening.
The Israeli Defense Force is also investigating how one can use miniature robotic mosquitoes in the same context."
