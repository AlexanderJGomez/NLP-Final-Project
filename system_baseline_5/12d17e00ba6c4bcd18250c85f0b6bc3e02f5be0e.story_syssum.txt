"I've instructed my attorney to sue Rita Cosby, the publisher and any source that spits out some of that false, defamatory information that's in there," Birkhead said Tuesday on CNN's "Larry King Live."
Birkhead said Cosby's sources on the Stern allegations were two maids, whose reliability is questionable, and Jackie Hatten, a woman who claims to be a friend of Smith's -- and who, according to the book, says she is the one who walked in on Stern and Birkhead.
In a statement issued to TMZ.com, Hatten said she has not read the book, but "Rita Cosby is such a reputable reporter and person, I can only assume it is true and credible.
Ron Rale, a former Smith attorney and a friend of Stern's, told "Larry King Live" Stern would "absolutely" join in the suit against Cosby.
Asked by TMZ.com about the video earlier Tuesday, Cosby said, "I have not seen the videotape, but I will say that we have enough corroborating people who say that they have.
Birkhead told CNN Cosby never called him to verify the allegations or told him she was writing a book.
