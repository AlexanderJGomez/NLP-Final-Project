There are 100 to 130 additional patient records still to review, according to Sledge.
The center is offering free tests to those involved and the clinic will provide all necessary care and treatment without charge should a veteran test positive for the viruses, Sledge said.
Veterans could still receive care at other facilities, Sledge said.
