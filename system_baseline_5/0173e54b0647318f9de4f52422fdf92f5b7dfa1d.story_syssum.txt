Hue is, in many ways, a city of ghosts, of memories and spirits -- and we play on that in Sunday's episode.
Spirit houses, as I understand them, are designed to deal with the problem of hungry, dissatisfied spirits who may not be settled, who have, for one reason or another, unfinished business left behind.
In the weeks following the initial North Vietnamese taking of the city of Hue, many hundreds -- if not thousands -- of citizens, deemed dangerous or counterrevolutionary or otherwise undesirable, were summarily executed and buried in unmarked mass graves by the communist forces.
For this reason, this episode is haunted by ghosts.
It's not.
You will see me with some old friends -- and you will, as always in Vietnam, see me eating some amazing food.
