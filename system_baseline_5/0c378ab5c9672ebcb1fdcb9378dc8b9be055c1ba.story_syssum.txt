Posey plays "Susan," a powerful marketing executive overseeing a chain of grocery stores.
CNN: My first impression of you is that you're fearless.
So, when something is good, I end up doing it.
Posey: There are things about "Susan" that I think are very of this time right now.
Her female powers aren't female, they are totally male.
CNN: She even demands fun.
It's not like that in other countries.
Posey: It's a really laid-back thing like cooking or having friends over and just talking.
I can't really watch it, I just get too, there's so much that needs to be done, I get kind of down about politics.
CNN: I wonder what Susan's reaction would be to all the men talking about women's issues.
Posey: I think she'd be really mad.
Posey: I just didn't care enough about it.
They probably wanted me to audition and I didn't feel like doing it, or maybe they wanted me to jump through hoops and I didn't feel like doing it.
