Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- A Japanese coast guard crew member has confessed to leaking a video of a boat collision that sparked a recent diplomatic battle between China and Japan, officials said Wednesday.
After the collision, Japan detained the crew of the Chinese fishing boat off the disputed islands in the East China Sea.
Japan has since released the fishing crew, which China says was stopped illegally.
