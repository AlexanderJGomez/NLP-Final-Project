Watch Obama say he's outraged by bonuses Â»
Obama said he would work with Congress to change the laws so that such a situation cannot happen again.
Under pressure from the Treasury, AIG scaled back the bonus plans and pledged to reduce 2009 bonuses -- or "retention payments" -- by at least 30 percent.
"There's no reason why those at AIG shouldn't do the same," he said.
In the House, Democrats are trying to shame AIG executives into forgoing the bonuses.
Both aides said it is unclear what authority Congress might have to force AIG to take back the bonuses.
The actions of AIG do just the opposite, and every American is justified in their outrage at this breach of public trust," he said.
"Previously, AIG had agreed at our request to make no payments out of its $600 million Financial Products deferred compensation pool," he said.
