How Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan performs if he secures a first round victory in Sunday's Presidential election will determine if this sizable emerging market can restore its luster as an engine for growth and a regional political force.
But many believe this presidential election will not broaden democracy in Turkey, but only help Erdogan consolidate his grip on power in an effort to burnish his legacy.
Those who are close to the current President Abdullah Gul tell me the moderate counter-weight to Erdogan will stay out of the political cross-fire and let this experiment to create a presidential system of government play out.
If achieved, Turkey would be in the top ten of global economies.
Whether it can live up to those expectations will depend on prudent financial management, but also on how "Team Erdogan" conducts relations within the global investment community.
He wants to secure his place in history.
