Workers next to the spot where subway trains will one day emerge from the tunnel.
"Istanbul is a dynamically changing city, every year increasing in population," says Zeynep Buket, an engineer working with Turkey's transportation ministry.
The "radical system" city planners embarked on five years ago involved construction of a new subway tunnel beneath the Bosphorus Strait, the spectacular body of water that cuts this city in two.
Today, engineers face equally daunting challenges building a tunnel beneath one of the world's busiest shipping channels, at depths of up to 55 meters, in an active earthquake zone.
First they dredged a trench on the bottom of the Bosphorus.
In Yenikapi, a neighborhood of textile factories and seedy hotels where one of the main transit stations for Istanbul's new subway and commuter rail system was to be built, archaeologists discovered the lost Byzantine port of Theodosius.
Until its rediscovery in 2004, archaeologists said they only knew about the port from ancient books.
"At around one meter below sea level, we started finding the remains of ropes.
In one tent, two workers carefully uncover the ancient wooden beams of a 40-meter long merchant vessel.
Historians say the new discoveries include the first examples of ships being built using the beginnings of the "skeleton approach" to constructing the vessel's hull.
It is the beginning of engineering.
Plans to travel beneath the Bosphorus have been delayed at least four years by the excavation of the Theodosious Port.
In the rush to move forward, the residents of Istanbul have accidentally uncovered a valuable piece of their city's ancient past.
