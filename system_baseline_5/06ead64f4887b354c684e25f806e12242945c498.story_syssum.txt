"I mean, I've prepared the exact same way that I've prepared for the last few major championships, and I feel it's a process that works for me, " he told of the official British Open website.
"That works for me.
It seems to have worked the last few times, so I just need to keep doing that."
He will be looking to match the spectacular 63 at last year's British Open at St Andrews which gave him the first round lead, but not the second round 80 which ended his chances of victory.
"As soon as you get that one win, it kind of opened up the door, gave me a lot of confidence, and I've been playing very well since then," he added.
