Teens at Camp Ayandeh learn how to blend their parents' history and culture with their contemporary lifestyles.
It's so common that Ayandeh counselors said the camp was created three years ago to address both Iranian and American parts of a new generation of Iranian-American youth -- a community they define as being "hyphenated."
"We're really becoming mindful of how we define things," said Natasha Sallahi, a first-time counselor and aspiring filmmaker.
Iranian-American teens from high schools across the nation now flock to the new Georgia address to learn about their heritage and ask questions that range from relationships and college admissions to sexual orientation and discrimination -- issues that can come with distinctly different social parameters than their parents were once accustomed to in Iran.

"I eat American food for lunch," he said.
"I read about American literature in the morning [at school]," Moazami said.
Unlike many of the American-born campers, Behnam immigrated to the United States at 5 after being born in Tehran.
Twelve years after arriving in the U.S., Behnam is part of a loyal following that returns to Camp Ayandeh each year.
