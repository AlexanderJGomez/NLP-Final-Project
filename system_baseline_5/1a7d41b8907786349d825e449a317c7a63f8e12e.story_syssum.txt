Atlanta (CNN) -- A North Georgia chapter of the Ku Klux Klan has applied to "adopt" a stretch of highway in Union County, Georgia, according to paperwork obtained by CNN on Monday.
Chambers told CNN she didn't know anything about that meeting but said the group is supposed to meet with the DOT at some point.
"We're not racists," Chambers said Monday.
However, the Missouri Department of Transportation eventually kicked the KKK out of the program because members were not picking up trash as agreed, spokesman Bob Brendel said Monday.
Georgia has been participating in the Adopt-A-Highway program for more than 20 years.
"I don't see why we can't (adopt the stretch of highway)," she said.
We're just white people that want to stick with white people.
Just because I'm white, I can't stick with my own group?"
