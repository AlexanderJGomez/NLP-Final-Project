Speaking to reporters ahead of this week's summit of the Group of Eight industrialized nations in Japan, Bush said he did not need to skip the ceremony to show his position on religious freedom and human rights in China.
Bush assured Japan that the issue of North Korea's past kidnappings of Japanese citizens will not be ignored by the United States.
Fukuda said he believes the United States "has not lost its sense of direction" on the issue.
Bush said the United States and Japan leads the world in research on clean technologies.
"What's essential in this summit for George W. Bush is to make sure the world economy does not spin downward," he said.
Bush has downplayed what he and other G-8 leaders can accomplish on the economic front.
