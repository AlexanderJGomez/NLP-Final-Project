(CNN) -- When Wisconsin temple gunman Wade Michael Page arrived at Fort Bragg in 1995, the sprawling Army base in North Carolina already was home to a small number of white supremacists including three soldiers later convicted in the murder of an African-American couple.
"What he told me during the course of our time together was that he really started to identify with the neo-Nazism during his time in the military," said Simi, who met Page in 2001 while doing a study on white power groups in California.
Page joined the Army in 1992 and ended up at Fort Bragg in 1995, around the time that the base became the focus of white extremism in the military when three members of the 82nd Airborne Division stationed there were arrested in connection with the murder of an African-American couple in nearby Fayetteville.
He talked about the racial holy war a lot," said Chris Robillard, who met Page at Fort Bragg in 1995 when both were doing psychological operations training.
"And, you know, the military is a massive operation like the U.S. population.
"He had gone through a dramatic change," Robillard said of the meeting, the last time he saw Page in person.
"His talk about the racist war was ... more like he really did believe it."
"His commanding officer went to the barracks and anything that was racist or seemed to be racist, he made them send it home," Leyden said.
It found that less than 1% said they had seen soldiers or civilian employees involved with extremist groups.
