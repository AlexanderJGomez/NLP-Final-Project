Zineb El Rhazoui, a writer with Charlie Hebdo, said the cover means the magazine's journalists were forgiving the extremists for the killings.
As Middle East analyst Juan Cole has argued, they were just an excuse for Islamic zealots to further widen and exploit the perceived gulf between Islam and "the West."
This is why it is baffling that political voices around the world, especially conservatives, have argued that we must show our support for Charlie Hebdo and free speech by reprinting the magazine's offensive cartoons.
Some have indeed argued that because some radical Islamists resort to violence it justifies not only broad offenses and smears of the entire religion but also thinking of such smears against Islam as different from those directed at Judaism or Christianity.
So do cartoons that blaspheme the Prophet Mohammed.
So I support the right of Charlie Hebdo to print the most outlandish, offensive cartoons it can come up with.
And, to give another example, I support the free speech rights of French comedian Dieudonné M'bala M'bala — even though I personally find his anti-Semitic jokes even more offensive and sick than any of the Charlie Hebdo cartoons I've seen.
The question for the rest of us — the ones who have free speech — is whether we feed the apocalyptic narrative or fight it.
