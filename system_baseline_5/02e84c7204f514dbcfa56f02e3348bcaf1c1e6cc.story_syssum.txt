Los Angeles (CNN) -- Delays in deposing Kanye West and other witnesses in the divorce of Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries mean the 72-day marriage may not legally end until next year, lawyers said at a hearing Wednesday.
"Ms. Kardashian had no intention of going through with the marriage," Waller said.
Humphries' case is taking longer to build because of delays in getting documents from NBC Universal and Bunim/Murray Productions, two companies involved in the wedding broadcast, Waller said.
Kardashian answered the door at her Los Angeles home on July 16 when a process server knocked and said told her he had something for West, Waller said.
West was not there at the time, Kardashian lawyer Laura Wasser said.
A trial date of early 2013 may be set then, he said.
