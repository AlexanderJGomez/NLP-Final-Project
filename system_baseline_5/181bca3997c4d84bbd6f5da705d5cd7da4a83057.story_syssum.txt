Mexico City (CNN) -- An explosion rocked the offices of Mexico's state oil company Thursday, killing at least 25 people and injuring 101, Mexico's interior minister said.
The explosion tore through the building "from the inside out," he said, and rescuers found many people trapped.

"Entering the building, we smelled a strong odor of gas," said Christopher Rangel, a paramedic and firefighter.
The explosion occurred in an annex building just to the east of the tower, Foreign Minister Jose Antonio Meade said.
"We will get to the bottom of the causes in close coordination with the authorities," Pemex Director General Emilio Lozoya Austin said.
As they combed through the rubble, a Pemex executive's cell phone rang, Rangel said.
CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet reported from Atlanta.
