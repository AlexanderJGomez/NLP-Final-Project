Hoping to tap into the events market, Reykjavik has set to work building its conference infrastructure.
Perhaps the most prominent display of the city's corporate courtship is the newly built Harpa, a combo concert hall and convention center that opened May 2011.
"We may be a small country, but we've got big ideas," says Karitas Kjartansdottir, Harpa's conference director.
"It will be a long time before we get another meeting as prominent as the Reykjavik Summit," says Gudmundsson.
The Blue Lagoon -- the most visited sight in Iceland -- is also set up for meetings and conferences.
"The Blue Lagoon brings more energy to business groups, and makes corporate events more fun and productive," notes Magnea Guomundsdottir, the director of public relations for Blue Lagoon Iceland.
As if the setting wasn't unique enough, Blue Lagoon has also arranged DJs, circuses and modern dance performers for corporate events.
