"I looked around and I saw this huge whale coming out of the water and smashing against the side of the boat," Werner told CNN.
"The whale slipped back into the water but we just saw the mast with all its rigging and everything flying towards us, and that was scary, actually."
Because the couple had been sailing without the engine on, the whale had failed to hear them, she said.
Werner said the whale appeared to be unhurt by the experience: "We saw it afterwards and there was no blood or anything.
Obviously it's a bonus if you see a whale but we didn't quite count on having one on top of the boat."
