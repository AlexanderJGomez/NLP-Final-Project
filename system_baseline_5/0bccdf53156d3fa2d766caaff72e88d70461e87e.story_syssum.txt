But these wrist gadgets are nothing new.
Microsoft created a software platform called SPOT that delivered news updates to watches via FM radio waves for $59 a year.
LG and Samsung gave that category a whirl late last decade, but the devices were way too expensive and not nearly as functional as a traditional smartphone.
It seems like the public is finally ready to accept smartwatches the way they accepted Apple's iPad.
The answer seems to be to make a device that isn't a replacement for your smartphone, but a clever companion, something that takes away the need to pull out your phone from your pocket or purse.
We weren't ready for smartwatches before, but now that smartphones are so ingrained in our lives, Apple and others appear smart to give wearable tech another chance.
