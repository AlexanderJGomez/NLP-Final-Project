Atlanta (CNN) -- More than two dozen college players on three major Division I football teams staged an unauthorized protest of the NCAA during their games Saturday.
CNN caught up with two other players who wore APU on their gear after the Georgia Tech game.
Huma, the NCPA president, later told CNN that he hadn't heard of any players being disciplined for wearing the gear.
"This is big business.
Dent said he's particularly troubled by the fact that the NCAA can cut short a player's education if they get hurt.
Huma said the NCAA doesn't force universities to pay medical bills for injured players, and that if a student doesn't graduate before their eligibility expires, they aren't guaranteed an education.
"Any way we can gain leverage, we try," Huma said.
