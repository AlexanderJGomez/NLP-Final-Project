France, Spain, Portugal and Italy refused to let the president's plane fly through their airspace after rumors surfaced that Snowden might be on board, Bolivian officials said.
Speaking alongside Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro at a rally in a packed stadium in Bolivia Thursday evening, Morales said officials should analyze whether to shut down the U.S. embassy in his country.
In several speeches Thursday, Morales said he had been targeted for his indigenous background.
The situation, they said, was a flagrant violation of international treaties.
The leaders said they supported Morales' complaint to the United Nations High Commissioner of Human Rights over the matter, and they called for their countries' foreign ministers to form a committee to investigate what happened.
"What just happened with the South American indigenous leader Evo Morales shows the level of madness and desperation that the (U.S.) empire has reached," he said.
He arrived from Hong Kong.
"We cannot lie to the international community by carrying ghost passengers," Bolivian Foreign Minister David Choquehuanca said.
France "never intended to deny president Morales' plane access to (its) airspace," and the Bolivian leader is welcome in France, Fabius said.
France said Thursday it had refused the request.
Iceland has said it can't consider Snowden's request for asylum there until he's in its territory.
