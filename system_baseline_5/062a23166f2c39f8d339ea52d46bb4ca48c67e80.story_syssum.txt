(CNN) -- The small plane had crashed in an extremely remote part of Alaska, miles from the tiny village of St. Mary's.
Had it not been for her going for help, more victims might have died, said Clifford Dalton, a paramedic for LifeMed Alaska.
Dalton said he and his partner, Paul Garnet, helped treat the patients at the site.
It left Bethel at 5:40 p.m. and went down about four miles from the St. Mary's airport.
Four of those injured were hospitalized in fair condition, officials said.
The National Transportation Safety Board said Sunday it was too early to determine if weather was the cause.
