(CNN) -- Some Gulf Coast residents and former clean-up workers are suffering from an array of mysterious illnesses, according to a Louisiana physician who has treated dozens of patients complaining of similar symptoms.
Robichaux said "there's no question" that these health difficulties are caused by contact with oil and dispersant.
He said the health problems he sees get very little national attention.
The April 20, 2010 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon led to the worst oil spill in U.S. history, with more than 200 million gallons of oil released into the Gulf.
