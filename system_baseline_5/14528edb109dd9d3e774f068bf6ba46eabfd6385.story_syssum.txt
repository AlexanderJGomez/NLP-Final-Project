Supporters hope Zahra Rahnavard will become Iran's future first lady.
Wherever Mousavi -- a centrist candidate -- goes, Rahnavard is usually nearby.
Wearing a floral headscarf and a traditional black chador -- a full-length loose robe that women in Iran wear like a cloak -- Rahnavard called for freedoms she says were lost during President Mahmoud Ahmadijenad's term.
"I am really angry here in Iran with the position of women," said Saghar Kouhestani, adding that she supports Mousavi because of his wife.
Over the weekend, the Iranian government blocked access to the social networking site Facebook, where Mousavi has a page with more than 5,000 supporters, the semi-official Iranian Labor News Agency (ILNA) said.
"This is the first time after the Revolution we see a lady behind the president," said Farhad Mahmoudi.
