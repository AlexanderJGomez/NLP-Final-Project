Why?
Awful.
Shapiro and the show's two other hosts -- Chris Dimino and Nick Cellini -- were fired Monday evening.
But Gleason isn't just any Saint.
Gleason also explained his struggles with, and triumphs over, the disease.
"The pressure is to try to do a good radio show, and that wasn't a good moment," Shapiro recalled.
Within hours, the radio station and its parent company had suspended Cellini, Dimino and Shapiro.
All three hosts have apologized on Twitter and personally to the Team Gleason foundation, as Gleason himself wrote on Facebook.
At the same time, he's personally shaken for his part in offending so many -- including Gleason, those fighting ALS and the city of New Orleans.
"And to make fun of those, it's an awful thing.
That's what should have happened to Cellini, Dimino and Shapiro, according to Sirius XM radio host Jay Thomas of New Orleans, where he says "Steve Gleason is an icon."
The Atlanta saga would have ended better if the fired radio hosts, after being suspended for some time, had returned to talk about ALS with Gleason and raised money for the cause, said Thomas.
