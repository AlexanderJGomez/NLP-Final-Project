GAZA CITY, Gaza (CNN) -- Israeli forces fired on a U.N. aid convoy Thursday in Gaza, killing at least one contract worker and prompting the U.N. to halt some of its operations in Gaza, U.N. officials said.
Ging expressed frustration with the Israeli military, which he said cleared the convoy to travel into Gaza.
Ging said an Israeli liaison did not dispute that Israeli forces fired on the vehicle.
The absence of foreign journalists -- whom Israel has barred from entering Gaza -- is preventing the truth about conditions there from getting out, Ging said.
Palestinian medical sources said Thursday that 765 Palestinians have died in Gaza -- nearly 40 percent of them women and children -- since the Israeli military operation began.
More than 20 rockets were fired into Israel on Thursday, Israeli police said.
During the three-hour "truce" on Thursday, large explosions could be heard from central Gaza and small arms fire from northern Gaza, according to CNN's Ben Wedeman, reporting from along the Israel-Gaza border.
Also, Israeli armored bulldozers demolished a home in Gaza "just as the lull was supposed to go into effect," he said.
A three-hour truce on Wednesday was also marred by fighting which Israeli officials said were in retaliation for Hamas attacks on Israeli forces.
