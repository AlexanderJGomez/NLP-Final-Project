Brisbane, Australia (CNN) -- Emergency services and Australian military personnel stepped up the search Friday for dozens of people still missing in Queensland as authorities and residents tried to assess the damage caused by the state's worst flooding in decades.
The search was concentrated to the west of Brisbane, near Toowoomba, which was all but submerged when a wall of water tore through the town on Monday.
Aerial views of Brisbane showed islands of roofs and treetops jutting from a sea of muddy brown water -- or stranded high-rises jutting starkly from murky river overflow.
Bligh said 11,900 homes in Brisbane were fully flooded and 14,700 were partially flooded.
Queensland police have arrested 10 people on 18 charges of looting, Atkinson said.
Some 600 members of the Australian Defence Force were helping and more were expected, said Bligh.
So far, 70 towns and cities in Queensland have been affected by the flood, Bligh said.
By late Thursday, the brown, murky water had risen more than half a meter above the second floor.
Numbers are expected to fall in coming days as people find alternative accommodations.
"We've been coming back and forward just to check" on the hostel, Jackson said.
