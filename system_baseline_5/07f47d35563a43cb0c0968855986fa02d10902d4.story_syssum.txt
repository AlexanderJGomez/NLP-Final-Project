A group of 15 artists in Nepal are turning that trash into art.
Everest 8848 Art Project I" created last year, they have collected 1.5 tons of garbage brought down by climbers from the mountain, including remains of a helicopter that had crashed into the slopes during the 1970s.
Nineteen pieces have been sold so far, and part of the proceeds will be given to Everest Summiteers Association, which has collaborated with the project.
In last two years, the association has collected over 10 tons of garbage from the Everest, but it estimates that another 10 tons are still littering the slopes.
Turning trash into art is one way of managing waste.
"We hope our creative works of art will inspire and encourage people to keep the mountains clean," Shahi said.
