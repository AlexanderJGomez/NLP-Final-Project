(CNN) -- Eleven people died as Hurricane Sandy pummeled Cuba on Thursday, state media reported.
We have never had a storm hit like this," said a woman named Dulce, a doctor in the city of Santiago.
The same province was hit hard by Sandy.
It is a "small storm" with "mediocre wind," he said.
Sandy may not be a Category 5 monster, but "we take it seriously, and we just want to make sure we are comfortable," he said.
Think there could be some debris, but in Nassau things are not as bad as they may be in the outer islands," CNN iReporter Cynthia Russell, an administration manager, said.
"It depends on where it hits."
Fort Lauderdale's Ocean Rescue advised beachgoers to stay out of the water, but acknowledged not everyone would heed the warning.
The five-day forecast from the National Hurricane Center predicts the center of the storm will shadow the East Coast in the coming days, with Sandy potentially making landfall as a tropical storm in New Jersey the day before Halloween.
Sandy also claimed two lives before reaching Cuba.
The government ordered evacuations of high-risk zones and canceled schools.
