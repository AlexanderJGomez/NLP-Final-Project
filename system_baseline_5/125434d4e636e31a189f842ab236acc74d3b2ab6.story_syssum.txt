(CNN) -- Bea Arthur, the actress best known for her roles as television's "Maude" and the sardonic Dorothy on "The Golden Girls," has died of cancer, a family spokesman said Saturday.
Arthur's opinionated Maude first appeared on Norman Lear's "All in the Family" as Edith Bunker's cousin, and was so popular that Lear created a spin-off series.
Along the way, she had a short-lived marriage she never spoke about, but she kept the last name -- Arthur.
Arthur left "Maude" in 1978, making television and some film appearances afterward.
The role earned Arthur a second Emmy -- the first was for "Maude."
Arthur entered semi-retirement after the show ended in 1992, returning to television in sporadic guest appearances and appearing at several celebrity roasts.
