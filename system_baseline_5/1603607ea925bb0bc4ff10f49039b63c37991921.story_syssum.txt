Marouane Fellaini, derided for much of the season following a nightmare year at Manchester United, headed home an equalizer with 20 minutes remaining after entering the fray as a substitute.
Even so, while Belgium boasts undoubted talent, its players have hardly excelled in European competition this year.
Arsenal's Thomas Vermaelen has spent most of the year as a substitute, while Fellaini has become a figure of fun following a number of disappointing displays at club level.
His strike, which came from the penalty spot after 24 minutes, might have sealed a historic win for an Algeria side which has never qualified from the group stage in its past three attempts.
It wasn't until the 66th minute that it created a real opportunity when Divock Origi, on as substitute for the disappointing Lukaku, fired straight at the Algeria goalkeeper.
Belgium's next game is against Russia on June 22 while Algeria takes on South Korea later that day.
Fortunately for Russia, Kerzhakov's strike ensured Russia avoided defeat after falling behind with 22 minutes remaining.
