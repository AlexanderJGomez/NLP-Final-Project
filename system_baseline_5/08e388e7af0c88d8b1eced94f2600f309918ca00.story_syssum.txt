A memoir detailing Shin Dong-hyuk's life, "Escape from Camp 14" hit the bookshelves in South Korea this month.
"The existence of prison camps in the North should be known to the people around the world," Shin said.
While the book was not the sole reason, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay met with Shin and another North Korean prison camp survivor in December
"I'm grateful for people who are paying attention to the North Korean human rights situation," Shin said.
"I think the most challenging thing still today is the past heartbroken story should be explained over and over again," Shin said.
The single photo resonated with him as "an outcry from the prison camp" that pressed the world for help.
The evidence of the North Korean prisons are overwhelming as more than 60 people have given detailed, consistent accounts, Harden said.
Shin was a product of a reward marriage in the prison camp.
Shin's testimony has encouraged the world to "grapple with the suffering," rather than just lampoon North Korea as a punchline, Harden said.
