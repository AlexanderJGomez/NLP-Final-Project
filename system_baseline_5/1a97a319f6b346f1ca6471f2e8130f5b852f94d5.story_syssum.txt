He has a point -- gun policy is a back burner debate these days, largely because Democrats who had pushed for tighter gun laws concluded it's bad politics.
Democratic strategists said they believe Gore and other Democrats lost critical votes in rural America by pushing for stricter gun laws.
"For many Democrats, it's smart politics not to get into the gun control debate," he said.
But Senate Democrats wouldn't hold a vote, and Giffords' Republican colleagues in the House said at the time new laws were useless.
Why?
But the NRA is still active and not afraid to throw its weight around on topics that even tangentially involve gun policy.
That's why the president is trying to heed the lesson of Gore and not go there when it comes to gun control.
"When we're done speaking out, sir, gun owners will have made the difference in key precincts in battleground states," NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre told the organization's meeting in April.
