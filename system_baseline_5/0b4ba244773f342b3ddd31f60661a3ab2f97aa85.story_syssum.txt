Twenty years on, two of Germany's most celebrated tennis players -- whose personal relationship was limited by an intense rivalry -- have still to raise a glass to their historic win.
The Olympics had come at the height of the duo's rivalry, says Becker, with the pair not just the best tennis players in Germany but also the world, as they vied with one another for major honors.
Yet although the partnership's strength was tested on repeated occasions in Spain, with their last three matches all going to five sets, Stich and Becker came through -- a result of single-minded ambition in their two-man team, says a British sports psychologist.
Research in sports psychology suggests that players do not have to like each other for a team to be successful."
One reason why Sheringham and Cole could channel their enmity for the good of the team was the influence of Sir Alex Ferguson.
"Team sports can often be individual sports because each individual is trying to be chosen for the team and garner the manager's attentions, so team sports lend towards some rivalry within the team," says Abraham.
Although their two years together resulted in a championship apiece, their frequent clashes -- some of which came on the track -- prompted the Frenchman to leave McLaren, no doubt regretting his decision to persuade the stable to sign Senna as he did so.
Three years on from winning medals as teammates at the world championships, Harding's bodyguard and ex-husband hired an assailant to break one of Kerrigan's legs ahead of the 1994 U.S.
Amid all this dressing room tension as players try to be the main man and with enmity between teammates potentially sinking any team, Abrahams warns that strong friendships between players can also bring complications.
"Strong characters like Becker and Stich can deal with an intense rivalry but the less robust cannot," says Abrahams.
We wanted to win the medal so we had to do well in doubles and we were professional enough to just go on that path."
