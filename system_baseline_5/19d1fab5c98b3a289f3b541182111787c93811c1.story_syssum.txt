Montevideo, Uruguay (CNN) -- The passage of a landmark marijuana legalization measure Tuesday means Uruguay is set to become the first country in the world to have a system regulating legal production, sale and consumption of the drug.
"It is understood that a regulation-based policy has positive consequences for health and public security, given that, on the one hand, it can produce better results when it comes to education, prevention, information, treatment and rehabilitation in relation to the problematic uses of drugs," said Sen. Roberto Conde of Uruguay's Broad Front coalition, which supported the measure.
Critics said legalizing marijuana could have dangerous consequences.
Conservative critics of the measure have said it promotes drug addiction and have suggested that Mujica's comments were uninformed.
Marijuana would also be sold at licensed pharmacies.
The same debates about marijuana that exist in the United States -- about medicinal properties, recreational use, the impact on the justice system -- have been happening in Uruguay for a long time, Calzada said.
"It's a very bad piece of legislation, mainly because it increases the availability of marijuana in the market," he said.
Those younger than 18 would not be allowed to use marijuana under any circumstances.
