(CNN) -- Just one week ago Republicans were united, railing against the man-made evil known as Obamacare.
So the plan to defund Obamacare -- and tie it to a measure to fund the government -- was hatched.
It passed the House, went to the Senate, where Cruz then promptly told reporters it would die.
At that moment, Cruz morphed from the Pied Piper of House Republicans into the man on the Most Wanted sign.
But a funny thing happened on the way to the national stage: The president decided not to cave, and Republicans treated this as if it were shocking that he would not gut his single biggest legislative achievement.
So Republicans had accomplished the seemingly impossible: They trampled their own message on Obamacare.
Great strategy.
So Obamacare had a crashing start, the government is shut down, and the deadline to raise the debt ceiling is a week away.
So what to do?
And some cooler heads I have spoken with are privately making the same point: Wasn't it always unfair to promise people something the Republicans knew they could never deliver (defunding Obamacare)?
In the end, they will probably find a short-term way to fund the government and raise the debt ceiling and continue to argue over spending and taxes.
A study of the newly perverse politics of our time, and how a government was brought to its knees over a fight only a few wanted to wage -- that everyone secretly knew could never be won.
