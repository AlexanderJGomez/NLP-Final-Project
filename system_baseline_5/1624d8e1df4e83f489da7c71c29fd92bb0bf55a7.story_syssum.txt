Washington (CNN) -- Health care reform backers won a key victory Saturday night as the Senate voted to move ahead with a floor debate on a sweeping $848 billion bill.
"Tonight's historic vote brings us one step closer to ending insurance company abuses, reining in spiraling health care costs, providing stability and security to those with health insurance and extending quality health coverage to those who lack it," White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said in a statement.
"Now is not the time to go wobbly in the knees.
... A vote in favor of proceeding to this bill is a vote in favor of adding to the tax burden of the American people in the midst of double digit unemployment."
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected that Reid's 2,074-page bill would extend health insurance coverage to 31 million additional Americans.
The outcome of the Senate vote was unclear before Saturday afternoon, when Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Arkansas, announced her intention to back a floor debate on the measure.
"There's no doubt that this vote will be a critical issue for Sen. Lincoln as she embarks on her uphill re-election bid," said Amber Wilkerson Marchand, a GOP spokeswoman.
Reid's bill, projected to ensure coverage for 94 percent of Americans, includes a range of tax increases and new fees.
Unlike the plan recently passed by the House, the Senate bill does not mandate that all employers offer health care.
Reid's bill also would expand government-run Medicaid coverage for the poor to everyone making less than 133 percent of the national poverty level.
Insurers under both plans would be barred from charging higher premiums based on a person's gender or medical history.
