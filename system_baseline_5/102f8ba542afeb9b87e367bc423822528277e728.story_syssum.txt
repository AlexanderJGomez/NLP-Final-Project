Not again.
At the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, on Thursday, South Korea's Yuna Kim, a 2010 Olympic gold medalist, skated an ethereally beautiful and outwardly perfect long program in the ladies free skating competition.
Setting aside her extreme margin of victory, there are reasons to think the judges got the podium right.
There is a long history of controversy and scandal that continues to hang over the International Skating Federation, particularly as Russia's first individual female gold medalist (and on home ice, no less) brings familiar echoes of the Cold War.
With the new system, too, judges are now anonymous, in hopes of relieving the sport of its former biases.
But the ISU needs to back these efforts with ethical and responsible judges.
If the governing body wants us to talk about figure skating as a sport, it needs to ensure that it behaves like one, with credibility and transparency.
Because while the ladies podium may have been right, with scoring this complex and judges this questionable, why on earth would we believe it?
