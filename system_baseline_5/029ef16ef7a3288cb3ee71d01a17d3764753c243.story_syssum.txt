(CNN) -- The mother of a Brooklyn teenager shot and killed by police demanded an investigation Thursday, saying he was "slaughtered" and that she wants to know why.
"He has a curfew," she said.
Kimani Gray then "turned on them," it said, and pointed a .38-caliber revolver at the officers.
Gray said that her son was killed in front of his best friend's house.
Police said they arrested two people that day.
You just knew it was going to turn into the cops trying to contain those kids who were obviously gonna go for it," Graham said.
The police were caught off-guard," Graham said.
One officer received a gash to his face while another was pushed off his scooter, police said.
"As a black man growing up in Flatbush, you just expect to be harassed by the cops, pulled over, arrested and now just straight up killed," said Shanduke McPhatter, a 35-year-old former gang member who works with young men in the neighborhood.
The violence over Gray's death will eventually subside, but the intense distrust of police will rear itself again violently soon enough in Flatbush, said Lumumba Akinwole-Bandele, a senior organizer with the NAACP.
"There are no community centers here," McPhatter said.
Otherwise, this is just going to keep happening."
