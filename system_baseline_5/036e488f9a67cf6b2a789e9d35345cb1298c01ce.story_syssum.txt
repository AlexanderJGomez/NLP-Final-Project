(CNN) -- Iran has threatened that it will retaliate against the Obama administration's proposed new economic sanctions on Iran's oil exports by blocking the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf.
The Obama administration has ruled out military strikes to stop Iran's nuclear program in favor of tougher sanctions, which, once signed by the president, and if fully implemented, would sharply reduce Iran's oil revenue.
The administration's strategy is based on the assumption that cutting Iran out of the oil market will not substantially impact world oil supply and prices.
Iran notes that Western economies are under stress and predicts they could not afford higher oil prices.
Those advocating new sanctions on Iran's oil industry have said little about the potential cost to the global economy.
Iran hopes its saber-rattling will persuade Asia's economic powerhouses and Persian Gulf emirates to pressure Washington to back away from the new sanctions.
