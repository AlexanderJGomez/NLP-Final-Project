Yet in 2005, a freestyle chess tournament featured teams of humans partnering with computers in various combinations.
In Licklider's view, human intelligence should be complemented by machines, not replaced: "Men will set the goals, formulate the hypotheses, determine the criteria and perform the evaluations.
..."
It's easy to argue that life and death decisions should never be left to machines, but Licklider's vision was much broader, recognizing technology as an enabler for many human capacities.
The tension between the Minsky and Licklider visions has certainly been amplified in the age of so-called big data.
Why is this?
Yet even the nimblest fugitives leave clues, even patterns -- they're just buried in an expanding universe of data, a challenge that intensifies as we seek still more data, hoping it will yield more insight.
Yet how weak is something that can learn in ways even the most robust automated systems can't?
Sometimes, the right combination of humans and technology can reshape the data landscape itself.
Through rapid iteration, a group of determined people using low-friction technology had created a vast, self-regulating system.
Almost 50 years since the identification of Moore's Law, and 10 years since the human genome was first sequenced, humans and machines are beginning a new arc of re-imagining and discovery -- together.
