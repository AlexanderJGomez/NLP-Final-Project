Ralph Steinman, a biologist with Rockefeller University, was named a winner Monday of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.
"The events that have occurred are unique and, to the best of our knowledge, are unprecedented in the history of the Nobel Prize," the Nobel Assembly said in a statement, announcing that Steinman will remain a Nobel laureate.
In 1996, William Vickrey died days after the announcement that he had won the Nobel Prize in economics.
Before 1974, two people received Nobel Prizes posthumously -- Dag Hammarskjold won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1961, and Erik Axel Karlfeldt won for literature in 1931.
The committee will announce the most anticipated of the annual honors -- the Nobel Peace Prize -- on Friday.
Since 1901, the committee has handed out the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 101 times.
