For the first time since they regained control of the House in 2011, Republicans have no plans at the moment to bring up a bill to repeal the law -- something they have done nearly 50 times.
A confluence of events hampered the Republican repeal effort and put it on pause.
Instead, Republicans have gone to great lengths to promote the negative aspects of the law by launching their own public relations campaign.
"It's all negative," Tanner said of the Republican strategy.
"As the law is being implemented, millions are either losing health care or having premiums go up, and Republicans want to make sure that everyone recognizes that."
That has caused Republicans to move away from their blanket calls for repeal to highlighting problems with the law.
"They don't have to go down the legislative road to defund Obamacare at this point because it didn't work," Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said.
While the Republicans have been taking to news conferences, committee hearing rooms and cable television to espouse the negative aspects of Obamacare, Obama has launched his own public relations campaign to highlight the bright parts of the law.
But that aspect of the party might not be pleased with their decision to stop trying to repeal the law.
"Republicans can still say defunding or replacing Obamacare," he said, adding that they can point to the dozens of votes taken to repeal it in the past.
Regardless if Republicans continue to shelve the repeal argument, Tanner said repeal will never happen.
On the other hand, if the law is successful and voters are pleased, the law is unlikely to be rolled back.
