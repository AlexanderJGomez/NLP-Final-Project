BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) -- Thailand's Constitutional Court Tuesday fired the country's prime minister, Samak Sundaravej, for violating the constitution by hosting a TV cooking show while in office.
The 73-year-old Samak continued to appear sporadically on the show "Tasting while Grumbling" after he became prime minister in February.
I said, 'No, I checked the constitution already.
Professor Suchit Bunbongkarn, an expert on the constitution, said the document clearly bans prime ministers from being employed by a private entity.
The protesters are demanding that Samak step down.
Thaksin, who was ousted in a coup in 2006, returned to England last month just as he was to appear in court in a corruption case.
