Now plans are under way to go back, even as the future of U.S. human space exploration is under close scrutiny and pressure is growing on NASA to aim for another alien world.
Constellation grew of out the Vision for Space Exploration, outlined by President George Bush in 2004, but its future now lies in the hands of the U.S. Human Space Flight Plans Committee.

"It's like having your sports car that's super safe and your large SUV," said John Olson, director of the NASA office that plans and integrates programs including Constellation.
At this point, NASA is favoring the heavily cratered south pole because of its scientific interest and the possible presence of water ice, Olson said.
A potential manned mission to the Red Planet wouldn't take place until at least 2030, Olson added.
Critics say NASA should skip the moon and set its sights directly on Mars.
Aldrin plans to present his vision to the U.S. Human Space Flight Plans Committee, Popular Mechanics reported.
Zubrin, who plans to testify before the U.S. Human Space Flight Plans Committee next month, said that if President Obama were to commit the nation to a mission to Mars this year, astronauts could be there by the end of his potential second term in office.
The agency is preparing to retire the space shuttle fleet in 2010, leaving a five-year gap until Orion is scheduled to be ready to launch.
NASA's Olson called the gap a "significant challenge," but said there are no plans to keep the space shuttles flying beyond their current manifest.
