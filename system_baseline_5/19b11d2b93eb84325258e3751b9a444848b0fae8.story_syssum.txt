"The thing that's in common is that Michael Brown is dead and that his death was caused by the actions of Officer Wilson," Peter Joy, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said about the various options.
According to Ed Magee, spokesman for the prosecuting attorney's office, the grand jury is focused on whether Wilson should be charged with any one of several possible crimes, including first-degree murder, second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter.
To prove second-degree murder, prosecutors would have to show that Wilson knowingly caused Brown's death -- that he knew what he was doing was going to cause serious physical injury or death.
If prosecutors can prove Wilson didn't know what he was doing when he fired in the direction of Brown, they might be able to secure an involuntary manslaughter conviction.
If the grand jury decided against an indictment, Wilson would continue to be a free man, at least so far as the state's criminal charges.
