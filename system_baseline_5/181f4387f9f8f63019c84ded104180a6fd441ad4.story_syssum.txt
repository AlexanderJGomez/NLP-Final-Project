(CNN) -- The last political drama of 2012 and the first one of 2013 suggest that if you love America, you might want to consider making your New Year's resolution quitting whatever political party you belong to.
Just as bad, or perhaps worse in terms of the day-to-day lives of average people, the bill only postpones the forced cuts of sequestration by two months, to precisely the moment the country will be engaged in another ruinous debate about lifting our national debt ceiling to ensure the country can pay its bills.
Next time around, the markets will not be so blasÃ© about congressional brinkmanship if the national credit rating and the stability of a bedrock of the international financial system are at stake.
Further, the deal addresses only a tiny slice of the economic problems confronting America.
The deal that was hastily cobbled together actually increases our deficit, and it creates an even bigger potential crisis just weeks from now.
One -- the one Washington will focus on -- is "who is to blame?"
One party speaks on behalf of one set of interests.
Both sides decided not to address it during the political campaign.
The fact that we even call the type of agreement that adequately starts to address our multiple needs a "grand bargain" as if it were some impossible dream reveals much about the current state of play in our nation's capital.
The two-party system is a boon for America when it is seen as providing a voice for two parts of a unified whole.
