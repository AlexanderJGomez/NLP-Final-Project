(CNN) -- A copyright dispute over royalties from an acclaimed film, "Raging Bull," can go the distance after the Supreme Court on Monday allowed a lawsuit to move ahead.
The underlying issue was a lot more dry and technical than the film itself: equitable defense and tolling for remedies in civil copyright claims.
Federal copyright law gave Paula Petrella the sole right to renew the copyrights before the term expired, which she did in 1991.
Paula Petrella claims she is the sole owner of the book and the original screenplay, and that the subsequent film infringes on those copyrights.
The companies say having an open-ended period to file copyright claims makes it hard to make future business decisions.
Copyright experts say the high court's ruling will make it easier to press decades-old copyright claims.
"Increasingly copyright ownership for much of this older content has now been passed down to the families and heirs of the original creators.
The case is Petrella v. MGM, Inc. (12-1315).
