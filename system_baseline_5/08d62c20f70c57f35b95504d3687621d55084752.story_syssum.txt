Although the rules apply to all IM service providers, they are widely seen as targeting WeChat, the immensely popular mobile app that allows people to share text, videos, photos and audio recording with multiple users at once.
Prominent Weibo users were later detained or prosecuted, on charges both related and unrelated to their online activities.
"After the takedown of the Big Vs (verified accounts with huge follower numbers) on Weibo last year, I more or less gave up posting anything to the Chinese Internet," says Goldkorn.
"It's quite obvious now, other public accounts are definitely going to be more cautious about republishing political news because no one knows how strongly the rules will be enforced.
The three-year-old WeChat, owned by Tencent holdings, is unlike any other mobile app.
We welcome users to report such instance to us via online channel."
The government wants to develop the Internet to drive innovation and economic growth, while keeping tabs on any potential political risk bubbling up online," says Lu Stout.
