Phnom Penh, Cambodia (CNN) -- Late one night, after dark, we met up with Don Brewster -- head of Agape International Missions, an NGO fighting child prostitution -- to go behind the scenes at Cambodia's KTVs: karaoke clubs that are fronts for brothels.
We walk into a KTV; Scott and Don lead the way into the karaoke rooms.
We are brought into a low ceilinged, dank room with some disgusting couches and a video screen on one wall.
Don says if we take the elevator up from the basement, we can skip the bar and go straight to the "massage" floor.
We hustle back onto the elevator.
We head to another KTV, this one still upscale but less fortress-like than the last.
An older woman walked in five girls dressed in fairly classy though sexy business suits, for us to take our pick of whom we would like to stay with us.
Don picks one, and so does Scott and the two join us; the karaoke starts in earnest.
The young girl sitting next to me, the one Scott chose, is extremely pretty.
She chooses to sing a song from the Karaoke catalog, a popular dance hit in Khmer, which has a video of a singer performing in front of what looks to be an American style high school dance, again like a prom.
and it talks about how a girl is like a flower, and only has the one time where she has most value.
Thankfully, the hostesses did not seem to mind or care that we were doing this; the whole room was on security cameras poised in the corners but no one came in and stopped us.
"I know it is hard to trust us, strangers," I told her.
I had no idea that I was going to be involved in trying to recruit girls to leave the KTV life and receive the services of Don's NGO.
