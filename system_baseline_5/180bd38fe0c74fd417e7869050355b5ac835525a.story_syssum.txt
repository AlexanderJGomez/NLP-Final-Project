Then earlier this year there was the remix to Rihanna's song "Birthday Cake," in which Brown was the featured guest vocalist offering such coy nuggets as:
In any case, the couple's allusions to their reunion --a Twitter picture showed her embracing a man who appears to be Brown; another showed a man presumed to be Brown face down and shirtless on a bed -- culminated with Brown posting a photo of himself and Rihanna, who appears to be in her underwear.
Rihanna doesn't need to be a spokeswoman for victims of domestic violence, nor does she need to live the rest of her life as a victim.
When the world first saw the images of Rihanna's face after her fight with Brown, many rushed to blanket the songstress with support.
She's right.
After that recording, I thought Rihanna had gotten Brown out of her system.
Oh, I can hear Brown fans now -- leave him alone.
Stop hating.
Hopefully that incident was a one-time thing and she'll be alright.
