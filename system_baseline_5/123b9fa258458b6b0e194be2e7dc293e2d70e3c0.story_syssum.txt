(CNN) -- The U.S. Navy has started a force to battle pirates attacking ships in and near the Gulf of Aden off Somalia's coast, the U.S. Fifth Fleet said Thursday.
Task Force 151 will be devoted solely to counterpiracy efforts, said Lt. Stephanie Murdock, a Fifth Fleet spokeswoman.
"The problem of piracy is and continues to be a problem that begins ashore and is an international problem that requires an international solution," Vice Adm. Bill Gortney, commander of the Combined Maritime Forces, said in a news release from the Fifth Fleet in Manama, Bahrain.
Pirates attacked nearly 100 vessels and hijacked as many as 40 in the waters off the coast of Somalia in 2008, according to the International Maritime Bureau.
Boyah said.
"We went into the deep ocean and hijacked the unarmed cargo ships," Boyah said.
The task forces are part of the Combined Maritime Forces, which includes naval ships and other assets from more than 20 nations.
"The most effective measures we've seen to defeat piracy are non-kinetic and defensive in nature," Gortney said.
