What's wrong with doing an updated version of a beloved Hollywood movie?
Carrie, the rapturous and terrifying 1976 Brian De Palma thriller based on Stephen King's first novel, is a movie that has earned its place as a quirky horror milestone without, perhaps, ever having quite attained the status of a masterpiece.
Yet I personally think it's a great film.
Carrie is a timeless movie because it's both one of the most passionate and most scandalously funny horror films ever made.
The fabled shower-room scene, in which the naïve, sheltered Carrie White (Chloë Grace Moretz) gets her first period and is shocked into thinking that she's dying, now has an added fillip of cruelty: Chris, the most hateful of the girls, doesn't just pelt Carrie with tampons and shout ''Plug it up!''
Despite being 40 years old now, the Carrie story lives quite comfortably in the 21st century.
Yet the way Peirce has updated Carrie White, without making any overt changes to the character, is to portray her as a little less clueless, a little less pathetic, a little more defiant.
And it's here that the real problem with redoing a classic reveals itself.
In the original Carrie, Spacek's character seemed to be channeling something creepy and larger-than-life — maybe it was even the underworld.
