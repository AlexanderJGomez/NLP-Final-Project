Suze Orman says it's a good thing the federal government bailed out troubled national insurer AIG.
Should the government be helping AIG?
AIG is an international giant that just doesn't have ramifications here in the United States.
Everybody has an AIG insurance policy.
The major danger that we had here, which is why you saw the stock markets go up today, is that rumors were circulating that AIG was going to be saved.
Why were they lending money to people who shouldn't have been borrowing money?
Orman: No.
It's not a good time to get in with brand-new money.
Are gas prices going to go down?
Lehman, AIG -- I get that's all bad news, but the good news is for the main people that have to get by every single day.
Your gas bills, in terms of what you put in your cars, aren't going to be as high.
Orman: I personally think it was bad.
You would think that they couldn't, but when you see dinosaurs -- Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, AIG -- going down the drain, anything can happen.
