Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Olympic and Paralympic runner Oscar Pistorius on Sunday canceled his appearance in five upcoming races, days after being charged with murder in the shooting death of his girlfriend in South Africa.
Pistorius, 26, also rejected the murder allegation "in the strongest terms," his agent said in a statement.
I was not expecting anything like this from someone like him," said Nondumiso Mlondo, who lives in Durban.
Just think of those young kids who want to be like him, who are looking up to him.
"It was a shock to the nation when we first heard it ... but it has worn off," he said.
The allegation was a major fall from grace for a man who made history last year by becoming the first double-amputee runner to compete in the able-bodied Olympic Games in London.
I don't have any bitterness," she said.
Images of his sports feats flashed across the screens at the time.
But South African authorities stressed that the scenario did not come from them, and said there was no evidence of forced entry at the home.
"There are 1.5 million gun owners -- about 3.5 million guns in civilians hands," said Alan Storey, chairman of Gun Free South Africa.
Most of the victims of gun homicides in the nation of 50 million people are between the ages 20 and 30, he said.
But the South African Gunowners' Association, a popular gun lobby group, has said citizens have the right to protect themselves from increasingly violent crimes.
Prosecutors said they will argue that he committed premeditated murder.
