(CNN) -- Not so long ago, Germany was vilified for its slow economic growth, high unemployment rates, and record budget deficits.
What West Germans found when they entered East Germany was a society marked by high unemployment rate, low productivity and a lot of poverty.
"German companies became increasingly skilled at understanding foreign markets and leaning towards foreign markets.
Germany turned into one of the world's largest exporters by going even further east to the emerging Asian markets, especially China and India, according to Irwin Collier, professor of economics at Free University Berlin.
"The high Chinese growth rates meant there was enormous demand for German goods."
Hassel said one of the keys to Germany's manufacturing success is the country's unique apprenticeship scheme, in which school leavers spend two to three years training with companies.
During the 2008-09 financial crisis, the loss of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Germany experienced was large compare to other countries, and even today fluctuations in the world economy are immediately felt in the German economy.
In the quarter of a century that has passed since the Berliners tore down that wall, Germany has, no doubt, become an economic superpower.
