Robert Zimmerman was not there the night of the shooting and did not say during the interview how he knew the details of the altercation.
The video did not provide a close-up of Zimmerman's head but some say it shows Zimmerman did not have significant injuries to his face.
Sybrina Fulton, Martin's mother, said the video is another strong piece of evidence proving her son was killed unjustly.
The 17-year-old was shot to death February 26 by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, as Martin was walking back to his father's fiancee's house in Sanford, Florida.
Robert Zimmerman said his son is having a hard time dealing with the criticism.
Robert Zimmerman said her son is not racist and race had nothing to do with incident.
Tracy Martin, Martin's father, said Wednesday that the 911 tape shows Zimmerman was profiling his son.
Angela Corey, the special prosecutor assigned to investigate the case, said Tuesday that investigators would look into the allegations that Zimmerman used a racial slur.
"I feel confident that they're going to do a thorough investigation," Fulton said.
