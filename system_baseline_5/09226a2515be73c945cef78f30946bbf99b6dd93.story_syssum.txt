Qatar Airways and Korean Air are two commercial airlines that offer a similar executive jet chartering service.
The Emirates Executive Airbus A319 can accommodate 19 people, with the plane divided into two main zones.
It's certainly a more affordable option than buying a large private jet outright; an Airbus ACJ318 (similar to the Emirates Executive A319) or long-range Gulfstream G650 costs around $65 million from the respective manufacturers.
According to forecasts by Canadian private jet manufacturer Bombardier, the industry is expected to exceed pre-2008 levels for the delivery of new jets by next year.
David Velupillai, marketing director of executive and private aviation for Airbus says that their jets -- from A318s to superjumbo A380s -- can be fitted out according to their clients' needs.
