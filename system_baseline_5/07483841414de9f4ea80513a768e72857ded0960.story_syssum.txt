(CNN)French police say two suspects in Wednesday's terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine are still on the loose after escaping onto the streets of Paris.
A tactical unit was deployed in an operation about a 144 kilometers (about 90 miles) from Paris in Reims, France, following the attack, CNN affiliate BFMTV reported.
"Everything will be done to arrest (the attackers)," French President Francois Hollande said in a speech Wednesday night.
These developments come after at least two heavily armed men entered the Charlie Hebdo office in Paris' 11th district, close to Place de la Bastille, and opened fire, Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said.
Video shows a gunman approaching his getaway car and raising his finger in the air in what appears to be a signal, possibly to another vehicle or other people who might have played a role in the attack, a Western intelligence source briefed on the French investigation told CNN.
Charlie Hebdo editor and cartoonist Stephane Charbonnier, known as "Charb," is among the dead in the attack, a police spokesman in the district where the office is located told CNN.
"Parisians will not be afraid," Klugman said.
That means there will be reinforced security at media company offices, major stores, religious centers and on public transport, his office said in a statement.
Thursday will be a national day of mourning for those killed in the attack, Hollande said.
He asked for a moment of reflection Thursday and said flags will be at half-staff for three days.
The attack on the magazine spurred a wave of support for the publication and its practices around France and the world.
