Geely's gambit will be watched to see if it paves the way for other Chinese car manufacturers to crack developed markets.
But given that Volvo's brand is staked on its reputation for safety, analysts said the company will have to tread carefully.
China surpassed the U.S. as the largest market for car sales globally in 2009, and most major automakers build cars in China.
Geely chairman Li Shufu said he hoped the company would eventually become a global car brand, but said there were no current plans to begin export its home-grown brand to U.S. showrooms.
