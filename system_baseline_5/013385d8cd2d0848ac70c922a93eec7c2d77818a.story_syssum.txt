Greek leaders, meanwhile, have seized upon this German "transgression" with glee.
To keep these truths from surfacing, German and Greek politicians, each for their own purposes, settled on gigantic loans for Greece that would act as plaster on the festering wounds of the aforementioned bankruptcies.
At the same time, Greek leaders, unwilling to confront their electorate, pretended to believe that they could deliver the targets demanded by Germany.
Once it became abundantly clear that the targets Greece had committed to were well and truly unrealistic, the coalition between our German and Greek leaders became testy.
Neither side is willing to admit that the whole rescue package was flawed from the outset.
The preordained failure of the Greek "program" has not yet exposed our leaders' connivance.
If it is not our leaders' insidious lie, it will be the eurozone.
