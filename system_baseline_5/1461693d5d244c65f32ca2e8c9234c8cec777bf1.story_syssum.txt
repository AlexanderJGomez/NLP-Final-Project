(CNN) --   The love-triangles, family feuds and paternity mysteries of Brazil's telenovelas have commandeered the nation's airwaves for decades and generated a fortune for Globo -- the powerful TV network that produces many of the genre's most popular shows.
Novelas depict the "small, healthy, urban, middle and upper-class consumerist family," says Alberto Chong, one of the study's authors.
But as well as fashioning lifestyle choices, the novelas contribute to an increasing awareness and tolerance of difficult social issues.
Bruno Gagliasso is the star of one of the most popular novelas in Brazil.
"Novelas are used to sell cars and freezers," he tells CNN.
