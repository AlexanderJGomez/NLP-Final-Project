Samuel Tombs, an economist at Capital Economics, said there was an obvious boost to UK economic growth during the Games but it was too early to see a legacy benefit.
Tombs said the figures also showed growth in all areas of the economy, which he noted was was a first in recent years.
On Thursday, Mayor of London Boris Johnson said that the success of the Olympics and Paralympics has spurred investment in the U.K capital.
said the Games were "a triumph of public endeavour... it's a very good example of what a very dynamic and focused public sector can do."
