Leonel Godoy said Tuesday.
Interior Secretary Fernando Francisco Gomez Mont has declared a state of natural disaster for the Michoacan cities of Angangueo, Ocampo, Tiquicheo de Nicolas Romero, Tuxpan and Tuzantla.
More than 3,500 Michoacan residents are homeless, the state government said on its Web site.
Officials also built two dikes to contain the sewage but were unable to use them out of concern that they would burst under the intense pressure from the floodwaters, Luege said.
Mexico state is bordered on the west by Michoacan and adjoins Mexico City on three sides -- north, east and west.
