And another one.
That's how long Clinton's speech lasted on Wednesday night, but no one in Charlotte gave a rip.
Why?
Bill Clinton saved the Democratic Party once.
"Highly effective Clinton speech.
Mitt's speech should have done this."
While speakers at the DNC Tuesday and Wednesday mostly stayed away from the topic, Clinton answered it head-on in his speech, delivering perhaps his biggest moment of the night.
