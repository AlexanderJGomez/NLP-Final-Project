The news release was sparked by recent praise for the senator from Nation of Islam Leader Louis Farrakhan, who has made derogatory remarks about Judaism and has indicated his support for Obama.
Also, in order to diffuse attempts by Democrats and the Left to divert attention from the main point of this release -- that Sen.

Hobbs said Thursday that the party will no longer use Obama's middle name in news releases.
And McCain, who on Tuesday denounced Cunningham's remarks, also indicated Wednesday evening that he disapproved of the news release.
