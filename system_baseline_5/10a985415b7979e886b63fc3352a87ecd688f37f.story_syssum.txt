U.N. monitors on the ground in five Syrian cities are making "all possible efforts to stop violence" and have had "some dampening effect," Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told CNN's Christiane Amanpour.
The report by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria noted the growing power of forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
At least 40 civilians were killed across the country Thursday, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said, among them "a complete family ... martyred in the shelling" of a neighborhood in Hama.
The military has conducted "large-scale" strikes on sites known for "hosting defectors and/or armed persons" escorting protests or supporting the Free Syrian Army, the anti-government resistance force, the report said.
"Many such protests were accompanied by armed groups, which have described their role as providing protection for the demonstrators," the report said.
Anti-government armed groups have executed security forces and suspected collaborators, the report said.
"One anti-government armed group fighter also admitted that he and his associates had killed government soldiers when the captives refused to join them," the report said.
There have been reports of security forces or their supporters confessing under torture after their capture by resistance fighters.
Some experts and officials say neither security forces nor anti-government forces may be responsible, suggesting "third" forces -- such as jihadi groups -- may be to blame.
... We have to prevent this."
The government said the elections were all-inclusive, but opposition forces call the process a sham.
