"My son tried to run thinking his life was in jeopardy," Terez Miles said.
The criminal complaint says the officers, considering Jordan Miles' appearance suspicious, got out of the car and identified themselves as police.
Miles' mother said the officers did not identify themselves as police to her son, a viola player and student at the city's Creative and Performing Arts High School.
The three officers were taken off plainclothes duty and were back in uniform, she said.
Lewis said Jordan Miles has no criminal record.
