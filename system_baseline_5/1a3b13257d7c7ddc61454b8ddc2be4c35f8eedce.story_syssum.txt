Washington (CNN) -- A judge on Monday ordered the release of sealed documents and transcripts from court proceedings related to the murder case of Chandra Levy, a Washington intern whose disappearance in 2001 drew national headlines and damaged a U.S. congressman's political career.
Guandique repeatedly said at his trial he had nothing to do with Levy's death.
Condit was never a suspect in the case, but he was questioned intensively for details about Levy's whereabouts.
Condit denied he and Levy were having an affair, but an FBI forensic expert later confirmed his semen was found in Levy's underwear that was retrieved from her apartment after she went missing.
