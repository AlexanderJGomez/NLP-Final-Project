Miami, Florida (CNN) -- A Miami, Florida, court appearance for Colton Harris-Moore, the so-called "barefoot bandit," has been postponed until Friday, as he did not have a U.S.-based attorney to represent him Wednesday.
In his initial U.S. appearance, he will be told of his rights and read an initial charge of interstate transportation of stolen property, Langlie said.
After his initial appearance, U.S. marshals will take him to the Western District of Washington in Seattle.
Federal prosecutors are working with other states to determine the best way to go forward in this case, but the Washington courts will get him first since he was arrested on their warrant, Langlie said.
Harris-Moore is called the "barefoot bandit" because he was without shoes when he allegedly broke into houses.
