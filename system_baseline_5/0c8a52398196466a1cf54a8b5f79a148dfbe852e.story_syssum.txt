There are a few thousand Egyptians left in Tunisia awaiting evacuation after more than 40,000 were taken home, said Firas Kayal, a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency, on Saturday.
Kayal said Saturday more than 10,000 Bangladeshis are awaiting transport in Tunisia.
Three commercial charter planes will take the Bangladeshis home from Djerba airport later Sunday, the British government said.
The numbers of people entering Tunisia daily from Libya dropped to 1,800 Thursday and Friday and stood at 3,000 Saturday.
The U.S. State Department said Saturday it would donate $3 million to the International Organization for Migration (IOM) as part of a joint U.S.-IOM partnership to help get home thousands of Egyptians and other nationals from Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia.
