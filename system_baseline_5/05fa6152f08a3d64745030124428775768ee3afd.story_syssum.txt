Mills represented herself during the proceedings and was a "less than impressive witness" on her own behalf, Judge Hugh Bennett wrote in awarding her £24.3 million ($48.6 million) -- far less than the £125 million she had sought from McCartney in the dissolution of their four-year marriage.
A summary of Bennett's decision was released Monday, but Mills had sought to keep the full ruling under wraps.

He ruled that Mills earned far less before marriage than she claimed, and far more while married -- and at several points in his decision, he wrote that Mills' ideas about their marriage were "make-belief."
Bennett found Mills failed to produce financial records to back up statements about money she claimed to have in the bank before marriage, which she said amounted to more than £2 million.
The judge said McCartney continued to grieve for his late wife well into his marriage with Mills -- and he suggested Mills misrepresented her case because she had been star-struck.
Bennett discounted Mills' claims that she was anything more than a loving and devoted wife in helping McCartney.
Mills and McCartney failed to agree on a divorce settlement in six days of hearings in February, leaving the judge to decide the terms.
