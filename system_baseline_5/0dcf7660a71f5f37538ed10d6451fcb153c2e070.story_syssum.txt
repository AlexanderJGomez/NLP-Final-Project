New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- In September of 2005, no one could have anticipated what we saw in New Orleans last week.
African-American candidates also won down-ballot races with majority white support, casting a blow to the notion that New Orleans politics and culture are mired in racial tension.
Additionally, the population is nearing 80 percent of pre-Katrina levels, in part due to hardworking residents who came back and a new crop of younger, entrepreneurial transplants moving to the city to be part of what is going on here.
All of this is not to say that everything is going perfectly in New Orleans.
But there is a unity of purpose (thanks in large part to the Saints) that wasn't there even six months ago.
The mayoral election was nothing short of staggering, and the confluence of the Saints win and the historic mayoral election, lined up for the city's best two days since the Battle of New Orleans in 1815.
And in 2018, New Orleans' tricentenary will focus not only on the founding of New Orleans but also its successful rebirth 300 years later.
And as of late, it looks like it will be preserved.
New Orleans is not just coming back and not just on its way back.
New Orleans is storming back.
