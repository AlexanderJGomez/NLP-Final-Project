(CNN) -- Qantas, Australia's national airline, grounded its Airbus A380 fleet indefinitely after one of its planes suffered a midair engine failure on Thursday.
"I am not sure what actually happened with the debris and why parts of the engine left the aircraft and fell into the ground," Joyce said.
"I do apologize," the pilot said.
We're making a left turn now to track back toward Singapore and as we progress with this we'll keep you informed, but at this stage everything is secure, the aircraft is flying safely and we'll get back to you very shortly with further information.
Ulf Waschbusch, who said he was on his way to Australia for the first time, said the crew kept passengers apprised of what was happening.
The airline said it will work with the plane's manufacturer as well as Rolls-Royce, the maker of the engine, to determine what went wrong.
Airbus will at some point deliver another 14, the airline said.
