(CNN) -- The Davis Cup is the just about the only major honor in tennis to elude Roger Federer and the Swiss maestro took another big step to righting that omission Sunday as he led his country into November's final against France.
The 33-year-old will be playing in his first Davis Cup final and paid tribute to the fervent supporters who willed him on to victory.
Switzerland will have to travel to France for the final on November 21-23, with the venue still to be announced.
France is seeking a first Davis Cup triumph since 2001.
