Cairo (CNN) -- Military police poured into Cairo's Tahrir Square on Wednesday in hopes of stopping clashes between protesters and police, as the Egyptian government said a truce had been declared through a group of clerics.
But along the barricades separating protesters from security forces, some clerics were talking to protesters, trying to negotiate.
Protesters reached Fahmi Street, which leads to the Interior Ministry, and were trying to surround the ministry, state-run Al-Masriya TV said.
Crowds have packed Tahrir Square since Saturday, calling for the nation's military rulers to step down immediately.
Through the state-run news agency MENA, the government said that the army was "exerting all efforts to stop bloodshed of Egyptians" and that the military had deployed three armored vehicles to Mohamed Mahmoud Street.
"She called me and said she was arrested by military. "
The students will be detained another four days as an investigation continues, said a spokesman for the office of Egypt's general prosecutor.
Demonstrators say they are concerned the military, which would continue to be Egypt's top authority until a president is in place, wants to keep a grip on the country.
Tantawi of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces said the resignations were accepted, but the current government will remain as a caretaker until a prime minister is named to form a new government.
