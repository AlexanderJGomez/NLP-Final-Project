Davos, Switzerland (CNN) -- Free trade, transparency and a crackdown on tax cheats will be at the heart of Britain's G8 presidency, Prime Minister David Cameron told the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday as he set out his vision for a more competitive Europe.
Cameron said the European Union and the G8 -- made up of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Britain and the United States -- all face the "looming, insistent question" of how to compete and succeed in the global economic race.
It's necessary for Europe," he said.
Britain's desire to renegotiate the terms of its EU membership is based on the need to gain the consent of the people as they follow a path within Europe, he said.
Cameron said the biggest thing that Britain and America could do together is to work on an EU-U.S. trade deal.
Addressing policymakers in Davos, Cameron said the questions of fairer taxes, more open trade and greater transparency apply just as much to the developed countries of the G8 as to poorer nations.
Meanwhile, transparency about the flow of money is key to poorer countries moving from poverty to growth, Cameron said.
The referendum should not be held until it's clear how changes made after the crisis in the eurozone works out, he said, but will be held in the first half of the next parliament.
"I am confident that if there is to be a referendum one day, the UK citizens will decide to stay in the EU and contribute to shape its future," he said.
But critics warn he is taking a big gamble.
