(CNN) -- Two employees at the Baltimore, Maryland, branch of the liberal community organizing group ACORN were caught on tape allegedly offering advice to a pair posing as a pimp and prostitute on setting up a prostitution ring and evading the IRS.
"Stop saying prostitution," the woman, identified by the filmmaker as an ACORN tax expert, tells Giles.
ACORN wants to see the full video before commenting further," Levenson said.
ACORN -- an acronym for the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now -- made headlines last year when Republican groups seized on allegations of voter registration fraud by the group in Florida and several other states, claiming its workers were trying to push the election in Barack Obama's favor.
Founded in 1970, ACORN calls itself "the nation's largest grassroots community organization of low- and moderate-income people."
