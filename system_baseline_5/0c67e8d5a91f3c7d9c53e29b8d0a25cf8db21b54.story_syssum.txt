In his veto message, President Bush calls on Congress to extend funding for the current program.
The president had proposed adding $5 billion to the program and said the version he vetoed would have encouraged families to leave the private insurance market for the federally funded, state-run program.
The program currently covers about 6 million children whose parents earn too much to qualify for Medicaid -- the federal health insurance program for the poor -- but who can't afford private insurance.
Meanwhile, Bush called on Congress to extend funding for the current program to keep the 6 million now covered on the rolls.
