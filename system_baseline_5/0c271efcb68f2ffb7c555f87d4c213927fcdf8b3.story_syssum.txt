At a meeting at their Swiss headquarters, the International Cycling Union (UCI) also announced an independent commission would examine its handling of the Armstrong case.
"The International Cycling Union (UCI) has asked Lance Armstrong to return all the prize money he won from his seven Tour de France victories, that have been struck off due to allegations of doping.
Former Tour de France winner Greg LeMond called on McQuaid and the UCI's honorary president Hein Verbruggen to resign over their handling of the case.
He told CNN: "The sport is going to have some tough times and I think there needs to be a leadership change for it to really be able to move forward.
The UCI said it would soon appoint a fully independent external commission that would look into the role it played during the Armstrong affair and report no later than June next year.
