Surveillance video appears to show a person -- identified by police and his family as Antonio Martin, 18 -- pointing a gun at an officer in a gas station parking lot in Berkeley right before the officer fatally shot the teen, Berkeley Mayor Theodore Hoskins told reporters Wednesday.
It "does not appear that the police officer initiated" the incident, he said.

County Police Chief Jon Belmar said the shooting was tragic, but stressed the teen pointed a gun "straight out" at the officer, who fired in self-defense.
Belmar said the officer, a 34-year-old, six-year Berkeley police veteran, was responding to a report of a theft when he pulled into the parking lot of a Mobil gas station in Berkeley shortly before 11:15 p.m.
In the Martin case, video released by authorities showed a second man nearby who fled when the shooting occurred.
My grandmother hadn't seen him for a while."
The officer involved was given a body camera before he left for patrol, but he wasn't wearing it during the shooting, possibly because he was distracted when a supervisor gave it to him earlier Tuesday, Belmar said.
Four people were arrested on suspicion of assaulting officers, Belmar said.
One police officer was sent to an emergency room after injuring himself while trying to get away from the firework, Belmar said.
Authorities said Brown, who was black, wasn't armed at the time, but that he tried to take Wilson's gun while the officer was in his vehicle during an encounter in Ferguson.
Police said Wilson fired in self-defense as Brown charged him.
