(PEOPLE.com) -- A "devastated" Simon Monjack told PEOPLE his wife Brittany Murphy did not overdose on drugs and did not suffer from an eating disorder.
During a sometimes tear-filled interview, an exhausted Monjack, 39, who hasn't slept since his mother-in-law found his wife collapsed in the bathroom early Sunday, said all he knows is what doctors told him at the hospital: She died of cardiac arrest, but they won't know details until after an autopsy.
"She was on herbal remedies that wouldn't speed up her heart," Monjack said.
That was it."
"She was tired and a little sad because she was sick," Monjack said about Brittany.
"So many people have their views of us, but they never met us or sat down with us," he said.
"She was an only child," said Monjack.
"
Monjack said he has been upset by some of the published reports.
It just can't be a tragic accident," he said, trying to explain the headlines.
Monjack said Brittany's family arrived in town Monday and that funeral plans are pending.
