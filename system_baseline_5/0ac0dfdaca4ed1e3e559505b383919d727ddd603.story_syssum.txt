Los Angeles (CNN) -- Paul Walker's brothers are helping "fill in small gaps" in "Fast & Furious 7" action sequences not finished before the actor's death, producers said Tuesday.
Walker's dramatic scenes were completed before his death but some action sequences were unfinished, they said.
Investigators concluded in a report released in March that speed was to blame in Walker's death.
The high-performance 2005 Porsche Carrera GT was going "between 80 and 93 mph at the time the car impacted a power pole and several trees," the final report said.
Investigators found "no pre-existing conditions that would have caused this collision," the report said.
