And "never mind," is what Speaker Boehner might just as well have said Thursday when he all but declared the immigration reform legislative debate dead for 2014.
Of course not, and it was just a week ago that the same Speaker Boehner said this of the same immigration debate:
But to that point, again just a week ago, the word from House GOP leadership aides was that Boehner wanted to try to see if the House could act this year.
They insist people, primarily immigration activists and the media, read too much into what the Speaker said a week ago.
Veteran GOP strategist Alex Castellanos, who for years has been urging the GOP to act on immigration, said the politics behind Boehner's shift were easy to understand.
The raw politics behind that view: In the 11 states where Senate seats now held by Democrats that are top GOP 2014 targets, conservative turnout is critical and the Latino population tiny to small.
"And the GOP wants to do nothing to distract from that, certainly not start a food fight on immigration."
