According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Fromme, now 60, is set to be released on parole August 16.
A prison spokeswoman would not say whether Fromme continues to correspond with Manson.
She said she knew Ford was in town and near her, "and I said, 'I gotta go and talk to him,' and then I thought, 'That's foolish.
"
However, she said she thought that her incarceration was "unnecessary" and that she couldn't see herself repeating her offense.
Fromme was sentenced to life in prison, but parole was an option at the time, although the federal system later abolished it, said Felicia Ponce, spokeswoman for the Bureau of Prisons.
Fromme was not granted parole until July 2008, Ponce said.
At the time, prison officials said they were looking into rumors that Fromme escaped after hearing Manson was ill, according to news reports.
...
Fromme wanted to be heard on issues including the environment, he said.
...
She said then she didn't plan to seek a parole hearing: "The parole board does not hold my life in its hands.
Virga, who is still practicing in Sacramento, said he had not heard from Fromme since her sentencing in 1975.
She's been in prison a long time ... it was, in my mind, a tragedy that she wound up a disciple of Manson."
