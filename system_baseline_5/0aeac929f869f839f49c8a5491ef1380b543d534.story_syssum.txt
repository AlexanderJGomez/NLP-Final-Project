No wonder so many sleep aids are available.

A: Many sleep experts aren't fans of OTC sleep aids because the meds don't usually help people with significant insomnia.
A: If you're taking a short-acting drug, such as Sonata, Rozerem, or Ambien -- and it's still early in the evening -- you can take another pill.
Here's why: "Alcohol becomes a stimulant about three to four hours after you drink it, so you're actually working against your sleep medication," Arand says.
Why?
A: Not usually, Arand says, "but some sleep meds can suppress dream recall."
"The newer medications like Ambien C.R., Sonata, Rozerem, and Lunesta have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration without a limit on how long they can be prescribed," Arand says.
Tolerance is a common problem with all sleeping pills: After taking them for a while, you need more than the usual dose to help you sleep, which may lead you to think you're addicted.
Then, stop taking the drug altogether.
A: You might have some trouble, Krieger says, though it's less likely with the newer pills -- these include Rozerem, Sonata, and Lunesta.

Before using any supplement, check with your doctor; combining them with other medications -- sleeping pills or otherwise -- can be risky.
