A hat and glittery glove represent Michael Jackson at the Apollo Theater tribute.
The cause of the 50-year-old singer's death has not yet been determined.
Fans have been gathering outside the theater since last week to remember Jackson, who at age 9 won a 1967 Apollo amateur night showcase with his brothers in the group the Jackson 5.
"Michael wasn't no freak," Sharpton said.
"You've got to come from the stage of the Apollo and go all over the world to understand Michael," Sharpton said.
The Jackson brothers' amateur night win led to a $1,000 deal for 31 shows at the Apollo, said Bobby Schiffman, whose family owned the theater.
