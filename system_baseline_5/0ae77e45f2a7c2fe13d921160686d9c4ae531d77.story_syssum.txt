(CNN) -- All 77 NATO service members wounded in a Saturday attack against a coalition base in Afghanistan are U.S. troops, a spokeswoman for the International Security Assistance Force said Sunday.
Allen said the attack indicates "much more what the Taliban are unable to do" than what they are able to do.
And that's how we view this particular attack," he said.
U.S.-led forces kicked off Operation Enduring Freedom in October and ousted the Taliban.
Coalition and Afghan troops have been fighting the tenacious Taliban militants in the Afghan-Pakistani region.
August was the deadliest month for U.S. forces in Afghanistan since the conflict began.
