Washington (CNN) -- Baseball all-time home run champion Barry Bonds won a big legal victory Friday when a federal appeals court ruled that evidence the government says would prove he lied about using steroids is inadmissible in court.
The Appeals Court ruling upholds a February 2009 ruling from U.S. District Judge Susan Illston that there was no proof that positive steroid tests from 2000 and 2001 were Bonds' and that out-of-court statements from his former trainer, Greg Anderson, are hearsay.
The government said it would instead bring BALCO executive James Valente to the stand to testify Anderson told him the samples indeed came from Bonds.
The government had the burden of showing the samples came from Bonds, then went to Anderson and then to BALCO.
"There must be at least some manifestation of assent to the principal's right to control," said the court of Bonds.
The government alleges BALCO helped supply Bonds with steroids and drug-masking substances.
Neither the government nor Bonds had an immediate reaction to the ruling.
