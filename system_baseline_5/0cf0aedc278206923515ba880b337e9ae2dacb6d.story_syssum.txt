A 34-year-old man being sought in a woman's death has been arrested in connection with the killings of two homeless men who were shot three days apart while both were sleeping on sidewalks, Atlanta police said Friday.
Atlanta police called the shootings of homeless men "sinister" because whoever pulled the trigger wasn't expecting to gain from the victims monetarily.
Dorian Jenkins, 42, was fatally shot five times as he slept, wrapped in a blanket, on a sidewalk in downtown Atlanta.
Less than three days later, Tommy Mims, 64, didn't show up as normal at a recycling center where he took cans and other scrap metals to sell.
"They weren't fleeing, running.
"These guns have a capacity of five or six rounds," Quinn said.
