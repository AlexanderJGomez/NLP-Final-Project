But even while Clinton was in Beijing, the Chinese government was maintaining a heated diplomatic back-and-forth on another territorial controversy, this one concerning a set of small islands in the East China Sea also claimed by Japan and Taiwan.
The uninhabited islands are known in Japan as Senkaku and in China as Diaoyu, and are privately owned by a Japanese family.
In reality, Clinton is pressing China on hot-button issues like the territorial disputes, human rights and trade.
Chinese officials said Xi would send a letter to Clinton.
The territorial disputes over islands in the South China Sea complicate that role.
The stakes are raised further by estimates that potentially huge reserves of natural gas and oil lie underneath the seabed.
Analysts have expressed pessimism that the disputes in the South China Sea will be defused soon.
