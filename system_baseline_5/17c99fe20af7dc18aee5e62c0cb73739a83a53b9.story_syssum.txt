(CNN) -- I was walking down 125th Street in Harlem last week when my iPhone beeped to alert me that New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg had proposed saving obesity-prone urbanites from themselves by banning restaurant sales of large sugary sodas and teas.
This result may have been unintended, but it could hardly have been unforeseen: When Canada imposed even higher taxes on cigarettes, tobacco smuggling became an industry worth $1.5 billion (in Canadian dollars) as the enterprising stocked up in the U.S.
No, and no.
Some public health experts have achieved such positive health behavior transformations very successfully indeed.
They can enhance a sense of community, and avoid the defiance that can sabotage well-meaning laws, such as tobacco taxes that spawn smuggling.
Otherwise, the health of others could be seriously imperiled.
Some studies even find that overweight people can be healthier than the underweight.
As for me, I'm still puzzling the question of the five-year $116 million marketing monopoly that Bloomberg gave Snapple.
You can't make this stuff up -- as Bloomberg should note.
