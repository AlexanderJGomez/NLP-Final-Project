(CNN) -- The president of the Central African Republic has fled the country's capital and rebels have seized control of the city, a government official said Sunday.
Some South African soldiers were killed in clashes, according to a statement from the office of French President Francois Hollande.
"A number of U.N. offices have been looted as well as residences of some U.N. personnel," spokeswoman Uwolowulakana Ikavi said.
The Seleka and the government brokered a new peace deal in January, agreeing to form a unity government led by Bozize.
Hollande's office said the French president had spoken Sunday with South African President Jacob Zuma, expressing condolences for the soldiers' deaths.
