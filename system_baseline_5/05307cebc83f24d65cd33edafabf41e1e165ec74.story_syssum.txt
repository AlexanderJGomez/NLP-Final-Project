Pakzad is one of several Afghan women's rights advocates who are in the U.S. capital this week to address a move the Obama administration is considering: reaching out to Taliban moderates in an effort to bring peace to Afghanistan.
But Pakzad wants U.S. lawmakers to put women's rights at the forefront of any deal with Taliban moderates.
"It makes me scared and everybody has the fear that one day [the Taliban] will be back again," Pakzad said.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will bestow the honor on eight other women on Wednesday, including Wazhma Frogh, an Afghan woman who heads Global Rights, which fights against domestic violence, marital and child rape, and sexual abuse in Afghanistan.
Pakzad expresses hope that Clinton and other members of the Obama administration will raise those concerns when moving forward with any policy of negotiating with the Taliban.
She said she hopes that one day, Afghan women will secure the same rights that American women have achieved.
