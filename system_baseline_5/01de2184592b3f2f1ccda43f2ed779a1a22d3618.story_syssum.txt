"In the first three months, I saw such a fast improvement, now I'm worried about plateauing," said Jason Dinant.
Dinant, a Las Vegas, Nevada, resident, is one of the three iReport contributors being followed by CNNhealth as they strive to meet diet and fitness goals they set at the beginning of the year.
With the parade only two months away, Dinant said: "Now I'm in high drive.
There's no cheating on the diet."
"You can't see a six-pack through fat," Dinant said.
"It's hard to eat that much protein," Dinant said.
Compared with just four months ago, the "man boobies" and the extra layer of flab around his midsection have been lost, Dinant said.
While pleased with the results, Dinant worried that with two-thirds of a six-pack, his body will begin to plateau.
"Jason has to do something different or harder to maintain results to keep on the track that he's on," Dothard said.
The body is adjusting to what you're doing."
