(CNN) -- It took a lot of effort for Leo Bonten to turn his amputated leg into a fully functional lamp.
So, Bonten, now 53, settled in to the fact that he would be losing his right leg -- a harsh reality for an otherwise healthy and active man.
"It's my leg," he told me over the phone.
Well, what if I bring in my own tin foil?"
Body parts can also be buried during some sort of official funeral (and, perhaps, exhumed) with proper legal oversight.
Still, he wanted his leg, for he had a crazy idea.
You see, as per his profession, van de Goot was able to legally obtain Bonten's leg from the hospital after surgery.
And, ultimately, he would preserve the leg with chemicals so it could remain ... a leg.
Almost.
They made a lamp out of his leg.
Bonten explained to me that the one he's getting through his insurance is not top of the line.
Something stronger.
So, he decided to sell his lamp on eBay for â‚¬100,000 -- an endeavor that lasted not even two days before the online bidding site rejected his listing.
His lamp will arrive on Sunday, and he'll finally be re-united with his leg.
And if he wants to cover the foot with a dirty, used sock ... sadly, I know just the place.
