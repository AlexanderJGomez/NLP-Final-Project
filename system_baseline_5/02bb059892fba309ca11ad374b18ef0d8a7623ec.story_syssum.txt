(CNN) -- Lake Urmia in Iran used to be a site to reckon with.
I saw caterpillars and bobcats taking salt from the dead body of the lake," recalls Gary Lewis, the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Iran.
"In the year 1956, the per capita water available in Iran was 7,000 cubic meters.
In the year 2020, it is likely to be only 1,300 cubic meters," says Lewis.
Iran is doing more than throwing money at the problem.
"When Rouhani took power, in the first government meeting, he ordered the formation of a special group to save Urmia and the other dying wetlands," recalls Naser Agh, a professor at the Artemia and Aquatic Animals Research Institute at Urmia University, and a member of the steering committee of the Lake Urmia restoration program.
"The past government would say we needed to save the lake, and would even form a national committee and ministers would come together, but there was never a budget, and without a budget, you can't do anything," says Agh.
They also approved a large amount of money, so it can really help save the lake."
