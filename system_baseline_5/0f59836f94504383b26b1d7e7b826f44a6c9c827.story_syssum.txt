Elvis Presley bought the property in February 1967, three months before marrying Priscilla Beaulieu.
The property has been on the market since last month.
McLemore said he met Priscilla Presley on a winter day in 1985.
"There's still a trailer pad behind the Honeymoon Cottage," McLemore said.
She said she remembers seeing Presley riding a horse along the highway.
