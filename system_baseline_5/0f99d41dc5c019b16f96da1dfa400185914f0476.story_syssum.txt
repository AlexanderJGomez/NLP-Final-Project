The farmers filed the discrimination lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 2000 and sought class-action status, meaning that all the individual complaints and suits could be heard as one.
The class could have included 20,000 farmers, the government said in court.
The Justice Department also is not interested in settling the case, government attorney Lisa Ann Olson told a federal district court judge in an August hearing.
The farmers also point out that former Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman testified before Congress in 1997 that the USDA had a long history of discrimination.
Carillo said he applied for a USDA loan after devastating floods in 1995 but was denied.
