"I misled the American people," Jackson, 48, said before U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson imposed the term, which also included an order for restitution and community service.
As the judge read her sentence, Sandi Jackson wept.
In a statement read in court, Jackson said he wanted to be held accountable for his actions and he knew what he did was wrong.
Jackson's lawyers reiterated that sentiment and asked the court for an 18-month sentence for Jackson and probation for his wife.
Prosecutors had sought a four-year sentence for Jackson and 18 months in jail and restitution of $168,550 for his wife.
Graves said that Jackson did not "deserve credit" for his job as a congressman.
"The real remorse you've shown is palpable in this courtroom," she said.
Jackson will begin his sentence around November 1 at a prison camp in Montgomery, Alabama, the judge said.
Jackson and his wife also were ordered to perform community service.
In total, prosecutors said Jackson made more than 3,000 purchases.
Early in his political career, Jackson was considered a politician on the rise.
"I know Barack Obama," Jackson said.
"I don't know how I missed so many signs," the elder Jackson said.
