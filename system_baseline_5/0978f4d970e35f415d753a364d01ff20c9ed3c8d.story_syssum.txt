Boston (CNN)The death penalty trial of accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev -- long delayed by painstaking jury selection, crippling snowstorms and last-ditch appeals to move the case someplace else -- is on track to get underway here next week.
The jurors first will decide whether Tsarnaev is guilty of using weapons of mass destruction to kill people at a large public event.
Many said they thought Tsarnaev was guilty of the April 15, 2013, bombings, which killed three people near the finish line.
He refused.
But this case is being tried in federal court, and 17 of the 30 counts against Tsarnaev include the death penalty as a possible punishment.
Tamerlan Tsarnaev died during a gun battle with police, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hours later, bleeding and hiding in a boat in a Watertown backyard.
No cameras are allowed at the Tsarnaev trial.
