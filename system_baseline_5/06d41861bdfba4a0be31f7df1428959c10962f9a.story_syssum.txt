London, England (CNN) -- The three Pakistani cricket players at the center of a betting scandal have been summoned to meet their country's top cricket authorities in London, England, where the alleged fixing took place, team manager Yawar Saeed told CNN on Tuesday.
The head of cricket's world governing body said Tuesday he wants disciplinary action within days if anyone on the Pakistan team was involved in the alleged betting scheme.
Federal investigators from Pakistan had been expected to arrive in England on Tuesday to look into the alleged scandal, but Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik later said their plans changed.
Police have questioned four people over the scandal, Pakistani manager Saeed said Sunday.
The video of the meeting -- which the newspaper said took place Wednesday, the day before the match between Pakistan and England began -- is intercut with clips from the following two days, where the players perform as Majeed said they would.
Police said no date had been set for a hearing or further proceedings, but that the investigation was continuing.
"We have given our best," Butt said after his team lost to England.
Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari ordered an investigation into the scandal, his spokesman said Sunday.
It is the second allegation of corruption directed at the Pakistan cricket team this year.
