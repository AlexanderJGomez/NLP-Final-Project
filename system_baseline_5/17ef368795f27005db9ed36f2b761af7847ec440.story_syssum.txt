Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani's decision to cede power willingly is a first in the modern history of the region.
"God only knows I never wanted power for personal reasons and I never sought power for any personal motive," the outgoing emir said.
Jamie Ingram, a Middle East analyst at IHS Global Insight, said that while Sheikh Tamim had been groomed for power for some time, especially over the past two years, it was still a surprise to see the handover come so soon.
It's the first time in recent history we have seen such a transfer of power from a living monarch to the next generation," he said.
But how greatly it will be involved in Syria under Sheikh Tamim "is the big question," said Ingram, since Qatar has already started to pull back on that front and let Saudi Arabia take a lead.
Social media has been abuzz over the news of the power transfer, with people thanking Sheikh Hamad for his efforts.
Sheikh Hamad was probably motivated by the desire for an orderly transition, having seen close-up what can happen if an older generation clings to power or an impatient crown prince plots a coup, said Ingram.
