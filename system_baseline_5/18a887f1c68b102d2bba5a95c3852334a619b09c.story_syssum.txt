Chicago (CNN) -- The week-old teachers strike in Chicago's public schools will continue into the new week, after a representative group of the Chicago Teachers Union decided not to end the walkout even though union leaders and school officials had reached a tentative contract deal.
But Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis said that, after extensive debate, the delegates said they wanted more time to discuss the contract with union members.
There were no classes all last week for more than 350,000 students in Chicago, home to the nation's third-largest school system, when the union went on strike after failing to reach a contract agreement with school board officials.
Lewis, from the teachers union, said that one problem is that "there's no trust" of school board members.
Another point of contention involves the teacher evaluation system, Lewis said.
In addition, "highly rated teachers" who lost their jobs when their schools were closed can "follow their students to the consolidated school," according to a summary of the proposed contract from Chicago Public Schools.
"There is no reason why our kids cannot be in school while the union reviews the agreement," Vitale said.
