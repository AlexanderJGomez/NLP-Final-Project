"At the end of last year, I once again had a stress fracture in my left foot and had to sit out of basketball," he said.
Since then Yao has scored an average of 19 points per game and been voted an NBA All-Star player eight times, turning himself to one of the most successful overseas players in the league.
"The entire city and the team changed me to a grown man -- not only as a basketball player but also I had my daughter there."
The league paid Yao $93 million during his nine-year career.
"I followed somebody's footprints -- Chinese players in the league ahead of me," he said.
"It's always taking some legacy from older players -- you get it, you gain experience from that and make your own success."
