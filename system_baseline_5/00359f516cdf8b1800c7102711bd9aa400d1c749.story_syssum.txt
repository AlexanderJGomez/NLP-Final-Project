Raymond Soeoth, pictured here with his wife, says he was injected with drugs by ICE agents against his will.
"I'm really shocked to find out that the government has been using physicians and using potent medications in this way," said Appelbaum, who also serves as a member of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law.
Responding to Lieberman's written questions, Myers said 1,073 immigration detainees had "medical escorts" for deportation since 2003.
"First, I am aware of, and deeply concerned about reports that past practices may not have conformed to ICE detention standards," Myers said.

In the records, the government says he was injected with the drug after he said he would kill himself if deported -- a remark Soeoth denies ever making.
He said he even had a federal stay of his deportation -- and the paperwork to prove it -- but his U.S. government escorts wouldn't let him show it to the pilot of the plane preparing to fly him out of the country.
Soeoth says he's traumatized by what happened.
