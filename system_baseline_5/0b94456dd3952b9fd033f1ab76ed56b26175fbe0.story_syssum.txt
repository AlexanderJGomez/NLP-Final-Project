He's broken every record in the book and won a glut of Olympic and world titles, but even at the age of 40, Haile Gebrselassie has no intention of resting on his laurels.
Throughout his glittering career stretching over two decades, Gebrselassie has proved an impeccable ambassador for track and field.
Those youngsters, who came from around the world, would do well to heed his renowned sportsmanship, because win or lose it was always with that smile on his face.
Disappointments have proved few and far between since his first competitive race at the age of 14 and while still in his teens he captured a 5,000/10,000 meters double at the world junior championships in Seoul.
Gebrselassie won his first Olympic gold at Atlanta '96 over his favored 10,000m distance, just edging out his arch-rival Paul Tergat.
"I won that race nine-hundredths of a second from Paul Tergat.
Successive wins in the Berlin marathon in 2007 and 2008 each came with world bests, the second of two hours three minutes and 59 seconds -- the first man under the two hours four minute mark.
Years of disciplined training, getting up at 5 a.m. each morning, have left Gebrselassie a battle-hardened veteran and have helped him in his life outside of track and field.
One of 10 children, he used to run several kilometers each day to school and back to his family's small farm.
My training started when I was two.
You don't see so much athletes from the city, most of our athletes they come from the countryside."
Without a role model it's not an easy job," he says.
"What is that?
Allied to his incredible talent and will to win, Gebrselassie has certainly "won for himself" in bundles down the years -- dominating distance running and becoming one of the most recognizable sportsman on the planet.
