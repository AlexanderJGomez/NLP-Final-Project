Cesar Chavez is something of a national icon.
"I was really surprised that there wasn't already a film out about Chavez's life, so that's why I spent the past four years making this and hope the country will join me in celebrating his life and work," Diego Luna said during Tuesday's screening of "Cesar Chavez: An American Hero" in New York.
He and Dolores Huerta co-founded what's now known as the United Farm Workers.
States such as New York, where farm workers face long hours without any overtime pay or a day of rest, are of concern for human rights activist Kerry Kennedy, president of the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights.
Farm workers here can be fired if they tried collective bargaining," Kennedy said after the "Cesar Chavez" screening.
Farm workers across the country face hardship.
To help facilitate that change, Luna and the film's cast -- Michael Pe√±a as Chavez, America Ferrera as his wife, Helen, and Rosario Dawson as labor leader Dolores Huerta -- have been trekking all over the country promoting the film and a petition to make Chavez's birthday on March 31 a national holiday.
In 2008, President Barack Obama showed his support for the national holiday and even borrowed the United Farm Workers famous chant "Si Se Puede!'
We even had people that were killed in the movement but we were still able to organize," Huerta said.
"Well, first Cesar didn't want to spend the time making the film because there was so much work to do, and he was hesitant on being singled out because there were so many others that contributed to the UFW's success," said Rodriguez.
But when it came time to getting the funding to produce the film, Hollywood was not willing.
"I hope young people use the power of social media to help spread the word about social change," Dawson said.
