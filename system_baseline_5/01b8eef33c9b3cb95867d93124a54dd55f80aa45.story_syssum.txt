San Diego, California (CNN) -- Nearly six years ago, I left Texas to move back home to California.
The other winners in the census lottery include Florida, which picked up two new seats in Congress.
Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Utah, South Carolina and Washington all picked up one extra seat.
Texas is the buckle in that belt.
Texas is the second-largest state in area, behind Alaska.
But in terms of population growth, it's second to none.
You can't talk honestly about population growth in Texas without acknowledging two things.
Second, much of the rest of Texas' population growth is tied to the phenomenal increase in the Hispanic population.
The data showing the racial/ethnic breakdown of the U.S. population won't be released until February.
There is no question that, as a result of the population shifts of the past 10 years, Texas and states out West are coming into their own and will have more power and influence to steer a new course for the country.
Or should I say, "Bienvenidos?"
