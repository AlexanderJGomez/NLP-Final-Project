"I have been in the market for this card for a long time," Walton told CNN.
The card's price beat initial estimates by $162,900.
The Catholic order, which has a facility in Baltimore, Maryland, obtained the card when the brother of one its nuns died earlier this year, leaving several baseball cards to the congregation.
Walton, managing partner of Walton Sports Cards and Collectibles, said he's tried three previous times to buy a Wagner card, but was outbid.
About 75 percent of his pursuit of the T206 card was emotion, he said.
