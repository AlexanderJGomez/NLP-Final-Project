Iran, minus the intense sanctions put forward by the West starting in mid-2010, would warrant a slot in the N-11 group of countries -- this is the next wave of the most promising economies within the emerging market sphere of Jim O'Neill at Goldman Sachs.
Iran joins Zimbabwe (2008) and North Korea (2009-2011) as the only three in the 21st Century to experience that fate and at the same time share a common link of being subject to international sanctions.
When U.S. President Barrack Obama signed the sanctions legislation into law in July 2010, the rial was trading at just over 10,000 to the dollar.
In 2010, Iran began removing subsidies for fuel, from heating oil to engine petrol, which amounted to $4,000 per year for the average family of four according to the IMF.
All the while, the screws linked to sanctions are being tightened.
The sanctions also limit any new investment by the international oil giants who are already operating in Iran.
President Ahmadinejad's term expires in June of next year.
