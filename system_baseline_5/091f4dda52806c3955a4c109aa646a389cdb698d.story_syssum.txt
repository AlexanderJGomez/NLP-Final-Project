"It is not simply that WWE has failed to protect its wrestlers," court documents say.
A lawyer for WWE called the lawsuit without merit, like a "virtually identical one filed by the same lawyers in Oregon."
"For most of its history, WWE has engaged in a campaign of misinformation and deception to prevent its wrestlers from understanding the true nature and consequences of the injuries they have sustained," the lawsuit says.
WWE forces wrestlers to do stunts "in a matter that dramatically increases -- often to a near-certainty -- their chances of sustaining brain damage," the suit says.
