(CNN) -- J.C. Chandor is one of Hollywood's hot new names.
J.C. Chandor: Attaching actors was actually not really the challenging thing with the film.
Getting actors to say yes is one thing, but having the money there and the crew there and have everything happen at the same time is where you run into quasi-impossibility.
Any we'd recognize?
Chandor: I never was a very prominent commercial director, to say the least.
Amazingly, this has been sort of the cherry on the sundae.
The film was very well received for what it was, which has allowed me to direct again, and everybody made their money back, so I've been pretty blessed from that standpoint.
