Speaking to Cheng, one of Australia's brightest young scientists, you get the feeling there's not much she couldn't solve with a bit of brain power.
"I don't know, I guess I get scared all the time really," she says, speaking by phone above the din of Melbourne trams trundling past.
Just 11% of engineers in Australia are women -- it's a similar story the U.S. (14%) and Britain (9%) --and Cheng felt compelled to show a new generation of girls that science could be fulfilling and even, wait for it, cool.
When Cheng recently graduated with a degree in Mechatronics and Computer Science, she had the choice of hundreds of job offers.
What will make me feel fulfilled?
said Cheng.
