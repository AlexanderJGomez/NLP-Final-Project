(Health.com) -- People who take vitamin E supplements regularly for years -- whether they are smokers or nonsmokers -- may lower their risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the lung condition that is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States.
Vitamin E did not lower the risk of asthma, a condition associated with a higher risk of COPD.
The idea that vitamin E can reduce the risk of developing COPD is "biologically plausible," says Yvonne Kelly, Ph.D., an associate professor in the department of epidemiology and public health at University College London.
In future studies, Sims says that the researchers should diagnose COPD using a breathing test called spirometry.
Currently, no vitamin supplements are recommended to prevent or treat COPD.
The vitamin E intake in the study was far higher, at 300 IU per day.
For people concerned about their lung health, taking vitamin E and C is not a bad idea, says Blumberg.
According to Sims, the new study offers an incentive to look closer at the potential to use vitamin E or other antioxidants to help prevent COPD.
