Naismith, a Canadian physical education instructor working at a New England YMCA, created the game of "Basket Ball" so students could play a sport indoors in winter.
Naismith wanted the game to have no physical contact between players and to encourage sportsmanship.
The Booths hope to bring Naismith's rules to the University of Kansas, inspired, they said, by lifelong Jayhawk basketball fan Josh Swade and his campaign to return the rules the university, where Naismith spent the last 41 years of his life and is buried.
Naismith "invented the game, and so these papers should be there," he said.
Ironically, Naismith is the only Kansas basketball coach to compile a losing record.
People are making an awful lot of money in the game and have a tendency to lose, in our opinion, the values," said Ian Naismith, the founder's youngest grandson.
The family has always been involved in the game of basketball, but after many offers, it is "time to move forward," said Naismith, now living outside Chicago.
The proceeds from the auction will go to the James Naismith International Basketball Foundation.
