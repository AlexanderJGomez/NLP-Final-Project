Frankly, I don't know how public figures get through it.
That's the secret to his success.
Take, for example, his tweet about Hillary Clinton, which caused something of a media firestorm.
So Drudge tweeted the picture, asking, "Is Clinton Holding a Walker?"
Drudge's tweet fits in with Karl Rove's orchestrated charge in mid-May that maybe Hillary Clinton was "brain damaged" because of a fall she suffered.
"It's better not to argue with women," Putin said, "but Mrs. Clinton has never been too graceful in her statements."
It's one thing to take on a world leader like Hillary Clinton, but an altogether different matter to offend half the planet while doing it.
Politico ran the quote with the observation, "This isn't going to play well in Moscow."
We can expect a lot more to be said about Hillary Clinton, since her memoir, "Hard Choices," is coming out.
And, unfortunately, I'm also sure some in the media will be right there with some tweetle-dumb about it.
