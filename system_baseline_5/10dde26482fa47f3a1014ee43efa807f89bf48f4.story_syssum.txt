Wyshak was responding to a defense claim that one of the key witnesses in the case may have been involved in further criminal activity since his release from federal prison in 2007, and that a member of the Massachusetts State Police claimed the investigation into that defense witness' activities was compromised.
The defense witness, John Mortorano, has admitted he killed 20 people as part of Bulger's criminal organization that ruled south Boston for decades.
Wyshak said the the internal investigation found complaints against Johnson were "unsubstantiated" and that the "real villain is the state trooper" who he says "went off the deep-end" and denied the allegations when confronted.
The conduct of law enforcement is key in the case since prosecutors allege a corrupt FBI agent aided Bulger in his criminal actives while Bulger himself was a government informant.
Federal prosecutors say Bulger led the Irish mob from the late 1970s through the mid-1990s.
