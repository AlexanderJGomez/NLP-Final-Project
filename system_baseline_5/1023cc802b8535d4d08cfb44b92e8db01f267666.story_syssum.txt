A British hostage whose life ISIS threatened in a video was helping to provide humanitarian relief in Syria when he was abducted last year, an aid agency said.
The threats on David Haines' life are intolerable," the aid group said in a statement.
As logistics manager, Haines had been in charge of procuring humanitarian goods for people staying at the Atmeh camp, Tomarchio said.
The group does have relief activities in Syria that are managed from a distance, he said.
"But I can assure you that we will look at every possible option to protect this person."
