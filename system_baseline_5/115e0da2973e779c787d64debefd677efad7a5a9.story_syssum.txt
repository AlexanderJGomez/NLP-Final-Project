Anton Caluori, 31, was arrested Tuesday at his home in Federal Way, a Seattle, Washington, suburb, Agent Bryan Molnar said in an affidavit.
Molnar said he and Federal Way police officer Andy Hensing went to the apartment complex at the address, where an employee told them Caluori was a "hothead" with a "temper" who lived with his mother.
The third time, a man later identified as Caluori opened the door, Molnar said.
Caluori continued to struggle and would not comply with our commands," Molnar said in the affidavit.
Molnar said one of them asked Caluori if there was anything in the apartment that "would hurt" law officers and he replied, "There are things inside that go boom."
The safety was not engaged," the affidavit said.
in the affidavit, said Caluori "spends a lot of time on the computer" but she "does not know what he does on it."
Call the CIA or run it up the chain of command," Molnar said.
Caluori is in custody at the Federal Detention Center at Sea-Tac, Washington.
His attorney, Kyana Stephens, would not comment on the case or the charges.
