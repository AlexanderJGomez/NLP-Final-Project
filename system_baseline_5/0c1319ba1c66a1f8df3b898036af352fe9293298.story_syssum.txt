In the wake of criticism over a two-game suspension for Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice, the NFL has established a six-game unpaid ban for personnel who violate the league's policy on domestic violence, Commissioner Roger Goodell said Thursday.
The policy, which is effective immediately, also applies to other types of violence.
"We were informed today of the NFL's decision to increase penalties on domestic violence offenders under the Personal Conduct Policy for all NFL employees.
Under the program, he won't be prosecuted, and the charges will be expunged after a year, the league said.
The NFL regular season is 16 games.
