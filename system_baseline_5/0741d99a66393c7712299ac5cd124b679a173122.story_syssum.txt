It is a solemn ritual repeated multiple times daily, year-round at Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington.
Christman, a civil war soldier, was the first to be buried at Arlington and the graveside remembrance was held to mark the start of the cemetery's 150th anniversary commemoration, which will continue through June 16.
The cemetery is also a year-round tourist attraction with 250,000 visitors each month.
For Phil Doyle and his family, visiting from Australia, it was one stop they knew had to be made especially with one of their sons training to be a helicopter pilot in the Australian Forces.
Barbara Christman Page, Christman's great-grandniece, had been to the cemetery before.
But she was never aware there was a family grave site, something she will make sure to change for her grandchildren.
