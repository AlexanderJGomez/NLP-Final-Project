Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN) -- The children keep asking when their mother is coming home.
Without her, Lee says he's lost his direction.
An 18-year Malaysia Airlines veteran, she loved to fly around the world.
Lee said he hears from Malaysia Airlines just once or twice a day, by phone or text message.
Even though his wife was part of the cabin crew, he says he gets more information from the media than the airline.
Lee wants the truth about what happened to MH370.
Most of all he wants his wife to come home.
