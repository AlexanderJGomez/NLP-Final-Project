(CNN) -- North Korea has confirmed to Swedish diplomats that it is holding an American citizen, the U.S. State Department said Friday.
"He has been detained somewhere in North Korea since that time," Newman's wife said in the statement.
The day before Newman was to leave North Korea, he and his tour guide met with "one or two Korean authorities," his son said.
"The tour arrangements were handled by the Korea International Travel Company," Thompson said.
Newman is one of two American citizens being held in North Korea.
North Korea has not publicly said why it is holding Newman.
An armistice signed in 1953 ended the three-year war between North Korea and South Korea.
Of his service during the war, he only said: "I went there, did what I was told and went home, went to college and started a family.
Newman's detentions bring to at least seven the number of American citizens who have been detained by North Korea, including four who allegedly entered the country illegally, according to the State Department.
Richardson's spokeswoman, Caitlin Kelleher, said he has been "in touch with his North Korean contacts" regarding Newman's detention.
