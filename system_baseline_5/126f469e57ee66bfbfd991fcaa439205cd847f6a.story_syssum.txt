Joseph, who was still recovering from giving birth at the city's Beth Israel Medical Center, said hospital officials notified her of her baby's death and had her sign off on a city burial.
Hunt, 53, has made it her life's work to document the undocumented at Hart Island, reportedly the nation's largest taxpayer-funded potter's field -- a term used for a place where the unclaimed dead are buried.
"For 33 years, I've been trying to find where my child is," said Joseph, who said her baby's official burial records were missing.
Hunt suspected Joseph's child was buried on Hart Island despite the incomplete records.
After submitting a series of Freedom of Information Act requests to the city, Hunt got her hands on thousands of the island's burial records and worked to create an online database.
And while Hunt has focused on New York's Hart Island, many other regions of the country have similar sites.
But until that happens, those like Joseph and New Jersey resident Lisa-Michele Russo have turned to Hunt and her website for help.
"It was a heartbreaking situation."
Using Anthony's death certificate, Hunt again petitioned city officials to arrange a visit to the island for the baby's now-adult sister.
"We do our best to accommodate every legitimate request," said Department of Correction spokeswoman Sharman Stein, who noted that in most cases, family members must first provide documentation proving that their loved ones are buried on the island before they visit.
"She is helping so many people and she doesn't know any of us," Russo said of Hunt.
Hunt, who sustains the Hart Island Project largely through donations and sales of her documentary and artwork, says she's recently received a grant from the state's Council on the Arts to create a "posthumous Wiki" -- a user-generated database of stories, photos and information about those on Hart Island.
