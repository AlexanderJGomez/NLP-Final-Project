But for hundreds of children in the rural villages of Colombia, Luis Soriano is far from a clown.
Soriano, 38, is a primary school teacher who spends his free time operating a "biblioburro," a mobile library on donkeys that offers reading education for hundreds of children living in what he describes as "abandoned regions" in the Colombian state of Magdalena.
To help bridge the learning gap, Soriano decided to personally bring books to the children.
"I saw two unemployed donkeys at home and had the idea [to use] them in my biblioburro project because they can carry a heavy load," Soriano said.
"It's not easy to travel through the valleys," Soriano said.
The books they do not have access to ... they get from the biblioburro."
Soriano has spent nearly 4,000 hours riding his donkeys, and he's not traveled unscathed.
That's how a community changes and the child becomes a good citizen and a useful person," Soriano said.
