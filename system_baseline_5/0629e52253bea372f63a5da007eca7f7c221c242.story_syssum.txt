And as trivial as it may seem, a lot of that had to do with Red Lobster.
It meant twice, sometimes three times a year, a poor family like mine could order a steak in a middle-class restaurant and pretend we were rich.
Red Lobster was the biggest culprit.
But statistics suggest that we haven't been going to restaurants like Red Lobster the way we used to, and it's not because our collective palate has changed.
But it's a mistake to blame the erosion of buying power and the decline of middle-class touchstones like Red Lobster or JCPenney on just the Great Recession.
And that may not seem like much until you realize that almost every year since 1983, a series of small ticks like those two examples has been widening the gap between between what we earn and what we can buy.
Red Lobster is not the only restaurant seeing more empty seats than in years past.
That also happens to be the same year Red Lobster was founded.
