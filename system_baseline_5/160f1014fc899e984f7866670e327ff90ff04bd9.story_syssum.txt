Heywood was found dead last November in his hotel room in the sprawling southwestern Chinese city of Chongqing.
Slowly, however, media reports are raising more uncomfortable questions about Heywood's death.
Now, the British government is asking China to investigate Heywood's death.
Heywood's death on its own -- a man linked to former spies, a light drinker dead from apparent alcohol poisoning -- would be suspicious enough.
Bo rose through China's political ranks and was appointed Communist Party secretary of Chongqing, a city of more than 30 million people.
But Bo also made enemies.
The Wall Street Journal, quoting anonymous diplomatic sources close to the case, reports Wang clashed with Bo after raising his suspicions that Heywood had been poisoned.
In a year of political transition in China, with a new generation of leaders poised to inherit power, the Bo case has captivated the country.
Bo, the man who ran the criminals out of town, now finds himself ousted.
And Heywood, found dead in a Chongqing hotel room, may still yet have a tale to tell.
