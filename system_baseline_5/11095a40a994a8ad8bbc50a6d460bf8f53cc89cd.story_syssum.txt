(CNN) -- The deportations of thousands of Mexicans who have served time in U.S. jails into Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, are adding a deadly ingredient to an already volatile state of security, Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz said.
Adding deportees from the United States, some with criminal records, worsens the situation, the mayor said.
About 85,400 "criminal aliens" were deported from the United States to their homelands in 2008, according to ICE.
Of those deported through El Paso, about 6,800 were criminal aliens, Zamarripa said.
In a recent conversation, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the United States would work to give Juarez more details about who is being dropped off on its doorstep, Reyes Ferriz said.
The 2009 death toll in Juarez was 1,421 as of Monday, the mayor's office said, on pace to beat last year's 1,600 killings.
