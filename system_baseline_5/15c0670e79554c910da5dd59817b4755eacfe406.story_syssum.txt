Lawson, a 42-year-old administrative assistant, checked out a library book about online dating before creating her profile.
One in six recently married couples met on an online dating site, according to a study commissioned by Match.com in 2009.
Lawson began online dating at the end of 2011 when she realized she wasn't meeting anyone her own age in Gainesville, Florida.
"I probably think about 'Star Wars' more than anyone should," Lawson wrote in her OKCupid profile.
Even though they ordered the same kind of beer, Lawson did not think they were a match made in heaven.
Lawson said her favorite part of the date was when she texted him later to tell him she didn't think it would work out between them.
White got close to one of the players whom she had never met.
"Finally just one day on Skype, everybody else had kind of hung up and I said you know, I think I love you," she said.
If you fall for it, it's because you want fall for it.
One of her matches said he was "an architect/construction manager who built and designed a building in Nigeria for orphans," Hassan, a 48-year-old divorcee in Texas, wrote in her iReport.
They corresponded online for a few months, until the man asked Hassan to pay for his ticket to the United States.
But just when Hassan thought she was done with online dating, she met her husband in 2011.
Whether people are looking to find their soul mate or just to have some fun, Lawson said it helps to go into online dating with a sense of humor.
"In online dating and in life, it's nice to have thick skin, let things roll of your back and move on," she said.
