"This has been a hard thing to admit myself, but I have a problem: I am a total and complete Google stalker.
My friends make fun of me mercilessly, teasingly (I hope) calling me a creeper, and I've seen some sitcoms and movies lately that seem to indicate that Google stalking kills the mystery or whatever, but I'm just fascinated by people -- and the fact that our lives have become so public.

You've just shaken hands with your new cubiclemate and you're settling into your computer chair when you're hit with the uncontrollable urge to enter her name into Google and hit "Search."

It's totally fine to do an initial Google on someone you just met (especially somewhere like a bar or online) simply to make sure that s/he is, in fact, who they say they are.

A simple Google search by an American Girl employee could have waylaid that issue.
Nowadays, when anyone can and will search for you online -- you're not the only one, Creeper(?)
You should even set up a Google Alert for your name.
