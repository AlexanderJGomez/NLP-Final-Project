I wouldn't have enough money to do something like that," said Cox-Reed, a film and video student at Columbia College in Chicago.
There are more than 400,000 children in foster care in the United States, the Department of Health and Human Services said last year.
Medicaid coverage will be extended for former foster youth until they reach 26, as long as the individual was in foster care and enrolled in Medicaid until the age of 18.
"You can't be on a film set if you are uninsured," Cox-Reed said.
Even if this part of the ACA is reinterpreted, former foster children like Cox-Reed may face other challenges with the existing system -- namely, not all doctors and dentists accept Medicaid.
She needs someone to remove her wisdom teeth, but can't find a single dentist who will take her Medicaid card and she can't afford to pay for it on her own.
"People think, 'Oh yeah, the foster kids have everything covered for them, they can get everything done with their medical card,' but it's not true," she said.
"States are still trying to figure out how these former foster youth can be identified, how they can let young adults know that this benefit is open to them and how they can enroll," Lehmann said.
