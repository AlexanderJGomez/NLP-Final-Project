(CNN) -- Allies of Philippines President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on Wednesday defeated an attempt by opposition leaders to impeach her on large-scale corruption charges -- the fourth such attempt in four years.
"I'm not saying that there is no substance (to the complaint), but it was insufficient," Deputy House Speaker Pablo Garcia told the committee before the vote.
The first of the impeachment charges were brought against Arroyo in 2005 for vote-tampering.
The opposition then tried to impeach Arroyo in 2006 and 2007 -- and Congress dismissed those attempts as well.
