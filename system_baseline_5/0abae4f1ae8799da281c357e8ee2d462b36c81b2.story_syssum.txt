(CNN) -- At least 26 people were killed Monday in the Syrian government's ongoing crackdown on dissidents, the pro-democracy group Local Coordination Committees of Syria said.
The number of people killed in unrest in Syria since mid-March has reached at least 2,600, the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said Monday.
Mattar was "a symbol of what the Syrian revolution should be -- peaceful and nonviolent," said one of Mattar's friends.
Both men asked not to be named for fear of retribution.
The group, citing reports from Mattar's fellow opposition members, said he was tortured to death.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Syria, freezing assets of specific regime members and banning Americans from doing business with the country.
Mattar's colleague said that Syrian security forces fired on mourners, and that one man was shot and later died.
