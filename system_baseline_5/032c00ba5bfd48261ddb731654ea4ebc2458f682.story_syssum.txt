Monrovia, Liberia (CNN) -- Two children orphaned by Ebola play in the empty corner of a Liberian orphanage.
The orphans are not sick, and pastor John Ghartey is tired of seeing them not being taken in.
As Ebola killed parents, the fear of contact with orphaned children spread, even after they persistently showed no symptoms.
Ebola survivors are considered immune to the disease.
It may have caught on.
"They sit in my living room with my family," he said.
As Ebola has thinned out his flock, the pastor has given them spiritual comfort to fight their fear.
