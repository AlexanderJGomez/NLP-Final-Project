Aqsa gave a lingering farewell to her bedridden grandmother, and that's when Khalida, her mother, knew something was wrong.
Four days later, Aqsa called her parents back in Scotland, just as she was crossing into Syria from its border with Turkey.
"There was nothing they (Aqsa's parents) could have done different.
Aqsa is said to be influenced by watching sermons online and coming in contact with people through social media that helped her make the trek from Glasgow to Syria.
We just don't know what happened to her.
She was very friendly.
But when the civil war in Syria flared, Aqsa grew increasingly concerned about the violence.
Khalida says her daughter was afraid of the dark and didn't even know what bus to take downtown, much less how to cross the border into Syria.
"I know she is my daughter, but I feel that she is my friend.
Soon after her arrival in Syria, Aqsa told her family that she would marry.
Now we have to find a mahram (male guardian).
"We used to tell her ... this is not Islam, some of these groups are not Islam.
The family hopes and prays that Aqsa will come home.
In a special message to Aqsa through CNN, her parents made a personal appeal to their daughter.
Looking directly into the camera, Khalida said, "Aqsa, my dear daughter, please come back.
My dear daughter, in the name of Allah, please come back.
I love you, my dear daughter.
Anwar, the lawyer, says Aqsa is not directly responsible for committing any crimes and is safe to return home.
Both parents are worried that time is running out for Aqsa to safely return home.
