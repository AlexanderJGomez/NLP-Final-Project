(CNN) -- Will you be any worse off the moment humans cease to speak in Aragonese?
The search giant's philanthropic arm, Google.org, has launched the Endangered Language project, a website devoted to preserving those ancient tongues that are now only spoken by a few thousand of us.
"By bridging independent efforts from around the world we hope to make an important advancement in confronting language endangerment," said Rodriguez and Rissman.
"We hope you'll join us."
