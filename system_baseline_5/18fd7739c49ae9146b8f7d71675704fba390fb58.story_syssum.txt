The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights also said it deplores the kidnappings, arbitrary detentions, torture, sexual violations and illegal raids that the panel maintains other members of the political resistance have suffered since the June 29 coup.
Honduras' top law enforcement official said he "laments and deplores" violence that resulted from the coup that removed President Jose Manuel Zelaya from power and installed interim President Roberto Micheletti.
The OAS commission said that one of the recently killed activists was 29-year-old Vanessa Zepeda Alonzo, who was found February 3.
A third person, Claudia Maritza Brizuela, 36, was killed in her home February 24, the commission said.
"Days before she was found hanged, Dara Gudiel had been released after having been kidnapped and held for two days, during which time she was alleged to have been physically mistreated," the panel's report said.
The violence can be political, from all sides of the spectrum.
"Unfortunately, Honduras has a history of violence," said Otto Reich, who served the past three Republican presidents in a number of high-level Latin American posts.
But political violence deserves special attention to safeguard democracy, the OAS panel said.
Reich said he hopes the OAS report does not blame the new government for the violence.
The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is an autonomous panel created by the OAS.
