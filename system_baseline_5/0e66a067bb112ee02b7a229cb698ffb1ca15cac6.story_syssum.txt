Second-ranked Oregon and fourth-ranked Ohio State will play for the championship after winning the initial semifinal games in the first College Football Playoff.
In the first semifinal, Heisman Trophy winner Marcus Mariota completed 26 of 36 passes for 338 yards and two touchdowns for Oregon (13-1).
The miscues included a fumble in the third quarter by quarterback Jameis Winston that was turned into a back-breaking 58-yard touchdown return by Ducks linebacker Tony Washington.
Winston, the 2013 Heisman Trophy winner, was 29 of 45 for 348 yards with one touchdown and one interception.
"It was our goal to play our best in this game so we would have an opportunity to play in a national championship game, but we obviously didn't do the things that we needed to do," Alabama coach Nick Saban said.
