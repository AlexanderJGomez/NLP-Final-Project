(CNN)  -- A car bomb exploded outside a British army base in Northern Ireland early Monday, injuring one person.
One elderly male, who was walking past the barracks at the time of the explosion, sustained minor injuries after the bomb detonated.
"The people responsible for this cowardly attack refuse to accept that Northern Ireland is moving on and that peace is working here.
A car bomb partly exploded outside the headquarters of the Policing Board of Northern Ireland on November 21, and another under-car booby trap exploded on October 22 in east Belfast, injuring a woman, the PSNI said.
