The court was shown cell phone footage filmed by a witness in which a man who prosecutors said was Adebolajo, holding a bloody cleaver in his hands, spoke into the camera.
Remove your governments -- they don't care about you," he said, referring also to British Prime Minister David Cameron.
Describing the events of that day, the prosecutor said the two suspects drove at Rigby in a car traveling at 30 to 40 miles per hour.
Whittam, the prosecutor, said the defendants were armed with a meat cleaver, knives and a revolver when they got out of the car.
When police arrived at the scene, the two men moved toward their vehicle, Whittam said.
"It is clear that there was an agreement to attack the police when they arrived," Whittam said.
While the gun carried by Adebowale was not loaded, he also had on him the bloodstained knife he'd used to attack Rigby, the prosecutor said.
I did it for my God.
Whittam said the attack unfolded in a very public place, near a school.
Friends and relatives of Rigby were in court for the opening of the trial.
The car allegedly used by the suspects was also caught on surveillance video maneuvering in the vicinity of the street where Rigby was attacked later that day.
