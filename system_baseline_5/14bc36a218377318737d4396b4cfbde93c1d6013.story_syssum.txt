(The Frisky) -- Dan had a big grin in his profile picture, like he'd just said something super funny.
!
He told me about his knee injury, his love of almond butter and Alpine air.
It was.
"You like fettuccini, right?"
he asked, shoving pasta in his face.
The waiter came over.
"I hate it when they do that," Dan said.
Dan asked.
Dan beat me to it.
But--
As is often the case in this fallen world, there is more that at least one of us--me--must say.
So.
Dear Dan, There are so many things I'd like to tell you.
Like how I spat out tuna and little bits of celery all over my keyboard the first time I read your message.
Thanks.
Enjoy being single, Dan.
Dan doesn't deserve my heated words, or the three minutes of my life it'd take to write them.
