(CNN) -- Just days after a Boeing 737 flown by Southwest Airlines made an emergency landing with a hole in its fuselage, the Federal Aviation Administration said in a press release Monday that it will mandate operators of about 175 specific older Boeing 737s to conduct inspections for wear and tear.
NTSB board member Robert Sumwalt said Monday that inspectors have visually checked lap joints in the past, but haven't used high-tech monitoring, because no one thought that part of the plane was susceptible to cracks.
After Southwest canceled about 600 flights over the weekend to accommodate inspections, the airline said it canceled another 70 flights on Monday.
As planes are cleared, they will be put back into service, Southwest said.
One flight attendant received minor injuries, the agency said.
The airline said it provided a full refund, an apology and two complimentary round-trip passes on the airline for future flights.
The plane's flight data recorders had no noteworthy information on them, Sumwalt said.
