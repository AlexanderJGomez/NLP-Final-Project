HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- In the decade since the 1997 handover of Hong Kong to China, local movie-makers have faced daunting changes in the industry.
"The Hong Kong film industry came to a rude awakening [in the late 1990s] that the world was changing faster than it was in the age of new delivery systems for home entertainment and the Internet," says Bede Cheng, a local film archivist and curator.
"1997, unfortunately, coincides with the beginning of the collapse of the local film industry -- a well-documented fact," says screenwriter Jimmy Ngai.
The new Chinese market has translated into an emphasis in contrasts of Hong Kong-made films, says film archivist Cheng.
In 2006, Hong Kong closed five small cinemas and re-opened one multiplex.
Tim Youngs, Hong Kong consultant for Italy's Far East Film Festival, says changing tastes among Hong Kong movie-goers has also affected the industry.

Films that best retain a Hong Kong style, Kerr maintains, likely carry "Category III" (under 18 not allowed) ratings: Movies that are "grown up and smart," she says.

In Hong Kong we all speak Cantonese.
China says: 'You are not Chinese.'
After 1997, we lost the confidence to be Hong Kong people."
