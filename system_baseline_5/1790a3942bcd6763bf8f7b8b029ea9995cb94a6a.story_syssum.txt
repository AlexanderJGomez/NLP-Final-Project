"I was right behind David and the careers officer said 'So Mr. David Jones, what is it you are planning to do when you leave school?'
Frampton's son Peter joined the school three years after George and David and was soon in search of musical companions.
"No one at that time was into American football in those days.
George says David convinced him that the girl wouldn't turn up for the meeting.
I knew David wouldn't fight me and I was so annoyed I just went like that."
"Oh God my stomach was turning," says Underwood.
That's when David Jones -- now performing as David Bowie -- took his first big step towards stardom.
George quit music to focus on art and David asked him to work on three of his most famous album covers -- "David Bowie," "Hunky Dory" and "Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars."
After achieving huge success as a solo artist -- "Frampton Comes Alive" remains one of the best-selling live albums in music history -- Peter Frampton suffered a series of setbacks which left his career in tatters, until David invited him to record and tour with him in the 1980s.
Peter went on to win a Grammy for his 2006 album "Fingerprints" while George has developed a career in painting which has included exhibitions at London's prestigious Royal Academy.
"A lot of people have copied what he has done, in terms of re-inventing himself all the time, just when you think he's got him figured out," says Frampton.
