(CNN) -- Security forces under Hamas rule have tortured Gaza prisoners during the group's five years of rule, a new report said Wednesday.
Abdel Karim Shrair, for example, was charged with collaborating with Israel, the report said.
"There is ample evidence that Hamas security services are torturing people in custody with impunity and denying prisoners their rights," Stork said.
Islam Shawran, a spokesman for Hamas' Interior Ministry, said Hamas gave Human Rights Watch all of the information it requested, but was surprised that it wasn't taken into consideration.
