"It's a great honor to be asked to be the next manager of Manchester United," Moyes told United's official website.
"I have had a terrific job at Everton, with a tremendous chairman and Board of Directors and a great set of players.
Everton will be close to me for the rest of my life."
Moyes told Everton chairman Bill Kenwright of his desire to join Manchester United and succeed Ferguson on Wednesday.
"Everton can confirm that David Moyes will leave the Club at the end of the season," the Merseyside club said in a statement.
His final two games as Everton manager will be against West Ham United and Chelsea.
United did not have to pay Everton compensation for Moyes, as his contract had been due to expire in July.
Moyes gave Rooney his debut as a 16-year-old at Everton but they fell out when the England striker left for Old Trafford in 2004.
