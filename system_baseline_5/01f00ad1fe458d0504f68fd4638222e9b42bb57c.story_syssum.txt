ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Rawalpindi's police chief stopped doctors at the hospital where Benazir Bhutto died from conducting an autopsy, according to a lawyer on the hospital's board.
A previously released videotape showed a man at the right of her vehicle raising a gun, pointing it toward Bhutto, who was standing in her car with her upper body through the sunroof.
Bhutto fell into the car, then came the blast.
Pakistan's Interior Ministry announced on Friday that Bhutto died from a skull fracture suffered when she fell or ducked into the car as a result of the shots or the explosion and crashed her head onto a sunroof latch.
In the letter, Minallah said the doctors "suggested to the officials to perform an autopsy," but that Saud "did not agree."
Cheema said the government had no objection to Bhutto's body being exhumed for an autopsy if the family requested it.
The three-page medical report, which was signed by seven doctors, described Bhutto's head wound, but it did not conclude what caused it.
