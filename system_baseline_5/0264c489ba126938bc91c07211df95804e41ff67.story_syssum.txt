WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton said Sunday she won't vote for any more money to support the four-year-old war in Iraq without a plan to start bringing U.S. troops home.
"Even those who are implementing this policy of the president's cannot tell us it will make America more safe, nor that it will lead to the kind of political decision-making that we have to expect from the Iraqis themselves," Clinton said.
Nearly two-thirds of the American public now opposes the war, according to a CNN-Opinion Research poll conducted in early September.
"The answer for this is, let's elect more Democrats in 2008," she said.
