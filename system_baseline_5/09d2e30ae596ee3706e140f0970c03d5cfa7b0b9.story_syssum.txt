Marcus Schrenker was taken to a hospital after being found Tuesday near Quincy, Florida, authorities say.
Authorities also found a book of campsites -- also with the Alabama and Florida pages ripped out -- near the plane, according to the affidavit.
He had plenty of food, water and clothes, authorities said.
A federal arrest warrant was issued, and Schrenker will appear before a magistrate judge in Pensacola, Florida, after he is released and arrested, the statement said.
Authorities say Schrenker took off alone Sunday night from Anderson, Indiana, in a Piper PA-46 en route to Destin, Florida.
Quincy is about 215 miles southeast of Childersburg, Alabama, where Schrenker was first spotted after authorities believe he bailed out of the aircraft.
When police, who identified Schrenker using his FAA pilot's license, heard about the crash and returned, they found that he had checked in under a false name and had since disappeared, possibly into a nearby wooded area, authorities said.
Chiumento declined to reveal how authorities tracked down Schrenker other than to say the lead came from the Birmingham marshal's office.
Michelle Schrenker contacted her last summer to discuss a divorce because he was having an affair, Schmid said in a statement.
