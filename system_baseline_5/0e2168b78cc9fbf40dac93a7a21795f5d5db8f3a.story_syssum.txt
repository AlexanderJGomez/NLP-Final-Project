They critically wounded him in a shootout -- it was the fourth time the man opened fire while on the run, the sheriff said.
"He was a very helpful person, and that's what he was doing," Tracy said, visibly moved.
Wride called in a "motorist assist" when he decided to pull off the road to aid what he thought was a disabled vehicle, Tracy said.
The suspect shot Wride, while he was still in his squad car, with what "appears to be a high-powered rifle," Tracy said.
Seconds later, the officer was shot in his vehicle, wounded in the head, Tracy said.
When deputies caught up with him, the man fired at them, critically wounding yet another deputy, the sheriff's office said.
Wride's killing to his family.
