Washington (CNN) -- The fire that crippled the Carnival cruise ship Triumph started with a leak in a fuel-oil return line running from one of the ship's engines, the U.S. Coast Guard said Monday.
The Coast Guard said it has conducted 21 interviews with passengers and crew members since Thursday, when investigators boarded the ship while it was still at sea.
Coast Guard spokesman Carlos Diaz said the line ran from the ship's "number-6 engine" to a fuel tank.
Passengers had to use plastic bags to collect their waste.
Three other generators are in a second engine room that wasn't involved in the fire, Cuty said.
Passengers have praised the crew for its response during the ordeal.
It appears that the fire suppression worked as designed, Cuty said Friday.
