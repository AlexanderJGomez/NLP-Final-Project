So, maybe genetics explain my inappropriate hilarity when I heard that the U.S. House killed the Violence Against Women Act this week -- or at least stood by and did nothing while it died.
This trend came to a sickening halt this week when the Senate sought to extend critical protections to immigrant and Native American women, as well as LGBT people.
Before VAWA, women saw little incentive and an ominous downside to reporting abuse.
The need is clear: A full third of Native American women will be raped in their lifetimes; an even higher number will experience physical and emotional abuse.
The reforms in the Senate bill that seek to right these devastating and rampant wrongs are modest and simple: Tribal authorities can prosecute offenses on reservations when state and federal prosecutors fail to do so, the government can issue a visa to abuse victims to halt deportation if they agree to testify against their abusers and shelters that receive federal grants are prohibited from discriminating against LGBT abuse victims who seek their services.
These reforms seem like no-brainers in the face of so many brutalized women.
More protections for these immigrant women would cost Spivack's company a lot of money.
