Current systems of education are based on the manufacturing principles of linearity, conformity and standardization.
Education is a personal process.
In the talk I gave at this year's TED conference, I made a passing reference to fast food.
Everything is standardized and guaranteed.
They can open when they choose, serve what they like and hire whom they want.
Education reform movements are often based on the fast-food model of quality assurance: on standardization and conformity.
Human aspirations reach much higher and if the conditions are right they succeed.
