"The (initial) turbine is capable of producing 2MW (megawatts) instantaneously at any one time, given enough wind," says Alla Weinstein, CEO of Principal Power.
This means WindFloat structures could theoretically be transported to any ocean location where there is a strong wind resource, says Weinstein.
Weinstein highlights lower construction costs -- the WindPlus turbine cost â‚¬20 million ($24.9 million) to build and install -- as a major advantage the technology has over existing offshore wind farms.
The initial structure off the coast of Portugal is merely a pilot installation to prove the device works and is viable, says Weinstein.
