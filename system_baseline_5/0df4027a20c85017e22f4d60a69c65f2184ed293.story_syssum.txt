(CNN) -- The death of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, who was killed Thursday in his hometown of Sirte, Libya, is "an important step" for Libya, but don't expect the fighting to end right away, said CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman.
And for him to end up basically in the same sort of spider hole that Saddam Hussein did seems a bit odd, a bit out of character.
And how will the NTC fill the power vacuum left behind by Gadhafi, who ruled Libya for 42 years?
I was in parts of Libya where I spoke to lots of people who were opposed to the new rulers of Libya, but not necessarily great supporters of Moammar Gadhafi.
So Gadhafi ... was a rallying point for a certain element of the opponents of the new regime in Libya.
There's been a lot of talk about tribal differences (in Libya) We haven't really seen that play out ... but I would not in any sense bet my bottom dollar that Libya will be smooth sailing now that Gadhafi is dead.
