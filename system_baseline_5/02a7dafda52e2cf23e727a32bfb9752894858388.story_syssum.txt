Anna Loginova in a photo shoot for the Russian edition of Maxim magazine.
Loginova grabbed onto the door handle as the car picked up speed and she was dragged along the street before letting go as the car sped away.
Loginova told Maxim magazine in a recently taped interview that she fought off a car thief just four months ago.
The guy obviously was not expecting such a reaction.
