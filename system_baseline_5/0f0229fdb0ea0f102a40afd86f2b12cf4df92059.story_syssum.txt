Kate Moore, 15, of Des Moines, Iowa, out-texted more than 250,000 participants for the texting title in New York.
Another round quizzed contestants' knowledge of texting acronyms.
The finals on Tuesday afternoon pitted Dynda Morgan, 14, of Savannah, Georgia, against Moore.
Faced with a do-or-die situation in the second round, Moore seemed to bet on accuracy over speed, finishing well behind her opponent but winning the round.
Nor does Moore's mother have to foot an appallingly large phone bill each month, because her daughter is on an unlimited texting plan.
Moments after her victory, Moore agreed to an exclusive text message interview with CNN.
