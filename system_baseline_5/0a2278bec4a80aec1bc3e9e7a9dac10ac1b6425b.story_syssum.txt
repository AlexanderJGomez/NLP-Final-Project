Officials hope the containment cap will stop oil from gushing into the Gulf.
But officials have said the new containment cap would be a temporary fix, and the permanent solution would still be completion of a relief well.
"We're feeling very good about how we've positioned that well," he said.
The Helix Producer recovery vessel is expected to begin collecting oil Sunday evening, Wells said, and officials hope to reach its full collection capacity of 20,000 to 25,000 barrels (840,000 to 1.5 million gallons) per day within three days.
Wells also said there will be "significant measurement capability" added to the new cap so officials can get a good idea of the flow rate.
