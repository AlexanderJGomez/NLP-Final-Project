That said, good prosecutors should vigorously pursue cases when justice demands, even and maybe especially, when there are legal impediments.
This means arguing at trial, and on appeal, that someone like Zimmerman can be brought to justice notwithstanding Florida's strong self defense law, or that the law should be construed less favorably to those who resort to deadly force.
In many self defense cases, the defendant can and does argue that the case should revolve around the uncertain moments of terror faced when he was confronted by an assailant, and that everyone in the court room is after-the-fact quarterbacking.
Thus, a major challenge for the prosecution team in the Martin case may be the version of events that Zimmerman offers.
Even though the state has a lode of evidence, including vitally important 911 tapes that can offer a unique window into the motives of Zimmerman on that fateful night, it needs to be mindful of the narrative of fear that will be told by the defense counsel.
To convict Zimmerman, a jury would have to find that there is no reasonable view of the evidence that would justify his lethal actions.
