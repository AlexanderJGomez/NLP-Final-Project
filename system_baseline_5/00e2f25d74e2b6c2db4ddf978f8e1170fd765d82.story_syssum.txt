Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Haiti's economy is getting a boost thanks to a venture with one of Korea's largest companies that promises to bring 20,000 garment industry jobs to a new industrial park in the north of the country.
The garment industry had been the prime source of Haitian exports before the earthquake and it remains so today.
Georges Sassine owns a garment plant in Port-au-Prince that employs 530 people.
Today, he is able to ship goods from a reopened port in the capital, Port-au-Prince.
