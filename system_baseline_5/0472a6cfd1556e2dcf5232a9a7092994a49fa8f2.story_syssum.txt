(CNN) -- The shooting death of a 21-year-old Mississippi State University student in a campus dorm room is thought to be an "isolated incident," and there is no indication others are endangered, the school's president said Sunday.
Campus police stepped up patrols, Keenum said, assisted by officers from Starkville and the Oktibbeha County Sheriff's Office.
"Throughout the night and into this morning, we have kept the campus informed of developments through our Maroon Alert emergency notification system," the president said.
"Mississippi State University's main campus is located in a rural, low crime area," the university website said.
