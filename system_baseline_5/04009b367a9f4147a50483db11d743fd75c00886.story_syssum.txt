(CNN) -- Call it a meteorological mystery: Forecasters warned that there would be at least six Atlantic hurricanes this season, but so far we've seen only one.
Although the number of 2013 Atlantic storms is above average -- at nine so far -- the intensity of those storms hasn't matched the forecasts.
--In the eastern Atlantic, where hurricanes are often born, African desert air is drying the moisture that hurricanes need to form.
"The forecast up to now is a bust," says Gray.
"Our forecast remains the same," weather service spokesman Chris Vaccaro said.
The NWS -- last May -- initially forecast 13 to 20 "named storms," including seven to 11 hurricanes.
According to the weather service forecast, at least four more tropical storms or hurricanes will form in the next 11 weeks.
-In 1998 one of the deadliest storms on record, Hurricane Mitch, raked the Caribbean and Central America after forming in late October.
-In 2002, Gustav, the first hurricane of the season, didn't occur until September.
How likely is it that the weather service forecast will pan out?
--This year there is no El Niño, which would keep the season quiet, or La Niña, which would fuel a more active season.
--Climate change?
At the National Hurricane Center in Miami, they're comparing this year to "a slow first half of a slow football game," says hurricane center spokesman Dennis Feltgen.
"If one gets to you, it's a bad year."
"We'll figure it out," says Gray.
