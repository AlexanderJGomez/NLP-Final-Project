Naturally, I was in no less despair.
I thought that each one of us needed to wake up to this call and help and inspire the other to do more for our future.
They just need someone to show them the way.
I also feel that there is a lot more to Pakistan than what the world gets to see.
Pakistan needs your help.
The world needs to see Pakistan in a whole different light to help us out of this darkness.
I also didn't want this to be just a song.
All proceeds from the downloads of the song will go towards building schools for the children of Pakistan and ensuring a bright future.
