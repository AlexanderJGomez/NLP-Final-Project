(CNN) -- Next Monday, Google is officially shutting down its popular RSS feed reader, Google Reader.
(Many of the tools we mention will import data automatically from Google if you sign up before Reader closes.)
However, the weak links could also end up abandoned in time, and you'll have to search for a home for your carefully organized RSS feeds again.
Major news surfaces naturally on the social network; a chorus of links or commentary about important stories will likely make its way into anyone's feed, whether they're following news junkies or just friends.
You can follow your favorite news organizations or drill down by finding their Twitter accounts for specific sections or topics.
The RSS fire hose of news can be overwhelming for many people.
RSS readers are great because you can scan headlines and the first few sentences of articles and get the gist without having to read them, only going further if it's a topic about which you want to know more.
Typing a news site's URL directly into a browser seems so passÃ©.
There is also Google News, which looks at all the news sources and arranges the breaking stories by popularity, highlighting the in-depth, opinion and featured stories on the topic.
For example, some go directly to their bookmarked must-read sites in the morning, keep up on current news with Twitter during the day and soak in longer articles on commutes with tools such as Instapaper.
Google Reader was a great tool that will be missed, but its death is an opportunity to try new things and play with different apps, sites and tools for reading news online.
