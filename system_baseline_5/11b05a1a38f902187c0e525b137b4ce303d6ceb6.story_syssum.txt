(CNN) -- Two former top leaders in Cambodia's notorious Khmer Rouge, which ruled the Southeast Asian country between 1975 and 1979, were found guilty of crimes against humanity by a specially-convened Cambodian court Thursday.
The defense team for Khieu Samphan also said they would appeal the verdict.
The two men were senior leaders in the Khmer Rouge regime, which ruled Cambodia between 1975 and 1979.
"For 35 years (the leaders of the regime) evaded justice for some of some of the most brutal and cruel crimes ever committed."
Until today's conclusion, the ECCC had delivered only one verdict in its eight years of existence.
Some victims of the crimes of the regime were not satisfied by the verdict.
(It is) really a disservice to the other Cambodian victims."
"It stays with us -- how can it not?"
