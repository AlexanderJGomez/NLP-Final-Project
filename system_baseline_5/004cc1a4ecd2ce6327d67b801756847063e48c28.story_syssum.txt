For one thing, the postal service has been a huge employer.
This was as a result of the 1970 nationwide postal wildcat strike that began in New York after postal workers declared they were tired of earning $2.95 an hour and having to work a second job or collect food stamps to make ends meet.
In collecting oral histories for a book I later wrote on the postal service, I interviewed those who had worked before 1970, including those who struck.
Even as they faced discrimination at other jobs, many found work there with college degrees or military service under their belts.
Postal Service -- a self-supporting quasi-corporate government agency that remains committed to universal service by constitutional and congressional mandate.
Or that the post office is the victim of an artificial deficit created by the 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act, signed by President George W. Bush, which forces the Postal Service to pre-fund its retiree health benefits 75 years into the future over the next 10 years.
.
And that pre-fund requirement ultimately needs to be repealed to keep the Postal Service from running off the rails.
