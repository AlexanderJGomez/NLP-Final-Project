The video, uploaded to video sharing site Vimeo, shows two masked men wearing hoodies talking urgently in Russian as they scope out the boarded-up construction site, before slipping in.
The climbers, Vadim Makhorov and Vitaly Raskalov, aren't new to this type of extreme freeclimbing.
Upon reaching the very top of the crane, one examines his hands, grimy from the long climb, and the pair high-five each other before taking the ultimate Facebook profile pic - one unlikely to ever be replicated.
Makhorov's blog says that the pair waited until the Lunar New Year holidays, when construction teams had left the site.
