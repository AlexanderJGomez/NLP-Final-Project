Lille, France (CNN) -- Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka each faced questions heading into Switzerland's Davis Cup final in France.
Also encouraging for Federer and the Swiss, Wawrinka thumped a listless Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-1 3-6 6-3 6-2 to begin the day.
"Definitely one of the top three matches in my life," said Monfils, who squandered two match points against Federer at the U.S. Open.
Wawrinka, meanwhile, sparkled against French No.
"I know how to play those matches," Wawrinka said.
Wawrinka stormed to the first set and when he held a break point to begin the second, it appeared as if the Swiss No.
The loudest the crowd got in the opener was in that third set, when an agitated Tsonga implored them off their feet when he saved a set point with an ace at 2-5.
Tsonga smelled blood when Wawrinka trailed 0-30 on serve, but the latter rallied to close out the set -- and the match, realistically -- despite double faulting on one of his set points.
"Now I'm coming out of the match without any pain, which is good, too," said Federer.
If I play the doubles and the singles, it needs to be a lot better than today.
Wawrinka and Federer both aren't scheduled to play doubles but they can be called upon Saturday.
