Many of Goldwater's supporters were determined to push their party toward the right wing of the political spectrum.
Yet Goldwater soon learned that extremism could quickly become a political vice, particularly to a party seeking to regain control of the White House.
Since Miller, a New York congressman, was known for his close ties to the right, Democrats could charge that Republicans had not balanced their ticket.
The ads played on statements by the candidates and extremist organizations.
Always nervous about being tagged by Republicans in a conservative era as too close to socialism, Democrats in Congress and in the White House since the 1960s have tended to distance themselves from fringe elements of the left.
Some ugly elements of the Tea Party movement, which have been held in check since the original Washington protest in September, have returned to the  political debate.
In the short-term, the Tea Party movement has helped to revitalize the Republican Party.
Local Tea Party organizers have also stepped forward with words of condemnation.
Yet Republicans need to follow through by continuing to exert pressure on local organizational leaders to stamp out this kind of activity.
Now Republicans are facing the Goldwater threat once again.
