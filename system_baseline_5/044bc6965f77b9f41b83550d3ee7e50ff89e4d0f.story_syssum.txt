The sweat-stained sheets of Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, still on her bed, a woman quarantined in a Dallas apartment said Thursday that she desperately wants her family's nightmare to end.
Louise told CNN's Cooper by phone that she is checking her temperature every hour, and based on that and everything else, isn't sick.
"But (authorities) said we shouldn't throw anything away until they can get back with me," Louise said.
And Louise, her son and her nephews must wait 21 days from when Duncan first showed symptoms before they can leave the apartment.
Judge Clay Jenkins, also director of the county's Homeland Security and Emergency Management, said officials are working on that relocation after Duncan's partner told CNN of being forced to live with distressing living conditions.
"We have some hygiene issues that we are addressing in that apartment," Jenkins said earlier in the day.
When Duncan arrived in the United States on September 20, "he didn't tell me that he came in contact with anybody with Ebola," Louise said.
"I was so (scared)," Louise said.
But Wayne doesn't want his 13-year-old son, who is the youngest person quarantined in the apartment of his mother, Louise -- to know that what he's feeling.
Wilfred Smallwood, Duncan's half-brother, said his 21-year-old son is also among those quarantined in Louise's apartment, where he lived.
(Louise said she didn't think she had.)
One Ebola expert, Dr. Alexander van Tulleken, also said the federal response to the first Ebola case on U.S. soil seemed troubling.
