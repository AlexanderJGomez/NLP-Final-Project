If you hadn't heard his name before, you certainly have now: John Brooks is the 21-year-old who came in as a substitute into the USA vs Ghana game Monday, and scored a header to keep America's hope alive in the World Cup in Brazil.
Brooks mixes it up on Twitter and Facebook with posts in English and in German, and sometimes in both -- like the one he wrote about his nomination for the U.S. team.
His video portrait on U.S. Soccer's website is heavily edited, sometimes in mid-sentence, and his German accent comes through at times, but he says he's proud to be part of the U.S. team.
Brooks goal was one for the record books.
He's the first substitute in U.S. soccer history to score in a World Cup match.
If you hear someone on the U.S. team scream "Tor!!"
for Team USA.
