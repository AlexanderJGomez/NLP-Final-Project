(CNN) -- As America grapples with a crisis of children on its southern border, another image from another time seems inescapable: that ship full of Jewish refugees off our shores as World War II approached.
Seventy-five years later, we are faced with a new group of desperate people hovering in our midst -- this time children from Central America escaping escalating levels of violence few of us can fathom.
But just as with the Jewish refugees on the St. Louis, this influx is not primarily a story of immigrants traveling to America to seek opportunity and prosperity.
This is a story of three countries with levels of violence comparable to a war zone.
Another organization reports a child explaining, "If you stay, you will die, if you leave, you might.
...
Estimates vary on how many will qualify.
--First, we should respond generously to those children who have already arrived or will soon.
-- Second, we should push to establish "safe zones" -- operated by the United Nations, supported by the U.S. -- for returning children and their families in their native countries and work with those countries to reduce their violence and expand hope.
And it's true: the only way this crisis ends well in the long run is if these Central America governments successfully fight back against gang violence and corruption.
Will we turn our backs, as we did so shamefully to those Jewish refugees years ago?
Or will we live by our ideals?
