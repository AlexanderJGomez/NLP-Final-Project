Jordan is now home to more than 1.3 million Syrian refugees, half absorbed during the last 24 months.
The refugee crisis is costing Jordan $3 billion a year, about a quarter of the kingdom's annual budget expenditure, according to Finance Minister Umayya Toukan.
The budget deficit is running above 9% of GDP, although government officials suggest growth of 5% would have been possible without Iraq factored in.
But Iraq is now very much part of the equation.
"We feel we are not getting enough to continue to play our moderating role in the region and meeting the needs of all those refugees is not only a humanitarian issues, it also neutralizes any extremist tendencies," said Toukan.
