(CNN) -- For many families, the school year just started, but for Karen Suffern, it's not too early to start planning for Christmas.
Suffern felt tears fill her eyes as she read her son's letter asking Santa to help stop the bullying his overweight sister was experiencing at school.
She had a vague idea that Amber was teased on the bus, but she didn't know the extent of the bullying.
"Every day when she goes to school, she says, 'Mommy, can I just stay at home?'
And now every time I send her to school, I feel like I am not protecting her and I am letting her down," Suffern said.
Study authors Gianluca Gini and Tiziana Pozzoli write, "Given that school bullying is a widespread phenomenon in many countries around the world, the present results indicate that bullying should be considered a significant international public health problem."
"
And Suffern says she is glad to have a selfless son like Ryan -- plus Santa -- watching out for Amber, too.
We are saddened that this has taken place within our school family, and we can assure all of our parents, scholars and community that we will continue to do everything possible to provide them with a positive and safe learning environment."
