Foreign ministry spokesman Abubakar Al-Sidiq said that he is not aware of any plans to release Mariam Yahya Ibrahim before a ruling from an appeals court.
Some Western media outlets have reported that Ibrahim would be released in a few days, but her husband said that only the appeals court could free his wife.
"She said, 'How can I return when I never was a Muslim?
"
"
Wani said he'd never met the relatives who made the accusations.
His wife, he said, was raised a Christian by her mother, an Ethiopian Orthodox, after her Muslim father deserted the family when Ibrahim was 6.
In addition to the emotional turmoil resulting from the conviction, the couple also have to worry about their children, Wani said.
"She's in a bad mood," he said of his wife.
Wani said he was optimistic the appeal their lawyers have filed would lead to the court's ruling being overturned.
"I'm hoping that, given the way people have come together around the world -- which I want to thank them for," he said.
"The fact that a woman could be sentenced to death for her religious choice, and to flogging for being married to a man of an allegedly different religion, is abhorrent and should never be even considered," said Manar Idriss, Amnesty International's Sudan researcher.
The last time Sudan executed someone for apostasy was in 1985 when a man criticized Sharia law.
