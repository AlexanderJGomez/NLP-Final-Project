James McCormick, 57, marketed his ADE 651 units to government agencies and private companies around the world, including in Iraq, with sales exceeding $50 million by his own admission.
While specific cases of death or injury as a result of the use of the devices can't be proved, their sale was a "callous confidence trick," the judge said.
Police investigators believe it cost McCormick less than $60 to make each device.
McCormick was not responsible for any attacks, his lawyer said, and any number of devices could not protect the people of Iraq.
British police believe that McCormick paid off officials to buy the ADE 651 in bulk.
