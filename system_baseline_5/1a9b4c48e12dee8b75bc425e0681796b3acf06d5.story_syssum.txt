Beginning Thursday, the founder and head of the National Black Farmers Association can be seen driving a spluttering tractor called "Justice" around Capitol Hill, pressing political leaders to provide funds to settle a discrimination case involving minority farmers.
The 1997 Pigford v. Glickman case against the U.S. Department of Agriculture claimed that black farmers were systematically denied government farm loans and support from federal programs because of the color of their skin.
But the statement said the settlement agreement was contingent on the appropriation of funds by Congress.
That's what this is about.
Where's that at?"
He chose this tactic because he says the black farmers "are just marched out.
You know they're older now, they're dying.
Now, Boyd says he hopes to remain in Washington until a bill is passed funding the settlement.
"It's time for Congress and leaders in the Senate to start working for the American people and that includes the black farmers, too."
