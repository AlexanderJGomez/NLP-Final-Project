(CNN) -- The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced Wednesday it will donate $50 million to help fight the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.
To help ease some of the burden on West Africa's already over-taxed medical system, the United States announced Tuesday it will send $10 million in additional funds.
USAID also announced it will make $75 million in extra funds available.
On Sunday, President Barack Obama said the Ebola outbreak needs to be a "national security priority."
