A new CNN investigation reveals what most analysts have been saying since the "birther" controversy erupted during the 2008 presidential campaign: Obama was born in Hawaii on August 4, 1961.
Dr. Chiyome Fukino, a former director of the Hawaii Department of Health and a Republican, told CNN in her most extensive comments to date that she has "no doubt" Obama was born in the state.
Obama's certificate is "absolutely authentic," she said.
Like Obama, Waidelich's birth was announced at the time in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin newspaper.
Could Obama's 1961 birth announcement in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin be a fake?
...
He said he wants to find someone who saw Obama immediately after the president was born.
Neil Abercrombie said he did.
She said there is "no way" Obama wasn't born in the state.
Waidelich's mother, Monika, said she believes she saw Obama in Honolulu's Kapi'olani Medical Center next to her son in 1961.
"I find it a bit amusing in the sense that (the issue) keeps resurfacing over and over again," Fukino said.
That, the evidence suggests, may be easier said than done.
