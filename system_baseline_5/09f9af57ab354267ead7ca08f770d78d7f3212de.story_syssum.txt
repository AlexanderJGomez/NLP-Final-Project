(CNN) -- Wednesday night's debate showcased a Mitt Romney resisting his worst debating weaknesses and playing solidly to his strengths.
Let's begin with Romney.
Listen, Mitt Romney can handle these debates.
Romney talked over him so often that I swear one time I saw Lehrer slumping behind his desk while he meekly gazed up at Romney and muttered, "Excuse me, I believe you have my stapler."
But not Wednesday night.
Romney put Obama on the defensive and kept him there all night defending his policies.
This time, Obama clearly presented his theme.
What was it?
And it failed to put Romney on the defensive.
Unfortunately for the president, he didn't correct this.
For Obama, with a troubled economy, it works against the president.
Obama needs to find a much more effective way to pin Romney down to a specific policy.
If he doesn't, Romney will be like Teflon, and nothing Obama says will stick to him in these debates.
Since Romney will continue to put him on the defensive (and this is guaranteed), Obama must turn potential flaws into strengths.
For Romney: Steady as she goes.
Romney was assertive in this debate without being aggressive.
Romney can lose more votes than he can gain in future debates if he comes across as rude or mean, an impression many had of McCain four years ago.
