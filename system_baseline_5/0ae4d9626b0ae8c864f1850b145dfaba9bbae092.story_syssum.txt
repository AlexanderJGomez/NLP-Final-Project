Vos had spoken to the media on her mobile phone while trapped under her desk in the Pyne Gould Corporation building, drawing international attention to her plight.
I heard the rumble and then stuff was falling from the ceiling and I thought it was best to go under the desk rather than try to get out.
I don't know what might have happened.
It was then, in severe pain and struggling to breathe, that Vos realized she may not survive.
Some time after those initial calls, Vos says she passed out.
The whole time I was thinking about my family and my friends and I just wanted to make it out.
Her son, Robert, gave her number to a Melbourne radio station, and soon conversations with her were being broadcast internationally.
I was just trapped under my desk, you know.
I feel a bit like I have nothing keeping me here.
I think I would be too afraid to go into a tall building for a while," she said.
