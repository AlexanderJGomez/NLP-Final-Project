But in an interview with CNN, school board member and former East St. Louis Mayor Carl Officer says it is the state that's corrupt.
Caught in the middle are the approximately 7,000 students attending schools in the district.
Louis Jones grew up in East St. Louis.
Jones, who says he was "lucky" because he went to a private school, lived next to an East St. Louis middle school.
According to the most recent U.S. Census statistics, more than 25% of youth in East St. Louis did not graduate high school.
East St. Louis High School student Danasia McDonald says some of her teachers will show movies during class time.
Mitchell says many of her students will attend middle and high school in East St. Louis.
Officer says the problems in the district are no different than those in other blighted and economically depressed areas.
In those cities, only 53% of high school students graduate within four years.
CNN iReporter and East St. Louis native, Louis Jones, says the federal government has to do more to improve public education, especially in blighted areas.
Jones also says he would like to see inner city students given more of a voice in their education.
