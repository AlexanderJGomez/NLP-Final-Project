Osh, Kyrgyzstan (CNN) -- The flow of refugees fleeing southern Kyrgyzstan has gone from a flood to a trickle, the Uzbekistan Foreign Ministry said.
But gunfire was heard Thursday from the center of Osh, Kyrgyzstan, a sign that the violent ethnic clashes may be intensifying again.
The secretary-general promised assistance to affected people in southern Kyrgyzstan and those seeking refuge in Uzbekistan, and said he intended to consult with key members of the U.N. Security Council upon his return to New York later Wednesday.
Francois Blancy, deputy head of the Red Cross regional office in Uzbekistan, said more aid is needed.
