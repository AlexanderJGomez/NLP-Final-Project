The man is undergoing a mental health evaluation at Anne Arundel Medical Center, officials said.
According to police, the man called himself a "joker" and then said, "I'm gonna load my guns and blow everybody up."
Magaw said police went Thursday afternoon to the man's apartment in Crofton to interview him and found him wearing a T-shirt that said, "Guns don't kill people.
I do."
