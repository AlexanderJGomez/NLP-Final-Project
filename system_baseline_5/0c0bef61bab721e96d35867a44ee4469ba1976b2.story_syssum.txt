The comparatively large number of cases in California this year and in the United States the past year have sparked debate over whether unvaccinated children should be allowed in public school.
"As a pediatrician I have personally witnessed children suffering lifelong injury or death from vaccine-preventable infection," said Pan, who also wrote the California law that requires people who want to file a personal exemption to consult a doctor.
On Monday, a Southern California day care shut down because an infant there -- who is too young to be vaccinated -- contracted measles.
It's not clear when, where or how the child got the disease.
