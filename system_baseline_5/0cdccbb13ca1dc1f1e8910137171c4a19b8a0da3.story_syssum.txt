Diego Leon Montoya Sanchez was captured in his underwear, hiding in bushes, Gen. Mario Montoya Uribe said.
Montoya was responsible for as much as 70 percent of the cocaine sold in the United States and Europe and his organization ordered 1,500 assassinations, Santos said.
On Sunday, intelligence narrowed his whereabouts to the Hacienda Pital, said Gen. Mario Montoya Uribe.
But a soldier searching outside the house saw leaves of a bush move and found the suspect hiding, clad in his underwear, Montoya Uribe said.
Montoya Sanchez's two brothers are also in custody on drug charges.
