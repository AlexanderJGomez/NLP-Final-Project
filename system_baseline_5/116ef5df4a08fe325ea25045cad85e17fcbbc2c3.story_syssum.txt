(CNN) -- Iranian intelligence officials have detained the sister of Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi, the Iranian lawyer and human rights activist said.
Iranian Information Ministry officials contacted Nushin Ebadi several times previously, her sister said, telling her to leave their apartment and warning her not to contact her sister.
"Not only does my sister not do any human rights work, she doesn't do any cultural work either," Shirin Ebadi said.
She said she is certain Iranian officials are trying to intimidate her by harassing her sister, but, she said, she will not back down.
I'm worried because she [Nushin Ebadi] was detained because of the work I do," she said, adding it was that work that made Nushin a target.
