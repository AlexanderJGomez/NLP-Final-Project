Every single president in our nation's history, except for John F. Kennedy -- a Catholic -- and Barack Obama, has been a white Protestant.
But it's over.
Times are so bleak for WASPs that there's not a single one on the Supreme Court.
The demographics of our nation are changing and, by 2042, minorities are expected to become the majority in the U.S.
There's little doubt that we will see more diverse presidential candidates.
So, how did we get to where we are today where the white Protestant establishment seems to be losing power?
Back in the days when our nation was founded, only white men who owned land could vote.
In our first presidential election in 1789, no women, no blacks, no poor white men, and in many states neither Catholics nor Jews, were permitted to vote.
And it took all the way to 1920 -- more than 100 years after our first president was elected -- that women were finally given the right to vote with the passage of the 19th Amendment to our Constitution.
And there is no doubt that another white Protestant will rise up one day against the growing odds and win the White House.
(Of course, he is the back up to Mark Sanchez.)
