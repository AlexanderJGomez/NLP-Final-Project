(CNN) -- Sebastian Vettel became Formula One's youngest world champion in a five-way shootout at the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in November 2010, and the German needs just one point in Japan this weekend to seal a second world crown.
British racer Button would need the unlikely combination of Vettel to score no further world championship points, while also winning the year's five remaining races.
I think it would be wrong to think like that at this stage, the target going into this weekend is not to get one point, in a way it's not to win the championship, the target is to do our best.
"Going into the last race and being some points behind is a completely different situation to leading the standings by a gap of 124 points," said Vettel, who was 15 points adrift of first-place Alonso heading into November's final race in the gulf kingdom.
"On paper, I think it's a circuit that will suit the Red Bulls, particularly in the high-speed sweeps that make up the first sector of the track, but I certainly don't think people should under-estimate our package.
If Vettel fails to clinch the championship this weekend, the title race would roll on to the Korean Grand Prix on October 16.
