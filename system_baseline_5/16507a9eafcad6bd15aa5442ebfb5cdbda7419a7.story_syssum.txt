Washington (CNN) -- Before Tuesday night's debate, polls showed Mitt Romney had gained ground with women voters.
2, Lieutenant Gov.
During the debate at Hofstra University in New York, Romney, who worked in business before serving as governor of Massachusetts, said he "learned a great deal" about the inequalities between men and women in the workplace when leading his state.
Undecided women voters who were watching the debate and participating in a focus group in Ohio reacted positively to Romney's anecdote during dial-testing for CNN.
A USA Today/Gallup poll conducted last week showed Romney had closed the gap with women and was within one point among women who are likely voters, 48% for Romney and 49% for Obama.
After the debate, Democratic pundits criticized Romney's efforts to hire women.
Socarides gave Romney points for trying to hire women but said in doing so, "Romney demonstrates that he's living in another world."
Romney campaign surrogate Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee, said one reason more women may be looking to vote for Romney is because of his economic message.
