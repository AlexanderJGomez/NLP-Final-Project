Furyk, 40, told the official website of PGA Tour that he set an alarm on his cell phone which ran out of power overnight and failed to wake him up.
But I'm more upset because it's this one," Furyk added.
One consolation to Furyk is that he already has enough points for the 30-man season-ending Tour Championship to be staged in Atlanta in September.
I am sure he will recover quite nicely next week and jump right in there again."
