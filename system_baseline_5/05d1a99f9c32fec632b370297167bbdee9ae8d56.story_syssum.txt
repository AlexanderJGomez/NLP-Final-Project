At the very least, Clinton insisted that Obama -- in trying to sell Obamacare to the American people -- should not have broken his promise that, if they liked their doctor and health care plan, they could keep both.
Meanwhile, millions of Americans lose health care coverage that, defenders of Obamacare insist, wasn't very good anyway.
Meanwhile, on the other end of the health care seesaw, according to official figures released Wednesday, just 106,000 Americans signed up.
That's $26,714,785.60 per enrollee.
Now we know that, sometimes, the hammock is made of gold.
You'll recall that every single Democratic lawmaker in both houses voted in favor of Obamacare, the very law that they're now trying to change.
These programs fine people for not buying a product from a website that doesn't work right, and they have caused an upheaval where -- under the pretense of ensuring that all Americans have health insurance -- several million Americans who had health insurance wake up to find that they no longer do.
Many Americans don't just feel disappointed and underserved.
Only 19% of Americans say they believe the quality of their health care will improve in the next year, while 43% say it will get worse and 33% don't think it will impact their coverage one way or another.
It wasn't supposed to be this way.
And, if voters have anything to say about it next year, someone will.
