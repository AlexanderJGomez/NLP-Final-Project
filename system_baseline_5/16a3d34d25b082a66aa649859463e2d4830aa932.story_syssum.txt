(CNN) -- Amanda Wagner and Jessica Tuttle turn 50 this year, but they're not letting age hold them back from their favorite exercise: running.
Tuttle, who is a medical epidemiologist at the Georgia Health Department, feels that running gets her day off to a good start.
Watch more on running as you age Â»
That includes not running through pain, and resting if you have an injury, something Tuttle takes seriously.
"The biggest risk that runners will face as they age, with regard to injury, is overtraining, by far," says Mason, who recommends giving yourself a day of rest between runs, or cross-training on the non-running days.
"Members of the running group, it took them 16 years longer to reach certain levels of disability," says Chakravarty.
But running is still the exercise of choice for Wagner and Tuttle, who have remained relatively injury-free throughout their 30-year running careers.
"And I do expect and hope to be running when I'm 60 and when I'm 70 -- I truly do."
