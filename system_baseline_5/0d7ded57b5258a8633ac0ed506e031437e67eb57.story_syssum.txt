Joselyn Martinez was 9 when her father was shot and killed outside his New York City restaurant in 1986.
After the killing, the NYPD received information that Santos had run to the Dominican Republic and was incarcerated there for murder, and the case was closed in 1988,  NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said.
"They should not have closed the case," NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly said Tuesday.
About 10 years after the shooting, she said, she went to the NYPD's 34th precinct.
"I said well, I put that in there," she said about never finding her father's killer.
In November last year, Martinez went looking for her father's file in the 34th precinct cold case division.
And in January, she went back to the police chief at the precinct and presented her case.
Martinez said the police were quick to respond to the information she gathered and were extremely helpful when she went to them.
"I am thankful to God and to my daughter for never resting and didn't care for how many years," she said.
