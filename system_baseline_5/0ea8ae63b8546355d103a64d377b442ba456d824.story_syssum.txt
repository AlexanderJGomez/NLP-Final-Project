In a new attack on Google, Microsoft's Bing search engine accuses its rival's Google Shopping tool of being dishonest by only including paying vendors, ranking listings by how much they pay, and not clearly marking the results as sponsored.
To appear in Google Shopping results, merchants must now pay for Google's Product Listing Ads.
Bing's own search results also include results from companies that have paid to be listed.
Bing has actually shut down its free sign-up for the holiday season, and any new vendors interested in being listed are directed to Shopping.com, where they will have to pay to be included in search results.
The disclosures that all Google Shopping results are paid are somewhat hidden.
As a result, the quality of the individual product search results should improve.
Bing Shopping still includes Amazon results, but Amazon has positioned itself as an entry point for online shoppers in direct competition with Google and Bing.
Google Shopping currently has around 100,000 vendors and over a billion products in its listings.
Seasonal hijinks aside, Weitz said he has real concerns that this could be the start of a trend at Google, spreading to other Google services such as news.
