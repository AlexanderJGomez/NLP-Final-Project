(CNN)  -- Roma captain Francesco Totti scored two late goals as his side beat Cagliari 2-1 to ensure the Serie A title race goes down to the last week.
Inter must now beat lowly Siena in their final match to wrap up the title as they bid for a Champions League, Italian Cup and Serie A treble.
The battle for the fourth place and final Champions League spot will also go to the last weekend after fifth-placed Palermo and fourth-placed Sampdoria drew 1-1 in Sicily.
The defeat ensures Juve will finish in seventh place and have to play in the qualifying rounds of the Europa League next season.
