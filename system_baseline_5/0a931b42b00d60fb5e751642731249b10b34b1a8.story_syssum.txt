Other startups in the IPO pipeline include a number of unprofitable companies like Box and Square, with rumored valuations in the billions.
Ordinary investors who rely on the hype surrounding a company rather than the company's fundamentals may make decisions that they regret later on.
Even a decent business model and the potential for growth do not justify a multibillion-dollar valuation.
Some market watchers have argued, as Michael Wolf did on CNN.com, that the WhatsApp acquisition is indicative of a fundamental shift, and that traditional "old world" methods of determining valuation have been replaced by "new world" metrics.
Of course, not all overvalued companies are "bad" companies.
Twitter's stock is trading at nearly 45 times its 2013 revenue, and its profit multiple (a company's market value expressed in terms of its earnings) is nonexistent, given that it has yet to establish a profitable business model.
Despite losing 97 cents of every dollar in sales, the company had a $2.6 billion valuation.
Despite what some market watchers say, the "old world" method of valuing companies is still the best way of valuing companies.
However, investors placing their bets on tech companies without basic fundamentals are more likely to resemble Ponce de Leon: map-less and looking hopelessly for the Fountain of Youth.
