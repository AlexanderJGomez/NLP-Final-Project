(CNN) -- A week after students seized Taiwan's legislative building over a controversial trade deal with China, Taiwan's president Ma Ying-jeou agreed to meet with protest leaders to help end the standoff and allow the legislature to get back on track, a spokesperson for the president's office said.
But, he added, the students wanted to discuss whether Taiwan needed new legislation to monitor all cross-strait agreements, and whether the service trade pact with China should be delayed until that legislation is introduced.
Protesters, who claimed negotiations over the deal were opaque and undemocratic, broke into the legislative building in Taipei the next day, demanding that the pact be scrapped.
Calling on the protesters to adhere to the rule of law, Ma said the pact would create jobs for young people and that without regional economic integration, Taiwan would be left behind.
He claimed the deal would allow China to invest in "sensitive and core industries" including those associated with press freedom, such as publishing and advertising.
