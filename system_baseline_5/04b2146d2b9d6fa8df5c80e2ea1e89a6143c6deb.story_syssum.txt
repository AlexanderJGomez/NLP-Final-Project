Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (CNN) -- Nayef bin Abdulaziz, Saudi Arabia's interior minister, has been named the new crown prince of the key oil-producing nation, ascending at a time of regional turmoil amid the populist Arab Spring movement and simmering international issues involving Iran and other neighbors.
As was the case with his predecessor, the move makes Nayef bin Abdulaziz the heir to the Saudi throne.
Nayef has served as the Saudi interior minister since 1975, having overseen the kingdom's counterterrorism efforts.
The Saudi Press Agency noted that he also has been appointed deputy premier, meaning he will officially hold three positions in the Saudi government.
