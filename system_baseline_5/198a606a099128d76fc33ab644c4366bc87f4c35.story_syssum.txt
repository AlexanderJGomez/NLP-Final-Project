Many made political hay with the remark.
All mothers work, nearly all of the time.
Contradiction #1: Everyone seems to agree that women and men should have equal rights.
But research published in this month's American Sociological Review shows that women who breast-feed for six months or more pay a mommy penalty in wages for the rest of their lives because of the lack of work policies that protect employed women's right to breast-feed on the job.
Contradiction #4: Everyone seems to agree that when women married to men of means choose to be stay-at-home moms, they are doing so for the good of their children.
We have inherited both workplace cultures and beliefs from a time in our past when successful men had wives to take care of their homes and children.
Their workplaces, and our cultural conversation full of contradictions, has lagged far behind.
Let's call a truce on the fictional mommy wars and start a war on workplaces that don't allow mommies and daddies to live full lives, on the job and at home.
