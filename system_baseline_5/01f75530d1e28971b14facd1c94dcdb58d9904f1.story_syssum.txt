(CNN) -- HTC's new flagship smartphone, the One, is an impressive bit of hardware and a big step forward for the company in three significant ways.
Although the phone carries the branding established last year with the One X, One S, and other HTC phones, the One amounts to a reboot of the company's vision for Android.
The company set out to build a phone that could surpass, not just meet, the performance and quality of the Apple iPhone 5 and Samsung Galaxy SIII.
So, for the One, we really had to get it right, we really had to just go for it."
While it's easy to see the chamfered edges found on the One and think of the iPhone 5, the One is far from a copycat product.
While the One won't replace your Jambox anytime soon, its onboard speakers sound immensely better than anything we've heard from a phone.
Along with all new hardware, HTC is using the One to introduce an all new take on Android.
And the app can be connected to Twitter, Facebook, Flickr and other social networks as well.
While BlinkFeed is a pre-installed app, it's also the default view any One user will see once they unlock their phone.
"But, everybody's snacking on information, whether it's from their social networks or some news source that they're just interested in.
The fact that the One is joining it's biggest rivals in a new paradigm that bucks the idea of exclusive phones is a good thing for HTC — because they get to sell their best device in more places — and consumers — because you have more choice when you go to buy your next phone.
