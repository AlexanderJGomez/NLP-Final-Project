I asked professional dog trainers to share the most prevalent behavior issues, along with solutions.
Dog trainer Sarah Wilson suggests that the whole family try an old-fashioned game of hide and seek.
"It's the dog's job to keep up with you, not your job to keep up with the dog," she says.
As you practice the "come" command, dog trainer Andrew Zbeeb of Frogs to Dogs in Atlanta suggests adding focus exercises to the mix.
"As we run backward, the dog follows," he says.
"Stop asking your dog 30 times to come," he says.

"If you can't walk the dog easily and safely, don't ask the child to do it," she says.
No."
If the dog ignores people, she says that means they are not interested in playing.
Problem: The dog is unruly around other pets.
"Usually the older dog is growling because it already said, 'Leave me alone,' and the pup didn't," she says.
He also says owners should let dogs be dogs.
Â "A lot of people think walking is the only exercise a dog needs," he says.
"That dog is reading your body language," he says.
"If the owner pays attention to a stray dog, the dog will pay attention.
"The dog needs to know that the owner is not going to let anything happen," he says.
