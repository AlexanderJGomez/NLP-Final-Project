But even more frankly, I am bone tired," he said.
I haven't done all of the big things that I wanted to do when I started out, but I've done all of the big things that I'm likely to do," he said.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee praised Obey as a "tireless voice for progress on behalf of his constituents in Wisconsin and middle class families across America" and disputed the notion that his job was at risk.
"Let me put it this way -- I have won 25 elections," Obey said.
Obey said he believes the job of a good politician is to be "used up" fighting for causes one believes in, and then stepping aside to let someone else carry on the battle.
