Madrid (CNN) -- Spanish rail chiefs testified on safety before lawmakers Thursday, two weeks after 79 people died and scores were injured in a horrific derailment in northwestern Spain.
Court officials have said the train was traveling at 153 kph (95 mph) when it derailed, nearly twice the speed limit on the curve where the accident happened.
Gomez-Pomar said Renfe has started to examine the safety systems in place and admitted that they can be improved.
He said the driver had taken control of the train at Ourense station at 8:06 p.m., about 35 minutes before the crash occurred.
"It has been said that the only cause is the human factor.
No nationalities were given for those still hospitalized.
Minutes before the derailment, Garzon received a call on his work phone, apparently receiving instructions on the way to Ferrol from a Renfe staff member, a court in Galicia said last month.
