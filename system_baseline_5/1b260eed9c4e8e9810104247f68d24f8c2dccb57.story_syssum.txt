From the perspective of people theoretically standing on Jupiter, it would be like three solar eclipses happening at once, astronomers said.
And STScI published them Thursday, along with a short fast-motion video animation.
Jupiter is a sort of mini-solar system inside our solar system.
It has many satellites, including 62 moons, and they swarm around the planet with many of them crossing the surface facing Earth constantly.
The moons spin around Jupiter at different speeds; their orbits vary in duration from two to 17 days, so having them line up together to zip across the side of Jupiter pointed our way is special.
