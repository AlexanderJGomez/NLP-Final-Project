And now a new war has broken out: the war on comedy.
With Limbaugh under attack for his despicable comments, his supporters launched a desperate counterattack to save him by targeting "liberal" comedians like Bill Maher and Louie C.K.
Thus, the war on comedy was on.
Limbaugh does not even consider himself a comedian; instead, he's referred to as an "entertainer," which is the same label often used to describe strippers.
Are you a famous comedian?
or even "the entertainer" Limbaugh would have articulated.
In a comedy club setting, it's very easy as a comedian to determine if you went too far.
However, comedians must be afforded great leeway when the joke is about a political issue.
The standard for acceptable political comedy cannot be whether the joke offended someone.
Political comedians must be afforded the unfettered right to satirize our politicians -- even if their jokes include crude words such as the ones that Maher and C.K.
We will not only have lost the war on comedy, but also effectively silenced comedians from telling jokes about any controversial political topics or figures.
