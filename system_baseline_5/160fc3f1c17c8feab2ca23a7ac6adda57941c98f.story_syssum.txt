Angola, Louisiana (CNN) -- Prisoners in southeastern Louisiana are helping to fill sandbags and patch up levee holes along the swollen Mississippi in an all-hands-on-deck effort to keep the mighty river at bay.
Elsewhere in Louisiana, inmates in Pointe Coupee Parish have filled more than 110,000 sandbags, some of which were expected to be sent to St. Landry Parish, said CNN affiliate WBRZ.
Like many states, Louisiana is struggling to cope with the worst flood to hit the lower Mississippi River valley since at least 1937.
So far, the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development has delivered nearly 150,000 sandbags, 30,000 cubic yards of sand and 33,000 linear feet of fabric-lined baskets, the governor's office said.
In just the St. Landry and St. Martin parishes alone, more than 3,000 people have evacuated, the governor's office said last week.
