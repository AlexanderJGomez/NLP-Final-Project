"Everyone in the Chargers family is sad today after hearing the news about Paul," a statement from the NFL team said.
"We appreciate all the thoughts and prayers," Oliver's family said in a statement to The San Diego Union-Tribune.
"I just want to tell everybody in his family that we're thinking about them and we love them.
Just a good, genuine guy."
Oliver's high school coach in Georgia, Bruce Cobleigh, said Oliver was a leader.
Suicides of some other former NFL players involved brain injuries.
In February 2011, former Chicago Bears defensive back Dave Duerson, 50, committed suicide with a gunshot to the chest, rather than his head, so his brain could be researched for CTE.
The NFL launched a crisis support line in July 2012 for players, former players and their families.
"There is no higher priority for the National Football League than the health and wellness of our players," NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell wrote in a letter to personnel and fans at the time.
