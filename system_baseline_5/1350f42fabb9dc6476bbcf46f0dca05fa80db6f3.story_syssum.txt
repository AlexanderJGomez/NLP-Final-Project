Copenhagen (CNN)Denmark was on edge Tuesday, as it emerged that the suspected gunman in the weekend terror attacks in Copenhagen apparently swore allegiance to ISIS' leader, and armed police responded to a bomb scare at the scene of one of the shootings.
The suspect in the attack has been named as Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein, a senior member of the Danish government said.
While police haven't formally released the name of the gunman, they said he was a 22-year-old man born in Denmark.
Charges have been filed against two men who are accused of helping to hide the gunman, the men's attorney said Monday.
"An attack on Denmark's Jews is an attack on everyone," she said.
He escaped unharmed and told CNN on Monday he has gone into hiding.
The Danish Film Institute said he was director Finn Noergaard.
CNN's Karl Penhaul and Dominique Van Heerden in Copenhagen contributed to this report, as did CNN's Ralph Ellis, Holly Yan and Hamdi Alkhshali.
