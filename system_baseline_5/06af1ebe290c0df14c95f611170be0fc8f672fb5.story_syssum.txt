To Sony, releasing the Move is an obvious move for the PlayStation, given it believes it started the motion controller era with its Eye Toy.
The idea is that Move will provide players with a realistic and precise feeling of holding whatever kind of thing the game calls for, be it a sword or a gun.
And later this year, the forthcoming game SOCOM 4 will incorporate both Move and the sub-controller.
