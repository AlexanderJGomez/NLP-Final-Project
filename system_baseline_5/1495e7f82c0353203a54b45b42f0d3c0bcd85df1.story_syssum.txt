Protesters pushed their way past police in rowdy scenes as elite members of Hong Kong's Election Committee decided the city-state's next chief executive.
While most of the mudslinging during the campaign was aimed at Tang, Leung ran into his own trouble.
He later opened his own firm, CY Leung & Co. and became involved in Hong Kong's administration through his election to the Executive Committee of the Basic Law Consultative Committee.
Leung replaces outgoing Chief Executive Donald Tsang.
