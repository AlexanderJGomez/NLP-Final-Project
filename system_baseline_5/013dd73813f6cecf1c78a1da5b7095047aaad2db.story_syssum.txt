According to testimony, police were ordered to use police vehicles to disperse protesters, Egyptian state television reported.
Outside the courtroom, clashes broke out between police and families of those killed in the uprising that led to Mubarak's ouster.
"The policemen are beating us to please their commanding officers," said Amal Eid, sister of a teenager allegedly killed by police on January 29.
The clashes began when the families of those killed tried to push their way into Cairo's police academy, the site of the trial.
A similar scene played out in August during a court appearance by Mubarak.
In addition to accusations of ordering the killing of protesters, Mubarak faces corruption charges.
He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Meanwhile, Cairo's district courts have indicated they are considering filing individual charges against Mubarak for every person killed by his forces in the uprising.
