Washington (CNN) -- When Rosalind Cron left home in the 1940s to join a teenage girl jazz band called the International Sweethearts of Rhythm, she had no idea what it would be like, as a white girl, traveling with the predominantly black band.
For three years, she said, they were like her sisters.
The International Sweethearts of Rhythm were founded at Piney Woods School in Mississippi in 1937, in part as a way for the students to help pay for their education.
"The director of the music was named White," Wong said.
Six members of the band were in Washington this week to reminisce.
Cron told the group that if music is your passion, you need to stick with it.
"Don't let anyone come between you and your horns, or music," she added.
