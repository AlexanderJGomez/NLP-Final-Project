"I didn't realize how much my life would change, even in the last 10 days," McIlroy said on "Piers Morgan Tonight," aired Thursday.
"To me, I won a golf tournament and that was the end of it," McIlroy said.
His father, Gerry, held down three jobs and was a "calming influence" during the U.S. Open, said McIlroy, an only child.
While the young McIlroy has one major championship, Woods has 14, including three U.S. Open wins.
A fan of boxing and soccer, McIlroy said he doesn't want the flash of fame to affect him.
I believe in myself," McIlroy said.
