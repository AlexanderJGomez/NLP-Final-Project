New York (CNN)  -- Ren√©e Fleming's new album "Dark Hope" has found the light, having earned the operatic soprano a spot on the Billboard Top 200 chart for the first time.
"I've devoted my life to classical music," says Fleming, 51.
And while eyebrows have risen over one of America's most beloved sopranos stepping into rock 'n' roll turf, Fleming points out that cross-genre admiration is a two-way street: Muse frontman Matt Belamy recently attended one of Fleming's performances in Rossini's "Armida" at The Metropolitan Opera in New York.
Rock image aside, recording "Dark Hope" was a family affair for Fleming.
They have great taste -- eclectic taste -- in music."
