China said on Thursday it would end the harvesting of organs from executed prisoners on January 1 and while the move has been welcomed by human rights groups, it's hard to see how China can wean itself from the controversial practice if the views of people like Zhou are anything to go by.
The country launched a voluntary donation scheme in 2010 but between that year and 2013 only 1,448 people donated organs -- a drop in the ocean compared with around 300,000 people in need of organ transplants each year.
To plug the shortfall, China has relied overwhelmingly on organs from death row prisoners.
Huang said that prisoners will still be qualified to donate, but their organs will be registered in a computerized donation system instead of being traded privately, according to official English-language newspaper China Daily.
Since the beginning of the year, 1,500 people have donated organs --  more than the total between 2010 and 2013.
Liu Teng, a 24-year old audio engineer from Beijing, says it's something he might consider.
