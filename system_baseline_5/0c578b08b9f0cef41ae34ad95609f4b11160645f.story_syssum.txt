Just 24 hours after resigning from his highly-successful eight-year stint at Italy's AC Milan, he has been announced as the new manager of English Premier League club Chelsea -- replacing temporary manager Guus Hiddink.
Ancelotti, who turns 50 next week, has been in management since 1995, when he took charge of Italian Serie B club Reggiana.
Before entering management, Ancelotti had a significant playing career as a midfielder with AS Roma and AC Milan.
He played in the 1986 and 1990 World Cups alongside players such as Roberto Mancini and the recently-retired Paolo Maldini.
