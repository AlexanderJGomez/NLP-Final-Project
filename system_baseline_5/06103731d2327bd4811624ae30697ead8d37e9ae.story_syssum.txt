One show that has been able to get it right is "Smallville," which begins its record-breaking tenth season Friday night on the CW (that would be the longest consecutively running sci-fi show).
At the same time, what was once one of the highest-rated dramas on TV, "Heroes," progressively lost viewers, ending its run on NBC after four seasons.
Executive producer Brian Peterson said, "[Series creators Al Gough and Miles Millar] created a world you could see walking into every week.
Even though we're in Metropolis and we're really touching on the Superman world, it's still a world where you can see yourself having coffee with the characters."
"The first season should feel like the first act of a superhero movie," said "Family" producer Zack Estrin.
"Family" co-creator Jon Feldman explained that they wanted their show to have no costumes (at first), either: "I think the goal is, what if it happened to us?"
Tim Kring, who created the NBC series "Heroes,"  certainly agrees about making the characters relatable.
"There was that kind of transparency between your life and characters on the show.
Actor Dorian Missick described the show as being "in the tradition of crime drama that just takes place in this fantastic world.
He's quite suited for the role, having had a hand in the TV series "Lost" and "Heroes."
It may have had an overriding arc, but it was more of the emotional arcs that we were following," he said.
If you don't care about characters, you're not gonna care about the show.
So, for an up-and-coming series like "The Cape," the villains were seen as extremely important.
"No Ordinary Family" producers hinted that the family will come up against a major villain as the first season goes along as well.
When asked to share advice for producers of superhero programs like Wheeler, Estrin and Feldman, "Heroes'" Kring said, "My advice would be stay away from time travel."
I'm just fascinated to see how these new shows explore the genre."
