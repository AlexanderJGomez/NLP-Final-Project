(CNN) -- Spending 24 hours in Le Mans is not for the faint-hearted.
"The track, the ambiance, the crowd, the titanic challenge of the phases of the race, you versus the track, you versus the elements, 30 scheduled pit-stops..." began the 53-year-old, an ex-F1 driver and a winner at Le Mans in 1990.
The drivers of the 35 cars that finished last weekend's race certainly earned a rest -- and a shoulder-rub or two -- in the days that follow Le Mans.
"At night it feels like a video game," said former F1 driver Karun Chandhok, after becoming the first Indian to race at Le Mans.
The potential rewards for car manufacturers at Le Mans are no less significant.
Highlighting "downsized technology," the car -- invited to race as a guest entry -- was half the weight of a typical Le Mans prototype and designed to consume half the usual fuel and tires.
With 55 assorted cars starting the race -- from Audi juggernauts to the racy Corvettes and Porsches -- there was plenty to quench the 250,000 car-thirsty fans who flocked to France.
Le Mans is a brilliant event to "endure" with relish -- but perhaps it's a relief that it comes but once a year.
