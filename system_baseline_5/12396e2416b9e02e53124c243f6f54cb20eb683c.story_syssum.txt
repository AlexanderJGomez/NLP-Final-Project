The group, al-Nusra Front, also denies an earlier claim that it has merged with Iraq's al Qaeda affiliate, according to an audio message purported to be from al-Nusra general commander Abu Muhammad al-Joulani.
Al-Joulani, acknowledging that al-Nusra Front fought with jihadists in Iraq before turning its attention to the Syrian civil war, said he would delay consideration of a merger with al Qaeda in Iraq in part so his group can consult with various supporting groups.
Al-Joulani's message comes a week after the White House, according to U.S. officials, signed off on new nonlethal aid for Syrian rebels.
Opposition officials said they were in the process of doing that.
Both have suggested they are prepared to join nations like Qatar in providing the rebels with weapons and are urging the United States to do the same.
Opposition activists reported at least 75 more deaths on Wednesday amid heavy fighting in and around Damascus and Daraa.
