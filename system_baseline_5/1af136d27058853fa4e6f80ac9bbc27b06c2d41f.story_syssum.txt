New York (CNN) -- Staring down a smoking homemade bomb and dismantling it is dangerous enough.
I identified it as a bomb, and I had to look twice," Clair said.
Clair and LaScala are part of New York's elite bomb squad, a unit whose size is a closely guarded secret.
"We think they're great," one man said.
It was.
Put on gloves, and it's hard to imagine that anyone in such bulky gear could maneuver and dismantle possible bomb components.
"The more you do, and the more you get involved, the better you'll get when it's the real thing," Clair said.
Everyone knows what they have to do," he said.
The bomb squad was called to check out a backpack found in a park near a police headquarters checkpoint.
"Everything is a bomb until we say it's not a bomb, " said Ryan.
"At the end of the day, it's just one day down and a lot more to go," said Det.
