The Bush family shared their eight years at the White House with a cat, a feisty English springer spaniel and two Scottish terriers -- all of whom have their own pages on the president's Web site.
And Millie the springer spaniel's canine view of life in the White House -- as "told to" then-first lady Barbara Bush -- became a best-seller that outsold the memoirs of President George H.W.
But some have also taken a bite out of their popularity.
Come January, the Obamas will make history by becoming the first African-American family to move into the White House.
