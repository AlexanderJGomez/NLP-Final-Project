The teen idol is just the latest young star to run afoul of both the police and public relations folks.
Bieber has had both.
From being accused of public urination to rumors of a visit to a Brazilian brothel and the run-ins with police (authorities recently swarmed his mansion is Calabasas, California, as part of a vandalism investigation), Bieber spent most of 2013 in the news for alleged bad behavior.
Former child star Danny Bonaduce said on his Seattle radio show on KZOK-FM Thursday that Bieber's recent arrest could be just what the embattled teen star needs right now.
For some young celebs, that type of skid is almost a rite of passage at this point.
What followed was a year of outrageous behavior including the infamous hair shaving incident, and Spears' father being awarded conservatorship over her fortune.
Now Bieber finds himself a member of the club of Hollywood's young, rich and infamous whose mugshots join their paparazzi shots.
"Not 'I don't give a f***' to just be reckless and do whatever, but 'I don't give a f*** what they say," Bieber reportedly said.
