The sources said that as the pilot approached Tripoli International Airport, he took the plane off auto-pilot hoping to manually land the aircraft.
Both of Ruben's parents and a brother were killed in the crash, a Dutch foreign ministry representative said.
The family, which will raise Ruben, said the boy knows that his parents and brother were killed.
More than two-thirds of the passengers killed in the plane crash were Dutch, the ministry said.
The Dutch foreign ministry said Friday it is sending more experts to Tripoli to help Libyan authorities and Dutch colleagues identify the victims.
