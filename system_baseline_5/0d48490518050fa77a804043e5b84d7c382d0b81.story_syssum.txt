Mubarak was taken by helicopter to the military hospital in the Maadi suburb of Cairo, Shaheen said.
And Mubarak's lawyer, Fareed El Deeb, told CNN, "He has been in a coma for hours now.
He is not dead as reported."
He was taken from Tora prison hospital to Maadi military hospital, El Deeb told CNN.
"Clinically dead is not a phrase that is commonly used, but when it is used, what it usually means is that someone is brain dead," said CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen.
"In the United States, we would call this person dead because they have no brain activity."
Final results have not been announced.
"If he's really dead, its God's will," said Nasser Shaaban, another demonstrator.
Across the street perhaps a half-dozen journalists sat on the curb smoking cigarettes.
