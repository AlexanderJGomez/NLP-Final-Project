The ruling that Kerviel must pay â‚¬4.9 billion (about $6.3 billion) in damages to the bank, Societe Generale, was also upheld.
The bank was pleased with the original conviction because it placed responsibility for the rogue trades on Kerviel and not the bank.
Metzner previously told CNN that Kerviel's behavior was strongly influenced by the environment at Societe Generale.
Metzner filed the appeal against the sentence, but Kerviel switched to Koubbi as his attorney in March this year.
Societe Generale, which said it discovered the losses in January 2008, said that at no time were supervisors aware of Kerviel's alleged unlawful activities.
