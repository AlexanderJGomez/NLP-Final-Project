(CNN) -- Microsoft is taking its last big step before releasing what promises to be a massive overhaul of its Windows operating system -- and, by extension, how almost all devices running it work.
The release will mark the first major update of Microsoft's operating system since Windows 7 was released three years ago.
The recently released Nokia Lumia 900 has been heralded as the best Windows phone ever, although, as of March, only about 4% of U.S. smartphones ran the company's operating system.
But with Apple and Google's Android system grabbing the attention and market share in the mobile world, Microsoft appears to have an uphill battle.
"There's a long, narrow road ahead for Windows 8," reviewer Seth Rosenblatt wrote for CNET.
