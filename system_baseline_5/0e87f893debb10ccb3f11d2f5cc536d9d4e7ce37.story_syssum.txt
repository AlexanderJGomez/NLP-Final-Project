(CNN) -- Throngs of revelers gathered around Times Square in New York City early Sunday to ring in the New Year amid cheers, glittering confetti and fireworks in one of many festivities worldwide.
From London to Samoa, the world ushered in 2012 and said goodbye to a year marked by natural disasters, economic turmoil and other highlights such as the end of the Iraq war.
Samoa and Tokelau -- historically the last to celebrate the new year -- reveled in being the first to party this time round, after skipping west across the international dateline, missing out on December 30 entirely in the process, in a move intended to boost trade.
The atmosphere was far more subdued in Vatican, where the pope presided over a Mass at St. Peter's Basilica.
Russia started by kicking off its new year in a grand way with fireworks over the Kremlin.
