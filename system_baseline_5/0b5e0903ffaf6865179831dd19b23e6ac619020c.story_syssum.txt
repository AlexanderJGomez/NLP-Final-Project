In their natural state, the barrier islands that line about half of the U.S. coast, including most of the region affected by Sandy, are mobile and change constantly in response to wind, waves, tides and sea level.
Taking the dynamic nature of these barrier islands into account as we rebuild after major storms can help reduce the vulnerability of the local infrastructure to the inevitable next big storm.
While a failed dune in a coastal community makes it more exposed to the next storm, dune failure can make an undeveloped barrier island stronger by adding elevation to its core.
On a natural barrier island, this new elevation reduces the chance of inundation from the next storm.
Sea level has risen 6 to 9 inches along the New Jersey coast since the last big storm in 1962 (the Ash Wednesday storm).
What we know about storms, sea-level rise and barrier island response can be applied to redevelopment of the New Jersey coast.
There are difficult choices to be made in our response to Superstorm Sandy.
This requires identifying which areas can adapt best, prioritizing which will receive the most protection and which will receive the least, or even none.
