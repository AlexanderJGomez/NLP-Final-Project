At a probable cause hearing Thursday, authorities provided more insight about Harris, who is charged with felony murder and second-degree child cruelty in last month's death of 22-month-old Cooper Harris.
While at work June 18, Harris messaged six women, according to Cobb County police Detective Phillip Stoddard, the prosecution's lead investigator.
Milling, who had lunch with Harris on the day his son died, said everything appeared normal.
When asked how Harris was acting, he said nothing seemed out of place.
Harris never called 911 and said "f*** you" to a police officer on the scene who asked him to get off his phone, the detective said.
"The results of that forgetting ... were absolutely catastrophic," he said.
In warrants obtained by CNN on Friday, police said Harris discussed with family members the procedure for cashing a life insurance policy, but there is no other information or time element.
Harris accessed sites about "people who die," which showed videos of suicides, executions, war, etc., police said.
When he arrived at work, surveillance footage shows Harris backed up his car, according to Stoddard.
Harris told police he was supposed to drive his son to day care June 18 but went to work without realizing Cooper was in a car seat in the back.
"
Stoddard said Harris would take Cooper to day care in the mornings.
...
Ross must have left him in the car," Stoddard said.
Three years later, Harris graduated from the University of Alabama with a bachelor's degree in commerce and business administration.
