Hawaii tied West Virginia for 49th place in voter turnout in the November election -- and I'm pretty pumped about it.
In the end, both Hawaii and West Virginia registered turnout rates of 44.2%*, according to Michael McDonald, an associate professor at George Mason University who runs a site called the United States Election Project.
And, in some respects, it is.
If nothing else, it's a step in the right direction.
Of course, six people won't move the needle on a state's voter turnout rate, but those three people's voices were heard by their government when they otherwise wouldn't have been.
The people who really can improve Hawaii's voting record are those who live in Hawaii and who want to make a difference.
There are people like that in every state, working to make the U.S. government more accountable to all of its people.
*Data nerd note: The voter turnout rates are rounded to one decimal place because of a margin of error associated with voting-eligible population data and with prison population estimates, McDonald said.
