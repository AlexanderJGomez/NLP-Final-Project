For most of my career in the Navy, I lived two lives and went to work each day wondering if that would be my last.
In spite of the stress of living under "don't ask, don't tell" and the constant fear of losing my job, somehow my partner, Lynne Kennedy, an openly gay reference librarian at the Library of Congress, and I had learned to deal with the policy and make the requisite sacrifices.
But it was the events of September 11, 2001, that caused me to appreciate fully the true impact of "don't ask, don't tell" on our lives.
At 9:37 a.m., American Airlines Flight No.
But none of that support would have been available for Lynne, because under "don't ask, don't tell," she couldn't exist.
We are now committed to doing everything we possibly can to get rid of "don't ask, don't tell" so that our military can finally be open to all qualified and motivated individuals who want to serve their country.
I have great love and respect for our country, but I know we can do better than "don't ask, don't tell."
