We set Baltimore on fire this time.
We created a culture of such deep distrust and disrespect that violence seemed the inevitable response.
We let the violence stand for everything that's wrong with the things we already didn't like.
Yes we can.
Well, if I -- a son of immigrants whose family had nothing to do with any of those accomplishments -- if I get to claim those aspects of American history, then surely I have to claim the unsavory aspects too.
We created a polity in which racial inequity and economic inequality magnify each other unrelentingly.
About how slavery and its legacy are artifacts of a time past.
No, we own them all.
For the left, it's about the deep structural root causes of the alienation and violence.
And until more people can see this, we will not see progress.
But it cannot possibly be that only those with whom I disagree are responsible for what is happening in Baltimore.
Because we are.
And there is no other "we" waiting in the wings.
