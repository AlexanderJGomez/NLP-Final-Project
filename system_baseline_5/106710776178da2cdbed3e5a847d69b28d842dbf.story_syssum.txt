A good place to look for answers would be to examine Saudi Arabia's policies of intolerance and extremism.
King Abdullah, as the protector of Islam's most sacred religious sites and leader of Saudi Arabia, is widely considered an important role model for Muslims around the world.
There is so much shock and outrage about ISIS propaganda videotapes showing its beheadings of journalists in Iraq and Syria -- and most recently, the reported beheadings of two Tunisian journalists in Libya.
But the much more routine and widespread beheadings by Saudi Arabia get little scrutiny and condemnation.
In 2014, Saudi Arabia was still beheading people for "sorcery."
That includes the anti-ISIS coalition, to which Saudi Arabia and many other unaccountable, authoritarian, and deeply abusive Arab governments belong.
