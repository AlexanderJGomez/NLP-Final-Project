Law enforcement from Massachusetts and Florida as well as the FBI questioned Todashev at his Florida home.
A U.S. government official briefed on the FBI investigation told CNN in May that Todashev had agreed to talk to authorities and noted he was never arrested or handcuffed.
A samurai sword was in the room when Todashev sat down with two Massachusetts State Police detectives and a Boston-based FBI agent, but it was moved out of his reach, the U.S. official said.
A law enforcement official told CNN that Todashev attacked the FBI agent with a broom handle, not a sword.
