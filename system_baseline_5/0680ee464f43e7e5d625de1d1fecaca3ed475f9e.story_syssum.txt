Delta Air Lines Flight 2566 from San Francisco to Minneapolis diverted to Salt Lake City on Wednesday when a pregnant passenger went into labor during the flight.
The pediatrician was a big help, she said, as were the flight attendants.
It's not the first time this month that a pregnant passenger has diverted a flight.
"It was amazing," a flight attendant said in a video posted on the airline's website.
Delta doesn't restrict the travel of pregnant passengers, but the airline does offer guidance about change fees on its website.
However, "air travel is not recommended at any time during pregnancy for women who have medical or obstetric conditions that may be exacerbated by flight or that could require emergency care."
