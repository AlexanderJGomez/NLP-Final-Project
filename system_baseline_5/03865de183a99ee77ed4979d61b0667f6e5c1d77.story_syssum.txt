The male acquaintance, also 30, witnessed the kidnapping of Denise Louise Huskins from the Vallejo home, and he is not a suspect in the case, said Vallejo Police Lt. Kenny Park.
Huskins, who has been living in Vallejo the past year, is from Huntington Beach in Southern California, police said.
Authorities don't know when her vehicle was moved, police said.
"All I can tell is there was a ransom demand," Park said.
