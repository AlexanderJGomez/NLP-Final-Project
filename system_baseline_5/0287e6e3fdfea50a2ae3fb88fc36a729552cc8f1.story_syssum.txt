"You feel like you're in a fight with one hand tied behind your back," said Mosier, 56.
Mosier was able to get her required surgery, but her doctor, Dr. Wendel Naumann, was unable to get Doxil, the chemotherapy treatment she needed.
Mosier was never able to get another dose of Doxil and spent the last month of her life in hospice care.
On June 29, 2012, Mosier died.
In a recent report, the panel claimed the FDA -- the very agency tasked with dealing with shortages -- is partly to blame for the shortage situation.
"Let me just say, very clearly, that the report is incorrect," Dr. Sandra Kweder of the FDA said on "Sanjay Gupta, MD."
On Monday, the FDA issued a letter to Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Maryland) of the House Oversight Committee, responding to the committee's blaming the FDA for the shortages.
A May 2011 FDA inspection found a string of problems, including inadequate oversight and metallic particle shards in some of the drugs produced on site.
From their findings, the House Oversight Committee found that 58% of the drugs on the shortage list were produced at facilities cited by the FDA.
Kweder also cited the recent reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act as a key to preventing shortages.
Signed by President Barack Obama earlier this month, the act will help the FDA expedite the drug review process, particularly for drugs in shortage.
Since Obama signed an executive order requesting early notification from manufacturers in November 2011, more and more companies have been able to give the FDA the needed heads-up.
Just since January, at our count, we've prevented 94 to 100 shortages, things the public never sees," Kweder told Gupta.
I don't think these shortages are going to go away because of this bill."
