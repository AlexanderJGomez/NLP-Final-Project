"Iran was beautiful," Sheppard said.
A native of St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Sheppard starred in both basketball and soccer for Jacksonville University in Florida.
"Sometimes you have to go out there and see it for yourself," the 32-year-old said.
"They brought me in as a brother," Sheppard explains.
That first year in Iran, Sheppard, along with another import, Serbian Zoran Majkic, led their team to the playoffs for the first time.
"Sara and I looked at each other and said if he's as clever and funny as he is on Skype then I'll stay in Iran and we'll make this film," Schauder said.
For instance, Sheppard became close friends with three Iranian women, rare in a country where the sexes are forbidden from interacting in public.
"It was really bad for women.
Schauder continued filming the discussions and cultural exchanges Sheppard encountered both on and off court, but as the 2009 presidential elections and violent street protests took hold, it became increasingly difficult to gather footage of him on the streets of Tehran.
"I mailed 80 tapes and kept the 10 I felt had the biggest nuggets with myself," Schauder says.
Schauder, who had been denied a journalist's visa, freely traveled in and out of the country before his last planned trip near the end of the basketball season.
On the basketball court, Sheppard was unfazed by the street protests.
While still interested in visiting his friends back in Iran, he admits that might be difficult.
