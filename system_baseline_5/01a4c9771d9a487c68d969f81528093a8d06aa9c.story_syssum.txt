They're not backing down," CNN's Atia Abawi reported from the battlefield, where she is embedded with U.S. Marines.
The Taliban seem to include "foreign fighters who will fight to the death," she said.
There have been five casualties among the NATO-led forces during the operation, the forces said in a statement Thursday, without giving further details.
Across the border in Pakistan, four people were killed and five were wounded Thursday when a drone fired on a suspected militant compound in the country's tribal region, intelligence sources and a local political official said.
The four dead were suspected militants, two intelligence officials said.
The Taliban sources said he was nabbed in Faisalabad.
Yaqubi said Salam and another Taliban "shadow governor," Mullah Salih, were arrested last week in the Pakistani city of Peshawar.
