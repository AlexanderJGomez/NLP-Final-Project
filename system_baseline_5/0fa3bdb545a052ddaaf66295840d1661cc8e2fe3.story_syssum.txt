One of the accusers had once traveled with them to the Alamo Bowl, Dottie Sandusky said, where she and her husband shared a hotel room with the boy.
Dr. Elliot Atkins testified that he had diagnosed Sandusky with histrionic personality disorder after interviewing the former coach.
The prosecution had earlier presented as evidence what one accuser described as "creepy love letters," written by Sandusky.
Early in the trial, Amendola implied that Sandusky would take the stand.
Sandusky routinely "got showers with kids" after working out, and he would say so later, Amendola said Monday.
The final prosecution witness testified Monday that her son seemed to suffer from stomach ailments during the times he was visiting Sandusky and sometimes did not want to visit the former Penn State assistant's home.
The defense then opened its case with a former Penn State coach who testified about Sandusky's stellar reputation in the community.
Another said Sandusky warned he might send him home from a trip to Texas, where they'd gone to watch a Penn State bowl game.
On Monday, prosecutors dropped one of the 52 counts against Sandusky because the statute he was charged with wasn't in effect on the date of the alleged incident.
