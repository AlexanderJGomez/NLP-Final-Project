(CNN) -- A Georgia youth football coach who made disparaging  comments on Facebook about ethnic groups and women wants to continue coaching and hopes people accept his apology, his attorney said Wednesday.
Attorney Chris McClurg, who said he also has been Samuelson's friend for about five years, said the coach made a public apology and "is a nice guy" who made "insensitive" remarks.
The coach described south Asians as "Red Dots" and Hispanics as "Beaners," according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which said he mocked other ethnic groups and women.
My personal observation is that those fishheads still eat with chopsticks.
"He wants to move on," said McClurg, indicating Samuelson was not available for comment Wednesday.
Samuelson hopes to continue coaching at Brookwood next year, McClurg said.
