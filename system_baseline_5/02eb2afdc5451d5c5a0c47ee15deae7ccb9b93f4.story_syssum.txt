(CNN) -- Four human rights organizations are urging authorities in the United Arab Emirates to drop charges against five pro-democracy activists.
The groups accuse UAE authorities of misusing the defamation charges "as a pretext" to punish the activists for peacefully expressing their opinions, they said in a statement.
All were arrested on the heels of a recent decision by the UAE's government to dissolve the elected board of directors of the Jurist Association, a prominent civil rights organization in that country, and replace it with state appointees, according to Human Rights Watch.
Human Rights Watch has accused UAE authorities of acting against its own free speech guarantees as well as those propagated by regional and international provisions.
Long-standing regimes in Tunisia and Egypt were toppled earlier this year, and Damascus has launched a violent crackdown against protesters in Syria.
Migrant workers comprise the bulk of the population in the country.
