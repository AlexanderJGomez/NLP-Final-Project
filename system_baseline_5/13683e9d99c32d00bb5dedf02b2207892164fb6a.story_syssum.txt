(CNN)  -- World number three Roger Federer exited the Monte Carlo Masters at the quarterfinals stage to Austrian Jurgen Melzer Friday.
The second followed a similar pattern, with Federer unable to capitalize on his seven break points in the match as the seventh seed went through.
Melzer will now play world number six David Ferrer after the Spaniard saw off 11th Viktor Troicki of Serbia 6-3 6-3 in an earlier match Friday.
There was no stopping world number one Rafael Nadal, bidding for his seventh straight title in Monte Carlo, as he swept aside Croatian Ivan Ljubicic 6-1 6-3 to reach the last four.
