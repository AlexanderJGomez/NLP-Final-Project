Washington (CNN) -- The turbulent political environment and a flood of outside spending from Republican backed Super PACs are throwing House Democrats on defense twenty days before the midterm elections, and they are putting out the call for help from their allies.
A senior House Democratic aide confirms that resources are being moved away from targets in red districts to shore up Democrats on defense against Republican attacks.
The House Democrats' campaign arm pulled resources way from a race in Northern Virginia to replace a retiring Republican, where Democratic challenger John Foust is competing against former House GOP aide Barbara Comstock.
A spokeswoman for the House GOP's campaign committee said Israel's focus on outside factors ignored the drag that the president was having on congressional Democrats.
"Chairman Israel needs stop the Washington blame game and admit that President Obama and his devastating policies are casting a large shadow over the landscape for House Democrats," Andrea Bozek, spokeswoman for the NRCC said in a written statement.
