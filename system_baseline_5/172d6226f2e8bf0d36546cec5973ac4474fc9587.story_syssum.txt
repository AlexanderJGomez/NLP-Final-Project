Its patented "breathable shoe" technology -- a combination of a membrane insole that absorbs sweat and lets it out through an outer sole filled with holes -- has turned the company into a multi-million dollar shoe empire.
When Polegato returned to Italy he started to develop a shoe with holes in the sole that let air in and perspiration out.
In every factory where we produce there is an Italian technician, a shoemaker, that controls shoe by shoe," said Polegato.
Nearly seven years after Geox opened a megastore on Madison Avenue in New York City, the company is looking east to expand its empire.
