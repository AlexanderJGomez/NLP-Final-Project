This time it's a hacker attack on various websites associated with Sony Pictures.
The accounts, presumably associated with any sort of registered activity on SonyPictures.com (or its subsidiaries or partners), contain information like passwords, email addresses, dates of birth and other Sony opt-in data.
The scariest part of this attack isn't what was taken, but how easy it was for the LulzSec members to take it.
We can only hope the most recent cyber attacks convince executives to think seriously about investing in online security.
