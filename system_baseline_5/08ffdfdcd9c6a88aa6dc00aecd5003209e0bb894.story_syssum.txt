(CNN)Talk show host Dr. Mehmet Oz is defending himself against a group of doctors who accuse him of "manifesting an egregious lack of integrity" in his TV and promotional work and who call his faculty position at Columbia University unacceptable.
The email sent to Columbia's faculty dean for Health Sciences and Medicine, Dr. Lee Goldman, said the group is "surprised and dismayed" that Oz is on faculty and that he holds a senior administrative position.
Oz is vice chair of the Department of Surgery, at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.
The FDA disputed the findings and said the report was misleading and irresponsible.
Miller and the other doctors who signed the email echo that sentiment, saying Oz is misleading the public and they tell Columbia's Goldman that having him on the faculty is unacceptable.
Orlando, Florida, anesthesiologist Dr. Shelley Fleet told CNN when she received an email from Miller inviting her to sign the email to Columbia, she said of course.
Oz spokesman Tim Sullivan sent an email to CNN last week listing the names of five of the 10 people who complained about Oz.
For its part, Columbia University is standing by Oz.
Oz rose to fame after frequent appearances on "The Oprah Winfrey Show" led to the creation of his own show and magazine.
