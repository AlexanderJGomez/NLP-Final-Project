(CNN) -- The U.S. government claims he's the mastermind of a huge online fraud operation with multiple identities and a history of breaking the law and evading arrest, but his lawyer says he's a law-abiding entrepreneur committed to raising his young family in New Zealand.
Dotcom holds one German passport, under the name of Kim Schmitz, and two Finnish passports, under the names of Kim Tim Jim Vestor and Kim Dotcom.
Dotcom is a resident of New Zealand, where he employs more than 50 staff, and Hong Kong, where he has a suite at the Grand Hyatt Hotel.
The judge also expressed concern about the existence of a firearm found near Dotcom at the time of his arrest last week.
It was also disclosed in court that Dotcom suffers from diabetes and hypertension.
All reasons, his lawyers said, for not keeping him in custody.
