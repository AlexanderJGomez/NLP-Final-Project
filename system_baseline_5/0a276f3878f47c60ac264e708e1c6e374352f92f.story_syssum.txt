But he said surveillance video showed a male "similar" to the man who police say dragged and abducted the 22-year-old woman Sunday night.
We just want Carlesha returned to us safely," her grandmother Ana Mulero said at a news conference with Wilson in Philadelphia.
Police didn't immediately release the bank video.
The video shows Freeland-Gaither tussling on the ground with her abductor and being forced into a four-door vehicle, which police say may be a gray Ford Taurus.
Investigators aren't sure whether she knew her abductor, though there's no indication on the Philadelphia surveillance video that she did, Wilson said.
Mulero said her granddaughter lived with her for four years in Maryland before Freeland-Gaither returned to Philadelphia to be with other relatives and pursue a career.
