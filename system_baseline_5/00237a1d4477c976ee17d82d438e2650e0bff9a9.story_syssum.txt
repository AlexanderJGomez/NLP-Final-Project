From within what he called the "Academy of Sciences and Space Technology," Nkoloso said, he'd been studying Mars through telescopes.
"Specially trained spacegirl Matha Mwambwa, two cats (also specially trained) and a missionary will be launched in our first rocket," wrote Nkoloso, a grade-school science teacher and self-appointed director of the space academy.
In the self-published book, De Middel self-consciously conjures up the story of the unofficial space program piece by piece.
"I was working in a very free way," says De Middel, sitting at the caf√© of the Photographer's Gallery in London, where The Afronauts is being exhibited.
"I think that's the greatest characteristic we have as humans, that we can dream of becoming big," says De Middel.
"It was like a short, small and very modest movie production," says De Middel.

"He had a fascination for the universe that we all share," says De Middel.
