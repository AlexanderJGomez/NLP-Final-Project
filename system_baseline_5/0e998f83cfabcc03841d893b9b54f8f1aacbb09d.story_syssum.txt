In the southern province of Kerala, the strike hit government-run transport services hard, authorities said.
Most marketplaces in the state were also closed, Kerala police spokesman S. Sudhir said.
"We demand the government come out with proposals in relation to our demands," said G. Sanjeeva Reddy, president of the Indian National Trade Union Congress that is linked to Singh's party.
While markets in the city remained open, at least one branch of the State Bank of India in New Delhi was hit hard by the strike, with senior executives picking up the slack.
