"Why are they doing this?"
says Frank Bales, 86, a co-pilot on a B-24 during World War II.
These World War II veterans have traveled here to visit the National World War II Memorial, which honors the 16 million U.S. armed forces who served and the more than 400,000 who died in battle.
All of the veterans wanted to see it but they were in poor health or didn't have the means to visit it."
Six planes flew 12 veterans.
So far, more than 30,000 veterans have experienced a visit to the memorial, courtesy of Honor Flight.
Many said they were stunned by its size and scope.
"I've had exchanges with veterans that are jaw dropping," Morse says.
The same "Honor Flight" that transported the veterans to Washington returns them back home, landing just 12 hours after it took off.
An estimated 1,200 WWII veterans die every day.
