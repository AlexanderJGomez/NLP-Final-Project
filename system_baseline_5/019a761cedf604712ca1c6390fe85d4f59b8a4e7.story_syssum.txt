Just three weeks ago, Fowle -- like his fellow Americans, Bae and Miller -- was detained in North Korea.
No more.
"Kenneth Bae and Matthew Miller should have been released before I was," Fowle told CNN.
Euna Lee, who was released from North Korea in 2009 after being detained for 140 days, said she wanted to return not just to her home, but to normal.
A devout Christian, Bae was in Rason, an area along the northeastern coast of North Korea, when authorities arrested him in November 2012.
While also accused of "perpetrating hostile acts," and while he -- like Bae and Miller -- told CNN he signed documents admitting his guilt, Fowle said he didn't spend time in a jail or at a labor camp.
Thankfully, that won't be a struggle any more for Bae and Miller.
Still, he believes that both Bae and Miller -- if they can survive months detained in North Korea -- can survive and thrive in their return home as well.
