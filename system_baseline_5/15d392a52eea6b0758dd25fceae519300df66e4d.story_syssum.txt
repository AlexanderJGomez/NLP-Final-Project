"The Daily Mail has printed a completely fabricated story about my fiancee's mother opposing our marriage for religious reasons," Clooney wrote in USA Today.
None of that is true, Clooney said.
We have family members all over the world, and the idea that someone would inflame any part of that world for the sole reason of selling papers should be criminal."
"We accept Mr. Clooney's assurance that the story is inaccurate and we apologise to him, Miss Amal Alamuddin and her mother, Baria, for any distress caused," the Mail said in a statement.
