Herbert, who followed up his best-selling debut with another hit, "The Fog," and another 21 books over the decades, was seen as a British rival to U.S. horror supremo Stephen King.
"It's a true testament to his writing and his enduring creativity that his books continued to be huge bestsellers right up until his death," said Trevathan.
"Sad news about James Herbert -- as a teen, I scared myself silly reading him.

He lived in Sussex, in southern England, with his wife of more than 40 years, Eileen, with whom he had three daughters.
