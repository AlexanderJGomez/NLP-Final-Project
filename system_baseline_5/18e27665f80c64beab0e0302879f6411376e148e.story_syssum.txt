One woman in her 50s, who works at a hospice, said she cannot go weeks without an income.
The judge in the case, Belvin Perry, previously ruled that the jury would be sequestered throughout the trial.
That the case is so high-profile makes it difficult to find a jury without prejudices.
A male juror said Tuesday he is one of four nurses on a 24-hour rotation for treating heart attack patients.
A man in his 30s said he runs a family-owned Ace Hardware store.
Cheney Mason, Anthony's lead defense attorney, said if the man can go to Panama, he has someone to take care of the store.
Anthony was transported to Clearwater, Florida, and booked into the Pinellas County Jail for jury selection.
Belvin dismissed a panel of candidates on Tuesday, saying they were contaminated by a prospective juror overheard discussing the case.
By sheer coincidence, the juror is a witness in the Anthony case and was serving in Pinellas County.
