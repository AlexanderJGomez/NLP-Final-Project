They were down, then they equalized, then they led.
Now, the U.S. team will have to find steelier resolve for its next contest, against soccer powerhouse Germany on Thursday.
"What's for dinner?
In 20 games, the U.S. has never recovered when the opposing team scored the first goal.
After all, Portugal is ranked No.

That confrontation is an intriguing one for U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann, who played for the German team that won the World Cup in 1990.
The key question for American fans is what their team has to do to get through to the next round.
If Portugal and Ghana tie, the United States would stay in second place on four points.
Portugal would need a big victory or an especially heavy U.S. defeat to tip the goal difference to their advantage.
So if Ghana wins by more than one goal, and the United States loses by one or more goals, Ghana would snatch second place.
"We have to make it against Germany."
