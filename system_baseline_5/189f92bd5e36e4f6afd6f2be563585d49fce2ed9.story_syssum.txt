The evolution of that question factors deeply in the plans of game hardware manufacturers and software development companies heading into this week's Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles.
I spoke with five prominent gaming companies -- Sony, Microsoft, Electronic Arts, Bethesda and 2K Games -- who will be pulling back the curtain at E3 on their latest and greatest titles, features and plans.
"We treat our games as a service," he said.
If Sony and Electronic Arts want to capture gaming on the move, other companies want to appeal to gamers who want to stay inside.
Microsoft is expected to show off enhancements to its Kinect motion controller, which the company hopes will transform the Xbox from a gaming device into an entertainment center for the entire family.
"People like to play good games," Hines said.
Christoph Hartmann, president of 2K, believes their E3 lineup of games will appeal to the type of gamer who wants to spend a lot of time playing.
So whether you want to spend hours gaming on a TV screen or just minutes on a smartphone, E3 is poised to show you new experiences.
