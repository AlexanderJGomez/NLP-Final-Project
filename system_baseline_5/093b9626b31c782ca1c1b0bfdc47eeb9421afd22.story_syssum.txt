Washington (CNN) -- Herman Cain on Tuesday vehemently denied all sexual harassment allegations against him and said he had no memory of the first accuser to publicly describe claimed misconduct by the Republican presidential hopeful.
Ain't going to happen," Cain said.
The restaurant association said at the time that it investigated the accusations and Cain denied them, Bennett noted.
At the news conference, Cain said the only complaint he could recall regarding Kraushaar involved a comment he made that she was about the same height as his wife, as he held his hand up to his chin.
"There is safety in numbers," she said.
Meanwhile, a longtime friend of one of Cain's unidentified accusers said Tuesday that Cain mentioned a possible job promotion at the same time he made the accuser uncomfortable with sexual innuendo and overtures.
I think you need to tell on him,' " Bialek said on CNN's "American Morning."
Bialek said Cain told her, "You want a job, right?"
She didn't file a complaint at the time because she no longer worked for the association, said Bialek, who also denied wanting any money for going public, despite a bankruptcy stemming from costs related to her late mother's medical bills.
Bialek's bombshell came as Cain was in his second week of battling the sexual harassment allegations that have overwhelmed his front-running campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.
However, Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said Tuesday that Cain should quit the race if the allegations against him are true.
I am concerned."
In denying all the allegations, Cain said Tuesday that he still has the support of his wife of more than 40 years.
Several unaffiliated Republican operatives said Cain must say more about the allegations, because his current message is not putting the controversy to rest.
He said Cain can "approach this with humility and sincerity" and people will listen.
She told CNN Tuesday that Cain and the women should testify under oath.
