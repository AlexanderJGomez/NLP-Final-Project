(CNN) -- Calling his drug possession conviction a "wake-up call," U.S. Rep. Trey Radel says he is taking a leave of absence for an unspecified time and will enter an in-patient drug treatment program.
"I will be going into treatment, and I'm going to start with intensive, in-patient treatment," Radel said.
Radel said he hopes he can win back the trust of the many people he hurt, including his wife.
"Your honor, I apologize for what I've done," Radel told Judge Robert Tignor in court Wednesday.
Radel said he is aggressively pursuing that help, with the support of friends and loved ones.
Federal agents approached Radel after he left the vehicle, and Radel dropped the cocaine to the street, according to court documents.
Radel is married with a young son.
"Beyond that, this is between Rep. Radel, his family, and his constituents," Boehner's spokesman said.
