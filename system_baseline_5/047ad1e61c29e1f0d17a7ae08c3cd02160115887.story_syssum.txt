(CNN)Ferguson City Manager John Shaw resigned Tuesday in the wake of a scathing Justice Department report.
The city manager directs and supervises all city departments, including the Police Department.
The city manager reported the email to the City Council, congratulating police and court staff on their "great work," the report said.
But when Ferguson resident Sue Schmidt defended Wilson at Tuesday's City Council meeting, she heard vocal objections from those in the crowd.
