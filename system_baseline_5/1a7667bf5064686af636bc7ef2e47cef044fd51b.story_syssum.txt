I have learned to live with the loss of my son, Mohammad Salman Hamdani.
His name should be reflected that way at the 9/11 Memorial, properly listed among the other first responders who rushed bravely toward the flames.
In the months before 9/11, Salman had served as a cadet in the New York Police Department.
Salman was determined to keep trying to get into medical school.
When Zeshan and I left the house, at about 7:15, Salman was still sleeping.
Clearly, he did not make that decision and take that fatal detour as a lab analyst, but as the first responder he was trained to be.
Yet, at the 9/11 Memorial, his name is grouped among the miscellaneous victims, not among the first responders who sacrificed their lives, where it belongs.
Salman is not here to defend himself.
