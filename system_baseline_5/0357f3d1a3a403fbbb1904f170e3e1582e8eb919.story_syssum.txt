(CNN) -- Don Pardo, the announcer whose velvety baritone voice introduced "Saturday Night Live" hosts on NBC for decades, has died at age 96, the network announced.
Seth Myers, who spent years on "SNL" before recently beginning his own late-night talk program, wrote, "RIP Don Pardo.
While visiting NBC in New York in 1944 -- there to see some of his heroes at work -- Pardo was offered a job with the network, according to The New York Times.
The next year, he became the announcer for a game show that almost rivaled Pardo himself for longevity: "Jeopardy!"
But for most people under 50, Pardo will always be the voice of "SNL."
Pardo also appeared in the movie "Radio Days" and on an episode of "30 Rock," among other credits.
