(CNN) -- College costs too much, both for students and for society as a whole.
The underlying structure of American higher education needs dramatic reform before there will be any relief in sight.
Indeed, the typical successful university president views his or her key constituencies not to be the customer (students and their parents who pay tuition charges or the granters of research funds), but rather others -- the faculty, important alumni, key administrators, trustees and occasionally politicians.
Like health care, prices are rising rapidly for higher education because of the predominant role of third-party payments -- federal student loans and grants, state government support for institutions and students, private philanthropic gifts and endowment income.
Customers are ignorant of college outcomes because we do not measure in any coherent and consistent manner what students actually learn, how well they do after graduation or whether they think better in a critical manner as a result of the college experience.
Even basic financial information on how colleges spend money is often not fully shared with trustees or key politicians who help fund or oversee college operations.
If information and incentives are provided, innovation will come.
According to my analysis of the data, more than 17 million college graduates were "underemployed" in 2008.
Like it or not, American higher education is in for big change in the next generation.
