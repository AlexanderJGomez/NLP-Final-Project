ET), Hannover police press officer Stefan Wittke said in a statement.
Enke captained Hannover 96, a team who currently lie tenth in Germany's Bundesliga top division,  and had been capped by his national side eight times after making his debut aged 29.
The German Football Federation (DFB) said Enke always said he wanted to play for the national team at the 2010 World Cup.
"The leadership of the German national team never had any doubt that he was important for the team both as a goalkeeper and as a human being," the DFB statement said.
Fellow players said they believed that Enke had been suffering depression.
"But he kept it under wraps."
