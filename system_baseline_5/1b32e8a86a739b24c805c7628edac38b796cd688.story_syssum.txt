Gulfport, Mississippi (CNN) -- Gulf Coast states have seen drops in tourism linked to the BP oil spill in the Gulf, though it has not caused any beaches to close, tourism officials told CNN Wednesday.
"And so we are devastated," she said.
Florida has $2.5 million in its coffers for use in advertising and is making plans to use the $25 million promised this week by BP, Torian said.
The oil is here.
The Louisiana Office of Tourism website assures visitors and potential visitors that there is no need to change travel plans, as the spill risk lies mostly east of the mouth of the Mississippi River and 75 percent of coastal fishing waters are west of there.
"I think we are getting word out with the tourism campaign," she said.
The tourism commission has spent $600,000 of its own money for an advertising campaign set to begin Monday "to let people know we are open," he said.
"The perception is that everybody has oil on the beach and we are all closed up," he said.
"The truth of the matter is it hasn't affected me yet," he said.
