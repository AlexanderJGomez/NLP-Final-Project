Keith vowed to create his solar attic fans entirely out of parts made in the United States.
Keith's company, SunRise Solar, steadily grew to the point that he couldn't keep up with the influx of orders.
Keith had achieved his own small part of the American dream: He became a self-made small-business owner.
"He said he was with the Obama transition team looking for small companies," Keith recalled.
Keith and his wife were asked to come and -- prodded by his wife -- he stood up and told the president about his solar business.

At these events, lawmakers talked about "how I created a solar product, how it's good for the environment, for business," he said.

While 95 percent of Keith's fans are American-made, he has yet to find a U.S. company that can make the small customized solar panels that make his fans run.
Over the years he begged environmental groups as well as the Commerce Department for help in finding an American company that could make the key solar component.
Keith said the U.S. Customs Department has accused him of using Chinese-made solar panels, in violation of a tough import policy adopted in May at the behest of major U.S. solar companies.
If that anti-dumping fine is levied, Keith said he will have to shutter his business.
"These guys are going to put me out of business," Keith said.
So he went back to the well one more time, pleading with Greg Nelson, deputy director of the White House Office of Public Engagement who Keith said had been his contact with the Obama administration.
