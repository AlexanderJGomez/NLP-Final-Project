Washington (CNN) -- The House Energy and Commerce Committee requested documents and information Monday from Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms of Iowa related to the recent salmonella outbreak and egg recalls, according to a news release from the office of the committee's chairman, Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California.
"We are devastated that our eggs have been implicated in making people sick," Hillandale farms said in a statement Sunday.
"Wright County Egg strives to operate our farms in the most responsible manner, and our management team has worked closely with FDA through their review of our farms.
The chairwoman of the House FDA and Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, Rep.Rosa DeLauro, D-Connecticut, sent a letter Monday to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Hamburg, asking questions about the recent egg recall.
She also inquired about the possibility of the tainted eggs being used by federal nutrition programs.
