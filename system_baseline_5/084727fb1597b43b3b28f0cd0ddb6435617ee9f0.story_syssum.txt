Washington (CNN) -- With just days to go until a self-imposed deadline, fixes to the problem-plagued Obamacare website are "definitely on track," Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said Tuesday.
In response, Obama said insurers can choose to continue offering canceled policies, even if they failed to meet new requirements under the health care reforms.
Now some states have reported stronger numbers, and Sebelius said Tuesday that more people were signing up daily.
According to a CNN count based on available figures, just over 200,000 people have signed up for new private health insurance under Obamacare -- either through the national system or networks set up in 14 states and the District of Columbia.
