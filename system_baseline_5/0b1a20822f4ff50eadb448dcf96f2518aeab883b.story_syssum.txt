Washington (CNN) -- Taj Magruder has never voted for Hillary Clinton.
Magruder is an unsalaried Clinton warrior.
"I am very, very passionate obviously about Hillary," Magruder said, if that wasn't already clear.
"She was so good last night," he tweeted after Clinton's sit-down on the Colbert Report.
And while he only has 780 followers, many of those include reporters following Clinton and representatives from the groups looking to help her if she runs again.
Some, like Still 4 Hill, have devoted years to blogging about her every move.
Still 4 Hill started her blog after Clinton ended her presidential campaign in 2008.
There is more to the online response, though: People like Magruder and Still 4 Hill have received a little notoriety for their persistence.
According to blogger, Clinton responded, "Still 4 Hill!
Both Magruder and Still 4 Hill are building a online record of their thoughts and feelings about Clinton and that record -- at some point -- could come back to haunt them.

But Clinton's previous run might not be her last.
If there is one, I would love it," Magruder said.
