The man who got kicked off a United Airlines flight because of a fight over seat reclining says he's sorry about his behavior.
Although the Federal Aviation Administration hasn't prohibited use of the device on commercial flights, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines (which also operates the U.S. Airways brand) and Southwest Airlines (which also operates the AirTran brand) all say they ban the $22 device, which prevents the seat in front of the user from reclining.
"She just took all the space, and I can't work now," Beach said he told the flight attendant.
Aviation blogger Johnny "Jet" DiScala says Beach should feel terrible.
As long as airlines ignore the problem and sell the same space to two people, these disputes will continue, Knee Defender creator Ira Goldman said.
People use the Knee Defender to protect their laptops, their knees and even their babies from being smacked by reclining seats, Goldman says.
