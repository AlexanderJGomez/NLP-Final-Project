But it happened in America.
It's no coincidence that Facebook, like Google, Apple, Twitter and Intel, started in the United States.
Here are some of things Facebook tells us about America -- not just what is right but what requires careful, urgent nurturing to preserve.
But America's "soft power" lives on.
Interpersonal relationships have been recast by social media.
Zuckerberg's ancestors, as well as those of Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, were Jewish immigrants.
Americans may be rolling out one great idea after another, but other countries are getting many of the jobs that come from its inventions.
America is one of the world's best places to do business since government does not interfere much with the private sector.
In the United States, people can make monumental fortunes when they have good ideas.
As a society, America should highlight the need to create and build, not just accumulate.
And congratulations to America for creating a place where people's ideas can become reality.
The secret is out.
