We see firsthand the severe damage oil can inflict, not only on our global economy but also on our environment.
The good news is we are already seeing a shift that will ultimately take us from a transportation system based on a volatile oil ecosystem to one based on a more sustainable model using electric cars that creates a market for clean energy.
We will see new countries emerge to lead the way, and we will see former powerhouses who fail to act, left behind in this new sustainable global economy.
Just two days before our Tokyo launch, Better Place signed a memorandum of understanding with Chery Automobile Co., China's largest independent auto producer and exporter.
In fact, recent research from HSBC predicts that China's share of the global EV market will grow from 2.7 percent this year to 35 percent by 2020.
We are talking about mass market with these cars -- as Better Place and Renault have committed to 100,000 electric cars for Israel and Denmark beginning in 2011.
As the benefits of a more sustainable transportation model are realized, we will very quickly see a dramatic change in the global economy, the health of the car industry and, most importantly, in the air we breathe.
