(CNN) -- Since the July 3 military coup, Egypt has been witness to the rise of a new military dictatorship led by Field Marshal Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.
By pouring billions of dollars into Egypt's economy, the Saudis and Emiratis believe that they can appropriate the Egyptian army and use it as a Trojan horse in order to eliminate and crush Islamists.
Surprisingly, or maybe not, the international community remains in limbo watching the manufacturing of a new dictatorship in Egypt while doing nothing to prevent the possibility of such a scenario.
The U.S. policymakers believe that Egypt's military is the only force capable of retaining stability and maintaining security.
El-Sisi, Egypt's most likely post-coup president, will not be able to bring stability or security to the country.
The past three years have shown the volatility of the Egyptian public mood which can shift dramatically overnight particularly if el-Sisi doesn't quickly and appropriately fix Egypt's ailing economic and societal problems.
Surely, el-Sisi's Gulf backers will likely continue their "lifeline" of support, at least for a while.
