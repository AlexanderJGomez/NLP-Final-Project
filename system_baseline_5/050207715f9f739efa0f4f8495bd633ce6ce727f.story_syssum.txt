Washington (CNN) -- In a dramatic slap at congressional authority, a divided Supreme Court has struck down a key part of a law that denies to legally married same-sex couples the same federal benefits provided to heterosexual spouses.
The case examined whether the federal government can deny tax, health and pension benefits to same-sex couples in states where they can legally marry.
So, Windsor sued the federal government.
Thirty-five states have laws banning same-sex marriage.
Under DOMA, Social Security, pension and bankruptcy benefits, along with family medical leave protections and other federal provisions, did not apply to gay and lesbian couples legally married in states that recognize such unions.
Windsor was in New York when the ruling came down.
"Because of today's Supreme Court ruling, the federal government can no longer discriminate against the marriages of gay and lesbian Americans.
Children born today will grow up in a world without DOMA, and those same children who happen to be gay will be free to love and get married as Thea and I did, but with the same federal benefits, protections and dignity as everyone else," Windsor said.
A bill known as the Respect for Marriage Act is working its way through Congress and would repeal DOMA.
The case is U.S. v. Windsor (12-307).
