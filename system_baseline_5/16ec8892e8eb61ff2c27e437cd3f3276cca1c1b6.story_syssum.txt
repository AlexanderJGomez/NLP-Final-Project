(CNN) -- Tens of thousands of anti-government protesters are expected to join a march on Pakistan's capital as the country celebrates its independence.
Qadri, who led protests against Pakistan's government last year that brought the capital to a standstill, has accused the Sharif government of corruption.
Representatives of opposition leader Khan told CNN that they planned to arrive in the capital at 6 p.m. local time (9 a.m.
On Wednesday, in a rare address to the country, Prime Minister Sharif refuted accusations of electoral rigging and stressed that Pakistan has moved forward over the past 14 months in terms of "currency value, foreign investment and economic growth."
But the air and ground offensive has displaced an estimated 500,000 people -- including 180,000 children according to the United Nations -- from their homes in North Waziristan.
