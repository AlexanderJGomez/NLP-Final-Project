(CNN) -- What do you get when you combine a hotel and a boat?
Now the oldest ferry boat in the country has a permanent home moored on the Hudson River -- and a psychedelic new interior.
The renovated 14-meter boat includes a double bedroom, dining room and two-person wooden bath.
History buffs can experience life as a World War II sailor -- without the combat -- aboard the historic USS Silversides submarine.
The 95-meter vessel, popular with school groups, features 72 bunk beds, giving youngsters the chance to step back in time and dream of life as a wartime sailor.
Perched on top of London's Queen Elizabeth Hall, this fantastical boat looks out over the city's River Thames, Big Ben and St. Paul's Cathedral.
