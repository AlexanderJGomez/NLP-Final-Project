A new lawsuit alleges Bernie Madoff financed a sex-and-drugs workplace with investors' money.
Attorneys Joseph Cochett and Nancy Fineman filed the complaint based on an investigation, including a four-hour interview with Madoff in prison in July, that they conducted for former investors.
Officials of KPMG and the Bank of New York did not immediately respond to calls from CNN Wednesday evening for comment on the lawsuit.
Madoff was fond of escorts and masseuses, and used money stolen from investors to pay them, according to the complaint.
The complaint includes details of Madoff's drastically different life now in prison.
Many of his fellow inmates are in prison for drug and sex crimes, according to the lawsuit.
"I forgot I was in prison, he was talking to us as if we were in a restaurant -- he has quite an ego, you could see why people would be drawn to him," Fineman said.
