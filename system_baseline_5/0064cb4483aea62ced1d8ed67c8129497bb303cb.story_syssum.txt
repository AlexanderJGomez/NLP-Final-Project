When it was announced last year that we would be getting a Green Day version of "Rock Band," fans of the band (myself included) were pretty excited.
Playing songs like "When I Come Around" and "Pulling Teeth" brings back memories of college days, and yes, I will admit I wish they had put "All By Myself" in the game, because it's the only hidden track that Green Day has ever included on an album.

In the Oakland venue the band is decked out in waistcoats, trousers and pin-striped shirts to match the vibe of the album.
Sore arms and scratchy voice aside, "Green Day: Rock Band" is a lot of fun.
Fans both new and old will enjoy playing along with their favorite songs.
