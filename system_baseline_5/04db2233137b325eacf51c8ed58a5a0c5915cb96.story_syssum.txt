A court in eastern China sentenced Bo Xilai -- the former rising star of the ruling Communist Party who fell from power amid a scandal involving murder, betrayal and financial skullduggery -- to life in prison Sunday.
During the hearings of the politically sensitive trial that took place over several days last month, Bo, 64, denied the charges and strongly challenged the prosecution's case against him, according to accounts published by the Jinan Intermediate People's Court.
"Meanwhile I will be waiting quietly in prison," Bo continued.
Bo's late father, Bo Yibo, was a revolutionary contemporary of Chairman Mao Zedong and late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
A source with close ties to the Bo family confirmed to CNN the authenticity of the letter, which has been circulating on the Internet.
The son of a revolutionary veteran, Bo rose to power as a city mayor, provincial governor, minister of commerce and member of the Politburo, the powerful policy-making body of the Communist Party.
Soon after news of the events began to emerge, Bo was removed from his party posts.
Wang and Gu both appeared as witnesses at Bo's trial last month.
