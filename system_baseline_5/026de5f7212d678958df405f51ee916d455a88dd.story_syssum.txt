So it's hard to imagine that a movie as slight and crude as "The Interview" could serve as a similar kind of historical watershed.
If the attacks of September 11 taught us to fear insurgent groups using improvised weapons against civilians -- al Qaeda, the Taliban, ISIS -- what we've learned from the "Interview" fiasco is that even nation states and "traditional" terror organizations can now find themselves to be nothing more than blindsided bystanders in strange battles between entities with hidden (or purposely misleading) agendas.
Sony was quick to assign blame to North Korea, based on the conclusions of federal investigators.
(It's also worth noting that Russia's Foreign Ministry this week held a press conference slamming "The Interview" as "aggressively scandalous," while also denouncing the U.S. accusations against North Korea as being without "direct evidence."
A group claiming to be members of the enigmatic hacker coalition Anonymous vowed vague reprisal against North Korea.
(However, unlike others who've criticized it, I don't think it is any worse than, say, "Pineapple Express.")
They continue by noting that this "revolution" was not one waged with ordinary weapons, but with the power of the media -- and with what can only be defined as trollery.
The end."
