The 60-minute initial mental examination of Gonzalez at the District of Columbia jail came as a surprise to the judge and to both the government and defense.
Bos told the judge: "There is no doubt in my mind that Mr. Gonzalez is competent to stand trial."
Collyer said that during the initial examination, the mental health screener found Gonzalez did understand some parts of the proceedings.
Collyer ordered the mental health screening to be done in 30 days and set a new hearing for December 3 at 10:30 a.m.
