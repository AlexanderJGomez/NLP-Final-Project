Instead, it also means the beginning of an arduous trek through busy and dangerous roads to get back home in time to complete their homework before sunset.
The reason we started this business is we looked at our community and we wanted to do work that matters," explains Kgatlhanye.
"One of the first obstacles these kids face is not being able to finish their homework," says Kgatlhanye, the first runner-up at the 2014 Anzhisha Prize, a pan-African award celebrating entrepreneurs aged 15-22 who've come up with innovative ways to solve problems in their communities.
After a six-month pilot phase earlier this year, the resourceful entrepreneurs are now distributing their 100% upcycled plastic bags to schools they've identified around their howetown of Rustenburg.
"We get [plastic] from landfill sites and collect it from schools that have come on board as "Purpose textile banks" and local schools run campaigns to get students to bring in plastic to be upcycled," Kgatlhanye explains.
Kgatlhanye says they are already hard at work as they prepare to take on an additional 12 employees to meet the growing demand for their bags, as well as introduce new products.
We've also started with product development -- having other things for sale like conscience bags made out of the same material that corporates can then buy for their conferences and summits.
