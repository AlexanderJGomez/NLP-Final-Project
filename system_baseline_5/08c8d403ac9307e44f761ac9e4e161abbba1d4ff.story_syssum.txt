Fashion's Night Out, which took place last night in New York and across the world, is not for the self-conscious.
The trademarked event started four years ago, when retail sales were anything but vibrant.
"We feel that Fashion's Night Out helped to jump-start that thinking then, and each year it serves as a reminder," she said.
Since 2009, Fashion's Night Out has expanded to 19 countries and more than 500 cities in the U.S.
Kriticos, who lives in New Jersey and is an aspiring accessories designer, met her best friend in New York City for the extravaganza.
"It's not only about the inspiration from all around and being in stores and seeing the new line and getting excited for Fashion Week, it's everyone coming together for a good cause," she said.
It galvanizes the community around a common love of shopping and fashion in unexpected and creative ways," said Portnoy.
Despite all the distractions, she's also smiling because Fashion's Night Out, at least for her boutique, achieved its original goal.
