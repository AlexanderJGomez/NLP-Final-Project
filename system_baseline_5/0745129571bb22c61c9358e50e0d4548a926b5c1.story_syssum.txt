(CNN) -- By the time police officers reached the swimmer floating off a New Zealand beach, it was already too late: a large shark was biting the lifeless body.
Following the death, police closed the beach and several others nearby.
There have been fewer than 20 shark attack deaths in more than 175 years in New Zealand, the agency said.
