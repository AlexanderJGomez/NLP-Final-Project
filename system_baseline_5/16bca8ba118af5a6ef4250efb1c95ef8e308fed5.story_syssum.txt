Istanbul (CNN) -- The Turkish prime minister huddled Wednesday with a special Syrian envoy in an effort to help stem the growing tide of refugees racing into Turkey from conflict-wracked Syria.
In its draft joint statement about Syria, the U.N. Human Rights Council noted that more than 1,000 people "peacefully protesting for democracy" have been killed.
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan met for nearly three hours with the envoy, who was expected to provide an assessment of the refugee situation and the wider political unrest in Syria, according to an official from Erdogan's office.
He planned to attend the meeting between Erdogan and the Syrian envoy after his visit to Hatay.
Of the refugees, 4,368 are children, and 73 Syrians are now being treated in Turkish hospitals, the emergency directorate said.
Many of the refugees have fled from a region that includes the northwestern town of Jisr al-Shugur, seized by the Syrian military over the weekend, a network of human rights activists said.
But Syrian refugees who have fled to Turkey said some Syrian soldiers rebelled after being ordered to fire on unarmed protesters and instead started fighting among themselves.
Tarif said he had received no report that the people of Jisr al-Shugur were returning to their homes.
In its joint draft joint statement on Syria, the Human Rights Council called on Syria to implement reforms and end censorship and restrictions on media.
