Warner Bros.' new baseball drama 42 topped the box office with $27.3 million — far ahead of recent baseball titles like Moneyball ($19.5 million debut) and Trouble with the Curve ($12.2 million).
According to Warner Bros., a surprisingly high 52 percent of the opening weekend crowd was female.
Like fellow "A+" films The Help and The Blind Side, which also deal with racial issues, 42 should earn a terrific multiplier and finish well above $100 million.
Part of the reason for Scary Movie 5's sub-par performance may have to do with the fact that it arrived in theaters a full seven years after Scary Movie 4, which earned $40.2 million in its opening weekend in 2006.
Scary Movie 5, which Weinstein/Dimension spent $20 million to produce, drew less interest than similar horror spoof A Haunted House, which scared up an $18.1 million opening in January — against a $1.5 million budget no less!
Joe: Retaliation dipped 48 percent to $10.8 million this weekend, bringing its total to $102.4 million after three weekends.
42 -- $27.3 million
Scary Movie 5 -- $15.2 million
Evil Dead -- $9.5 million
Oblivion's strongest markets included Russia ($8.6 million), the U.K. and Ireland ($7.9 million), and France ($3.9 million).
The film opens stateside next weekend.
