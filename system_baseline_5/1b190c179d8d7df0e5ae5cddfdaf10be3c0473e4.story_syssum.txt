These are just a few of the themes that have bubbled to the surface since New York Fashion Week ended Thursday and the roundups started pouring in.
Like most of us living outside the bubble, I relied on fashion magazines, blogs, phlogs, Tumblrs and tweets to stay abreast of the action.
Then there are the looks that are so bizarre they can't be replicated off the runways, perhaps with the exception of wet mullets.
Images from GQ's street style series and Citizen Couture's spotlight on fashion week could easily be mistaken for a fashion shoot, although it helps that everyone's so attractive.
Since it's fashion week, they dress for the occasion.
