Washington (CNN) -- Dennis Apel has been a longtime critic of U.S. military policy and for 17 years has protested around Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.
At issue is whether someone previously barred from a military base may be convicted under federal law for "peacefully protesting" on a public road easement along the enclosed high-security facility.
The federal government owns and operates the base, but the state and county have held a "use easement" for more than a half-century, and they maintain the roads.
Vandenberg's commanding officer in 2003 issued a "barment order" against Dennis Apel after he was arrested for trespassing and vandalism, including throwing blood on a base sign.
A federal appeals court eventually ruled in his favor, saying the special protest zone was not an area under the military's "exclusive right of possession."
"When an easement goes towards a public road, that easement includes the right to use the public road for speech activities," he said.
It's their base.

One of the arguments that the government makes is, look, what the military wants to do here is something very sensible.
And that's for the convenience of military personnel and for other people who live around the base.
The case is U.S. v. Apel (12-1038).
