So when I learned CNN's Talk Asia had booked the Beach Boys for an interview in Hong Kong, I jumped at the chance to interview Al Jardine, Mike Love and Brian Wilson.
Although their new song is about a technology the band is nostalgic about, the Beach Boys are not stuck in the past.
And they're still capturing the sweet, adolescent purity of "Surfer Girl."
"The night we cut the vocals was one of the highlights of my life," says Wilson.
Perfectionist' (pointing at Wilson) here.
Like a roller coaster, "Good Vibrations" twists and turns like a joyride of sound.
Half a century on, the Beach Boys are still creating new music that captures the emotional thrills of youth.
And then it hits me, I'm being serenaded by The Beach Boys.
And why not?
