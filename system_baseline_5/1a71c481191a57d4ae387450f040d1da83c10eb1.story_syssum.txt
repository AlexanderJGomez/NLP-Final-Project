Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- Toyota's president apologized profusely Tuesday as he announced the global recall of more than 400,000 of the automaker's 2010 hybrid models, including the popular Prius, for problems in their anti-lock braking systems.
The worldwide recall involves 437,000 vehicles, including the Toyota Prius and Sai, along with the Lexus HS250h.
The announcement was made by Toyota President Akio Toyoda and Shinichi Sasaki, vice president of quality control, at the Toyota offices in Tokyo.
Jim Lentz, president of Toyota Motor Sales in the United States, during an online video interview Monday evening, declined to say when -- or if -- Toyota would recall the car.
Separately, the total number of vehicles Toyota Motor Corp. has had to recall for gas-pedal related issues now comes to 8.1 million.
Toyota officials estimate the total cost of the global recall could be as much as $2 billion, including the loss of 100,000 vehicle sales in the United States and Europe.
