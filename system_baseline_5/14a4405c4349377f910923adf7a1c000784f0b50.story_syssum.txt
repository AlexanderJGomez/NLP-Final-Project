A suspected U.S. drone strike killed 20 people in North Waziristan, a region along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, a Pakistani intelligence official told CNN Friday.
In the incident, which occurred shortly after 10 p.m., two missiles struck the compound in the residential area followed by another four missiles that were fired 10 minutes later, the officer said.
Pakistani government officials have been angered by suspected U.S. drone airstrikes in the country that have left many dead.
The U.S. military routinely offers no comment on reported drone strikes.
