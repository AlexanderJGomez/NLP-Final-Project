A new survey reveals that one in seven Americans -- more than 46 million people -- relies on charitable programs and services to get the nutrition they need to remain healthy.
While the number of households receiving nutrition assistance from the federal government's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (previously known as food stamps) increased by approximately 50% between 2009 and 2013, the report found that this was matched by radically increased need for outside charitable resources.
Of the households included in the Hunger In America survey, 66% reported having to choose between paying for food and paying for medicine or medical care, 79% of households purchased the cheapest food available, even if they knew it wasn't the healthiest option.
While SNAP provides some relief for the lowest-income families and vulnerable populations such as seniors, children and pregnant and post-partum women, the nation's 7% unemployment rate between late 2008 and late 2013 added significantly to the number of food insecure households.
Feeding America also provides its local networks with $30 million worth of grants annually, and assists with individual food banks' efforts to secure donations from local businesses.
Still, hungry Americans are left with hard choices about how to keep their families healthy.
Another emphasized the importance of advance planning, writing, "I'm homeless and I am still able to buy food and sometimes even meat!
In Aiken's eyes, the struggle for healthy food is one that all Americans must first acknowledge, and then help shoulder.
"The Hunger in America 2014 findings demonstrate the urgent need for all of us to address hunger in our communities," said Aiken.
