The first thing you notice about the Travis County Correctional Complex is the door.
"Let's practice the G chord again and strum four times," instructed Jean Synodinos, an Austin-based singer-songwriter who teaches the weekly music class at the county jail in Texas.
Jail Guitar Doors is the name of an organization started by musician Billy Bragg in the United Kingdom.
But the class at the Travis County jail reminds us that music is more than just entertainment.
Almost all of the women at the Travis County jail have been behind bars before.
One of the women in the class is on trial for shoplifting $15 in merchandise from a department store.
"This class isn't just about music," says Raul Garcia, a program coordinator on staff at the jail.
"Oh, we had this awful meat patty thing that's brown on the outside and pink on the inside," one woman says.
"Music is like an escape," one of the women says during the discussion.
And for eight women in the Travis County Correctional Complex, music is a way to respond to the noise of their lives and find a way to escape, at least metaphorically for now, that impenetrable door.
