The 34 miners in the Lonmin mine in Marikana, South Africa, died after police opened fire on a gathering of thousands of machete-armed workers striking for higher wages.
The violence exploded when police shot at striking rock drillers in the "Easterns" area of the Marikana mine.
Rivalry between the AMCU and the NUM is widely blamed for feeding the violence.
The stand-off later escalated into violence, leaving 34 dead, 78 injured and 259 arrested on various charges, according to South Africa National Police Commissioner Riah Phiyega.
The outcome set a "problematic precedent for platinum companies in South Africa," Africa analyst Mark Rosenberg said.
The video appeared to show the police response was "very forceful," Turner said.
Late last month, a regional prosecutor charged 270 of the platinum miners with the murder of their colleagues, who are believed to have been shot by police.
Mphahlele said police initially shot at the protesters from behind, although when asked if they shot first he said: "I was not there," adding: "The killing of those people was not necessary."
Re-election is "significantly less likely" Rosenberg said.
The company said last week that a "peace accord" had been signed, but key unions had not agreed to the deal.
It was unrelated to the mine incident.
