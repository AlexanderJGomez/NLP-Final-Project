Washington (CNN) -- The justices on the Supreme Court know very well their rulings can send immediate political shock waves, and those just intensify in a presidential election year.
An expected June ruling in an election year will put the court front and center for voters come November.
The court under Chief Justice John Marshall clarified the Commerce Clause, concluding state law conflicted with overriding congressional power to regulate interstate commerce.
The new president in fact had asked the court to time its decision until after the election but before being sworn into office.
This ruling is widely viewed as the court's darkest moment, a sentiment expressed by most current members of the high court.
-- 1908 / Muller v. Oregon, allowing a state law limiting the working hours of women.
The 5-4 court said the death penalty was being applied unconstitutionally.
Stopping the tally meant Republican George W. Bush, who was then narrowly leading in the decisive state, would become president, defeating Vice President Al Gore.
Here are some presidential election years where the Supreme Court as an institution or the justices became a major campaign issue:
New President Thomas Jefferson had campaigned on remaking the federal courts as well, but it was Chief Justice John Marshall, taking office two months before Jefferson, who succeeded on that front.
-- 1896: The high court a year earlier had invalidated a nationwide federal income tax.
Democrats campaigned against court "usurpation" of congressional reform efforts, a divisive political issue that would carry in into the 1930s.
That would allow the president to immediately name new, presumably more sympathetic, members to the court.
Warren retired a year later, and Nixon eventually named four justices to the high court.
