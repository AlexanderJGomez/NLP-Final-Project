By 2008, when recession caused many small businesses to close shop, the Scotts left their day jobs to grow the business, Barn Light Electric Company.
"I always tell people I became an accidental business owner," founder and owner Bryan said.
I didn't know if it was going to last," he said.
They've been married for 29 years, Scott said, and building Barn Light made them stronger.
They're manufacturing vintage-inspired lighting styles and specialize in porcelain enamel finishes, a process the company says "has not been seen in America for over 50 years."
The company bought the patents of old lighting businesses, including Benjamin Electric Manufacturing Company, and allows employees and customers to suggest ideas for new styles.
Johnny Bragg, manufacturing general manager for Barn Light and Bryan Scott's uncle, calls Barn Light the best job he's ever had.
The company pays well, employees said, and has a sense of humor, too.
Locals may see a new building and go "Oh, its Barn Light, they're getting bigger again," Barn Light's communications coordinator Betty Lynne said.
"He's one of the few people I know that loves going to work every day and loves what he does."
