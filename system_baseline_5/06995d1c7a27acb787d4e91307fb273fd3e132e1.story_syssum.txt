Plate had already had the conversation about the drug with his daughter.
Bauer's tale set off warning bells for parents across the country: What is this drug?
While parents like Plate sympathized with the Bauers, others said it would never happen to their kid.
On the other side of the debate were parents who might allow their children to smoke real marijuana if that would keep them from experiencing Emily's fate.
Emily's stepfather, Tommy Bryant, welcomed the conversation because he wants to raise awareness of the drug, even if some of the comments weren't so kind.
While Bryant knows there will be critics and people out there questioning his parenting, he said he's just thankful to have more time with his daughter.
Why or why not?
