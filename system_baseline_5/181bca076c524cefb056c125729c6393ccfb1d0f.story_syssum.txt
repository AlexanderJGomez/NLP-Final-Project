The coal ash poured out of a broken pipe into the Dan River, turning water into dark muck.
"We're committed to the Dan River and the communities that it serves," Charlie Gates, the company's senior vice president of power generation operations, said in a statement Saturday.
Tests of the river last week revealed levels of copper, aluminum, iron and arsenic above state standards for surface water, state environmental officials said.
"It's certainly cause for concern for the long-term impacts of this coal ash spill on the health of the Dan River," he said.
State environmental officials said Sunday that arsenic levels appeared to be decreasing, but recommended avoiding prolonged direct contact with the river in the area of the spill until further notice.
Tiffany Haworth, executive director of the Dan River Basin Association, first learned about the spill from a mail carrier, who warned that the river's water had turned black.
"I stood on the bank a day or two after the spill, and I can say that I openly cried," she said.
In North Carolina, authorities will investigate the coal ash spill to determine what violations occurred, Kritzer said.
State and federal agencies are working with Duke Energy to figure out the next steps for cleanup, he said.
Parrish said Sunday that the utility is in the midst of plans to close the sites where it stores coal ash in North Carolina.
"Ash basin closure planning is already well under way for the ash basins located in North Carolina, including the one at Dan River," Parrish said.
In statements announcing the North Carolina spill last week, Duke Energy said up to 82,000 tons of ash had been released and up to 27 million gallons of basin water had flooded into the river.
That amount of ash, the company said, would fill up to 32 Olympic-size swimming pools.
