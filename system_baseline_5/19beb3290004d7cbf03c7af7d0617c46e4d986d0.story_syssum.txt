Sherri Goforth, an administrative assistant to state Sen. Diane Black, R-Gallatin, has admitted she sent the e-mail May 28 with the title "Historical Keepsake Photo."
"I want to be sure that everyone understands that the communication was sent without my knowledge," Black said Tuesday afternoon.
"Ms. Goforth did get a verbal reprimand as well as a very strongly worded reprimand, written, that was put in her file that if this should ever occur again, that she would be terminated," Black said.
"This is an employee who has had a stellar record," Black said.
"This e-mail is reprehensible, insults the office of the president, and is embarrassing to all Tennesseans regardless of political party," Forrester said.
Grantham said Goforth told him she felt "very bad about accidentally sending it to the wrong list" of people.
State Rep. Johnny Shaw, D-Bolivar, a member of the black and Democratic caucuses, said Goforth should be dismissed.
He said Goforth and Black, as well as Republican Lt. Gov.
Several other black Democratic lawmakers agreed Goforth should quit.
