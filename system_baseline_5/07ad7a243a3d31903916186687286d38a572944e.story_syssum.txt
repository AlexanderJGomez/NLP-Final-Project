Wayne Rooney opened the scoring from the penalty spot after 40 minutes and then added a second two minutes after the break.
The win matched United's biggest victory of the season and saw the them register more shots on target than in any other league game under Moyes.
While delighted with the result, which was United's first win since early April, Giggs also said he was equally pleased with his team's performance.
Giggs then brought on Juan Mata who had dropped to the bench after last week's defeat at Everton and the Spanish international made it 3-0 just after the hour, knocking in a Phil Jones cross.
Rooney and Javier Hernandez came close in the final ten minutes for United while a deflected shot from Norwich's Leroy Fer rebounded off the bar but the game would finish without any further scoring.
Own goals from Everton defenders Antolin Alcatraz and Seamus Coleman were enough to seal a 2-0 victory for the Saints.
