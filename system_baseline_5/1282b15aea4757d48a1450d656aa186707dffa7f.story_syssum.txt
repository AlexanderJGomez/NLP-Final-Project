We will be vigilant and we will be relentless," the President said in televised remarks.
ISIS is believed to be holding a number of Americans, including Sotloff, a U.S. official told CNN.
As the President spoke, the Pentagon confirmed the United States carried out 14 airstrikes against mobile ISIS targets in the vicinity of the Mosul Dam, which Kurdish forces recaptured from the terror group with the support of American airpower.
Obama ordered targeted airstrikes in Iraq this month to protect U.S. personnel and facilities, as well as minorities being brutalized by ISIS.
The first Boeing 747 to land carried 100 tons of aid, he said.
Now that the dam is cleared of ISIS militants, Iraqi forces are moving to grow their area of control, the Defense Department said.
If approved, the troops would number less than 300, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
