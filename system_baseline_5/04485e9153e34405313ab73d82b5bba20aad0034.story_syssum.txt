But Gen. Rookmangud Katawal has refused to accept his dismissal, and Nepalese President Ram Baran Yadav -- the constitutional commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces -- has told Katawal to remain in office, a presidential spokesman said.
"Without consensus, the ongoing peace process will not reach its logical conclusion and the drafting of the new constitution will not be possible," said Ishwor Pokharel, general secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist).
Pokharel said his party urged the Maoists not to fire Katawal without a consensus in the country's parliament.
The Maoists could continue to hold power with the support of smaller parties, but Pokharel said his party is working to form a new ruling coalition.
