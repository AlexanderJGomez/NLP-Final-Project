Siemionow said the patient never saw a photo of the donor and said, "the donor never looks like the recipient.
"This patient exhausted all conventional means of reconstruction and is the right patient," she said.
Dr. Eric Kodish, the professor and chairman of the Cleveland Clinic's Department of Bioethics, said doctors thought she would adhere to medications after the surgery.

The current face transplant patient understood the risk of rejection and of immunosuppressants, doctors said.
"With something like a liver or kidney transplant, it's a life or death transplant," Clark said.
Doctors at the Cleveland Clinic said that because the patient has limited vision after the surgery, she has yet to see herself.
Siemionow said the patient will need re-educate her facial motion and need three to six months of nerve regeneration.
