Since last year, Clinton has been meeting with a broad array of Democratic operatives and possible campaign staffers ahead of a possible 2016 run.
"If she runs, as I hope she will, I will do whatever she asks me to do," Podesta, who previously worked as chief of staff to former President Bill Clinton, said on the Charlie Rose Show in November.
In the memo, Miller argues that Podesta's inclusion on team Clinton is the biggest sign of her joining with Obama.
"Beyond Clinton's issues agenda, her campaign's political leadership is shaping up to be staffed not by her own former campaign advisers, but rely heavily on President Obama's 2012 campaign leadership," Miller writes.
"Put bluntly: the state of the Obama-Clinton 2016 Union is strong."
