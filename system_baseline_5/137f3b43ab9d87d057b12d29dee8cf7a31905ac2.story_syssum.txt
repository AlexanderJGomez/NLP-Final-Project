But prosecutors are fighting that, saying Hinckley has been deceptive about his activities while on visits to his mother in Williamsburg, Virginia.
"The hospital doesn't know what Mr. Hinckley is thinking and he wants it that way," the prosecutor said.
Hinckley's attorney, Barry Levine, said the issue is not whether Hinckley has sometimes been deceptive but whether he is dangerous.
Jones said he has interviewed Hinckley but has not treated him.
According to Jones, Hinckley's treatment team was informed by the Secret Service that Hinckley had not told the truth about his activities during several visits.
Currently, Hinckley is allowed to visit his mother 10 days a month.
The first step would allow Hinckley to have two visits of 17 days.
Prosecutors want to cross-examine Hinckley and his defense lawyers oppose that.
On March 30, 1981, Hinckley waited for President Reagan to leave a Washington Hotel after a speech.
There is a definite possibility I will be killed in my attempt to get Reagan."
