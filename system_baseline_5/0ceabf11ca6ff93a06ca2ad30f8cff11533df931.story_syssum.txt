The Florida Division of Law Enforcement will investigate Monday's arrest of Andrew Meyer, said University of Florida President J. Bernard Machen.
"The thing that I regret is that civil dialogue and civil discourse did not happen," Machen said.
Do you have this?
Clarissa Jessup, who contributed I-Report video of the incident to CNN, said Meyer gave her his camera and asked her to shoot video of him posing his questions to Kerry.
One of the police officers on the scene observed that Meyer was "yelling as loud as he could as to sensationalize his presence," according to the police report.
Meyer responded, "What did I do?
You were just trying to do your job," Meyer said, according to the police report.
But the arrest triggered a protest by a group of University of Florida students Tuesday.
Meyer was carrying a business card advertising "TheAndrewMeyer.com 'Speak My Mind,' " the police report said.
In a statement issued Tuesday, Kerry said he didn't know a Taser had been used on the student until after he left the event, and said he hoped no one was injured.
