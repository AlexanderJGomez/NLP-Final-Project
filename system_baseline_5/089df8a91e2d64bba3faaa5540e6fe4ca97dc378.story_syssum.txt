It's a phrase coined by South African marketing agency The Creative Counsel, describing individuals who live, breathe and promote a brand in specific zones of South Africa.
This is marketing turned upside down, but it works in Africa.
Gil Oved, co-founder and co-CEO of The Creative Council, says: "Multinational brands are coming from all over the world and they want in on Africa as is obvious, and agencies like ours are helping them engage a consumer in a new, inventive way, which is actually a very old traditional way.
Zonal champions will inform and educate members of the emerging middle class in South Africa on what to buy, and why they should buy it.
Vodacom is one of The Creative Counsel's clients; it too utilizes zonal champions to spread its marketing message to consumers who are hard to reach.
For the community, a big multinational such as Vodacom now has a face and a voice and can give one-on-one advice on a daily basis.
Apart from bridging the gap between the big multinational and the consumer this marketing strategy also provides employment opportunities for South Africans.
"It means that if you're a brand that needs to support me in the community, create employment opportunities, gives me real product information, I will support you and buy your product -- one hand washes the other.
