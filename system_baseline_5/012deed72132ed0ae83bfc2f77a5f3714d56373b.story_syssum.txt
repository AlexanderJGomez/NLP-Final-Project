The decision allowed Cilic to enter the final regular season tournament on the main tour in the French capital and he took full advantage.
Despite losing the first set, Cilic earned a second round match against in form World No.5 Juan Martin Del Potro of Argentina.
World No.1 Rafael Nadal, who is playing in Paris for the first time in four years, told gathered reporters that he was delighted to see Cilic return to action.
That's all.
"The last tournament of the year is important," he told the official ATP Tour website.
I hope this year I can change that situation.
