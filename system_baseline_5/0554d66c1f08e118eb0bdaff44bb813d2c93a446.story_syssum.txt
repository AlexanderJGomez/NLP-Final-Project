But, family members say, Nehemiah Griego is no monster.
The family disputed any media characterization that the teen was a loner and said he had many friends and was a wrestler in state tournaments.
What we do agree on is that those who wish to score political points should not use a confused, misguided, 15-year-old boy to make their case," the family statement said.
He said that the boy planned the shootings for at least a week.
He was arrested Saturday night, after deputies found the bodies of his mother, father, brother and two of his sisters in their home on the outskirts of Albuquerque.
When Griego told Zephania that their mother was dead, the younger boy did not believe him, the document stated.
After the slayings, Griego "spent the majority of the day with his girlfriend," Houston said.
He even sent his girlfriend a picture of his slain mother, Houston said.
His church, Calvary Albuquerque, is scheduled to hold a prayer vigil Wednesday at 7 p.m. for the Griego family.
