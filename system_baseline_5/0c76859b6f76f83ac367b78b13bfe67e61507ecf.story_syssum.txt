So the question is, what can 20-somethings learn from an old man like Bush?
It starts with what Bush said to a group of young people in one of the last speeches he gave as President: "What all of us seek in our life is meaning and adventure.
"Public service is a noble calling," something he's said so often that it's engraved on a bust at his Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University.
"If your primary motivation is to serve, then, in an imperfect world, you're likely to make the right rather than the wrong compromises.
Pierce Bush is G.H.W.
He wanted to go and defend America, he wanted to be a part of something bigger than himself."
The greatest thing that you can do in your life is to serve your country.
Bush's life is full of lessons for young people.
