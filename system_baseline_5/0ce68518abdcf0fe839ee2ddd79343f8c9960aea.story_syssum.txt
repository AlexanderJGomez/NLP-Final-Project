The mood at the show was somber, said Bob Templeton of Crossroads of the West Gun Shows.
Some critics have questioned whether the gun show was appropriate so soon after the shootings.
Bill Schaeffler of Tucson, among those at the show Saturday, said he knows gun control and high-capacity ammunition magazines will be hot topics.
"Being armed is the natural state of man," he said.
Federal law enforcement officials were on site to monitor buyers and sales activity, Templeton said.
