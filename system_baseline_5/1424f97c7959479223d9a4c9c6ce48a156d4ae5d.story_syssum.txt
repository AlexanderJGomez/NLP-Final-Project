(CNN) -- Citizens of the Ivory Coast headed to the polls Sunday for a repeatedly delayed presidential election -- the first in a decade for the top cocoa-producing west African nation.
"The United States is convinced that credible elections are key to resolving Cote d'Ivoire's decade-long crisis and are central to political reconciliation and creating conditions that will result in good governance and economic development," the U.S. Embassy in Abidjan said in a statement.
U.S. President Barack Obama said the nation's citizens are entitled to a fair election.
