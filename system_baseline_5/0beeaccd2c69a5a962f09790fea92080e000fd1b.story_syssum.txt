iReporter Clinton Wood, who lives outside Portland in Tualatin, Oregon, acknowledges that Seattle is prettier than Portland.
Absolutely not, Wood claims in his defense of Portland, and goes on to list why "Portland thumps Seattle."
"While I love Seattle, let's be clear, Portland is my city," writes Moon, who grew up in Portland.
"Brunch is one of our favorite food groups," he says.
Commenter Laura Minnick says Cameo Cafe has the best breakfast in town "hands down."
"If you visit Portland, Mount Tabor is a must-see," says Moon.
iReporter Crummett suggests a Duck tour for Seattle visitors.
Regular admission to the observation deck is $19, but the elevator ride and observation deck are complimentary for diners.
"The city is full of surprises and great shopping," says Crummett, and she recommends excursions to neighboring Bainbridge Island and Bremerton.
Seattle supporters, where are the rest of you?
