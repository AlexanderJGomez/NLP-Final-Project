Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigerian aviation authorities suspended Dana Air's operating license Tuesday as torrential rain hampered recovery efforts after a deadly weekend plane crash.
Seven U.S. citizens were aboard the flight, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Tuesday.
The pilot declared an emergency as the plane was on final approach to Murtala Muhammed International Airport, and witnesses said it appeared the plane was having engine trouble, said Oscar Wason, Dana Air's director of operations.
Also among the dead were six Chinese citizens who were on the plane, the Chinese Embassy in Nigeria said Monday.
It had undergone routine maintenance checkups after every 200 hours of flight, and it had been inspected three days before the crash, Wason said.
