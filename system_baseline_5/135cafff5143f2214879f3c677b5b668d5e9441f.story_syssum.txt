But unusually for influenza, Fukuda said, H1N1 continues at high levels over the summer months, and many of the serious illnesses and deaths are concentrated in people younger than 65.
Activity is picking up in East Asia, Fukuda said.
"East Asia is one of the parts of the world where seasonal influenza viruses have remained in reasonably high circulation," Fukuda said.
Disease activity has been difficult to predict, Fukuda said.
But Fukuda said that's a dangerous mind-set.
The WHO also has no evidence of widespread resistance to antiviral medication, Fukuda said.
Other useful protections against H1N1 are vaccines, which the WHO recommends against pandemic infections, Fukuda said.
