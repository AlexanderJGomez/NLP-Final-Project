One of the outcomes of the fighting will likely be "the end of the old Arab alliance system that has, even nominally, supported the Palestinians and their goal of establishing a Palestinian state," Younes says.
Now it's the extremists -- the Muslim Brotherhood, Hamas, Hezbollah, and their backers Iran, Qatar and Turkey -- against Israel and the more moderate Muslims including Jordan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia."
Hamas, which has controlled the Palestinian government in Gaza for years, is an extension of the Muslim Brotherhood.
"From the perspective of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, the UAE and some other Arab states, what the Israeli Prime Minister is doing is fighting this war against Hamas on their behalf so they can finish the last stronghold of the Muslim Brotherhood," Younes says.
Egyptian and Saudi-owned media are liberal in labeling the Muslim Brotherhood as 'terrorists' and describing Hamas as a 'terrorist organization.'
"In Egypt you have a regime that came to power by toppling a Muslim Brotherhood government," says Trager.
The new Egyptian government has been "cracking down aggressively since it removed the brotherhood from power," Trager says.
The monarchies of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan have called on Hamas to accept the cease-fire proposal as is.
Qatar also funds many Muslim Brotherhood figures in exile, including Hamas political leader Khaled Mashaal, who is believed to have orchestrated numerous Hamas terrorist attacks.
Turkey has "more of an ideological sympathy with the Brotherhood," he says.
Iran has long supported Hamas, supplying it with weapons.
"There's fault lines within the Palestinians between Hamas and the other part of the Palestinian Authority.
Fatah and Hamas have long fought each other, but earlier this year made another effort at a unity government.
He must now watch helplessly as protests in the West Bank undo whatever progress he had made towards a two-state solution."
