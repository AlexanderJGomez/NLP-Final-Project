Now Nike is being reminded again that pinning your company reputation on star names is a risky business.
Pistorius, known as the 'blade runner,' is the man Nike called a bullet and who is now charged with shooting his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.
A bullet in the chamber still represents a gun and a gun represents a weapon."
That way, if the star derails, the wider campaign can continue.
It is not the first time Nike has sponsored a scandal-hit star.
Marketing specialist Adam Handt said Nike should do something immediately such as suspending its relationship with Pistorius because of the severity of the accusations against him.
In this marketing world, Vorhaus said, with many athletes sponsored by and representing Nike, it is also easier to shake off the bad publicity when a star falls.
