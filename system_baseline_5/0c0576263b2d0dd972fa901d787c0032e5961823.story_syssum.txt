And an affluent Atlanta neighborhood up in arms over a possible new neighbor.
Amid rumors that pop star Justin Bieber was considering a move to Atlanta, the Regular Guys, a morning show on Atlanta radio station Rock 100.5, put together a fake neighborhood group and pulled the wool over the eyes of the world's news organizations.
It warned that "Justin Bieber's relocation to Atlanta can be nothing but bad for our children, as well as the community.
"That's a big win," Wachs said of the prank.
As the prank swirled, no one in Bieber's camp commented on the rumored move, which began with a TMZ report.
He was recently arrested in Toronto, accused of assaulting his limousine driver in December.
