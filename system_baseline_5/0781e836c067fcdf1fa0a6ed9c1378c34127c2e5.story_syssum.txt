Steve Harvey could not respond at the time because of a gag order in the case, said attorney Bobbie Edmonds.
In addition, the court documents said, Mary Harvey received $40,000 a month from Harvey until March 2009 and received $1.5 million from him in March 2009.
Harvey "is authorized to publish this order for the limited purpose of refuting the allegations of respondent Mary Lee Harvey," the documents said.
Edmonds said that hearing is on contempt of court allegations against Mary Harvey.
