Hong Kong (CNN) -- The international community is now waiting for confirmation from the United States and South Korea on whether a seismic disturbance in North Korea Tuesday is in fact the hermit regime's third underground nuclear test.
With Chinese technical assistance, North Korea begins working on the development of short-range ballistic missiles based on Soviet Scud technology, which is itself derived from Germany's V-2 rocket.
North Korea has long been suspected of developing its own nuclear weapons program.
North Korea pledges to freeze long-range missile tests.
A Bush administration official says North Korea has conducted an engine test of the Taepo-dong-1 missile.
North Korea withdraws from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, an agreement that was signed by most of the world's countries to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.
Responding to the test, the U.N. Security Council approves a resolution to impose sanctions against North Korea and require an end to nuclear and ballistic missile tests.
North Korea initiates what it calls a peaceful launch of a satellite, but the U.S. State Department declares it a "provocative act in violation" of a 2006 Security Council resolution prohibiting North Korea from conducting ballistic missile launches.
North Korea declares it will launch a long-range rocket in April to deploy a satellite into orbit.
Just two days after announcing that the launch window would be extended due to technical issues, a long-range rocket lifts off from a launch site on the west coast of North Korea.
North Korea appeared to have conducted its third underground nuclear bomb test February 12, as the U.S. Geological Survey reported a seismic disturbance centered near the site of the secretive regime's two previous nuclear tests.
The reclusive, Stalinist state announced last month that it planned a new nuclear test and more long-range rocket launches, all of which it said were part of a new phase of confrontation with the United States.
