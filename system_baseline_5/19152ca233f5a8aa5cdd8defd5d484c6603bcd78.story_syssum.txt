"That's my favorite part of the circus," Dutch photographer Wiesje Peels said.
It's what the majority of Peels' work focuses on, something she calls "in between worlds."
Starkly different from her father's small production, the circus boasted multiple tents and more than 100 performers.
The images capture a "glimpse of the hidden life of the performing artist."
He emanates an "unavoidable authenticity," Peels says.
"There's the home life and the artist life," Peels says.
"So do you."
