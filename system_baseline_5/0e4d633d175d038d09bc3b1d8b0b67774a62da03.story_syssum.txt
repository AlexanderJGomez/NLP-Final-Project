(WIRED) -- In an effort to streamline and simplify the maturity ratings of software in mobile app stores, CTIA, the international wireless industry association, yesterday proposed a ratings system that store owners could voluntarily adopt.
In its App Store, Apple provides an age rating ranging from 4+ to 17+, and lists the reasons for assigning its maturity rating.
CTIA announced it would be developing its app rating system in March.
Apps would receive their rating almost instantaneously, and if a developer disagreed with the assigned rating, it could appeal it.
