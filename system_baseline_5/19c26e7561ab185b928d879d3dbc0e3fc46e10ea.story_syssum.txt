NEW YORK (CNN) -- Russia invades Georgia and President Bush goes on vacation.
Sen. John McCain takes weekends off and limits his campaign events to one a day.

Some have suggested that might have played a role in McCain being admitted.
Unless he's reciting talking points or reading from notes or a TelePrompTer, John McCain is lost.
I fear to the depth of my being that John McCain is just like him.
