BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Samar Saed Abdullah's entire body trembles as she speaks about her impending execution.
We first met Samar in spring 2007, at al-Kadhimiya Women's Prison in Baghdad.
Samar was sentenced to death by hanging for being an accessory to murder in the killings of her uncle, aunt and cousin -- slayings that she says were carried out at their home by her husband-to-be, who remains on the loose.
Samar has now been moved a step closer to death: to Baghdad's maximum-security prison, where there are more than 500 prisoners waiting to be executed.
I wake up with it in my head," she said.
It all happened in just two months."
The Iraqi police picked Samar up the next day, after Saif dumped her in front of her house and disappeared.
"There was nothing that made me suspect that this was a guy who would do something like this," she said.
She says she was tortured by the police into confessing that she went to her uncle's house with the intent to steal.
But it did not.
Amnesty International issued a report Tuesday saying that at least 1,000 prisoners sit on Iraq's death row and that Iraq now has one of the highest execution rates in the world.

Local organizations like the Organization for Women's Freedom in Iraq have for years been fighting to get the death penalty abolished in Iraq, especially when it comes to flawed trials and women being put to death.
"As a human rights organization in Iraq, we find that we need some backup from abroad to put pressure on our government as a first step to stop the executions of these women, some of whom we know are innocent."
Me?
I will never love anyone again.
Samar feels betrayed, both by the man she once loved and by a judicial system that is about to send her to her death.
