It is September 2003, and I just found out my daughter is going to be born with Down Syndrome.
I do not want to deal with Velcro versus ties or orthopedic shoes; I want to pick out the latest trends and styles for her.
It doesn't.
I want her to be born healthy and be happy.
She rocked those shoes for a good couple of months.
Had she not been born with Down Syndrome I don't think I would be as good a person as I am now.
Jaylin is such a special child.
She will keep doing what she loves, in great shoes, just to make me happy.
