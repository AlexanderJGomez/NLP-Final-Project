Walter Kendall Myers, 72, and his wife, Gwendolyn Myers, 71, are charged with conspiracy to act as illegal agents of the Cuban government, wire fraud and providing classified information to Havana, according to court documents.
The two have the financial means to obtain false documents and flee to Cuba with their sailboat or through Mexico or Canada, he said.
The judge allowed the couple to meet briefly with their son after the court proceedings, but turned down the request to allow them to go home.
The State Department has not described what information the Myerses may have passed to their Cuban handlers, but said more information would come out after a full assessment.
