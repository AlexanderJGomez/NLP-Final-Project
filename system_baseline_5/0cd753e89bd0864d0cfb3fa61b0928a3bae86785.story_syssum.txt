(CNN) -- The bodies of two dolphins and the head of another have washed up along the Gulf Coast, raising red flags for federal investigators already looking into roughly half a dozen dolphin killings.
The remains of the latest three dolphins were found in Mississippi.
On Saturday, someone found the body of a 1-year-old male dolphin on the beach in Gulfport.
The first dolphin was found January 8 with a bullet wound on Deer Island, near Biloxi, Mississippi.
On November 6, a dolphin was found dead with numerous cuts near Ocean Springs, Mississippi.
We need public input and information," he said.
