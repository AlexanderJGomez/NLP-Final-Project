And with this, the story took a drastic and disturbing turn as an aggressive backlash took place.
Threats to rape and kill her were posted across the Internet as part of an assault that seemed intent on humiliating and silencing not only Roberts, but any woman who dares to speak up against inequality and expose the truth about how women are treated in our society.
In fact, weaponizing women's bodies -- whether by making rape threats or disseminating unwanted and compromising images of women's bodies -- are crimes, violations that are born of a deep-rooted hatred toward women and a drive to shame into submission any woman who dares to speak out.
These threats are not just happening to high profile women, but to women and girls everywhere.
It is a hate crime against women.
You don't have to look too far to see how women are dehumanized in popular culture.
It is time for the silencing of women stop.
