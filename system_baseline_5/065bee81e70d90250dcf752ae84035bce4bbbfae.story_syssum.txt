After prosecutors brought charges against Hernandez, the Patriots offered fans who had purchased Hernandez jerseys the chance to trade them in.
The exchange applied only to Hernandez jerseys purchased from the Patriots' ProShop and PatriotsProShop.com.
Authorities have said Hernandez and two other men picked up Lloyd from his Boston apartment on June 17.
Hernandez, 23, is being held without bail at the Dartmouth House of Corrections in a 7-by-10-foot jail cell.
