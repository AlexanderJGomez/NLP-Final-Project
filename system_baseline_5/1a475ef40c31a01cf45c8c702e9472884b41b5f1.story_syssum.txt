North Korea has arrested a U.S. citizen for committing an unspecified crime against the country, state media reported Friday, 10 days after U.S. officials said an American had been detained by the reclusive nation.
The U.S. official said Bae had made several trips to North Korea previously, and that he was not believed to have been mistreated in detention.
The Embassy of Sweden acts as our protecting power for issues involving U.S. citizens in North Korea," Nuland said then.
The United States and North Korea do not have diplomatic relations.
