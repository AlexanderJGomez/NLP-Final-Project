Boston (CNN)Jurors in the Boston Marathon bombings trial were shown a key piece of evidence Tuesday: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's writings on the inside of the boat he used as a hideout.
"I'm jealous of my brother who ha (bullet hole) ceived the reward of jannutul Firdaus (inshallah) before me," one of the writings said, referring to the word for paradise.
In his writings on the boat, Tsarnaev asked Allah to allow him to reach the highest levels of heaven.
Well at least that's how muhhammad (bullet hole) wanted it to be (for)ever," Tsarnaev wrote in the boat.
Prosecutors argued that these tweets indicate an attack on the Boston Marathon was on his mind a year before the bombings.
