(CNN) -- The leader of the Syrian opposition met Saturday with the foreign minister of Russia, a longtime ally of the government that rebels hope to topple.
Russia has criticized Western powers, including the United States, that have recognized the opposition as Syria's rightful leadership.
The opposition chief said the group was open to talks, but not in Russia.
The carnage continued Saturday, as at least 101 people were killed, the opposition said.
