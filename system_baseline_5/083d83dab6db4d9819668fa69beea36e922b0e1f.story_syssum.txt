(CNN) -- Jurors in Portland, Oregon, awarded a former Boy Scout $1.4 million after finding Tuesday that the organization was negligent in allowing a Scout leader who was a sex offender to have contact with him.
Clark produced documents that he said were part of an archive of previously secret Boy Scout files that chronicled decades of abuse of boys.
A Boy Scouts spokesman has acknowledged the organization does have confidential files, but said they are made confidential in order to protect people who are ineligible to be Scout leaders but who may not have done anything illegal.
"We are gravely disappointed with the verdict," it said.
The church has sponsored a number of Boy Scout troops, including the one to which the plaintiff belonged.
Steve English, a lawyer representing the church, said Tuesday's verdict has no impact on the church, since it settled the case out of court more than a year ago.
