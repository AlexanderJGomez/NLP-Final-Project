Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Nine people killed in a military action targeting militants in eastern Afghanistan apparently were members of an insurgent network, a U.S. military official told CNN on Tuesday.
Coalition forces said they killed their targets, he said, but a delegation sent by the governor to investigate reported the civilian casualties.
The U.S. military source said it was "a joint operation with Afghan and U.S.
"It is better to miss a target than to cause civilian casualties," he said.
