This is Selma the movement and "Selma" the movie.
They condensed years into minutes -- with great success.
The movie "Selma" has been years in the making.
When you see "Selma" for yourself -- and you must -- look for the miraculous transformation of America.
"Selma" is a cinematic tribute to the democratic vision that we can live together in freedom without violence.
Because of the miracle of Selma in 1965 and today as a film in 2015, we can bear witness and embrace the powerful belief that we shall overcome.
