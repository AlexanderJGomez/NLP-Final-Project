New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton said Tuesday he is disappointed in himself and feels regret over a scandal that has left him suspended for the entire 2012 season.
It also found that Payton lied about the bounty program.
More suspensions could be coming, the NFL said.
Asked whether anyone on another team was injured as a result of the bounty program, Payton said no.
Meanwhile, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said Monday he's focusing on punishments for players.
When shown the email during the course of the investigation, Coach Payton stated that it referred to a 'bounty' on Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers."
