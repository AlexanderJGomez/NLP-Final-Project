This 60-foot sailboat, the Plastiki, is being built from more than 12,000 recycled plastic bottles.
"The idea is to put no kind of pollution back into the atmosphere, or into our oceans for that matter, so everything on the boat will be composted.
De Rothschild's vessel, scheduled to set sail from San Francisco in April, is called the Plastiki.
Joining him on the Plastiki will be a permanent crew of three sailors and scientists plus a handful of other crew members who will rotate through the voyage.
"This actually is the same material that is made out of bottles," said de Rothschild of the PET fabric.
Only about 10 percent of the Plastiki will be made from new materials, de Rothschild said.
It's infinitely recyclable."
But to conservationists concerned about the amount of energy required to manufacture and distribute plastic bottles, its symbolic message is a welcome one.
This trip strikes me as kind of dangerous."
