FAIRBURN, Georgia (CNN) -- In a south Atlanta neighborhood lined with palatial homes and manicured lots, the Hicks family was living out its American dream.
"I've always been looking in this subdivision, but never thought we could afford a home here," Terese Hicks said.
It all seemed like a dream come true, until the couple learned the interest rate on their loan would readjust in just six months, making the loan a short three-year ARM.
Struggling to pay the new adjusted mortgage, Terese Hicks appealed to their mortgage company, Homecomings which is owned by GMAC, for help.
She continued to make regular payments for all of their mortgages in order to maintain their good credit.
At the time of the Hickses request for a loan modification, investors backing the loans required some proof of financial difficulty.
"We advise homebuyers not to talk to a realtor or lender before we can meet with them for a Mortgage Profile Meeting," said Griffin.
It's one of several national nonprofit organizations that offer mortgage assistance and home ownership counseling.
Griffin believes families like the Hicks could have qualified for a better, less risky loan and should have been better informed about the terms of their loan.
Griffin hopes other homebuyers can learn from the Hickses' situation and seek out an advocate early in the process of refinancing or modifying a loan -- before they are caught in a financial storm.
"People don't know where to go and who to talk to," says Griffin.
