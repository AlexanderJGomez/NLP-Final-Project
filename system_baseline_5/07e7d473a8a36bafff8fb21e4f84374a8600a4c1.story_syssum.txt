Prosecutors said they will appeal the decision, and bail for Valle was set at $100,000.
Defense attorney Julia Gatto said the decision backed up her assertion that Valle is "guilty of nothing more than very unconventional thoughts ... We don't put people in jail for their thoughts.
But prosecutors said he was "deadly serious."
The database, which Valle was trained to use and had access to as a police officer, helped him research potential victims, prosecutors said.
"He is anxious to get home to his family, the people who supported him through this whole ordeal," she said of her client on Tuesday.
