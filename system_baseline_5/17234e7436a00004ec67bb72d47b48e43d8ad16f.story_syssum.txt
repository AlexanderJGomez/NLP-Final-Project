Maybe we've gotten too soft.
Yes, our kids need to excel at algebra, but we want them to not only learn, but to also enjoy learning in a stimulating environment where they can thrive in their own uniqueness.

Chua claims that heaping shame and ridicule on her children drives them to success.
Western moms just don't get this.
Do we want our children to succeed academically?
But the Western moms I know, particularly working mothers, have neither the desire nor time to run such an extreme household.
And during the time we do have to spend at home with our kids, we'd rather not battle.
I think Western moms are a little envious of at least part of the Chinese mom method.
