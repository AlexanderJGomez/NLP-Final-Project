Paris (CNN)A man arrested after a knife attack on two soldiers on the streets of Nice in southern France was already known to intelligence services as having been radicalized, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said Wednesday.
The notification meant that when the suspect got on a plane to Turkey last month, an alert was raised, and Turkish authorities expelled him, Cazeneuve said.
The suspect shares the same last name as one of the three terrorists behind last month's deadly attacks in and around Paris.
The attacker injured another soldier trying to assist before he was stopped, with help from a passer-by, public transit officers and municipal police.
