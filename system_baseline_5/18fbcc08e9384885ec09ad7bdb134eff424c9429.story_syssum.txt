Cairo (CNN) -- When Azza Hilal Suleiman saw Egyptian military pummel the veiled woman, she stepped in to help and got kicked and clubbed by security forces, a beating that was captured in a video that went viral around the world and also showed live gunfire and the violent removal of a Muslim woman's clothing.
Suleiman is one of three people in the video interviewed by CNN, with one of them saying he was shot.
A CNN crew also witnessed the security force beatings and shootings and saw other women stripped of some of their clothing.
The woman has not been identified.
More than a thousand people gathered in Tahrir Square for a "Million Woman" march Tuesday.
Others came to Suleiman's aid, such as businessman Ehab Hanna, who was also beaten up and shot after he tried to help the woman with the veil.
I tried to walk but fell to the ground, so they started beating me and Azza relentlessly," he told CNN.
He said he and other injured people were on the ground for about 30 minutes because ambulances weren't allowed into the area.
He told CNN that he is filing a complaint against military leaders because they "dragged, stripped and beat" women and journalists.
One military official showed no sense of remorse.
Where is she?"
The Egyptian military said it isn't aware of Suleiman's case but will look into it.
