Biochar's high carbon content and porous nature can help soil retain water, nutrients, protect soil microbes.
Watch how biochar is made and why it's important Â»
"Soil acts as an enormous carbon pool, increasing this carbon pool could significantly contribute to the reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere," said Christoph Steiner, one of the leading research scientist studying biochar.
Worldwide use of biochar could cut CO2 levels by 8 parts per million within 50 years, according to NASA scientist James Hansen.
The process of making biochar can also lead to other valuable products.
But still more large-scale tests need to be conducted before biochar technology can be rolled out on a global scale.
Industries can now begin to look at farmers around the world and pay them for their agricultural wastes, said Day.
