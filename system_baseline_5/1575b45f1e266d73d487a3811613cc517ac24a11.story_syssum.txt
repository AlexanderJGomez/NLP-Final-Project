STANFORD, California (CNN) -- Students and professors at Stanford University are protesting Donald Rumsfeld's appointment to a campus think tank, saying the former defense secretary does not uphold the "ethical values" of the school.
"There are lots of temporary appointments made around the university," said Jeff Wachtel, special assistant to Stanford president John Hennessy.
Despite being housed in a tower on the center of campus, Hoover has only loose affiliation with the university.
His meeting was later moved to Schultz's nearby house.
"Let me stress that the petition objects to Rumsfeld's appointment as Distinguished Visiting Fellow, an appointment we find without merit," Lee said.
