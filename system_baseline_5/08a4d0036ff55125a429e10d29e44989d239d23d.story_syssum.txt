Istanbul, Turkey (CNN)The questions Turks asked on Tuesday were tinged with fear.
Dozens of cities across Turkey lost power for hours on Tuesday.
The mysterious collapse of much of the country's energy grid triggered a burst of wild conspiracy theories across social media.
Even Turkey's veteran deputy prime minister, Bulent Arinc, recently observed that opposition supporters now look at him "with hatred" rather than the grudging respect he enjoyed when his political party first swept to power in elections in 2002.
Two gunmen had somehow infiltrated the Palace of Justice, the monolithic court house in the center of Istanbul.
On Tuesday, in the midst of the hostage crisis at the court house, the Turkish government imposed a gag order banning broadcasters from reporting on the Palace of Justice siege.
Turkish officials say special forces raided the court house only after the militants began shooting.
Just hours after a devastating lapse of security at the Palace of Justice, police began detaining the demonstrators hurling abuse at their elected government.
Amid the burst of optimism and civil society activism in the early heady days of the Arab Spring in 2011, Turkey was often cited as a possible democratic model for countries in the Middle East.
