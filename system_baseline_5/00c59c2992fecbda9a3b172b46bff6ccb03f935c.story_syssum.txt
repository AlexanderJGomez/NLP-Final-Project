The Western Australian government caught 172 sharks, and killed 50 of the largest animals, as part of a culling program that has sparked anger among conservationists.
But none of the creatures captured were great white sharks, the species believed to be responsible for most of  the recent fatal attacks in Western Australia, which have left seven people dead in the past three years.
"Of the 172 sharks that were caught on the drum line, the majority were tiger sharks which haven't been involved in shark fatalities for decades in Western Australia," Sea Shepherd shark campaigner Natalie Banks told CNN.
Beach closures due to shark sightings were also down this year, according to government figures.
