For me, it was all about the masks.
But their masks also allowed me to imagine myself (or someone very like me) beneath the Lycra Spandex.
When the masks came off, however, the fantasy ended.
In the world of comics, they get passed around like the sniffles at a kindergarten.
But just swapping costumes doesn't quite do that — not in a permanent way, anyway.
The Asian-American Wasp got eaten by a supervillain.
Cartoonist Vishavjit Singh saw this firsthand when he decided to go out in public in a Captain America costume, modified to accommodate his Sikh turban and beard, testing Yang's premise that "anyone can be American."
The fact is, the only way to really make the superhero universe look like America (and by extension, the world) is to create fresh, new heroes who represent us in all our vibrant diversity, with origin stories that are authentic to their identities.
Back in the early 1940s, one of the few Asian-Americans working in comics was Chu F. Hing, who invented the Green Turtle — a character he reportedly conceived of as Chinese-American.
In defiance, Chu never drew his Turtle out of costume, and the character quickly fell into obscurity.
This means that for my kids and future generations, there might finally be a masked marvel they can legitimately call their own — one whose origins are deeply rooted in our nation's past, yet whose features reflect the ones they see when they look in the mirror.
