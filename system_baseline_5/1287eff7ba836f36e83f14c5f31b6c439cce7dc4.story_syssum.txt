That's when Shanley, who'd been flagged down by one of the guests, hustled door to door, waking guests up to ensure everyone left the building's 24 vacation villas as windows cracked and parts of the building separated.
But no one was injured, earning Shanley praises from managers of the resort in Clermont, near Orlando.
There weren't any noticeable changes between Monday and Tuesday, Doug Yovaish, an expert hired by the resort, told CNN around 5 p.m. Tuesday.
Two buildings evacuated as a precaution are expected to reopen by week's end, a resort executive said.
The resort is working with county and other officials to ensure foreign guests get new passports and will make sure no guest suffers a financial loss, said the resort president, Paul Caldwell.
An interior breezeway connecting parts of the building "actually started collapsing right after I got there on scene to get the guests out," he told reporters in a news conference Tuesday morning.
"He, his wife and an infant, he had to break the window so they could escape," said Ghamry, who said she escaped with her three children but lost the belongings she'd had in her room.
