Egyptian authorities arrested Greste, Mohamed Fadel Fahmy and Baher Mohamed of Al Jazeera English on December 29.
Adel Fahmy said the family was trying to stay strong.
He said the family was particularly worried about Mohamed Fadel Fahmy because even Greste, as a foreign citizen in detention, was not getting any protection.
Greste wrote in a letter released by Al Jazeera on Saturday that his detention was an attack on media freedoms.
Fahmy worked for CNN and The New York Times before joining Al Jazeera.
