Among the show's nominations were picks for best comedy series as well as best actress in a comedy for creator and writer Lena Dunham.
PBS' breakout hit "Downton Abbey," which was nominated in the miniseries category last year, joined the crew for best drama, as did Showtime's "Homeland."
The show's defenders, on the other hand, applaud Dunham for showing her characters in less-than-flattering lights and observe that "Girls" isn't the first series to take place in a perceived vacuum.
NBC's "Parks and Recreation" missed out on best comedy series as well, though star Amy Poehler got a nomination.
"Homeland," about a CIA agent combating terrorism and her own demons, received plenty of attention, picking up nine nominations, including nods for best drama series and stars Claire Danes and Damian Lewis.
(Her comedy series, "Hot in Cleveland," also got recognition, with two nominations.)
The nominations were announced by Kerry Washington, star of ABC's "Scandal," and late-night host Jimmy Kimmel.
The show will air on ABC from Los Angeles' Nokia Theatre.
