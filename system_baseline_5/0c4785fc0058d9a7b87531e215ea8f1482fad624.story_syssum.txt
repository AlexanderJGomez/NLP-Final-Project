If the music sounds familiar, you may have heard unauthorized, lesser-quality versions circulated by fans for decades -- or similar takes on the several anthology albums released over the years by the Beatles' label, Apple Corps.
Apple Corps did not comment to CNN on the motivation for the release, but the timing of the release and their naming it "The Beatles Bootleg Recordings 1963" suggests the connection.
The first several tracks came from their legendary 13-hour session with Martin on February 11, 1963.
The new release includes the seventh take of "Do You Want to Know a Secret," while the sixth one was released in 1963.
The two tracks of "From Me to You" offer a glimpse of the group's studio demeanor during another Abbey Road session on March 5, 1963.
They stop playing abruptly in the first take, with Martin asking why.
The new release includes the first and fifth of 13 takes from the March session.
"What are you doing?"
The bootleg project gives you take 21.
The tracks include the BBC hosts' introductions, which remind the listener of where the Beatles were in early 1963.
