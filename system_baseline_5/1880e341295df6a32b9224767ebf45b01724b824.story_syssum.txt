The large muscles up and down my leg and hip would get hard and tight, making sitting, standing or even sleeping painful.
She used a device called a Thera Cane, a deep-pressure massage device that's shaped like a large candy cane, to press down hard on my tight spots and help them release.
And it requires a second person to use.
Sit in a chair or on the edge of a bed, place the Wiffle Ball under your foot (starting in the arch) and slowly roll your foot back and forth over the ball for about two minutes.
Slowly rock yourself back and forth over the ball, moving it around the large muscles encasing the blade.
You should feel tension release down the hip and into the leg.
Roll over onto one side, prop yourself up on an elbow and place the ball just below your hip in the large part of your thigh.
To release, roll over on your stomach and put the ball right in the spot where your leg meets the hip and lay flat for about a minute, rolling slightly until you find your tightest spots.
