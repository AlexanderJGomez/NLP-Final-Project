(CNN) -- We had a process.
Americans have discovered that a tiny, radical minority can immobilize their entire country and hold it as still as a robbery victim staring at the barrel of a pointed gun.
Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and his acolytes of extremism have cracked the Republican Party into two dissimilar parts.
Political recalcitrance over the American debt ceiling threatened to toss international markets into chaos simply because a small cabal of conservatives did not like a new law to provide health care to millions of people who cannot otherwise afford premiums.
Cruz of Texas, who has become the de facto leader of the national GOP and appears to be shepherding his party into a burning building, won office by defeating his state's lieutenant governor in a July runoff.
The streak of anarchy that runs through the politics of Cruz and the tea party ought to frighten sober Americans.
We might die to preserve our nation's principles but most of us won't kill our country to win an argument.
Cruz thinks he can speak directly to the voters and rise without the help of the political infrastructure of his party.
Such an unconventional strategy may be his only hope, because there are few left in the GOP who will offer him any respect.
We cast the ballots and gave office to Cruz and his compatriots.
They like this game because now it only takes one person to storm the battlements that protect American democracy.
