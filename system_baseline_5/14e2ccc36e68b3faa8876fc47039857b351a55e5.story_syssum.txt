Malik said one of the youths distracted the driver of the car that carried Malala, while the other asked a bystander to identify her.
Police said last week that they had arrested six men in connection with the shooting, but were still searching for Khan, who was studying for a master's degree in chemistry.
Malik called her "the pride of Pakistan" and said "we would love her to come back."
He said that will require two cordons of police -- female officers to surround Malala, with male officers surrounding the female contingent.
He said she had asked for her school books so she can study for exams, which he said will be given to her when she returns.
