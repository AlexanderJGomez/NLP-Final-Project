Recently, the embattled comedian's attorneys filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit accusing the actor-comedian of sexually assaulting plaintiff Judith Huth in 1974 at the Playboy Mansion when she was 15.
A demurrer essentially says the complaint is so defective as written, that it should be dismissed His attorneys have also gone on the offensive, asking the court to impose sanctions against the attorneys who filed this lawsuit.
If they knew it was impossible to comply with the rules, then the attorneys knew when they filed the complaint that it was fatally defective.
Huth filed her complaint long after the time permitted by the statute of limitations.
Accordingly, some jurisdictions have special rules extending the time to file in cases of childhood sexual abuse.
Cosby's attorneys correctly point out that Huth failed to file the requisite certificates, which exposes the complaint itself to attack.
That's why a plaintiff is prohibited under the rules from identifying the defendant by name until the court gives permission.
She didn't.
Plaintiff already identified Cosby in the complaint prior to obtaining court permission.
But, under the rules of the Superior Court of California, this complaint should be dismissed.
