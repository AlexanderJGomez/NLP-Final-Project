Pedro Zapeta was "very, very happy" when he learned about a federal appeals court ruling that says he is entitled to recover some of the money, said attorney Robert Gershman, who handled the financial end of Zapeta's case.
Because Zapeta had not done so, he was detained, and his money was seized.
Gershman has said Zapeta, who does not speak English, was not trying to conceal the money but did not know the law.
"The government always acted as if the money was their own," Gershman said.
As Zapeta's case was publicized, U.S. residents donated money to him, and Gershman set up a trust.
