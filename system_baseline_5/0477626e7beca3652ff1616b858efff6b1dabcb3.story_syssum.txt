WASHINGTON (CNN) -- When Sonia Sotomayor won Senate confirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1998, all 29 "no" votes were cast by Republicans.
A senior White House official told CNN that Sotomayor was "nominated by George [H.W.]
Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will first consider Sotomayor's nomination, called her record exemplary for a candidate to succeed retiring Justice David Souter -- a liberal voice on the high court.
"I know that this is on tape," she then immediately said.
Having said that, the Court of Appeals is where ... the law is percolating."
"Certainly you will see controversy because it's in Republicans' interest to generate controversy," Toobin said.
"You want to be careful," Steele said.
Obama has said he wants Sotomayor confirmed before the Senate goes on its August break to ensure that Sotomayor, if confirmed, can be seated with the Supreme Court when it begins its new session in October.
Senate Republicans, however, want to allow time for an upcoming Supreme Court decision on an appellate ruling by Sotomayor in an affirmative action case involving New Haven, Connecticut, firefighters.
In the New Haven case, a three-judge appellate panel that included Sotomayor upheld a lower court ruling that supported the decision of New Haven officials to throw out results of promotional exams that they said left too few minorities qualified.
