"Patients are sandwiched between two groups who are being less than helpful: the FDA and Ranbaxy," said Lisa Gill, editor of prescription drugs at Consumer Reports.
"It makes my palms sweat just thinking about it."
Pharmacists at several CVS pharmacies said it was all right to keep taking already-filled prescriptions of Ranbaxy atorvastatin, but the company would exchange it for another brand at a customer's request.
Consumer Reports is advising consumers to take potentially contaminated medicine back to the pharmacy and request another brand, Gill said.
