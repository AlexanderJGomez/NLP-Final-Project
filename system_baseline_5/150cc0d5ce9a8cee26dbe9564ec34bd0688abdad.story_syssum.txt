That's what the British taxpayer has put toward the refurbishment of Apartment 1a, Kensington Palace, which recently became the official residence of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince George.
A royal spokesperson said: "Kensington Palace has a working kitchen provided by the Sovereign (public) Grant to support receptions and other public events which might be hosted there.
Well, we haven't been allowed in to see, but a Royal Household source describes "a very ordinary level of furnishing."
There's a major backlog of repairs throughout the estate -- 40% of it isn't up to standard, according to the Household source.
The Household source says there was massive demand for charter flights by heads of state to attend and that was the cost to charter at that time.
The Royal Household source notes: "The cost of security is a cost of terrorism rather than a cost of the monarchy."
