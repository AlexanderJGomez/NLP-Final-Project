But this Friday's contest will also mark the first time Iranians go to the polls since allegations of vote-rigging during presidential elections in 2009 triggered mass street demonstrations against the regime.
But at a campaign rally for candidates from the conservative Principalist Front on Wednesday, one lawmaker running for re-election offered a decidedly different account of the aftermath of the 2009 vote.

According to Iranian state media, there are more then 3,400 candidates competing now for some 290 seats in parliament.
Iranian analysts said the Principalist Front represents one of the leading groups of candidates.
At a speech before thousands of supporters on Wednesday, Ayatollah Khamenei accused the United States and its allies of trying to stop Iranians from voting on Friday.
Others pointed to the recent series of assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists, which the Iranian government has blamed on foreign agents.
