That's where they were slain, ambush-style -- Saturday afternoon as they sat in their patrol car, New York Police Commissioner William Bratton said at an evening news conference.
He opened fire several times, striking both officers in the head, Bratton said.
Both dreamed of being police officers, Bratton said.
"When a police officer is murdered, it tears at the foundation of our society," the mayor said.
Baltimore police received information that Brinsley had made threatening comments about police, and sent a warning to police in New York, Bratton said.
"It is an attack on all of us," he said.
Now, we have two families that (are) missing somebody for the holidays," Shaniqua Pervis told CNN affiliate WABC.
A grand jury's decision not to indict the police officer in the Garner case, as well as a separate grand jury's refusal to indict an officer in a controversial police shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, led to nationwide protests against the police.
Al Sharpton said the Garner family was outraged by news of the shootings.
"Any use of the names of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, in connection with any violence or killing of police, is reprehensible and against the pursuit of justice in both cases," the statement said.
