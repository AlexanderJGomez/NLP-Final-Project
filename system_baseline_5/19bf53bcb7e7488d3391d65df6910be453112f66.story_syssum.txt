Her new book of photographs and essays, "The Oldest Living Things in the World," came out on Earth Day, April 22.
That search was both an intellectual one -- pondering ideas about combining art with science and philosophical concepts like deep time -- as well as a literal one.
The ancient survivors I've photographed have weathered thousands of years in some of the harshest environments on Earth, but are now threatened by the climate crisis.
It is stunning, and I'd love everyone to be able to see through that window back into deep time.
My suggestion is to get involved with Al Gore's fantastic organization, the Climate Reality Project.
There is so much to see, know and do in the world, and I hope that we can all get out there -- in our own ways -- and do some good.
