Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Documents showing that China offered to sell arms to Moammar Gadhafi in the waning days of his rule are "the real deal," a senior member of Libya's transitional government said Monday.
And Mohamed Sayeh, a member of the NTC, said Libya's new leaders have seen the documents.
China says it followed U.N. Security Council resolutions that banned the export of arms to Gadhafi's government.
But Ibrahim said there was "ongoing resistance" in areas that Gadhafi has lost, and that Gadhafi "is inside of Libya fighting."
The documents NTC officials were examining Monday detailed a trip by Gadhafi's security officials to Beijing on July 16 during which they met with four state-controlled weapons manufacturers, the newspaper reported.
The Chinese said they would replace the Algerian arms sent to Libya, the document said.
Algeria said it acted on humanitarian grounds, but it angered the NTC.
"The NTC has said it is going to set up a government representative of all regions, and when it has done that, we'll recognize it," Medelci said.
The Ukrainian Embassy in Tripoli and the ministry are rendering proper consular assistance to those arrested, the ministry said.
