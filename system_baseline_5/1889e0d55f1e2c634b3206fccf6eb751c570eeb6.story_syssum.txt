"Due to concerns regarding our February 16 appearance at SeaWorld, we have chosen to cancel the performance," the rock band said on its Facebook page on Friday.
"We expect that other artists will be targeted in this campaign," SeaWorld spokesman Nick Gollattscheck told CNN in consecutive statements Wednesday and Thursday, starting with Cheap Trick's cancellation.
SeaWorld is working to book replacement acts, Gollattscheck said.
SeaWorld said it would like the musical artists to learn for themselves about SeaWorld.
SeaWorld says the documentary ignores the park's conservation efforts and research.
