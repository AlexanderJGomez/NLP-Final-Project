Homeland Security Adviser Fran Townsend turned in her letter of resignation to President Bush on November 6 and will be looking for new opportunities outside government.
"Fran has always provided wise counsel on how to best protect the American people from the threat of terrorism," Bush said in a statement.
She said not getting the job "had absolutely nothing to do with her decision to leave."
"It was a hard decision as I have loved and will cherish my every minute of service," she said in an e-mail.
