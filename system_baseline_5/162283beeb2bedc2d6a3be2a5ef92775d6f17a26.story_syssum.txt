Both of us are in the military and were deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.
I am proud of the military and the people who risk their lives -- in Britain and elsewhere around the world -- to do this and I am proud of my own military service.
I am also a transgender woman; I have known this all my conscious life, but my military didn't know until I told them after 18 years of service to the Air Force.
Had I not been able to continue my military service because I was transgender, I wouldn't have been in the right place at the right time to make that vital difference for my colleagues and my nation.
For those three months, I didn't feel like I had to walk on eggshells, and I didn't worry about being outed as transgender.
I was proud to serve my country in a mission-critical role.
Caroline Paige and Landon Wilson: After serving in Operation Enduring Freedom, we and others attended the first-ever gathering of currently serving transgender personnel from around the world to share our stories.
We do want to be sure, however, that people understand the main message emerging from our personal stories, and from the experiences of service members from other forces who participated in the conference: Transgender personnel serve just as effectively as everyone else, even in austere environments like Afghanistan.
