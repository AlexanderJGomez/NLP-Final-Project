Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Bangkok turned into a war zone Wednesday as Thai military forces cracked down on anti-government protesters, ending a tense standoff that has troubled the capital for weeks.
The chaotic day left at least five people dead as Bangkok residents endured an edgy and unsettled night.
The government considered the demonstrators to be terrorists, and army Col. Sansern Kaewkamnerd said that growing violence necessitated the use of force.
He said the government had regained full control and Red Shirt leaders had fled or were taken into police custody.
Sniper fire and explosions were heard after the leaders spoke of calling off the protests, said George McCleod, a witness and freelance journalist in the area.
At least five people, including an Italian journalist, were listed as killed by the Police Hospital in Bangkok.
The military operation was the government's last stand against protests that paralyzed parts of Bangkok for months, Thai officials said.
"Negotiations failed because core [opposition] leaders are not to be able to make decisions by themselves," the statement said, alluding to an outside force influencing the protesters.
"I never approve nor agree to any use of violence," he said.
The violence prompted the United Nations' top human rights official to implore anti-government protesters and government officials to resume talks.
