New Delhi (CNN) -- Here's the best way to understand the new India in 30 seconds.
The story struck me because it weaves together some important trends and forces in India as the nation undertakes the biggest elections in world history.
Many of these mobile users are buying cheap smartphones and data packages to access the Internet.
The second trend is the rise of rural India.
More than 100 million voters in India's elections are first-timers who turned 18 in the last five years.
Growing up in an India of fast growth and development, they have more confidence in their culture, identity and language.
Some suggest that these trends mean India's elections will be fought and decided on social media.
India's Internet and Mobile Association says a strong social media campaign could swing up to 4% of votes.
Facebook says it has 100 million users in India: it sounds like a lot but it accounts for less than a tenth of Indians.
Why?
Watch India's elections very closely.
Calling these elections too early could be embarrassing, too.
