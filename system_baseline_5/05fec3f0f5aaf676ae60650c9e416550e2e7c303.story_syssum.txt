In a 55-minute video released less than two weeks ago, the current leader of al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, promised to "raise the flag of Jihad" and to spread Islamic rule across the South Asia by operating in India, Bangladesh and Myanmar, under the new rubric "Qaeda al-Jihad."
As to why the Indian subcontinent has been declared as the new home for al Qaeda, Zawahiri cites the aim of rescuing Muslims from oppression and injustice in the region as the group's main driving force.
ISIS has also managed to do things al Qaeda never could.
More worryingly, from al Qaeda's perspective, is the fact ISIS seems to be attracting smaller splinter groups previously viewed as being in al Qaeda's domain of influence.
In all likelihood, al Qaeda's attempts to branch into India and Bangladesh will fail.
It is clear is that al Qaeda is panicking and witnessing the rise of ISIS with dread and jealousy.
