Barack Obama isn't just the president.

The frenetic pace of the presidency is largely a reflection of America's role as the premier global power in the post-World War II era, Dalleck told CNN.

Teddy Roosevelt would "just disappear as president for months at a time and people didn't know where he was," noted acclaimed Rice University historian Douglas Brinkley.
Ike "laid the foundation for the West Wing infrastructure of expertise that we see now working for Obama (constantly), and that infrastructure gives presidents the capacity" to adapt quickly on a broad range of issues.
Twenty-first century presidents, she said, must have that energy "in all senses of the word."
"That's the watchword."
