David Goldman has been locked in a legal battle over custody of his son, Sean Goldman, with the family of the boy's deceased mother.
However, "Sean must be heard in court," he said.
"Every day that my son is under that roof, he is being severely psychologically damaged," Goldman said.
"My son is suffering, and he's losing the innocence of ... a child," Goldman said.
Instead of traveling to Brasilia, where the high court is, Goldman planned to stay in Rio de Janeiro on Friday, where he is just miles from Sean.
Smith said Sean was previously put in front of a video camera as adults asked questions.
If the court does not do so, Smith said, he and Goldman hope Chief Justice Gilmar Mendes will.
The family has said Goldman can visit his son.
