This much we know: Flight 17 was shot down using a surface-to-air missile in Ukrainian territory that's controlled by pro-Russian rebels.
So have the rebels, who accuse the Ukrainians of downing the plane -- without offering proof.
If indeed the rebels are behind the attack, they may have mistaken Flight 17 for a Ukrainian military aircraft.
Those posts were later deleted once it turned out the plane was a civilian aircraft.
Last week, Eurocontrol, the agency responsible for coordinating European airspace, said Ukrainian authorities had closed airspace in the region below 32,000 feet (about 9,750 meters), but it was open at the level Flight 17 was flying (33,000 feet).
When will international investigators get access to the crash site?
But Russia, which has veto power as a permanent member of the council, wants a modified resolution -- one that leaves out Ukraine from any investigation.
If an investigation concludes the plane was shot down by rebels using a Russian-supplied missile -- or, worse still, by Russians themselves -- President Vladimir Putin will have two choices.
Or, Putin could sever ties with the rebels.
