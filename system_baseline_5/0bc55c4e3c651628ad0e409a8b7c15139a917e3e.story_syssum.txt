The divers stopped searching months ago because of the winter and water conditions, and the South Korean ferry remains on the bottom of the sea floor.
"We, the families of the missing victims, are still living the day --  April 16, 2014," said Park, who is in poor health, but refusing treatment.
Park's case is an unsettling one -- emblematic of what remains unresolved a year after the Sewol ferry sank.
As the ferry tilted sideways, water seeped in and objects in the ship toppled over, injuring people and blocking their way out.
The Sewol ferry is over 20 years old and there are fears it could fall apart during the extraction, according to the South Korean Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries.
Since the days immediately after the disaster, families have criticized the government over its response.
The captain of the first coast guard ship sent to rescue the Sewol passengers was found guilty of negligence and making false reports.
In the case of Sewol, the ferry was found to be loaded with double its capacity.
"The tragedy of Sewol was also virtually caused by accumulation of corruption, irregularity and going blind eyes," Park said on Thursday.
Whether the ferry will be raised and an independent investigation will be held remains to be seen.
