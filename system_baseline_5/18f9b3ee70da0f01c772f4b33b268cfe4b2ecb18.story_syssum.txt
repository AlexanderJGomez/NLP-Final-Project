The latest: The blog TechCrunch on Wednesday published a story claiming the next-generation iPhone will have a new connection port that's about a third the size of the one on the current model.
"Are standards just too easy for Apple to use?"
TechCrunch said its report is based on interviews with three independent manufacturers of Apple accessories that said the new iPhone will include a 19-pin dock instead of the current 30-pin model.
The connection type is proprietary, meaning cords and accessories that use the 30-pin dock only work with Apple devices.
If that's the case, he said, the switch could have all kinds of advantages, including saving consumers money (a 30-pin cord from Apple costs $19; Micro USB cords start at less than $1) and making it easier for Apple to comply with a European law that requires Micro USB ports on new mobile phones.
