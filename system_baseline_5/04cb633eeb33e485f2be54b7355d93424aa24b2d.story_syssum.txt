Schrenker also must pay the Coast Guard more than $34,000 in restitution and must pay Harley-Davidson Credit Corp., the plane's lien-holder, more than $871,000, the U.S. attorney's office said.
On January 11, Schrenker took off alone from Anderson, Indiana, in a Piper PA46 plane, saying he was headed for Destin, Florida.
Schrenker agreed to the facts, the documents said, and they were read aloud during his change of plea hearing in June.
The Coast Guard Investigative Service later recovered cut lines from tree branches and a parachute with a serial number that was traced to Schrenker, court documents said.
In a search of the plane, authorities found handwritten notes on the inside back cover of a campground book, saying among other things, "windshield is spider cracking," "doors open," "bleeding very bad" and "graying out," the documents said.
When questioned by federal officials, Schrenker claimed that his windshield struck him in the face and his door malfunctioned, the court documents said.
Indiana officials agreed to allow the federal case against Schrenker to proceed before seeking to extradite him, prosecutors have said.
