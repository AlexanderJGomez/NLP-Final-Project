The right engine was still attached to the plane when it was pulled from the Hudson last week.

Seconds later, an inflatable evacuation ramp extends from the opposite side of the plane.
Some passengers jump into the water, which was a chilly 41 degrees when the plane splashed down on the afternoon of January 15.
A person manning the camera from inside the plant saw the plane hit the water and redirected the camera, Olert said.
