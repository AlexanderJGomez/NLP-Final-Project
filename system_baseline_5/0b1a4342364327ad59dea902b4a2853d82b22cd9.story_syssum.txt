Happiness isn't just an emotional state.
In fact, science shows people who are happy live longer and healthier lives.
They have lower levels of happiness compared with optimists and are three times as likely to develop health problems as they age, researchers say.
But the overall level of happiness in Denmark has more to do with the generosity that's common among citizens, their freedom to make life choices and a strong social support system, according to the U.N. World Happiness Report.
The Danes seem to strike a great work-life balance, which ups their happiness level.
Researchers say when people focus on experiences, they feel a greater sense of vitality or "being alive" during the experience and afterward.
Research shows that a strong social support system can lengthen our telomeres.
People who volunteer are happier with their lives than those who don't, according to dozens of studies.
The United Nations even credits volunteerism as one of the reasons Denmark is the happiest nation in the world -- 43% of Danes regularly give back to their community, compared with 25% of Americans.
Research shows that laughing doesn't just signal happiness, it produces it.
Laughing is also good for your heart.
Laugh in your car, in the shower -- force yourself to start laughing a few minutes every day.
