(CNN) -- Shortly after 1:30 p.m. on February 24, 2010, a SeaWorld Orlando trainer lost her life in a tragic accident involving one of the park's killer whales.
The three years since Dawn's death have seen the emergence of individuals who have chosen not to honor her memory, but rather to use the events of February 24, 2010, to advance their own interests.
Not a single interview with a guest who was inspired and enriched by their experience with killer whales at SeaWorld.
In the three years since Dawn's death, we have again made significant changes at SeaWorld.
No, it does not.
Blackfish, like other works driven by the same agenda, ignores the extraordinary benefits to conservation, scientific research and education of America's zoo and aquariums.
That, not the inaccurate and shamefully misleading account in "Blackfish," is what SeaWorld really is.
