(CNN) -- Former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari has won the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize, the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced Friday.
The committee awards the peace prize annually according to guidelines laid down in the will of its founder, Alfred Nobel.
The committee plans to award the prize to Ahtisaari on December 10 at Oslo City Hall in Norway.
The others -- for physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, and literature -- were announced this week and will be awarded in Stockholm, Sweden later this year.
