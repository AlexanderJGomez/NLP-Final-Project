Like many public schools, his doesn't provide cups.
"Since children spend a large percent of their waking hours at school, they should be consuming at least one-half their total water intake at school," says Dr. Melina Jampolis, CNNHealth's Diet and Fitness Expert.
The legislation requires that clean water be easily available in school.
Vista Middle School outside Los Angeles has approximately 1,700 students and four water fountains in the student eating area.
Chicago Public Schools do not.
Hillsborough County school district in Tampa says it does not provide cups of water and there is usually one water fountain in student eating areas.
According to the California Food Policy Advocates, filling cups is "likely a slow process at most water fountains."
It's called a water intervention -- a five-week research program that includes a water filter and cups for five schools in the Los Angeles school district, provided free from the UCLA/RAND project.
The test includes these steps: Install a water filter in the school.
Free drinking water and cups could also decrease revenue from bottled water sales.
Researchers in Germany found that by installing a cooled, filtered water fountain with plain or optionally carbonated water, providing children with water bottles, educating them on the importance of drinking water and encouraging them to fill up their water bottles, they were able to reduce the risk of children becoming overweight by 31%.
David Binkle, deputy director of Los Angeles school district food services, would like the federal government to help pay for water instead of only mandating that water be made available.
"I wouldn't really drink water because it's sort of hard to be eating your meal and then stop and go drink water at the water fountain," she said.
At Vista Middle School, Principal Nidia Castro says she will do her best to keep cups of water in her school, even suggesting she might pay out-of-pocket to provide cups for her students.
"It is documented that if we provide the choices for them they will really go for it."
