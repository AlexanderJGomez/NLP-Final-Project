"I'm working on the movie right now," the show's creator tells Rolling Stone.
Any sort of "Arrested Development" movie has yet to receive a green light, so Hurwitz is very reluctant to guess when it might see release.
I want to get a time and tell everybody when it's happening and not play with people.
"I was really aware that we were trying to do something that not only had nobody done before, but we didn't really tell anybody what we were going to do," says Hurwitz.
"By now, many people have gone through the episodes again," says Hurwitz.
People responding quickly to the first episodes was akin to reading a couple chapters of a book and saying, 'I don't like this.'"
It doesn't matter what people like now.
"And then 'Kid A' came out and everybody was like, 'We don't like this.
What is this?
Plans are obviously in flux at the moment, but Hurwitz's ultimate goal is to make an "Arrested Development" movie and then another season of the show.
