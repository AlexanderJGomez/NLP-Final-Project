Rome (CNN) -- Italian President Giorgio Napolitano said Wednesday that his country will adopt a series of austerity measures promised to the European Union, as officials try to allay investor fears and head off a eurozone debt crisis.
Investor confidence plummeted Wednesday when the yield on 10-year Italian government bonds rose above 7%, the level at which other European countries -- including Greece, Portugal and Ireland -- have sought international bailouts.
"The global economy has entered a dangerous and uncertain phase," Christine Lagarde said in remarks prepared for delivery at the International Finance Forum in Beijing.
Although she made no specific mention of Italy in the prepared remarks, Lagarde spoke as even more bad news came from Rome.
Berlusconi later said he would resign, and on Wednesday his spokesman, Paolo Bonaiuti, said Berlusconi would not run in the country's next parliamentary elections.
Many hoped that, by now, we would no longer be lurching from one headline to the next.
For now, analysts are keeping their focus largely on Italy.
"Italy's debt level is sustainable, but it needs to implement policies that will support economic growth."
Berlusconi told Italian newspaper La Stampa that his decision gives him freedom.
Now it is time for Alfano.
Berlusconi was referring to former Justice Minister Angelino Alfano, who has been known as his hand-picked successor.
Dubbed "Super Mario" for his work in international finance, the former EU commissioner gained notoriety for his role in blocking a merger between U.S. firms Honeywell International and General Electric, thought to be a move that highlighted Europe's newfound regulatory clout.
