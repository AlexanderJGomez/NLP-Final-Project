Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actor Charlie Sheen on Friday declared "we are at war" following canceled production of the hit CBS sitcom "Two and a Half Men" and his impending loss of $1.2 million per episode.
"I was told if I went on the attack, they would cancel the show and all that, so I'm just sort of seeing if they're telling the truth or not," Sheen told Jones.
The decision to halt "Two and a Half Men" was announced Thursday after Sheen spoke with the Jones show.
Sheen said the employees should be focused, patient and to understand "there are ways to deal with these clowns and take all their money."
Newsflash: I am special, and I will never be one of you!
I cured it with my brain, with my mind," Sheen told the show.
"I have a lot of work to do to be able to return the support I have received from so many people," Sheen said in a statement then.
"
That's what we do for him."
"I healed really quickly, but I also unravel really quickly, so get me right now guys," Sheen said.
While his representative blamed a hernia for Sheen's pain, he later announced the actor was undergoing rehab at home.
