(CNN)After five months of detention in North Korea, Jeffrey Fowle arrived home in Ohio early Wednesday for an emotional reunion with his family.
The Obama administration, for which Carney was the spokesman, continues to "press very hard" for the release of Americans being held in North Korea, as previous administrations did, he said.
A U.S. government plane picked up Fowle in Pyongyang on Tuesday.
"We're thrilled; we're overjoyed," said Jim Shihady, assistant pastor of Bethel Baptist Church, which the Fowle family attends in Miamisburg, speaking Tuesday to CNN affiliate WHIO.
Last month, Fowle spoke with CNN in a situation controlled by North Korea.
"It's been very good so far, and I hope and pray that it continues, while I'm here two more days or two more decades," he said.
Fowle said at the time that he expected his trial to start within a month.
Officials said he had exhausted his leave.
