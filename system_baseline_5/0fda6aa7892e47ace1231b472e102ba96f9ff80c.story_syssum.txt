Quantico, Virginia (CNN) -- There aren't many people who would voluntarily be pepper-sprayed, but at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia young Marines are doing just that.
CNN got exclusive access inside the Marine Security Guard training program at Quantico, where Marines are training as the service tries to almost double the number of its members posted at embassies and consulates worldwide.
"We also will create a quick-response unit that will be able to augment embassy security in case there are indications ... in a particular country ... and that ambassador wants reinforcement with more Marines," Col. Michael Robinson, commanding officer of the Marine Corps Embassy Security Group, told CNN's Barbara Starr.
Marine security guards do not stand guard outside of their assigned embassy.
Additionally, Marine security guidelines state that guards must have maturity, judgment, moral character and financial stability.
"How you doing?
"No sir, still alive, sir," the young Marine responded.
