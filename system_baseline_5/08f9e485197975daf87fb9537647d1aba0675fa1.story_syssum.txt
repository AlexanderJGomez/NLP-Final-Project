iReporter Bob Austrian, 45, of Tiburon, said he could see the blaze from his home about 4 or 5 miles from the island.
Fire crews and equipment were being ferried to the island to battle the blaze, Giannini said.
Austrian, who has visited the island at least a dozen times, said he's concerned that firefighters won't be able to douse the blaze.
Fire officials said earlier that all of the park workers and campers on the island were safe.
