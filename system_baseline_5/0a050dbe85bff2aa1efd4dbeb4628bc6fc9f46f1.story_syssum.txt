Cooper took up the "Fusion Journey" challenge to travel from New Zealand to New Delhi, India's capital.
There she was tasked with creating a new fashion line that would combine her own sophisticated modern style with the vibrant, brightly colored traditions of Indian dress-making.
I'm also obsessed with detail, so when I find a Victorian gown or a 50s bridal slip that I like, then it's important for me to be able to emulate the exact stitching, embroidery or beading used at the time.
So in one sense, I've been fusing my clothes with Indian influences for a while.
In fact, when it comes to bold use of colors and the use of these rich, deep dyes, how can anyone deny the huge influence of India on fashion around the world?
I mean, lime and pink!
However, what I took back to New Zealand, was their techniques, their intense celebratory colors, their detailed embellishments, their expert use of beads and sequins.
But I'll only know I have finished the creative process when someone comes in and says that, no matter what, they have to have it.
