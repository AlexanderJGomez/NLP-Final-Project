No shape more aptly fits the diamond nickname "ice" than the emerald, a rectangular cut with lean facets extending down the sides.
Characterized by a flat top and step-shaped side facets, an emerald cut cries out for a clean setting.
Ovals have been enjoying a high profile since Tom Cruise placed a gorgeous one on Katie Holmes's finger.
The long shape is especially flattering.
It's often called the round brilliant because it has triangular facets, arranged to direct light from the bottom of the stone up through the top for maximum sparkle.
