Los Angeles (CNN) -- Broadcast icon Dick Clark, the longtime host of the influential "American Bandstand," has died, publicist Paul Shefrin said.
That stroke forced Clark to cut back on his on-camera work, including giving up the hosting duties for the "Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve" specials.
"Only God is responsible for making more stars than Dick Clark," said singer Tony Orlando, who was 16 when he first appeared on Clark's show in 1961.
"I idolized him from the start, and I was graced early on in my career with his generous advice and counsel.
Clark became wealthy as a businessman, producing successful TV shows through Dick Clark Productions.
"One of the real draws when we purchased Dick Clark Productions was the opportunity to build on the tremendous foundation of programming that this icon of American broadcasting created," Snyder said Wednesday.
"He helped me from the very bottom of my career all through the '80s and the '90s, and he's going to be missed a lot."
And Dick Clark was a legend."
He was 75.
