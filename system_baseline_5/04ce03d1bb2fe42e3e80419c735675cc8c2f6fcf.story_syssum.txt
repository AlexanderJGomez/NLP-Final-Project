But what's really interesting about Thanksgiving is the day after -- known as Black Friday.
But what about those who succumb to mass hysteria at local megastores?
Once a person steps onto private property, the law traditionally considered him one of the following: 1) trespasser; 2) licensee; or 3) invitee.
You might think an "invitee" is someone who is just invited on to the property, say, for a cocktail party, but that's not it.
An "invitee," on the other hand, is someone who enters the land for a purpose connected with or benefiting the business owner.
However, whether applying the traditional common law or a modern rule, if you are on someone's property for the purpose of spending money, courts will hold the landowner to the highest applicable standard of care.
The bottom line is that stores will be liable if people are injured by known, unsafe and nonobvious conditions on their property on Black Friday, especially if stores take no special safety or security precautions, and treat the day like any other day.
But, if a store is deliberately indifferent to security problems, then it may be liable where it knowingly ignores the behavior of that riffraff.
If a Black Friday sale devolves into the running of the bulls in Pamplona, and the store knowingly allowed dangerous conditions on the property, it's likely that the store will be held liable for injuries on the premises.
Maybe the Black Friday retailer deserves the Black Friday shopper.
