The move follows a European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) report released Tuesday that concludes one lot of fenugreek seeds imported from Egypt and used to produce sprouts is the "mostly likely common link" between the outbreaks of E. coli in France and Germany.
The EFSA report does not rule out the possibility that more than one lot of seeds may be implicated in the outbreaks.
The recent European outbreaks from a strain of E. coli have led to 48 deaths in Germany and one in Sweden, the EFSA said, with 4,178 cases reported in European Union states, Norway and Switzerland.
Most seeds for sprouting imported by the EU come from India and China, it said.
