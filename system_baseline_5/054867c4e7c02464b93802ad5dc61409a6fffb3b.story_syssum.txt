Yanukovich, who was ousted from office in 2004 in the pro-West "Orange Revolution," beat Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko in a bitterly fought election earlier this month that has left the country deeply divided.
"Being a bridge between East and West, an integral part of Europe and the former Soviet Union at the same time, Ukraine will choose a foreign policy that will allow our country to get the most out of the development of equal and mutually beneficial relations with Russia, the European Union, the United States and other countries that influence development in the world," he said.
"I want to tell the people of Ukraine ... we will repay the arrears of wages and pensions, what the current government never managed to do," he said Thursday.
We will start with ourselves."
