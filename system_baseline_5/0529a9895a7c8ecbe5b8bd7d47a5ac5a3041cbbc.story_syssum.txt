As Chair of the influential Subcommittee on the Internet of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Boucher's imprint on tech issues -- particularly online privacy -- was clear as a bell.
Ditto for content on race, religious beliefs, or sexual orientation.
The big Republican voices that will replace them on the House Commerce Committee have been very vocal on communications technology issues.
Still, despite all the "no compromise" rhetoric that's flying about, there may be some continuity in various policy areas -- particularly regarding online privacy.
That means that Senate Commerce Committee Chair Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) will remain a critical voice on Web-related concerns on that side of the aisle -- Rockefeller warned just last week that he may submit a privacy bill to Congress himself.
It all depends on who winds up where in the next Capitol Hill.
