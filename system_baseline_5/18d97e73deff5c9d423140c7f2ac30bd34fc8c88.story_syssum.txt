(CNN) -- There are "a lot of scare tactics in play here," Steve Butler, protagonist of the new anti-hydraulic-fracturing film "Promised Land," warns a local politician skeptical of the benefits of hydraulic fracturing.
With charm and wit, Noble wins over the town and leaves Butler at the point of despair.
"Promised Land" lacks any substantive scientific evidence illustrating the alleged dangers of fracking.
Of course, what the film does not explain is the incredible economic revolution that hydraulic fracturing has already brought to much of America.
As to the controversy surrounding the environmental safety of hydraulic fracturing, "Promised Land" offers little credible, scientific evidence to illustrate the alleged dangers of hydraulic fracturing.
A monumental energy revolution is under way in this country.
