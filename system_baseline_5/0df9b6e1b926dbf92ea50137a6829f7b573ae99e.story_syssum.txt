(CNN) -- A driverless taxi is waiting for you outside your house.
Instead, this is how your airport travel experience will be in just 10 years from now-- according to Skyscanner.
"Airports and flights will no longer be the price we pay to travel but instead will signify the start of our holidays where travelers can relax and create the perfect space to suit their needs whether they're flying for business or leisure," says Filip Filipov, Skyscanner's Head of B2B.
Biometric check-in software will eliminate the need for boarding passes and passport checks, while X-ray machines will also become a thing of the past thanks to sensors capable of scanning big groups from a large distance.
"You will be able to select the goods that you'd like to buy and have them delivered to your home potentially when you're back from vacation," says Filipov.
"That seat will become your home, in a way, in the air," says Filipov.
"It will actually be tailored to you, not in terms of how it looks and how it feels but rather the multimedia that goes with it."
