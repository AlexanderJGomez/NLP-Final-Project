The South Sudanese government and rebels signed a cease-fire deal on Thursday after more than a month of fighting, according to the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, an East African trade bloc that has been helping to mediate between the parties.
Support for peace talks also came from U.S. President Barack Obama who called on both parties to adhere to a separate detainee agreement, which was also signed as part of the cease-fire deal.
The mayor said between 1,200 and 1,400 civilians were killed when rebels held Bor between December 17 and 24.
South Sudan seceded from Sudan in 2011 after decades of war, making it the world's youngest nation.
