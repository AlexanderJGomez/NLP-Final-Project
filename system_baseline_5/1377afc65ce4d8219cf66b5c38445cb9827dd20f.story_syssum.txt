The musicians are now exchanging bitter words in public while fighting in court over who owns the right to use the New Order name.
Hook left in 2007, claiming it would be impossible for New Order to make music without him.
However, Sumner, Morris and Gilbert reformed four years later without him and are now touring and planning to release new material under the New Order name.
The singer also said he was saddened by his former bandmate's lack of interest in New Order, and Hook confirmed that a reunion seemed unlikely.
How would you feel?"
It's do as I say, not as I do.
"'Movement' is a very Joy Division record with New Order vocals, whereas by the time "Power, Corruption & Lies" came along, it was a proper New Order record.
On previous tours Hook's group played the two Joy Division albums, material New Order rarely performed.
Hook acknowledges the name of his old band is far better known to fans than that of his new one, so the legal battle over who owns the trademark is not just a matter of pride.
