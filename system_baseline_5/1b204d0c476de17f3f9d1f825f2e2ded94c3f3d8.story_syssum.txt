Prosecutor Gerrie Nel has accused the athlete of hiding the truth about the death of Steenkamp, whom he shot last year through a closed toilet door in his home in Pretoria, South Africa.
Pistorius said he thought he heard the toilet door opening before he fired.
Nel then hammered Pistorius on whether he had known Steenkamp was in the toilet when he fired.
Pistorius earlier denied being "ready to shoot" as he made his way to the bathroom where he says he heard what he thought was an intruder.
"You wanted to shoot," contended Nel, who on Thursday sought to build a picture of Pistorius as an arrogant hothead who is reckless with guns.
Nel also argued that it was "not possible" that Steenkamp would not have responded when Pistorius screamed to her about what he thought was an intruder in the house, as he has said happened.
Pistorius said he did not.
Pistorius replied that he didn't because he was sure about what he had heard.
More than once, Nel suggested that Pistorius had difficulty remembering what happened because he had made things up.
Pistorius became emotional as the cross-examination continued, prompting Nel to ask him why.
Pistorius, becoming emotional, replied, "I don't need time.
...
But Pistorius said he preferred to talk to his girlfriend over the phone rather than messaging.
"Because it was all about Mr. Pistorius," Nel said.
The trial has gripped South Africa, where Pistorius is considered a symbol of triumph over physical adversity.
