Cursing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, she asks why the girl had to die -- one of 10 children killed by shelling Sunday on a playground in a Damascus suburb, according to opposition activists.
The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said cluster bombs from Syrian warplanes killed children while they were playing.
Rockets pummeled the Syrian city of Atma on Monday, not far from a key command center for the rebel Free Syrian Army, a witness said.
What started as security forces cracking down on mostly nonviolent protesters has spiraled into a civil war between pro-government forces and the rebels, including the Free Syrian Army.
Rebel fighters scored significant victories over the weekend, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The bloodshed has seeped into Lebanon as well, where there have been deadly clashes between pro- and anti-Syrian factions.
