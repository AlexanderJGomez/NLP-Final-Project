Now 19-year-old Yaasmeen Castanada is fighting for her life inside a California hospital's burn unit, suffering from an allergic reaction that's so severe she has large open wounds all over her body.
Doctors diagnosed Castanada with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, a rare disease that can be triggered by antibiotics or other medications.
"Just unreal, just watching your daughter burn in front of you, literally, burn in front of you," her mother, Laura Corona, told KABC.
And I can't take her home.
Don't offer medication," she said.
At first, doctors diagnosed Castanada with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, which refers to a condition where between 10% and 30% of the skin on the body is affected, Joe said.
"Patients can experience problems with taste, swallowing, eyesight and sexual functions can be affected.
As part of her treatment for the disease, doctors have wrapped her body in a special dressing, Joe said.
The fact that you can get a life-threatening situation from taking a medication.
It's almost over.'"
