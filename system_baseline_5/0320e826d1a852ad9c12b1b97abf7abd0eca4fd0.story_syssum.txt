His condition was stabilized very quickly, said the source.
FBI agents stayed nearby during surgery, the source said.
There were no other patients in that secure unit for the duration of the time that he was there and Tsarnaev recovered very quickly, the source said.
Tsarnaev is now able to speak and has been interacting with medical staff, spokesman John Colautti said.
