The reunions of about 100 people from each country are scheduled to take place between February 20 and 25, the South Korean unification ministry said Wednesday, following face-to-face talks between the two sides.
If they go ahead, the meetings of divided Korean families would be the first to take place since 2010.
In its calls so far this year for better relations, North Korea has asked South Korea not to take part in the drills -- a request that Seoul and Washington have rejected.
Tens of thousands of people in South Korea are on the list of those wanting to take part in the reunions.
