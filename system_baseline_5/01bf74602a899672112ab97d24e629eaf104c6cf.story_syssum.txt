By looking at a total population sample in South Korea, the study authors estimate that 1 in 38 children in the country -- or 2.64% -- has some form of autism.
In this new study, researchers looked at all 55,000 school children in a large metropolitan community of Seoul, which they say is representative not only of South Korea, but also many other developed nations.
Using mathematical algorithms, researchers estimate 1 in 38 children in South Korea have an autism spectrum disorder.
The study doesn't mean that suddenly many more children have autism, Kim said.
He said when the study began in 2005, South Koreans believed that autism was rare in their country.
He cited one South Korean official who he said estimated the prevalence of autism to be about 1 in 100,000.
What makes Monday's study different from other autism studies is that researchers sought out children in regular schools.
Many of the children who were identified with an autism spectrum disorder through this study were found to have a higher IQ, but had poor socialization skills, one of the hallmarks of autism.
This may explain why many children with autism in South Korea may go unnoticed and may explain a significant difference with children in the United States.
