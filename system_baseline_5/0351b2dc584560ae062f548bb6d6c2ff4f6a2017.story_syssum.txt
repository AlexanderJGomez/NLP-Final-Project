(CNN) -- Famed folk singer Richie Havens, the opening act at the 1969 Woodstock music festival, died Monday of a sudden heart attack, his publicist said.
"It was 5 o'clock and nothing was happening yet," Havens told Billboard.
Havens, a Brooklyn, New York, native, told CNN in 1999 that music enabled him to leave his rough neighborhood to head to Greenwich Village and the music scene there.
"It was the songs that actually changed my life," he says.
They were just so powerful.
Stephen Stills of Crosby, Stills and Nash said Havens was an inspiration for the natural gravel in his singing voice.
"But he sure knew what to do when they were begging for someone to go on first, when all those people showed up at Woodstock," Stills said.
Billboard reported Havens died in New Jersey, leaving behind four daughters and five grandchildren.
