According to a press release from Showtime, "Twin Peaks" will be a limited series of nine episodes.
Lynch and Frost will write and produce each one and Lynch will direct all nine.
The tone was set with Angelo Badalamenti's ghostly theme music.
Showtime plans to show the entire run of the TV series before the premiere of the new "Twin Peaks" episodes.
"To quote Agent Cooper, 'I have no idea where this will lead us, but I have a definite feeling it will be a place both wonderful and strange.'"
