Washington (CNN)The boys — and girls — of Capitol Hill are back in town.
Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, a member of the new Democratic minority in the Senate and a former member of the House, said he was committed to getting something done on Capitol Hill even with Republicans at the helm — but sounded less than confident it was possible.
There was, however, some bipartisan love seen in the halls of Congress on Tuesday, perhaps brought on — or allowed to slip out — by the chaos of the day.
Dan Sullivan, Mike Rounds and Thom Tillis, and had about a dozen receptions he planned to hit — but he'd spend "most of my time" with his new colleague from Iowa, Sen. Joni Ernst.
Mia Love, an African-American Mormon representative from Utah, got a special visit from Rep. Paul Ryan — who thanked her friends and family for bringing "this budding star" to Congress — before heading to the House floor for the first business of the new Congress.
Indeed, it seemed despite Tuesday's fun, the dirty work of legislating wasn't far from lawmakers' minds.
"The hard work begins tomorrow."
