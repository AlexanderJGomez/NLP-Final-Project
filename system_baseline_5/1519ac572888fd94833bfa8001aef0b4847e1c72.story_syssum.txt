Supermodel Natalia Vodianova was discovered in Moscow in a classic rags-to-riches tale.
Vodianova was born on February 28 1982 in Nizhni Novgorod, the fourth largest city in Russia.
When Vodianova was 11 she began to help out on the family's fruit stall, and at the age of 15 she had moved into her own apartment with her best friend.
I appreciate what she has done for me and the way she raised me"
The Portman family is one of the wealthiest in Britain, owning over 100 acres of prime land in central London and 3000 acres in Herefordshire, as well as expansive properties in Antigua and Australia.
Vodianova lost a huge amount of weight after the birth and just a few weeks later at the castings for Paris Fashion Week she was the clear favorite among the designers.
Afterwards, Vodianova took Valentino for a well-deserved holiday to her much-loved city of Moscow.
It would be my dream" Vodianova told CNN.
It's really about people in general -- I really love people and I try to never say no if someone needs my help."
