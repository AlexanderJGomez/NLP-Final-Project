Chantal Ka-Hor-Rury, a coffee trader and head of a collective that helps farmers bring their crop to market, is committed to helping Burundi expand its coffee industry.
Coffee accounts for 80% of Burundi's export revenues but with market prices slipping to their lowest level since 2009, according to the International Coffee Organization's index, profit margins are thin.
Today, Burundi's coffee producers are trying to transform the country's fortunes, with farmers harboring ambitions to process coffee domestically.
"Coffee comes from Africa so it should be able to produce the best coffee in terms of the characteristics of the bean," he said.
And Galindo believes more needs to be done to increase revenues for Africa's coffee producers.
