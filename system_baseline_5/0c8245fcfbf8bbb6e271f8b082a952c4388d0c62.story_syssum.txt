Boxx was diagnosed with lupus in 2007 when she was 30 years old.
She went public with her lupus diagnosis in April 2012 and is now working with the Lupus Foundation of America to create awareness about this chronic autoimmune disease that affects 1.5 million people in the U.S.
You have lupus, in addition to Sjogren's Syndrome -- another autoimmune disease.
I deal with fatigue and joint pain just like with lupus, but it also affects my skin, my eyes and my mouth.
Now add in a disease where my main symptoms are extreme fatigue and joint pain, and that standard becomes a little bit more difficult to maintain.
The medicine I am on now helps control the amount of "flare-ups" I may have, as well as control the amount of inflammation in my body.
The best solution for me is, if I start to feel more fatigued than normal, I will train lighter that day or even just take it off completely.
I understand that people with lupus and/or Sjogren's range from mild to severe and no two people are alike in their struggle with either of these diseases.
You've just begun to talk publicly about your battles with autoimmune disease.
If I can help spread the word about what lupus or Sjogren's is and what the symptoms are, maybe I can help get people in to visit a doctor sooner.
How do you weigh the benefits of rest/recovery over pushing through the pain to help your team?
My hamstring healed and I was able to start in the final game and help my team to an Olympic gold medal.
