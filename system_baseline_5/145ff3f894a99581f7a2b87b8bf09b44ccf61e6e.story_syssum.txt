In an interview scheduled to air on CNN Friday night, Larry King asked James whether the Cavaliers have an edge to retain the Ohio native.
"So, I've got a lot of memories here.
"I don't know to that extent, but it will be fun," James said.
The Cavaliers drafted James, 25, out of high school in 2003.
He told King his goal is to be with a team that can win more than one NBA championship.
