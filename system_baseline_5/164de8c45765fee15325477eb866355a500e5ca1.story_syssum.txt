Near Suruc, Turkey (CNN) -- Iraqi-Kurdish Peshmerga fighters began arriving in the besieged northern Syrian city of Kobani from Turkey, two witnesses said Thursday, starting what analysts call a largely symbolic reinforcement of fellow Kurds defending the town from ISIS.
Though the Syrian Kurds will welcome the Peshmerga, the troop movement doesn't necessarily signal a major shift in the fight, analysts say.
ISIS is also reinforcing its contingent in Kobani, White said, setting out the prospect of a protracted fight over the city.
With ISIS controlling the Syrian land surrounding Kobani, the Peshmerga's easiest path into the city was through Turkey.
But while Turkey did nothing to intervene in Kobani, Kurds protested in Turkish streets.
