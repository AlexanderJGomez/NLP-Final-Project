Former Royal Navy officer Philip Beale hopes to sail a replica Phoenician boat 10,000 kilometers across the Atlantic in an ambitious voyage that could challenge maritime history.
"It is one of the greatest voyages of mankind and if anyone could have done it [before Columbus], it was the Phoenicians," said Beale.
Using locally-sourced materials, shipbuilders stayed true to the original down to the exact thickness of the planks and position of the mast.
But at least there was no cleaning."
He said copper coins with Phoenician iconography have also also been discovered in North America.
"If the Phoenicians got to England -- which we think they did -- I wouldn't be surprised if the boat could get to America physically.
Setting off from Tunisia, the modern-day Phoenician vessel is expected to take two to three months to reach America -- granted Beale can raise Â£100,000 ($156,000) for the expedition.
They've found Viking settlements in Newfoundland, it's undisputed," Beale said.
