CNN: What happens in the body when someone experiences carsickness or motion sickness?
If there is some sort of mismatch between your senses, say your eyes are telling you that you're moving -- or not -- and your ears are telling you [the opposite] and for some reason they're not connecting, you start to get what's called disequilibrium, or motion sickness.
Gupta: You know it's funny, I think that probably anybody could get motion sickness.
Gupta: People who have some sort of inner ear problem, we know that that can be an issue.
Diabetics -- because they have numbness in the feet -- often times won't be able to tell if they're moving when they are, so they'll get a mismatch.
And it is all those things: I get sweaty, I feel really sick to my stomach, I feel like I'm going to throw up, I can't think straight, I can't even talk on the phone at that time because any kind of stimulus just really throws me off.
But you get a lot of starting and stopping and that can make it a lot worse.
I'll drive even in New York, because I don't get sick when I drive.
If I get there, if I allow myself to get to the point where I'm motion sick, then I'm pretty much toast.
That whole process can make you motion sick.
Motion sickness is something that people -- if you're particularly bothered by it -- might resort to a Dramamine patch, or something like that to get rid of the symptoms, but to have it not actually occur in the first place is a pretty difficult thing to do, particularly through training.
For the diaphoresis and the sweating and all that, they're not going to help you that much.
But they do the same thing, they sort of quiet your stomach, quiet some of the symptoms associated with motion sickness but they don't really take care of the cause of it in the first place.
Get as much fresh air as much as possible.
And get the kids and elderly people in particular out of the car as much as possible.
