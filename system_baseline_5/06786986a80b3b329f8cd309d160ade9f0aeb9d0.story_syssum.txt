Football or soccer?
The world body -- FIFA -- has the word "football" in its title.
Soccer would have been used to differentiate between University sports rugby football ("rugger") and "association" football.
In later years, it became the United States Soccer Football Association and today is known as the United States Soccer Federation.
We'd like you to tell us whether the game should be called football or soccer and why.
