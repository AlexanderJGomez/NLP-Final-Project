(CNN) -- Linguists announced Monday they have identified an endangered language known as Koro that is spoken by about 800 people in northeast India.
Koro shares some vocabulary with other languages spoken in the region but shares more features with languages spoken farther east, such as Milang and Tani, the linguists said in a news release issued by National Geographic.
It is a language hotspot where there is room to study rich, diverse languages, many unwritten or documented.
While recording the vocabularies, they detected a third language -- Koro.
"Koro could hardly sound more different from Aka," Harrison writes.
Anderson and Harrison said Aka is the traditional language of the region's historic slave traders, and they hypothesized that Koro may have sprung from the slaves; though they said more study is needed to determine the origin.
