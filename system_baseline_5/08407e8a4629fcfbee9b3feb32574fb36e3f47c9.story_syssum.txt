Last Thursday, Jeff Courcelle came home from work to find 5-year-old Mocha -- a pure bred fawn-colored Doberman pincher -- hovering over a pile of screws, metal pieces, three watch heads and some chewed leather straps.
Parkinson knew that Mocha wouldn't be able to pass all that leather on her own.
Parkinson and her husband were just expecting to see a couple metal pieces.
The night Mocha stayed in the hospital, a nervous Parkinson stayed awake reading stories about dogs ingesting watches and other objects.
Mocha likes to suck on fleece blankets and has been known to eat rubber ear buds or hair elastics, but nothing like a pile of jewelry, Parkinson said.
From now on, Parkinson said she will put Mocha in a crate if the dog will be staying somewhere new.
"My husband was all excited about the new Apple watch, but couldn't justify a reason to purchase it since he owned three watches," she said.
