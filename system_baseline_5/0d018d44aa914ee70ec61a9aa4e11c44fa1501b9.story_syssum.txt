"Once the levee completely fails ... it is unknown how far south the flood waters of the Wisconsin River will travel," the Weather Service said Sunday night.
The levee is located on the south side of the Wisconsin River, just south of Portage.
"Emergency vehicles including police, fire and EMS will not be able to reach residents," the statement said.
The river at Portage is now expected to stay above flood stage -- 17 feet -- through Wednesday, Beghin said.
But the levee system, built in the 1890s, was constructed from locally available materials -- mostly sand -- "without any engineering design or adherence to any standards," the Natural Resources department said in a statement last week.
"I have never seen the water rage down like it is," CNN iReporter Jason Asselin said.
CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said Sunday that there's no immediate end in sight to the flooding.
