(CNN) -- New junior federal prosecutors literally started in the basement of the U.S. courthouse in downtown Brooklyn.
And now, two-plus decades later, it looks like she will be the next attorney general of the United States.
She is a workhorse, not a show horse, and she has flourished doing the hard, ordinary work of federal prosecution -- narcotics cases, organized crime (always big in Brooklyn), public corruption (ditto) and civil rights violations.
Like Holder, she comes from the generation after the civil rights movement, but it is part of her DNA, and that will come through in her priorities.
Will Lynch continue these efforts?
In any event, one verdict is clear: Lynch has come a long way from that basement we shared.
