To be fair, Psaki described the U.S. peace talks with the Taliban -- which Afghan President Hamid Karzai opposes -- as the preliminary step toward long healing process in war-torn Afghanistan and creating "reconciliation" within the country.
What has influenced U.S. leaders is the Taliban's announcement that they oppose "the use of Afghan soil to threaten other countries" such as the United States and they support an Afghan peace process, Psaki said.
The Taliban announcement has angered the Afghan president, who said the country's High Peace Council won't take part in peace talks in Qatar until the process is led by Afghans.
"We've long said that this conflict will likely not be won on the battlefield, and that is why we support this office," Psaki said.
The ability to open a formal line of communication with the Taliban is important to reaching an "end goal" of disassociating the Taliban from al Qaeda and bringing peace to Afghanistan, Psaki said.
We're doing both at the same time, talking and winding down our fighting in the country," Psaki said.
"This is just the first step in the process.
That U.S. withdrawal raises the stakes for Afghanistan to govern itself in peace.
