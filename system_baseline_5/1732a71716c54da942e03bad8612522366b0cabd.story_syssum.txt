The wife of British hostage Alan Henning pleaded Saturday with ISIS to release him, describing her husband as a "peaceful, selfless man" who was only in Syria to help people in need.
Henning's wife said her husband, a father of two, was only trying to do good in Syria.
"Alan is a peaceful, selfless man who left his family and his job as a taxi driver in the UK to drive in a convoy all the way to Syria with his Muslim colleagues and friends to help those most in need," she said in the statement.
And news of Haines' death came the same day that his family released a brief message to his captors through the UK Foreign Office.
"When they hear this message, I implore the people of the Islamic State to see it in their hearts to release my husband, Alan Henning."
While part of the convoy stopped at the Turkish border, Henning -- the only non-Muslim in the group -- volunteered to cross into Syria with a 10-person advance party.
The other members of the convoy thought "that they would just question him further and then they would let him go," she said.
Islam-Zulfiqar said other members of the convoy gave Henning the affectionate nickname "Gadget," for his love of all things technical.
"He really is the guy that fixes everything," she told CNN.
