(CNN) -- Call David X. Cohen a nerd all you like, but never call him a geek.
I love being called a nerd."
Finally, in 2007, fans had their "Futurama" back, in not one, but four direct-to-DVD movies.
The most exciting new thing about this season of "Futurama," according to Cohen, is that it's, well, new.
"I want to reassure our fans that this will be the real classic 'Futurama' back to its original form.
"Futurama" also has a big milestone to celebrate, thanks to that Comedy Central pickup: "We will have our 100th episode with Mark Mothersbaugh and Devo.
"Our tenth episode of the new season is written by Dr. Ken Keeler, and it involves the characters switching minds, and it becomes very complicated due to the nature of this to work our way back to the original body, and requires solving a mathematical problem," Cohen explained.
