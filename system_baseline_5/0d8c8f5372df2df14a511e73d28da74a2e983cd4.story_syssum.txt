But even though I take steps to keep my old electronics out of landfills and environmentally disastrous overseas disposal doesn't mean I'm willing to spend large amounts of time and effort to figure out what to do with them.
Since then, my two-year-old iPhone 3G has been gathering dust on my dresser.
So I found a middleman to shield me from embarassment, keep my old iPhone out of the landfill and let me make some easy money all at the same time.
In less than a minute Gazelle.com agreed to buy my old iPhone for $93.
Frankly, if I had to deal with the hassles and risks of selling this phone myself via Craigslist or eBay, and also reverting it back to an older OS so it's bearably functional again to assuage my conscience, that iPhone would keep sitting on my dresser until the next electronics recycling drive.
Gazelle.com spokesperson Kristina Kennedy explained that the company, which buys over 20 categories of electronics products in addition to cell phones, ends up "finding new homes" for more than 90 percent of the used devices they buy.
For instance, before the iPhone 4 was unveiled June 7, Gazelle.com was getting about 25 used iPhones per day.
The Gazelle.com site did not ask me which operating system is on my iPhone 3G.
I asked Kennedy whether, given the widely reported troubles with iOS4 on the iPhone 3G, they'd start taking that into account into the price they offer on trade-ins.
