Until recently, Berlusconi appeared to be leading a charmed life.
But last year he became embroiled in charges that he had paid for sex with a 17-year-old girl; his coalition government became ever more fragile; and Berlusconi resigned his premiership as Europe's financial crisis threatened to embroil Italy.
Berlusconi is also vowing to cut corporate taxes and income taxes and spend the economy out of the recession.
After amassing a fortune from his property portfolio in the 1970s, he diversified his interests by setting up a TV cable company, Telemilano, and buying two other cable channels in an effort to break the national TV monopoly in Italy.
Berlusconi turned his attention to politics in 1993 when he formed the center-right Forza Italia Party and the following year, in a snap election, he won the post of prime minister.
His fortunes turned again in 2001 when he was sworn in as prime minister for a second time.
Berlusconi said she was the daughter of a friend and that he had done nothing wrong.
The prime minister survived three votes of confidence in Parliament during 2010 and 2011, winning one by just three votes, but his authority continued to ebb.
El Mahroug has said she never had sex with Berlusconi and that she lied to him about her age, telling him she was 24.
Berlusconi denied the charges and accused prosecutors of conspiring against him in a left-wing plot.
But, according to the transcripts of the calls, Berlusconi made several controversial remarks, vowing at one point to leave Italy, which he described as a "s****y country" that "sickened" him.
