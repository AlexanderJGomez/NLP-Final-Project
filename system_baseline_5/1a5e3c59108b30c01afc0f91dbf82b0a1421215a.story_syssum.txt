Razgui supports himself and his family playing these instruments.
A spokesperson from U.S. Customs and Border Protection said Razgui did not claim his bag at JFK.
Razgui said he did not understand what happened.
The Customs spokesperson, however, said agriculture specialists neither found nor destroyed any instruments.
In the past, he said, his instruments have been subject to increased scrutiny by Customs officials, but he has never had his instruments confiscated.
He said he made all of the instruments himself.
The Customs spokesperson said any passenger who has an issue can file a report online or contact Homeland Security.
