London (CNN)A UK public inquiry into the 2006 death of Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko opened Tuesday at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, after years of wrangling over what evidence can be heard.
But unlike a public inquiry, it cannot hear evidence behind closed doors.
Both men deny involvement in Litvinenko's death.
The public inquiry will look at possible Russian state involvement in Litvinenko's death.
The presence of radiation in Litvinenko's body complicated the autopsy, the inquiry heard.
In the course of the inquiry, evidence may also deal with the contamination risk posed to the wider public by the transfer of such highly radioactive material.
