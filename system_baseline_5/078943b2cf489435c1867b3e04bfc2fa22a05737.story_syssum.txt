Hong Kong (CNN) -- Panasonic halted operations at three factories in China after angry protesters ransacked Japanese businesses over the weekend amid rising tensions over disputed islands in the East China Sea.
Panasonic also halted operations at a factory in Guangdong province until Tuesday as some local employees staged a strike as protest against Japan's claim to the island chain, called Diaoyu by China and Senkaku by Japan.
"I want them (China and Japan) to be friendly again.
Meanwhile, an editorial in the China Daily on Monday called on China to impose economic sanctions against Japan.
"Taking a cue from the U.S. practice, China can use the security exception clause to reduce the export of some important materials to Japan," the editorial said.
China dispatched the ships after the Japanese government bought several of the islands from a private Japanese owner last week.
Nearly 20% of Japanese exports last year were sold to mainland China, compared to 15.3% exported to the U.S., according to figures from the Japan External Trade Organization.
China says its claim to the islands goes back hundreds of years.
