Mariupol, Ukraine (CNN) -- A U.S. lawmaker is calling for the arming of Ukrainian forces engaged in fighting Russian troops along the nation's eastern border with Russia.
"I think we are very close to the point of no return," Poroshenko said following an EU summit in Brussels, Belgium.
Poroshenko said thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukrainian territory.
"I want to remind you that Russia is one of the most powerful nuclear nations," Putin said.
The Ukrainian military worked to fortify the port city of Mariupol after Russian intelligence groups were observed there, said Col. Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Defense and Security Council.
Since mid-April, the conflict between the pro-Russia rebels and the Ukrainian military has cost more than 2,500 lives, according to the United Nations.
