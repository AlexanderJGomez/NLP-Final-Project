NEW YORK (CNN) -- The Justice Department and federal prosecutors will investigate allegations of discrimination against Latinos by police in Suffolk County, New York, officials said.
Lucero's stabbing also prompted the Southern Poverty Law Center to undertake an investigation in Suffolk County.
"The Lucero murder, while the worst of the violence so far, was hardly an isolated incident," the report said.
Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer said law center researchers did not speak with him during the course of their investigation.
In January, hate-crime charges were extended against the seven teens charged in Lucero's death to include other assaults on Latino men.
Justice Department spokesman Alejandro Miyas said the department hopes police will cooperate with the inquiry and work with investigators.
"We're very proud of the way the police department interacts with our minority communities."
