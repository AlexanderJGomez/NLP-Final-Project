(CNN) -- As water levels already at or above flood stage continue rising in rivers in southwestern Louisiana, the weather forecast says more rain is on the way.
There were no initial reports of injuries.
The National Weather Service said at least two EF-1 tornadoes struck Thursday, one of which damaged 50 homes in St. Martin Parish.
Much of the region is hilly and not as prone to flooding.
2012 was the warmest year on record for the contiguous 48 states of the United States, according to the National Weather Service.
Cold weather should return soon, giving the country a normal start into 2013, he said.
