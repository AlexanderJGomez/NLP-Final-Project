(CNN) -- Just six weeks after the Australian Senate rejected a bill that included opening offshore processing centers for asylum seekers, a government-appointed panel has recommended just that.
Refugee Convention, Malaysia has no legal obligation to protect asylum seekers, something required under Australia's Migration Act.
"We will also move to immediately implement the recommendations on family reunion," she added.
"What we need to do is promote proper protection standards in the region.
Since then, there has been a sharp increase in asylum seekers making the dangerous trip by boat to seek a new life in Australia.
"Sending asylum seekers to places like Malaysia, Nauru and Papua New Guinea is unacceptable and a complete outsourcing of Australia's human rights obligations.
Manne said it was questionable whether Nauru would meet the requirements to be considered as a legally viable option for offshore asylum centers.
Gillard said she is willing to compromise further to reach agreement and a policy on the issue.
