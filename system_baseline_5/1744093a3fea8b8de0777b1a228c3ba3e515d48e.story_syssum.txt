The Wolong Giant Panda Reserve Center in southwest Sichuan province is home to about 86 giant pandas, who were reported safe Tuesday.
The mountainous, densely wooded region is the natural habitat for most of the 1,200 giant pandas living in the wild, making it an obvious location for research bases like Wolong and Chengdu.
Zobor said the WWF had confirmed the safety of staff members based in Beijing but had not received word on the conditions in Wolong.
In the late 1990s, the captive giant panda population was in decline, with more animals dying than were born, Wildt said.
If the staff is fine, then the animals will be fine," Wildt said.
