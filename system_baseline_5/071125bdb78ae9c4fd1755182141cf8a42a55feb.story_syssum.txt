It may now be Albania's liveliest neighborhood, but a little over two decades ago it wasn't even on the map.
The Block ('Ish-Blloku' in Albanian) was Hoxha's refuge.
The Block was a silent stronghold of Albania's elite.
At street level too, the neighborhood is almost unrecognizable.
The Block was his perfect opportunity.
Almost all of The Block's venue's names are in English, a detail that irks some locals.
"English is a way to look trendy," says Rudina Hoxha, a journalist.

"I like it here," she says.
In 2007 a shade more than a million people visited the country.
"It's impossible to understand what that regime was like without living in it anyway," he says.
For coffee: Radio Cafe Tirana.
For drinks: Duff Bar.
Yes, its theme might be cheesier than cheddar sandwich, but Duff is packed most nights and it's a great spot for people-watching in the heart of The Block.
