(CNN) -- Six inches of snow in Chicago.
Many drought-stricken states need a foot of rain, not snow.
"All of the snow that has fallen over the winter by and large remains on top of the landscape," said Minnesota's state climatologist Greg Spoden.
Comparatively, Minnesota doesn't have it that bad, according to U.S. Drought Monitor.
But the state is still plagued by "severe," "extreme" and "exceptional" drought, U.S. Drought Monitor said.
Total snowfall in the western half of the country is dropping, said Princeton climatologist Sarah Kapnick, which will mean less accumulation of moisture from snow.
As the current storm reaches the Atlantic coast, dumping snow on the nation's capital, the white precipitation should become slushier and deliver more moisture per foot of snow, according to CNN's Weather Center.
Snow plows have been readied.
In the parched Plains states, snow hasn't helped enough.
