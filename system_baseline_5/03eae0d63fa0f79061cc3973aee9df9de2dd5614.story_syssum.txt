Duncan, Oklahoma (CNN) -- Justin Boyles lay in bed, exhausted and depressed.
Her mom had tried to explain why Justin was so sad, but Autumn didn't really understand diabetes or its dangerous implications.
The first time they hung out at 16, Justin took Shanon to church.
"As long as I can remember, I've been overweight," Justin says.
"I was really kind of in my own little hole, and I didn't want to get out or do anything," he says.
He's her hero," Shanon says.
Since his diagnosis with type 2 diabetes in March -- and his pinky promise to Autumn -- Justin has lost more than 65 pounds.
"I no longer lay in bed thinking that my weight is just too much to overcome," Justin says.
I don't care what weight he's at," Shanon says.
Justin still has a long way to go in his weight loss journey.
