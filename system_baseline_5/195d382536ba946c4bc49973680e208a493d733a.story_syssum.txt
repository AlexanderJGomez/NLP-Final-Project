Bangalore, India (CNN) -- As one of India's richest self-made women, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw has an impressive resume.
"I had a lot of foolish courage because when I started up the company I found I had huge credibility challenges to overcome," said Mazumdar-Shaw.
"India is a country where 80% of healthcare (spend) is out of pocket; where 80% of healthcare infrastructure is in the private sector; where most people don't have access to quality healthcare," she said.
"I felt there was a crying need for a comprehensive cancer center which also addresses affordability," said Mazumdar-Shaw.
"One of my objectives when I started Biocon was to make sure that I create a company for women scientists to pursue a vocation," said Mazumdar-Shaw.
"There's a huge journey ahead for me.
And I want to be remembered as someone who did make a difference to social economic development in India."
