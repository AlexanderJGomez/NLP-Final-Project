She's one of six people still in the hospital, and the only one in critical condition.

AZUZ: Many consider Martin Luther King the face of the civil rights movement.
On April 4th, 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee.
That proposal became law in 1983 and the first nationwide observance of the Martin Luther King holiday was in 1986.
Critics say it shouldn't be up to the federal government to decide what schools are allowed to serve -- that it's a state or local issue.
What is the atomic symbol for gold?
AZUZ: Gold, money and dreams: A dangerous combination that has been the downfall of many and the success of a few.
But why gold instead of other metals?
POPPY HARLOW, CNNMONEY.COM ANCHOR: We're gearing up to go two miles deep into one of the biggest gold mines in the country.
Here, in Barrick Gold's Cortez Mine in rural Nevada, more than one million ounces of gold were mined last year alone.
In fact, you can't even see the gold in this mine.
HARLOW: Miners have to drill and blast through layers and layers of rock to reach the gold.
HAGER: There's gold in this.
HARLOW: So, after the gold ore is mined, about 400 tons of it goes in massive trucks just like this one.
Of that, only four ounces is pure gold.
HARLOW: Barrick mines gold for around $300 an ounce, and gold is selling for record highs, around $1,400 an ounce.
HAGER: There's job security here with gold that high.
AZUZ: It's something people can play by day, and by knights.
Enjoy the Martin Luther King holiday, and we'll see you on Tuesday!
