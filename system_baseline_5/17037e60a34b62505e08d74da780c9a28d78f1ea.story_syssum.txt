OLLANTAYTAMBO, Peru (CNN) -- Stand anywhere in the Peruvian town of Ollantaytambo and look up.
When planning a trip to the area's star attraction -- the mountaintop Incan ruins of Machu Picchu -- this gem of a town in Peru's Sacred Valley is not to be missed.
Acclimating to elevations of more than 11,000 feet above sea level is a good reason to head directly down to the valley after arriving at the Cusco Airport, but the tiny town called Ollantaytambo is another great reason to set aside at least a couple of your vacation days.
The main attraction, the Ollantaytambo Ruins, a former Incan fortress, attracts busloads of day trippers that unload by the market.
Across town are other Incan sites, also visible from the town's cobblestone corners, where you can hike up to the ruins free of charge.
Once you have worked up an appetite, you can easily find a good meal in Ollantaytambo.
There are several trains a day between Ollantaytambo and Machu Picchu, so it's feasible to do a day trip to visit the main attraction.
Whether you take the bus, train or taxi, consider a stop in this impressive Incan town as you check the nearby world wonder off your list.
