(CNN) -- Child beauty pageants are a lot like crime coverage on local news.
People complain that child beauty pageants exploit young girls -- some as young as 3 or 4 who are donning makeup, high heels and fake tans -- and yet, the ratings for reality television shows such as TLC's "Toddlers & Tiaras" are sky high.

"I do not like it when children who are not able to make choices on their own are forced to be in pageants and that is when I see the over-glamourization of young girls," said Westmoreland, who is a media coordinator and writer for CNN's food blog, Eatocracy.
Tish Howard, a former school principal, is no fan of child pageants, but like Westmoreland, thinks government should not be deciding what programs are acceptable for children.
pageant in high school, but let me stress it was not a beauty pageant but a pageant based on talent, interviewing skills and community service.
Do you think child beauty pageants should be banned in the U.S.?
