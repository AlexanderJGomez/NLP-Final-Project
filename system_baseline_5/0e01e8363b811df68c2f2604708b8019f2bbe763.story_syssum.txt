(CNN) -- No budget for a new computer in this recession?
Like any machine, a well-maintained car or computer will surprise you, no matter its age.
I'm here to tell you that even if you don't have the riches to get your dream setup today, you don't have to settle for less than what yesterday's perfect computer can offer.
Check for driver and version updates either at your computer manufacturer's Web site or through the list of software you use frequently; see if new drivers or versions are available.
If you use more than one computer on a regular basis, this is likely what you're doing anyway.
If you're still using Internet Explorer, stop!
Another option takes us back to the Web -- you can often get an online backup plan that will remove your valuable data not only from that main hard drive, but also from your computer's immediate vicinity.
Your old computer, treated with care and respect, can still make that pan-global road trip on the Information Superhighway.
