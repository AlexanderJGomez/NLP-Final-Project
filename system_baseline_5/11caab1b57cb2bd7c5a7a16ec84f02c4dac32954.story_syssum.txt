Panetta's assessment came just days before the one-year anniversary of the U.S. commando raid on bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, that ended a manhunt for the al Qaeda founder that began following the September 11, 2001, terror attacks.
"I don't think there's any question that America is safer as a result of the bin Laden operation," Panetta said."...
And then actually going in to the compound when one of the helicopters went down because of the heat coming off the ground.
Panetta has said he remains convinced that someone with authority in Pakistan knew bin Laden was hiding at the compound.
Pakistan has in essence halted much of its cooperation with the United States while its parliament reassess future terms of engagement with Washington following a U.S. airstrike in November that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers along the border with Afghanistan.
