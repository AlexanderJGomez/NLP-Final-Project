The outcome of the game is not important -- few people remember who wins the All-Star Game from year to year.
The answer may be found in a single sentence written by a man who died at the age of 76 in this still-new year.
But it is another sentence in the story that explains everything -- not just about sports, but about the lives the rest of us can lead.
On fields of play -- baseball diamonds, football fields, a basketball court like the one on which Sunday's All-Star Game will be held -- the tissue-thin difference is there for the world to see.
Are the rest of us the same as the players on the court?
And yet, the one way in which we can be the same, or at least strive to, is in that pursuit of the tissue-thin difference.
We wait for them.
