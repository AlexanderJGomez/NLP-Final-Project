(CNN)Valentine's Day is big currency in China, a nation obsessed with love, romance and dating.
Every weekend in China a strange, albeit charming, ritual takes place -- the parents of China's singles frequent their local park in order to match make on behalf of their children.

Instead, they go by the putdown "third gender."
China now has the largest number of online daters.

Other jewels include dressing better and spending less on the object of your affection (yes, you read that correctly).
