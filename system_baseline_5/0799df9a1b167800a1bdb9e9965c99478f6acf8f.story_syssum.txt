Conservative outlets that back McDaniel have been all over the fact Cochran rents a basement apartment in Webber's D.C. home, and that Webber has traveled extensively with Cochran on the taxpayer's dime.
Now McDaniel is fending off questions about whether his campaign was involved in trying to photograph Cochran's sick wife.
"I am not going to Washington D.C. to be a member of the cocktail circuit or to make backroom deals.
He's a guy that believes in big government.
I am not that guy," McDaniel said.
But like other Republican incumbents this year, Cochran and his allies are fighting back hard.
He said Cochran fights hard for Mississippi's needs and calls his seniority -- ranking Republican on the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, a big plus for the state.
People can lose touch and get lazy and all those things but I don't think that's the case with Senator Cochran.
"I say name one fight Senator Cochran's lead against Barack Obama.
And they can't name one," McDaniel told CNN.
We tried to catch Cochran after his event in Vicksburg, but when an aide came out and saw us waiting, they did a bait and switch -- the car they told us Cochran was getting into screeched away without him, while he snuck out another door and left in another car, leaving reporters in the dust.
