Philippines Coast Guard Rear Adm. Rodolfo Isorena said Wednesday that he hopes the salvaging will begin soon so that further damage to the reef will be limited, the Philippines News Agency said.
Various U.S. officials, including Navy Vice Adm. Scott Swift last month, have apologized to the Philippines for the incident, which the U.S. Navy and the Philippines Coast Guard are investigating.
The ship's wood-and-fiberglass hull was penetrated, allowing a significant amount of water into the ship, the Navy said.
One of the environmental concerns is that algae will grow on dead or scarred corals, park Superintendent Angelique Songco said.
But the park, which is celebrating its 25th year, will have to close two of its 15 major diving sites during the operation, she said.
