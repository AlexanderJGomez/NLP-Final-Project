I was one of those kids who wasted their youth watching "Creature Double Feature" smackdowns between Godzilla and his arsenal of enemy combatants such as Mothra and Ghidorah.
Unfortunately, Gareth Edwards' "Godzilla" feels like two movies Scotch-taped together.
He doesn't seem too interested in his actors â€” they're more plodding than their reptilian costars and you don't care about a single one of them â€” but Edwards does know how to fashion some serious monster mayhem.
When Godzilla first lumbers on screen to hunt the MUTOs and ''restore balance,'' he feels both nostalgically familiar and excitingly new.
Godzilla is humanity's only hope for destroying the MUTOs.
In its handful of moments like these, "Godzilla" almost makes you feel like a kid again.
