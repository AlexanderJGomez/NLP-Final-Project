Washington (CNN) -- A typo kept President Barack Obama from signing legislation designed to end budget-related FAA air traffic controller furloughs blamed for widespread flight delays, a congressional source told CNN.
The FAA "is not impacted," the source said.
Since Sunday, more than 3,000 flights had been delayed because of the furloughs, the FAA said.
