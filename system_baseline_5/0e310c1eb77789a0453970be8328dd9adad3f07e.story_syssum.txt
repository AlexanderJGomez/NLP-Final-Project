BURBANK, California (CNN) -- Laura Ling on Wednesday expressed the shock she and Euna Lee felt when former President Clinton showed up in Pyongyang, North Korea, to help secure the two journalists' release.
North Korea pardoned Ling, 32, and Lee, 36, after Clinton's brief trip Tuesday to Pyongyang.
She said that she and Lee are looking forward to spending "some quiet, private time" with their families.
He expressed his gratitude to Clinton and President Obama and his administration who "have been deeply involved in this humanitarian effort."

"I am very happy that after this long ordeal, Laura Ling and Euna Lee are now home and reunited with their loved ones," Clinton said in a statement.
Their release is a "source of happiness not only for the families but for the entire country," he said.
Clinton made the trip to North Korea after the women's families asked him to travel there, a senior administration official said.
In July, Ling and Lee spoke to their families and told them that the North Koreans were willing to grant them amnesty if a high-level envoy, such as former President Clinton, were willing to travel to Pyongyang, the administration official said on condition of anonymity.
He said Clinton met for three hours and 15 minutes with the North Korean leader but said he did not know what issues were discussed.
Clinton's mission came as the United States and its allies in the region are seeking to persuade North Korea to return to the stalled nuclear disarmament talks.
Clinton had considered visiting North Korea in 2000, near the end of his second term as president.
