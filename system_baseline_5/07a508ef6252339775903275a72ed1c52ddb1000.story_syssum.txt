Colligan claims Jobs called him in August of 2007 — roughly two months after the public launch of the iPhone — to propose "an agreement" wherein Palm and Apple would not hire employees away from each other.
Colligan went on to point out that Palm recruits employees based on talent, not because Palm wants to hurt other companies.
"This is not satisfactory to Apple," Jobs wrote.
Other companies involved in the lawsuit — including Apple, Adobe, Google, Intel, Intuit, and Pixar — had indeed begun to agree not to cold call each other's employees at that time.
