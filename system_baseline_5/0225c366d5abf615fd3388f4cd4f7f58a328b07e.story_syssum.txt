After hearing his verdict Nicolaides said: "I wish my family the best."
"I think there are individuals who have exploited an obscure law for their own self-interest," he said.
"There are cases in the past where this law has been abused for political purposes, and I agree this has to stop," he said.
Other cases are pending against both foreigners and Thais.
