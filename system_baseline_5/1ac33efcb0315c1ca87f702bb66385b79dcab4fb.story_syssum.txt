New York (CNN) -- Many times I've watched in dismay as crowds of Moammar Gadhafi supporters gathered to wave flags in front of Libya's former dictator -- in particular, two years ago, when the convicted murderer Abdul Al Megrahi returned to his home country under the guise of near-death, to be welcomed as a hero, banners waving, Gadhafi embracing the man who helped him kill my brother.
Today, as I look at the images streaming from halfway around the world, my heart is deeply moved by what I see on the faces of a liberated people.
I have had countless e-mails and phone calls today, asking me if I'm happy, and if I feel that my brother can finally rest in peace.
In the 23 years since I lost my brother I have fought (alongside my parents) for this day.
Today, as ever, it has also been about justice for the 6.5 million Libyans, who no longer need to be paid to look happy when the world's cameras point their way.
