Novato, California (CNN) -- When health care reform passed Congress more than two years ago, Julie Walters yelled for her husband to come into the living room where she was watching the vote live on television.
Without health care reform, she would have gotten kicked off her parents' insurance, perhaps as early as her 5th birthday, because her care is so expensive.
This week, the Supreme Court is hearing a debate on health care reform.
It was to be the first of hundreds of seizures -- sometimes thirty in one day.
Before health care reform, there was a $5 million lifetime limit on Violet's insurance policy.
Health care reform made lifetime limits illegal -- which is why Violet's family breathed easier when it passed -- but now her parents are worried the Supreme Court could restore the limits and Violet would lose her insurance.
After health care reform passed, Walters and McManus felt more secure about Violet's future and decided to have another child.
Violet's parents know not everyone shares their enthusiasm about health care reform.
