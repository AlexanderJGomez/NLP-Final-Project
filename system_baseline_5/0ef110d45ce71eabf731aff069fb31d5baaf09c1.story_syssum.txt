(CNN) -- Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso fears Formula One is in danger of becoming a "lottery" and says it could lose its credibility.
We cannot lose that the best teams, the best drivers, the best strategies win the races, because at the moment from the outside it seems that in every race anyone can win.
"We were not happy with the car at the beginning of the season.
Formula One is dominated by aerodynamics and we had some areas of the car that were not working exactly as they were designed, so we did some tweaks there," he said.
But as I said it's not enough, we know that and we will keep doing upgrades to the car."
"But he has the talent, he has full support from our bosses, from me, from everybody in the team and we know the talent from Felipe.
Every year in Ferrari it is like this," Alonso said.
"Things are complex and not straightforward and I think it will be quite tight for the championship," said Alonso, who is 25 points ahead of Raikkonen, back on the grid this year with Lotus after a two-year absence.
I don't know if we will be champions but we will fight until the last race, I am sure."
