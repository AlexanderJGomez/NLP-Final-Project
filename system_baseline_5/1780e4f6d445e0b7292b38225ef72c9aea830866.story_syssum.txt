We at Greenpeace, along with the activist group Yes Men, are behind the Shell Oil website ArcticReady.com, which we created to call attention to the company's Arctic destruction.
But we revealed our role just hours after the site went up, and the site is so over-the-top -- it has a kids' game called "Angry Bergs" -- that people realize very quickly that it is fake.
In the Arctic, the oil giant is exploiting melting sea ice to drill for more of the oil causing global warming in the first place.
Shell has been relentlessly conducting its own PR campaign to distort the truth about what the company is doing in the Arctic.
This reaction from the public shows Shell has serious problems in the court of public opinion, and that it ignores Arctic defenders at its peril.
And when people realize it's a parody, they like it even more.
People clearly want an opportunity to tell Shell what they think of the company's Arctic drilling program, and our site has provided them with a voice.
But Shell and its sympathizers would like people to talk about Greenpeace and the Yes Men rather than what the company is doing in the Arctic.
Let's go.
