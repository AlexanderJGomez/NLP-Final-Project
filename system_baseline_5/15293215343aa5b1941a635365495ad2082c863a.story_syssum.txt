(CNN) -- People were "thrown to the roof as if they were dolls" and some feared for their lives when a Continental Airlines flight ran into turbulence, shaken passengers said.
I caught my phone in my lap," passenger Richard Sharp told the Houston Chronicle.
That's when the plane really fell," Fabio Ottolini of Houston, who with his wife and daughter was returning from a visit with family in Brazil, told affiliate KTRK-TV in Houston.
He couldn't see because the cabin lights had gone out and "it was pitch black outside," Frederick Bright told the Houston Chronicle.
Several people hit the ceiling hard, witnesses said.
"People that weren't seatbelted in flew up and hit the ceiling, so their heads and their faces hit the plastics all up at the top," John Norwood of Houston told WSVN-TV.
Deanna Buckley of Houston hit the ceiling but wasn't hurt.
"It seemed like the back of the plane got it the worst, though, probably because there's more people in the back and a lot of people didn't have their seat belts on," Sharp told the Chronicle.
"I thought the plane was falling, just like a big earthquake, but in the air," he said.
Continental flew remaining passengers to Houston later Monday.
