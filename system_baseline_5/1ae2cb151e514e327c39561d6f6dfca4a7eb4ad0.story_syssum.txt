"The allegation so far with this phone hacking scandal includes a component where someone within News Corp.'s organization perhaps made payments to London police officers to perhaps obtain information that would thus allow News of the World to write newspapers and sell newspapers," said Mike Koehler, a professor of business law at Butler University in Indianapolis, Indiana.
The potential implications for the Murdoch media empire are numerous and none of them are good, Koehler said.
The act stipulates that U.S.-listed companies, their employees or agents may not make bribes to foreign officials.
And if Rupert Murdoch -- the 80-year-old Australian-born head of News Corp. who became a U.S. citizen in 1985 -- knew what was going on and authorized it -- even implicitly -- "he could have some potential exposure," Zarin said.
"The SEC has brought cases against U.S. companies who had no knowledge of what foreign subsidiaries were doing, but had misbooked it," he said, adding that the SEC blamed the companies for not having set up the internal controls that would have caught the illegal behavior.
But a criminal prosecution by DOJ would be the most to fear, since it would carry the potential of jail time, he said.
The DOJ can impose a criminal fine on individuals of up to $100,000 and five years in prison for each count on a bribery charge, he said.
"If the Department of Justice were satisfied that the U.K. had sufficient ability to prosecute this, then they may step aside," Tillen said.
"Of the 10 largest fines in FCPA history, eight have been against foreign companies," Tillen said.
"I plan to introduce a bill that would reform the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and bring it up-to-date with the changing world," Sensenbrenner said in the statement.
Foreign law enforcement officers are clearly foreign officials and it is absolutely absurd to imply that any changes to the FCPA would change that status or permit U.S. businesses to bribe policemen," he added.
