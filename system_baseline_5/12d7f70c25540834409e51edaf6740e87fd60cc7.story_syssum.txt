His plans will hammer them with a new tax hike of up to $2,000."
Romney wants to cut today's income-tax rates, which date back to the Bush administration's tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, by 20% and eliminate the alternative minimum tax on high earners.
If a Romney administration got rid of tax breaks like deductions for mortgage interest, health insurance and charitable contributions for top earners and cut them only by 42% for households that earn less than $200,000, the lower-income families with children "would pay, on average, $2,000 more in taxes," the group concluded.
The Romney campaign disputed the findings of the study when it was released, arguing that the analysis was flawed because it did not account for Romney's promise to keep the share of taxes paid by top earners the same and that a reduction in the corporate tax rate -- another part of Romney's plan -- would lead to more revenue.
The $2000 "tax hike" figure that Warren cites is grounded in a third-party analysis that Romney has criticized, but one the authors stand by.
