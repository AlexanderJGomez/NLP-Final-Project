London (CNN) -- Barclays bank took out large UK newspaper ads Saturday to say sorry to "all Barclays customers and clients" in the wake of a rate-rigging scandal which has hammered its reputation.
Barclays was fined $450 million by British and American regulators last month after admitted some of its trading desks purposely under-reported its interest rates.
Between 2005 and 2009, when Diamond was in charge of the investment branch of Barclays bank, traders were influencing the pricing of rates which impact up to $800 trillion of securities.
