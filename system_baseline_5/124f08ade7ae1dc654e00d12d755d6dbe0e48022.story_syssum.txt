"We think (Titanfall) can very much be a game-defining moment for Xbox One as a platform because of how much it has lit up the imagination of gamers everywhere and how it takes advantage of the unique features of Xbox One," said Microsoft Xbox Chief Marketing and Strategy Officer Yusuf Mehdi.
Some of the creators of "Titanfall" have a pretty good idea what it is like to have that kind of pressure on a game.
Asked if the expectations were too great for "Titanfall," he said with a laugh, "If I say yes, it makes me look like I don't have confidence in the game.
Zampella said "Titanfall" couldn't have existed without the increased gaming power and features of the Xbox One console.
Microsoft's Mehdi said game developers were able to store a lot of the computing that "Titanfall" uses directly onto Microsoft servers.
"It really is about that balance of gameplay where sometimes you are in a titan, sometimes you're not.
"We have had a tradition of a big, multiplayer, epic game that defines each one of our console generations," Mehdi said.
"Whether it was the original Xbox with 'Halo,' there has always been a great game to define the generation.
