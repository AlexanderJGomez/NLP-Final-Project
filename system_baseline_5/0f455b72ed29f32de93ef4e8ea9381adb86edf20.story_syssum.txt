Can you tell me what Joe Cotton did?
Each of them won the Kentucky Derby horse race.
Bet you don't know Burgoo King.
In 1932, when a lot of people were depressed with a capital D, a lot of them were impressed by Burgoo King when he won the Kentucky Derby by three lengths and then the Preakness by a head.
He was "scratched," as they say at the track, just as I'll Have Another was turned into I've Had Enough by his keepers on the eve of today's scheduled Belmont race.
Would you like to know why?
In 1958, when folks were giving thought to buying one of Ford's really cool new cars, the Edsel, a lot of them were impressed by Tim Tam when he took the Kentucky Derby with a tremendous stretch run, then ran first in the Preakness, as well.
Bet you don't know Canonero II.
That was him.
And why were we all there?
Silver Charm was going to do it in 1997, but he ran out of steam in the Belmont at the wire.
He could run Secretariat-style and leave everyone else gagging on his dust, as he showed at the Preakness while winning by more than 11 lengths.
"Nobody else," I said.
"Birdstone," I said.
Smarty Jones ran second that day.
I would see no Triple Crown won that day.
Horse racing.
But you know what?
