Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Reeva Steenkamp told Oscar Pistorius she was afraid of him and his temper less than three weeks before he shot and killed her, the judge in his murder trial was told Monday.
But there were several that accused Pistorius of jealousy and possessiveness.
Moller's testimony came after a neighbor of Pistorius said on the witness stand that she heard "terrified, terrified screaming" the morning the Olympian killed his girlfriend.
The trial was originally scheduled to last until March 20 but will now continue until the middle of May, the South African court hearing the case said Sunday.
The trial began March 3.
In South Africa, premeditated murder carries a mandatory life sentence with a minimum of 25 years.
