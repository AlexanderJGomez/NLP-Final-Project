(CNN) -- Millions of American parents spend countless hours trying to figure out how to help their children get better grades, better teachers or better schools.
For some, education in Finland is utopia: a dreamland where teaching is the most desired profession, authorities trust schools and political parties agree on the direction of educational reforms.
According to the most recent data provided by the OECD the average teaching load of junior high school teachers in Finland is about half what it is in the United States.
Schooldays are also shorter in Finland than in the United States, and primary schools keep the homework load to a minimum so students have time for their own hobbies and friends when school is over.
But even if this were true, it would not explain why in Finland students learn better in their schools than in most other places in the world.
Frequent turnover of teachers in thousands of American schools undermines the entire education system.
One affordable and smart step would be to terminate policies and practices that prevent American teachers from teaching what matters most to their students.
When poverty explains up to half of student achievement, schools must have measures to better cope with the harmful consequences that disadvantaged family backgrounds have on teaching and learning in many schools.
