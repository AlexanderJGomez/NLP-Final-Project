Manchester United defender Evra accused his Liverpool opponent of racially abusing him during Saturday's 1-1 Premier League draw, and the English Football Association said it would investigate after match referee Andre Marriner reported the incident.
Obviously Patrice feels very aggrieved at what was said to him.
Both sets of fans were good," Ferguson said.
United midfielder Ashley Young was racially abused by Bulgaria fans during England's Euro 2012 qualifier in Sofia in September, but Ferguson said there are no such problems in the Premier League.
Ferguson said Evra would be in contention to play in Romania, with last season's Champions League finalists United seeking to kickstart a faltering European campaign after picking up just two points from two Group C matches.
None of us did," Ferguson said.
Nine-time European champions Real Madrid will seek a third successive Group D victory at home to French side Lyon in the clubs' ninth meeting in six years.
