My first game was in 1961 when Burnley were reigning league champions.
Tony [Blair] and Gordon [Brown] both follow football pretty closely so I think they understood it.
Bertie Ahern [Taoiseach of Ireland at the time] was a big Manchester United fan and he had tickets for a game the next day.
We had to win a game against Leyton Orient in 1987 to stay in the Football League.
Our wage bill is the smallest in the league by a mile, we've got a small stadium, we've got the smallest squad and we're the smallest town that has ever produced a Premier League football club, so with all that it's quite an uphill battle to stay up but I think we will, and by playing good football.
It was proving impossible to beat Leeds and we absolutely hammered them.
The Orient game, obviously, was the most emotional for every Burnley fan.
