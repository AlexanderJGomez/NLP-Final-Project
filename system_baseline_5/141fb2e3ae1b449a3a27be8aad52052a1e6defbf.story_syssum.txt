(CNN) -- South Carolina social workers were familiar with Timothy Jones Jr. long before police accused him of killing his five children and dumping them off a dirt road in Alabama, according to documents from the state Department of Social Services.
Jones and the children were listed as missing persons last week after Jones failed to drop off the children with his ex-wife.
The mother, who was pregnant, said that the children were 3, 4 and 5 and too young to start school, but that when they were of age, they would be home-schooled, the report says.
The caseworker told Jones the home wasn't safe for the kids, and Jones took them to a hotel, it said.
Four months ago, a South Carolina DSS case manager spoke to one of the children, who said Jones made them do exercises for punishment.
Jones admitted to the case manager that he had spanked his son, and the case manager told Jones to refrain from physical discipline.
Jones said his ex-wife had left him for a younger man and she hadn't seen her kids in four months, the report says.
It's unclear how or why Jones allegedly killed his children, but acting Sheriff Lewis McCarty of Lexington County told reporters that Jones drove for several days with their decomposing bodies in the back of his SUV.
It is believed he killed all the children at the same time, and that the crime happened in Lexington County, McCarty said.
"I'm a father and I'm a grandfather, and in all of my years of law enforcement, I have never seen a case like this," McCarty said.
"We do not have all the answers and we may never have all of them, but anyone who knows little Tim will agree that he is not the animal that he will be portrayed through the media."
