Zenani Mandela, 13, was buried in a private ceremony earlier in the day, Mandela's office said, after she was killed in a car crash June 11.
Zenani was returning from the World Cup soccer tournament's kickoff concert when she was killed.
No other vehicle was involved in the wreck, the foundation said.
Zenani was one of Mandela's nine great-grandchildren.
