You eat too much sugar.
We're talking about added sugar here, the sugar in processed and manufactured foods -- sugary drinks, sodas and juices, cakes and cookies, candy, processed cereals, salad dressings and breads.
Most adults in the study, which looked at average adult sugar consumption between 2005 and 2010, ate or drank more than 10% of their total calories in added sugar.
According to this recommendation you would have exceeded your sugar allotment by noon.
As a doctor, I see the consequences of excessive sugar intake every day.
In the study, those who consumed approximately 17% to 21% of calories from added sugar had a 38% higher risk of cardiovascular disease mortality  -- that means death because of heart or blood vessel failure -- than those who consumed approximately 8% of calories from added sugar.
Real life is another.
Look at the labels on that bottle of green tea or so-called energy bar, there is likely sugar there, too.
Look for yourself to see how much sugar is in the foods that you are eating.
