(CNN)A few days ago, when British journalist Charlene White posted on Twitter an apparently unretouched photo of supermodel Cindy Crawford, she launched a firestorm of debate over what women's bodies should look like as they get older.
But the photo was not, it turns out, from Marie Claire, as White acknowledged.
White said to CNN, "I want people to feel like magazines aren't responsible for their happiness when it comes to their bodies, but magazines also have a responsibility to show us an array of images.
In releasing the image, White made an example of one woman's body to satisfy a personal agenda -- that magazines should show more "realistic" images of women.
One of the most recognizable female icons grows old and ages just like the rest of us!
We don't like Crawford's image because it's "real."
We're also not cheering Crawford's bravery in showing the world what even the most genetically blessed 50-year-old women look like, since the photo was very likely shared without her permission.
