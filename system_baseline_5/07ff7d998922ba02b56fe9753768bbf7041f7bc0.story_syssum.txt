"I looked and the helicopter was almost immediately pitched sideways and off balance," construction worker Bo Bain told CNN affiliate KING.
The two people aboard the helicopter died in the crash, and another person who'd been in one of the three vehicles that caught fire was critically burned, officials said.
The helicopter had just come from Covington, Washington, and was planning to head next to Renton, said Dennis Hogenson with the National Transportation Safety Board, which is leading the investigation.
Video showed what was left of the helicopter immersed in flames, as well as a line of fire in the street that engulfed several vehicles.
One man emerged from a car that was ablaze, with "his shirt ... in flames, his head ... bleeding," Gonzales said.
Still, while it could have been worse, the crash had a devastating effect -- especially among those who knew the victims.

Ten tons of sand were dumped on the street to absorb the helicopter's fuel, with vacuum trucks later heading to clean up the site, said the mayor.
"What we have left is basically just a part of the tail and burnt-out metal from the main chassis of the helicopter," Moore said.
"We mourn their loss and suffering and our thoughts and prayers are with them," he said.
