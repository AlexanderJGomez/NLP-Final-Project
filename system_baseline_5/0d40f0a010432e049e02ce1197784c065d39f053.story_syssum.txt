(CNN) -- It's a cliche.
Such has not been the case so far with Evan Ebel, 28, the man suspected of killing Colorado prison chief Tom Clements last week.
"From the beginning, his son just seemed to have this bad streak, a streak of cruelty, and anger," Colorado Gov.
He was the son of Jody Mangue and Jack Ebel, an attorney and former oil executive.
One in particular he beat up with a broomstick," said Kurt Frey, who put Ebel's age at the camp somewhere between 15 and 17.
Authorities have said the bullets that killed Clements came from a gun that was found with Ebel, who had handwritten directions to the prison chief's house in his car.
According to Frey, Ebel's behavior, even as a teenager, suggested he was interested in white supremacy.
Mangue and Ebel's father kept in close contact, sending letters, cards and visiting their son when they could.
The family kept her for 15 years.
Ebel was released from prison in January, after serving seven years -- three for felony menacing, robbery and assault, another four for assaulting a guard.
That time was hard for Ebel, Frey said, and it may have made things worse.
He never liked being told what to do and his time in isolation really only compacted that," Frey said.
