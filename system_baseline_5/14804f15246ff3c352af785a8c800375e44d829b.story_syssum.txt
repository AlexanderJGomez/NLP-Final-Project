PARIS, France (CNN) -- Debris from Air France 447, which crashed en route from Brazil to France last month, killing 228 people, has arrived in France, the French air accident investigation agency BEA said Wednesday.
The search for the data and voice recorders from the plane entered a second phase last week, according to France's accident investigation agency.
On July 10, two U.S. naval vessels and the French Navy submarine called off their search for the recorders, which investigators hope will shed light on exactly how and why the plane crashed.
"We want to stress that for the sake of the families, we hope that the search for the black boxes will be successful," an Air France representative told CNN.
"It is as if it fell in the Andes (mountains)," Olivier Ferrante, chief of the BEA search mission said.
