The video sparked protests worldwide, starting in Egypt and Libya, and then spreading to other countries.
As things become clearer, it seems that the video was created and promoted by members of the American Coptic Christian community -- a community with its roots in Egypt.
It also said that the video does not in any way represent the view of the Coptic community.
Sadek's personal actions have nothing to do with the Coptic Church or the Coptic-American community.
It is a mark of Christian value for the Coptic Church to condemn the video and its filmmakers.
The violent actions of a comparatively small number of individuals do not represent all Muslims, just as the video does not represent the views of all Coptic Christians.
It provided an ideological base for Anders Breivik, recently convicted of mass murder in Norway.
The least we can do now is to make sure not to blame the wrong people for the vile actions of a few individuals.
Hellyer.
