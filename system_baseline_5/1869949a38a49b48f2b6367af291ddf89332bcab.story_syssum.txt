(CNN) -- Mexico's military has notched an important success for President Felipe Calderon with the arrest of Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sanchez, the reputed boss of the powerful Gulf drug cartel.
Costilla is said to head a criminal group considered the third-most powerful in Mexico.
In that incident, according to the U.S. State Department, Costilla and other suspected Gulf Cartel leaders allegedly stopped federal agents and pointed AK-47 rifles at them.
Costilla assumed a top role after the arrest of former Gulf Cartel boss Osiel Cardenas Guillen and became the top leader after a rift with Cardenas' relatives in the organization, authorities have said.
Costilla's arrest was the result of "intense intelligence" work by the Navy, and information gleaned from Mario Cardenas' arrest, Vergara said.
But Grayson said internal divisions within the Zetas will prevent them from turning the heat up on the Gulf cartel, and that the Sinaloa cartel will be the trafficking group most likely to strengthen its position.
But the arrest of Costilla was a "Mexican operation," said the U.S. drug agency's spokesman, Rusty Payne.
