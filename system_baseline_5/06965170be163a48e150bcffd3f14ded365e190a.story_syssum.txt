Washington (CNN) -- Abdullah al-Kidd -- a U.S. citizen -- was held in jail by the U.S. government for 16 days as a "material witness" in an ongoing terror investigation.
American Civil Liberties Union lawyers representing al-Kidd say the government has warped the law to allow open-ended arrests and confinement of citizens, without being later held accountable for those wrongfully held.
An affidavit submitted to a federal magistrate said al-Kidd had a one-way first class plane ticket, and that he was "crucial" to the prosecution of Sami Omar al-Hussayen.
In his lawsuit, al-Kidd says he was held in three prisons in Virginia, Oklahoma, and Idaho, under high security with convicted criminals.
Al-Kidd later sued corrections officials; that suit was settled out of court.
A federal appeals court had allowed his civil lawsuit to continue, but Ashcroft argues officials under his supervision obeyed the letter and spirit of the material witness law.
"We are talking about the attorney general and the attorney general's immunity," she told the Justice Department lawyer arguing the case.
Justice Elena Kagan is not participating in the case because she helped brief the case for the government last year as solicitor general, just before joining the high court.
Ashcroft has the support of the Obama administration, which argued the case in the high court, as well as several former attorneys general.
But about 30 former federal prosecutors are backing al-Kidd.
The case is Ashcroft v. al-Kidd (10-98).
