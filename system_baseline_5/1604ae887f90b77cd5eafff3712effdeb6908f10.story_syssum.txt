Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda (CNN) -- The forest was in charge.
I grit my teeth knowing the forest was forcing me to want the prize it hid in its shape-shifting bosom.
Three sweltering hours that drew blood and inflicted bruises, yet I pushed on, realizing the forest would not give me something for nothing.
I could almost hear its heaving chuckles as I disentangled myself from ropes of thorns.
Protected by a hardcore ring of black backs, a mother nursed a three-week-old gorilla.
It was a rare and moving sight.
