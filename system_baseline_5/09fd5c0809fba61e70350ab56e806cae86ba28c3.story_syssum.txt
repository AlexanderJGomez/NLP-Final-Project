Bela Fleck traveled to Africa to immerse himself in banjo-related culture.
CNN caught up with him backstage at the Bonnaroo music festival last month, where he played with African kora player Toumani Diabate, to discuss his film and experience in Africa and what prompted him to go.
I've always wanted to go back to Africa and hear what's going on there and find the instruments that still exist that are the roots of the banjo and play music with them.
Except that just the experience of playing with these musicians made my life a lot richer, made my worldview a lot bigger, and in a lot of cases I learned music that was so new to me that it's affected the way I play music ever since.
I liked being unprepared and being forced to come up with it on the spot.
Fleck: I am so lucky to be performing with Toumani.
Fleck: My reasons for going to Africa were kind of selfish, because I love the banjo, and I really want to play with the musicians.
One of the ways is to show people that there are a lot of great things about Africa.
It's not a political statement, but it does point out what is beautiful about Africans.
