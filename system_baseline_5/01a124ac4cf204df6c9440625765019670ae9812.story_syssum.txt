Under West Virginia law, the state's popular two-term Democratic governor, Joe Manchin, has the power to appoint Byrd's successor.
West Virginia law says that if a Senate vacancy is created within two and a half years of the end of a term, the appointed successor will automatically serve out the remainder of the term.
"The people of West Virginia have lost a true champion, the United States Senate has lost a venerable institution, and America has lost a voice of principle and reason with the passing of Robert C. Byrd.
He scaled the summit of power, but his mind never strayed from the people of his beloved West Virginia.
"It has been my greatest privilege to serve with Robert C. Byrd in the United States Senate.
Senator Byrd came from humble beginnings in the southern coalfields, was raised by hard-working West Virginians, and triumphantly rose to the heights of power in America.
"Sen. Byrd combined a devotion to the U.S. Constitution with a deep learning of history to defend the interests of his state and the traditions of the Senate.
"No senator came to care more about the Constitution or to be a more effective defender of our constitutional government than the senior senator from West Virginia.
...
There was no one who loved the institution of the Senate more, and no one who was a better student of it."
