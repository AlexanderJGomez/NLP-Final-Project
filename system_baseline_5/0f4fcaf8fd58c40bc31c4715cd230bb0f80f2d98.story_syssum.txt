Mazza was being transported in a medical van because of a medical condition, Lamberti said.
Mazza and Rein left about 8:05 a.m., Lamberti said.
Mazza allegedly took Rein's service weapon away from him and shot him, authorities said.
When the man arrived at the second pawn shop, he left Mazza in the car and went inside, Lamberti said.
Rein's gun was found with Mazza in the man's car, the sheriff said.
Mazza initially was reluctant to talk to authorities, but later agreed, and confessed to shooting Rein, the sheriff said.
Broward County also has a pending case against Mazza -- a February drugstore robbery in Pompano Beach, he said.
Broward County deputies conduct some 400 to 500 inmate court transports a day -- one deputy transporting up to a handful of inmates, Lamberti said.
"It's a routine thing," Lamberti said.
The deputy was memorialized Wednesday on the Web site of the Broward County Sheriff's Office.
