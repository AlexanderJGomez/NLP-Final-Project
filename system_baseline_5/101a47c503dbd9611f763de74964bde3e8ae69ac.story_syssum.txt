Israeli fighter jets struck a Syrian convoy suspected of moving weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon, a senior U.S. official said Wednesday.
State-run media said the attack killed two workers and injured five others.
But the senior U.S. official said American authorities do not believe the strike was linked to growing concerns about chemical weapons.
"We see no nexus," the official said Wednesday.
The United States has provided more than $200 million in humanitarian aid and other funding to the Syrian opposition.
"We want to make sure that not only does it enhance U.S. security, but also that it is doing right by the people of Syria and neighbors like Israel that are going to be profoundly affected by it," Obama told CBS News' "60 Minutes."
