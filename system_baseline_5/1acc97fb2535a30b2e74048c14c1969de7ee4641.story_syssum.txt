WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Former Vice President Dick Cheney said Monday that he does not believe Saddam Hussein was involved in the planning or execution of the September 11, 2001, attacks.
Cheney restated his claim that "there was a relationship between al Qaeda and Iraq that stretched back 10 years.
The evidence is overwhelming," Cheney said at the time.
Tenet "testified, if you go back and check the record, in the fall of [2002] before the Senate Intelligence Committee -- in open session -- that there was a relationship," Cheney said.

Cheney said Monday that the memos previously released also were the subject of ongoing lawsuits.
On May 21, Cheney gave a full-throated defense of the Bush administration's enhanced interrogations of al Qaeda prisoners during an appearance at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.
