For the first time in a week, there were no explosions, bullets or bombs coming from the Syrian side of the border.
Fighting first erupted in the area on November 8, when Syrian rebels mounted an assault on Syrian government forces in the neighboring Syrian town of Ras Al Ain.
They raised the opposition flag triumphantly over Ras Al Ain, despite the fact that their offensive had sent thousands of terrified residents streaming across the border to Turkey for safety.
"We will respond to Syrian planes or helicopters that violate our borders," said Ismet Yilmaz.
Whether or not Damascus heeded Ankara's warning is not clear.
These frightened Syrians said Ras Al Ain had been a safe haven until last week's rebel attack.
"We are angry at both of them (the rebels and the government), because the rebels entered Ras Al Ain and because the regime bombed us with its aircraft," Mohammed said.
Roughly half of Ras Al Ain's population is said to be Kurdish.
Speaking by phone from the Kurdish-controlled Syrian town of Qoubani, Aloush said his Kurdish faction would not use force to push Syrian rebel groups out of Ras Al Ain.
"All Syrians have to sacrifice, even the Kurds, because they are part of the Syrian people."
But Turkey has failed to deter the Syrian military from carrying out operations within sight of the Turkish border.
