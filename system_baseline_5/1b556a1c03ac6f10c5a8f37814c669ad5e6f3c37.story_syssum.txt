Galligan, the former Army lawyer who has been the lead attorney for Hasan since nearly the beginning of the case, was not present at Hasan's arraignment Wednesday at Fort Hood.
Galligan had fought the Department of Defense for months to make sure his client gets a fair trial.
Gen. Donald Campbell ordered that Hasan face general court-martial, he also ruled that Hasan would face possible execution if found guilty.
Galligan also said he and his family have been vilified for defending Hasan.
Hasan did not have the option of pleading guilty.
Hasan appeared in court in standard-issue Army camouflage fatigues.
For example, it took a lot of time just to get a blanket to keep Hasan warm during hearings in the well-air-conditioned courtroom.
He took it off during the hearing and put it back on just before wheeling himself out of the courtroom.
