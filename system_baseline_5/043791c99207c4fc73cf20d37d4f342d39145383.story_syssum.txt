Howard, who premiered the follow-up in Rome, Italy, this week, said there was "residual antagonism from 'The Da Vinci Code,' " but Vatican officials ignored the movie by not responding to suggestions that the church was offended.

"I think there's some residual antagonism from 'The Da Vinci Code,' " Howard said.

"One thing that was important to me and to all of us was to be as authentic as we possibly could be about what Conclave was like, that period when they're trying to elect the pope," Howard said.
"There are so many reasons to do it, and when I really looked at 'Angels & Demons' and realized that it was going to feel different," he said.
