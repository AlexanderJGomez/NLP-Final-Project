(CNN) -- Luis Suarez leading Uruguay to a late victory over England grabbed headlines on the eighth day of World Cup group play, but before that match began another team had an arguably more important victory.
All four teams won their first match.
Each team won their first match and has three points, so a draw will mean each has four and a victory for either side will give them six.
If they draw, they get one point each and would only go through if either France or Switzerland win tonight, and the winner of the Ecuador-Honduras match also wins big in their last match of the group.
