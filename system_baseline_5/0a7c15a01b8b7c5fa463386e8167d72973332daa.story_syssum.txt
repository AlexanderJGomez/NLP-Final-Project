Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Doctors completed an autopsy of Moammar Gadhafi on Sunday, with the chief pathologist confirming the former Libyan leader died of a gunshot wound to the head.
The autopsy report will go to the attorney general's office before it is released to the public, he said.
Leaders of Libya's interim government have said Gadhafi was killed in crossfire after fighters captured him Thursday.
An amateur video distributed by the Reuters news agency Sunday showed NTC fighters congratulating a man the fighters say killed Gadhafi.
Mahmoud Jibril, chairman of the NTC's executive board, has said Gadhafi's right arm was wounded when a gunbattle erupted between the fighters and Gadhafi loyalists as his captors attempted to load him into a vehicle.
The United Nations human rights office and activist groups like Amnesty and Human Rights Watch have called for a probe into Gadhafi's death.
"We believe there is a need for an investigation and more details are needed to ascertain whether he was killed in the fighting or after his capture.
