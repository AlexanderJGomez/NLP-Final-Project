Video from the patrol car of North Charleston's Michael Slager shows an initial traffic stop and early interactions between the officer and Scott.
Scott exits his vehicle, briefly, and Slager tells him to stay in the car.
Scott family attorney Chris Stewart told CNN the man with Scott was a co-worker and friend.
Many questions remain about what happened on Saturday when Officer Slager pulled Scott over for what police have said was a broken taillight.
In the police report that CNN obtained, a responding officer said that Slager said that at one point he started to chase Scott down a street.
He had control of Scott," Santana said.
She saw Scott and Slager at the entrance to a vacant lot.
Feidin showed the video to the Scott family.
The video shows Slager shooting eight times at Scott as Scott runs away.
It's unknown whether Scott took the officer's Taser or whether the officer picked the object up and moved it closer to the body.
Scott, who was unarmed, was black.
"He has his family, and Mr. Scott also has his family," he told Holt.
"I have watched the video, and I was sickened by what I saw," North Charleston police Chief Eddie Driggers told reporters Wednesday.
Summey said that the city has ordered an additional 150 body cameras "so every officer on the street" in the city will have one.
"We can't get into the brain of another individual, so we can't state that," Scott family attorney Stewart said.
"There was not a struggle for the Taser," Anthony Scott said.
"I think my brother was thinking he was not going to be shot, no one would have thought that," Scott said.
