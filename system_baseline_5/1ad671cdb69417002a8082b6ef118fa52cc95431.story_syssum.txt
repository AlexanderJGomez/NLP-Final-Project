Jerusalem (CNN) -- The Israeli government's press division is apologizing for circulating a link to a video that mocks activists aboard a ship headed to Gaza earlier this week that was blocked by an Israeli raid.
A number of other people were wounded.
Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev dismissed the the video link, saying, "The GPO sends out lots of articles.
Regev said he first noticed the video on the New York Times website.
It was not the first time the Israeli GPO stirred controversy with its public communications on the Gaza flotilla.
In an interview with the Jerusalem Post, GPO director Danny Seaman defended the communication, arguing that foreign media coverage of Gaza was not balanced.
