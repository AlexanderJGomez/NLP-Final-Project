If someone had told me 50 years ago that I would be the marshal of the New York City Gay Pride Parade in 2013 at the age of 84, I never would have believed it.
When Thea died in 2009 from a heart condition two years after we were finally married, I was heartbroken.
At a time when the gay organizations that I approached responded with, "It's the wrong time for the movement," Robbie Kaplan said -- as did the Rev.
Robbie argued my case in the Supreme Court on March 27 this year.
And those same children who happen to be gay will be free to love and get married -- as Thea and I did -- but with the same federal benefits, protections and dignity as everyone else.
If I had to survive Thea, what a glorious way to do it.
