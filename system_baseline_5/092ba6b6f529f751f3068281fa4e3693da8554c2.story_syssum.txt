Police look on as one of the nine bodies found in a common grave near Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, is removed.
Extreme violence among warring drug cartels and the Mexican government has long plagued Juarez and the state of Chihuahua, but the situation has been getting worse.
Enrique Torres, spokesman for the Chihuahua Joint Operation, said by Sunday there will be 7,500 military personnel, 2,300 federal police and 1,600 city police working together to patrol the city and aggressively fight the cartels.
Torres said the city has been preparing for a year to "clean up the local police."
To prevent corruption among the just arrived soldiers, Torres said they will be frequently rotated.
Ferriz said that during a recent raid, local police confiscated two .50-caliber military-style rifles.
Ferriz siad he plans to travel next week to Washington to meet with U.S. lawmakers about the security situation in and around Juarez.
