DC Comics pulled the cover for the upcoming "Batgirl" #41, which portrays the Joker threatening a frightened Batgirl with a gun, with "Joker makeup" on her mouth.
The cover recalls Barbara "Batgirl" Gordon's encounter with the Joker in the classic story "The Killing Joke."
Albuquerque said in his own statement, "My Batgirl variant cover artwork was designed to pay homage to a comic that I really admire, and I know is a favorite of many readers.
For that reason, I have recommended to DC that the variant cover be pulled.
The cover was not seen or approved by anyone on Team Batgirl and was completely at odds with what we are doing with the comic.
1 variant cover caused an uproar for being "over-sexualized."
