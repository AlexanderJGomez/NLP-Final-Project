Afghan security forces must be fully trained to take over for U.S. troops.
"How this war winds down is very important to Afghanistan, to the United States and so many other countries," said CNN's Erin Burnett, who has been in Afghanistan this week talking to U.S. officials, troops and Afghan civilians.
Erin Burnett: Panetta points out the success in bringing down key members of core al Qaeda, and he believes he has made real progress on fighting al Qaeda and terrorism in Afghanistan.

Some of it's going to come down to the treatment of U.S. troops' indemnity, which Panetta told me he's sure won't be a problem but the deputy foreign minister here in Afghanistan said was a serious issue that is on the table.
The deputy foreign minister I talked to said, "Look that's not really fair, we're trying to train brigades on one thing at a time."
And he really was loyal to them.
Some people we've spoken to here sort of take it for granted that there's going to be a civil war when the United States leaves.
One female member of parliament I talked to, she wasn't totally in that camp, but she was extremely afraid of it, saying: "I hope that it won't and I have to have confidence that we're going to be able to overcome it.
Burnett: During the Taliban, basically there were thousands of girls going to school in Afghanistan.
There are women's rights activists who are really afraid that when the U.S. leaves, a lot of the progress will be rolled back.
They really want to stay in their country, and they say, in their own experience, that there's been such a change in what girls can do.
