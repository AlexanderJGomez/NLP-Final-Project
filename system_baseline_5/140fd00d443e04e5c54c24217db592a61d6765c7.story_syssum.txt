Dante de Blasio, the son of New York City mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, is a typical nerdy, smart, shy 16-year-old Brooklyn boy.
But it's mostly not because of his anti-Bloomberg or I'm-for-the-small-man messages (although that matters).
To some black voters, Dante's afro reflected that this boy and by association his father, respected the civil rights struggle, since the afro is considered an icon for black pride and progress.
But while Dante's afro is being celebrated, in a different part of America last week a little girl in Tulsa, Oklahoma, was reprimanded because her hairstyle violated the policy of her charter school.
Parker's parents pulled her out of the charter school and placed her in a new school where hopefully she can lead a hair hassle-free childhood.
Let's hope that one day, hairstyles from the black community will no longer trigger powerful emotions or suspicions.
