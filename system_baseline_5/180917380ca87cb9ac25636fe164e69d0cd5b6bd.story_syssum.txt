(CNN) -- Nine Peruvian miners emerged into the daylight Wednesday morning after six days trapped in a collapsed mine.
Peruvian President Ollanta Humala greeted the miners at the mouth of the mine.
Humala's government has made a push for illegal mines and miners in Peru to be formalized and regulated so that risks decrease.
The ordeal stirred memories of a 2010 Chilean mine collapse in which 33 men were trapped underground for 69 days.
