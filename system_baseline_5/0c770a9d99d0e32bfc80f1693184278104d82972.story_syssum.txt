Sony Pictures Television, the studio behind the original series, is said to be shopping a pitch for a spinoff series centered on David Faustino's girl-crazy Bud Bundy.
It also isn't known if any other characters from the original series would be part of the spinoff, or if any of the original cast members are attached.
Ed O'Neill is one of the stars of the Emmy-winning "Modern Family," which begins its sixth season September 24.
And last month, TV Guide reported that a "Full House" reboot is in the works with some of the original actors reprising their roles.
