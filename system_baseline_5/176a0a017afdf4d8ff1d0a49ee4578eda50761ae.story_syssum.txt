An iPhone app called BeautyMeter was pulled from the app store after a nude photo surfaced.
"Apple will not distribute applications that contain inappropriate content, such as pornography," an Apple company spokesman said at the time.
But Apple, like any company or Web site that hosts user-submitted content, may be engaged an impossible task by trying to keep all offensive material from the app store.
It would be impossible for Apple or developers to keep all potentially objectionable material out of the app store, since much of the content is submitted by users, he said.
The mysterious approval process frustrates app developers and could lead some to turn away from Apple and move on to other phones, said Jared Brown, an app developer.
In some cases, applications have been banned from the iPhone app store for showcasing material that also would be easily accessible through iTunes or by using Apple's mobile Web browser.
Apple has said it approves 96 percent of submitted iPhone apps.
In a recent update to the iPhone software, Apple included controls that let users choose which types of content they would like to block from their phones.
"I think they've really cultivated that."
