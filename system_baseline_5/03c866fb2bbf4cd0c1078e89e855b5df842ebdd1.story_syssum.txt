"He was just everything," said T.J. Jackson, who shares guardianship of Michael Jackson's children -- Prince, Paris and Blanket -- with their grandmother.
"Do you believe your uncle was murdered?"
T.J. Jackson had earlier testified that his mother, Delores Jackson, was the victim of murder 19 years ago.
He said he was at a loss for words to describe what Paris is going through.
Blanket, who was 7 when his father died, "was always wrapped around his leg, very shy," T.J. Jackson said.
Prince said he has "a hard time sleeping" since his father's death in 2009.
As a guardian, T.J. Jackson said he must constantly deal with paparazzi stalking the children for photographs.
"It's, just to be frank, a complete annoyance," he said.
