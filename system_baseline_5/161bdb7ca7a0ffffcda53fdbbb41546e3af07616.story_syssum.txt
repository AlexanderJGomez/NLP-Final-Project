"If you want to describe Alex in one word, he was just good," says his father, Tom Teves.
In the midst of mourning his first born, Tom Teves has wrested purpose from his grief -- the Alex Teves Challenge, he calls it.
Alex Teves had just completed his master's degree in psychological counseling.
Alex Teves died shielding his girlfriend from the rain of bullets.
"He told me one day, 'I'm not going to do what you do -- because it's business,'" says Teves, an executive for a corporate services firm.
He knew what he wanted to do," the father adds.
He met his girlfriend in graduate school, and Alex planned to marry her once he finished his studies, the mother says.
Alex Teves was a cooperative student with a streak for being fun and funny, says high school math instructor Francoise Dastous, who teaches the statistics class.
Alex once recounted to the class a hiking adventure that went awry, Dastous says.
Alex was an honors student whom other faculty recalled as having a sense of humor, says Anna Battle, principal of the 3,000-student school, one of the largest in Arizona.
"Unfortunately, it sounds like the young man who created this incident (in the Colorado movie theater) had some challenges that Alex may have been able to help," Battle adds.
Alex Teves will not be forgotten.
"That's the kind of kid he was," the father says.
"He didn't look like much," Teves says.
"You make him out to be a madman," he says of the man suspected of killing his son.
Tom and Caren Teves have been married 28 years.
"He was my hero every day," Teves says.
"It's got to end," he says.
He says he will spend his days reminding the media of this challenge in his son's name.
