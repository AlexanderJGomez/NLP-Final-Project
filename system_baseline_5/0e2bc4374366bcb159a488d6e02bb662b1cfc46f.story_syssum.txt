Following in the footsteps of her older brother, Barnes started playing soccer when she was 4 years old, for Coach Walter Stewart.
Stewart started coaching the all-girls team in 1998 with only eight players at the Marian Anderson Recreation Center in South Philadelphia.
The program exists because the girls want to play and we happen to be in a predominately African-American neighborhood."
There are girls who want to play that may not get the opportunity in many parts of the country, and they can play, and they're very good," he said.
"They deal with the challenges of inner-city living for black girls, and soccer isn't that popular socially," said Jafi Barnes, assistant coach.
The Monarchs aren't just about soccer.
The U.S. women's soccer team may have lost to Japan, but it's still inspiring this special team of inner-city girls who play soccer on a dusty field in urban Philly.
"They just want a chance to play," Stewart said.
