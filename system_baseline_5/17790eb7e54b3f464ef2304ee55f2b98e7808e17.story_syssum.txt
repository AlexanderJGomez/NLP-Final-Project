Tacloban, Philippines (CNN) -- For Joseph Pedrero, the thought of another massive tropical storm bearing down on his home in Tacloban is traumatic.
Tragically, only six of his family members were ever found -- and they're now buried close to his modest home.
"The government is now providing better information.
He said one of the biggest problems last year was the sheer volume of people they had to help.
"Many were coming in from outside Tacloban and saying they were from here," he said.
People respect what they're being told.
Like many others people in Tacloban, it took Joseph months to rebuild his home -- and his life -- after such an appalling tragedy.
We fear this typhoon will destroy everything again," he said.
And that is the biggest difference between this year and last.
