Chris Christie blasted Democrat Mary Burke on Monday, saying the Wisconsin gubernatorial hopeful can't be trusted after her campaign hired a political consultant who appeared to plagiarize parts of her job plan from other candidates.
"If you can't trust her honesty and her integrity when she tells you that this is her plan, why would you trust her honesty and integrity on anything else she tells you about what she'll do for Wisconsin or about Scott's record?"
According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Burke said last week that her jobs plan did not violate her principles.
"She is in this for the right reasons," the first lady said at a rally for Burke.
She doesn't care about politics."
