The police offered "a further unreserved apology" for the death of de Menezes in 2005, plus an undisclosed compensation package, the police and the de Menezes family said in a joint statement.
Jurors at a 2008 inquest found that the police who shot de Menezes did not shout a warning before firing at him.
De Menezes was killed July 22, 2005, a day after four failed bombings aboard the London transit system.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission concluded in 2007 that de Menezes was innocent of anything that might have justified police action.
The shooting was one of several issues that led to the resignation last year of Police Commissioner Ian Blair.
