They were here to see "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview," a documentary of sorts that's now playing in a handful of U.S. cities.
"It was the first time in 16 years he touched the tape," Cringely told the audience at Thursday's screening.
After the movie completes its brief run in theaters, "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview" will probably be made available online and on DVD, Cringely said.
"He never sat for another interview like this, and what a shame," Cringely said.
Cringely, then a technology columnist, managed to score a coveted interview with Jobs because NeXT desperately needed the attention and because Cringely and Jobs had a prior relationship.
Jobs predicted the meteoric rise of the Internet, which he said would be especially satisfying because Microsoft doesn't own it.
"People like symbols," Jobs said.
