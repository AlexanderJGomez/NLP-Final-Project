Blair and Estelle Hunt with their wine awards.
"We were amazed," said Blair Hunt.
"I'm really wary about the word retirement," Blair says.
"Just the sheer beauty of the place led us to say right let's give it a go," says Blair Hunt.
Every weekend they'd drive up into the hills from their home in Balclutha, South Otago to tend their vines.
Even then it didn't demand their full attention.
We used to spend a lot more time in the vineyard but as time went by we discovered that there was more and more paperwork to be done."
Renowned New Zealand winemaker Grant Taylor started working with them before the first grapes were picked.
But underneath it all is a shared philosophy, which is to do everything in the vineyard and winemaking to make the best wine possible.
Pinot noir grapes are notoriously difficult to nurture.
The rest of the season, the vines are pruned and tended by hand, the grapes individually picked.
At the end of the day you're talking about long term viability and sustainability rather than short-term gains," Blair says.
