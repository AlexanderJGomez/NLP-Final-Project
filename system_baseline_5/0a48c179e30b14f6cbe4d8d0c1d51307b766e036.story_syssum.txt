SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- The last bit of news I heard before boarding a plane to Seoul a few days ago was that North Korea had just fired 100 artillery shells into the sea near the border with South Korea.
North Korea is a Riddle Kingdom that is simultaneously threatening, bizarre and brutal.
It is those random, capricious, frequently dangerous behaviors that allow fragile, brittle, bankrupt North Korea to force its dazzlingly successful neighbor, South Korea, to maintain a constant state of alert, to wonder if its capital city can survive an attack across a border that lies just 35 miles away.
The news from North Korea can be so disconcerting that spoofs and rumors regularly make it into the news and social media as if they were fact.
And, why not?
No official biography of the current Kim has been released, other than an account that says he was "born in heaven."
The three generations of Kim men who have ruled the North are painted as supernatural to the local population.
By firing missiles, threatening neighbors and acting erratically, North Korea portrays itself as mysterious and volatile, and even that perception magnifies its ability to create fear, adding to its power and helping keep the despotic regime in control.
