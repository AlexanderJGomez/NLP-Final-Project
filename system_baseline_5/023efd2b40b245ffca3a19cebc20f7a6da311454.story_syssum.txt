Washington (CNN) -- A Washington lawyer has filed a lawsuit in federal court, claiming he is the father of basketball star LeBron James.
Stovell said he had sex with James' mother, Gloria James, after meeting at a Washington bar while she was visiting from Ohio in 1984.
Stovell said he filed the suit two weeks ago because a statute of limitations was about to expire.
The lawsuit states Gloria James was 16 at the time of the alleged encounter, but Stovell said she told him she was in her early 20s.
Stovell is a solo legal practitioner in the District of Columbia, and filed the lawsuit on his own behalf.
Federal court records show the case was settled when the commission paid him $230,000, while not admitting fault.
