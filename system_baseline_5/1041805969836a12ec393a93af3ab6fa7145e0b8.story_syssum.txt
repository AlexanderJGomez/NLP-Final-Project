"The Lance story is a sad one, with our emotional connection with that athlete," Oakley chief executive Colin Baden told CNN.
Baden said there had been no question of Oakley dropping Armstrong until he was officially stripped of his titles.
Texas company SCA Promotions is also seeking the return of $12 million it paid Armstrong, but Baden said Oakley would not be following suit.
"I like to think of us as a premier sports performance company and we do really extreme product development -- and sometimes the products we develop are unique and it requires somebody in what we call 'the front row' to explain to the masses that this is the best," Baden said.
