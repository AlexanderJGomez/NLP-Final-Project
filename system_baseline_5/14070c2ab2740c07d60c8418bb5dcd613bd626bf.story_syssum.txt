A school district outside Columbus, Ohio, is on track to receive more than $1 million in federal grant money for its Chinese arts and language program.
The funds will be used, school officials say, to support their visiting teacher from China and to foster the newly formed relationship with their sister school in the southern Chinese province of Kunming.
During his visit to the United States this week, Chinese President Hu Jintao plans to visit one such program at the Walter Payton College Prep school in Chicago.
"We feel very lucky that we have this," Aldis said.
"It's really been challenging," she said.
I think China has a beautiful culture."
"The problem here was the culture portion and the involvement with the Chinese government."
Kramar said he was concerned about impressionable elementary students learning about communism through material provided by the Chinese government.
Parent Mandy Aldis said she isn't bothered one bit by the program being funded by China's government.
I think the more you're exposed to another culture, the more you understand each other, you're just a more well-rounded person.
