Katherine Jackson has proposed she or one of her children be added as an executor to Michael's will.
Questions surrounding Michael Jackson's death and AEG Live's role in his last days are an "obvious source of tension" as Katherine Jackson objects to the agreement, Jackson attorney Burt Levitch said.
"There's an obvious link between AEG and concerns that we have about the decedent's demise," Levitch said.
A Jackson family member would be in the best position to guide Michael Jackson's legacy, he said.
Jackson lawyers argued in Monday's hearing that the 50-50 split of profits for the exhibition was too generous to AEG Live, but estate lawyers said they negotiated the best terms possible.
Estate lawyer Howard Weitzman said canceling the exhibition deal could cost the Jackson estate $5 million.
