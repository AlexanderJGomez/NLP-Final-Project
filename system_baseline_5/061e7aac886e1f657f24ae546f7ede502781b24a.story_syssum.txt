Think of Zite, the free personalized iPad magazine that launched today, as the Genius playlist or Pandora of news discovery -- but with one noticeable advantage: Zite is smarter, at least for now.
It then culled news items from fitting sources -- Fast Company, Wired, TechCrunch, Fred Wilson's blog.
Features or analysis?
"It's a combination of semantic- and statistically based machine learning," says CEO Ali Davar, of Zite's content algorithm, the technology of which has been in development for years.
Users can tell Zite whether they enjoyed a particular article, whether they liked a particular source, or whether they want more news on a particular topic area.
Users can select these topics on their own, but Zite is best at autosuggesting them--after playing with the app for a week, Zite began featuring "Graphic Design & Typography" as one of my top news sections.
"The difference between Flipboard and Zite is that with Zite, your sections are actually personalized," Davar says.
But that's really 'customization.'
Since Flipboard features only hand-picked sources, the app is arguably very personalized: Just as one might only subscribe to New York magazine or The Economist in print, one might only be interested in subscribing to those mags on Flipboard -- and less interested in reading similar content from other sources.
