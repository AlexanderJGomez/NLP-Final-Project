Trying to figure out how the United States and its European allies will respond to Russia's Crimea incursion gets confusing.
United States -- It is hard to imagine a scenario that would cause U.S. troops to get involved in Ukraine.
While no obligation exists for NATO to militarily defend Ukraine against Russian aggression, the United States and Britain -- along with Russia -- committed to protecting Ukrainian independence and territorial integrity in 1994 when Kiev gave up its nuclear arsenal that dated back to the Soviet era.
The United States -- President Barack Obama said Thursday that he signed an executive order that laid the groundwork for sanctions against people and entities deemed responsible for the crisis.
Already, Russia threatens to retaliate with its own sanctions if the United States and Europe take such a step.
On Thursday, the European Union threatened limited steps if no substantive negotiations between Russia and Ukraine start in coming days.
United States -- Kerry announced $1 billion in loan guarantees for Ukraine this week as part of the Obama administration's effort to publicly support the interim government and provide incentive for Ukraine to continue to align itself with the West through the European Union instead of Russia.
United States -- The United States is working with European allies to create an "exit ramp" for Putin to be able to de-escalate the Ukraine crisis.
Reflecting the standoff, Merkel said Thursday that the European Union wants to do everything it can to settle the Ukraine crisis diplomatically, but she warned that without any "diplomatic possibility," steps such as asset freezing and visa limitations would be options.
