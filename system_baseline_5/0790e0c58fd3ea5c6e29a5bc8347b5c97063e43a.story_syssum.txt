(CNN) -- On July 13, 2013, a Florida jury found George Zimmerman not guilty in the death of Trayvon Martin.
His wife, Shellie, filed for divorce in September, citing irreconcilable differences -- and in November, Zimmerman was arrested and charged with felony aggravated assault for a domestic dispute with his girlfriend.
She had taken the Zimmerman case near the end of her one-year rotation in the criminal courts.
The colorful attorney who represented Trayvon Martin's parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, has been busy, taking on several high-profile cases spanning the nation.
In February, her office argued a case against Michael Dunn, accused of shooting at four teens in a vehicle after complaining about the volume of their music.
O'Mara, who does not currently represent George Zimmerman, is now flush with new business and is a current CNN legal contributor.
The ousted former Sanford, Florida, police chief, who took the brunt of criticism about how the initial investigation in the shooting was conducted, is now working as a special agent with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's Orlando Regional Operations Center Public Integrity Squad.
A cadre of supporters took Jeantel, 20, under their collective wings after she was subjected to scathing public criticism over her appearance, demeanor and speech during the trial.
Juror B37, the first juror to speak, told CNN that Zimmerman was "justified in shooting Trayvon Martin" but that he "had good in his heart, he just went overboard."
