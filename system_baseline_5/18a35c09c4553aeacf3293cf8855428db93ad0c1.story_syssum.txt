(CNN) -- A black Agriculture Department employee who resigned after a video clip surfaced of her talking about a white farmer said Tuesday her remarks were taken out of context.
Sherrod resigned Monday after conservative media outlets aired the video, in which she says she did not give the white farmer "the full force of what I could do" to help him avoid foreclosure.
To prove she had done her job, she said, she took him to a white lawyer.
She said she, the farmer and his wife wound up being friends.
Sherrod told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution there were white people, including a mayor, at the banquet where she spoke.
According to her remarks, she mistreated a white farmer in need of assistance because of his race," said Benjamin Todd Jealous, president and CEO of the civil rights group.
Asked why did she resigned instead of fought, Sherrod said, "I didn't have any support from USDA.
What would I do?"
"I think she is using this an anecdote to work through her own issues but also to show the audience we can move beyond and transcend some of these circumstances," he said.
The National Tea Party Foundation expelled Williams' organization from its coalition as a result.
