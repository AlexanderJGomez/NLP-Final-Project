ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- I'll never forget holding World War II medic Tony Acevedo in my arms.
"When I say the name Erwin Metz, what comes to your mind?"
Metz was one of the Nazi commanders who headed a slave labor camp known as Berga an der Elster, where 350 U.S. soldiers -- 80 of whom had been targeted for being Jewish -- were beaten, starved and forced to work in tunnels at a secret V-2 rocket factory.
He shot one soldier, Morton Goldstein, through the head, execution-style, according to the survivors.
Acevedo described seeing Metz dump ice water on one emaciated soldier.
Buddeski died April 13, 1945, on the death march on what the soldiers call Hell's Highway.
Amid the chaos and death all around them, these men -- these soldiers who suffered so much -- took the time to stop and pray for their president.
When CNN first reported Acevedo's story in November, I had no idea it would lead to what I witnessed this weekend: The U.S. Army reversing course on six decades of silence and recognizing the Berga soldiers for what they went through.
Berga soldiers will tell you they were never called to testify against Metz or Merz.
When Metz and Merz were freed, the survivors felt the Army betrayed the war ethos of "leave no soldier behind."
Heading into last weekend, the six Berga survivors present knew a two-star general was being sent to meet with them.
Surely, a two-star won't call it a "slave labor camp" after all this time.

I knew history had just been made, the legacy of the Berga soldiers preserved for all time.
I had met with his 90-year-old wife, Florence, and their daughter, Nomi, months before.
When she was notified Izzy was a prisoner of war on March 16, 1945, one relative shouted, "That's just like Izzy to take the easy way out of war."
I thought about Martin Vogel, the brother of the man who died with Izzy.
"Are you the one who did the story on the medic, Tony Acevedo?"
They were 19 and 17.
At the time his brother died such a horrific death, Martin Vogel was just a few hundred miles away.
You can scroll through Acevedo's diary and read the War Department document explaining why Metz and Merz were set free.
It was humbling when Boles, the two-star general, told me that my reporting and my colleagues on CNN television preserved the men's legacy, culminating with the Army recognizing them.
"Just as they never left their fallen comrades, we will never leave them," Boles said.
I wished the other Berga survivors were there, especially Acevedo.
My final message is to my generation and the next.
The greatest generation.
