(CNN)After more than nine years of traveling through the solar system, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft has sent back its first color image of Pluto.
Discovered in 1930, Pluto was once considered to be the smallest planet in the solar system.
By discovering more about Pluto and its moons, New Horizons will shed light on a little-known third zone of the solar system, beyond the rocky planets and the gas giants.
It will also be on the lookout for rings and other satellites.
