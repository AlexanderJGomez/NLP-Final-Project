If a new president comes to the White House -- if Romney and Ryan win -- will America find itself once again at war?
Sensing Obama's vulnerability, Romney and Ryan would like to keep the focus there.
A look at how Romney and Ryan would respond to the challenges facing America is as revealing as it is stunning.
Obama has since learned his lesson about being shy in praising America.
Regarding Afghanistan, the war in which Americans are serving and dying, Romney and Obama have, incredibly, largely avoided the topic.
On Iran, arguably the most important foreign policy question and conceivably a new war front for America, both Romney and Obama have stated that Iran must not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons.
And despite criticism of Obama's approach to Israel, Romney agrees with Obama that Israel is a key ally whose security is one of the non-negotiable aspects of U.S. foreign policy.
Obama went even further, saying "Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel and it must remain undivided."
But overall, America's foreign policy choices, based on national interest, national values, strategic considerations and popular opinion, will not significantly change regardless of whether Obama or Romney wins the presidential election.
But Obama may do just the same.
