(CNN) -- Former CNN anchor Lou Dobbs said Thursday said neither he nor his companies have ever hired illegal immigrants and it was not his responsibility to check their papers.
But Macdonald said that the situation involved Dobbs and his Dobbs Group hiring contractors that she said used undocumented workers.
That doesn't sit well with me," Dobbs told the author.
Macdonald said Dobbs is responsible for those working at his properties.
In particular, he has said that employers who hire illegal immigrants should be prosecuted.
The next day, he said on his show that field workers are paid "not, in my opinion, an adequate wage, but a decent wage," adding: "These people deserve to be paid more.
According to the article, the man said an old friend worked at a stable owned by Dobbs and promised the man work as a groom at a Vermont stable contracted to care for horses owned by the Dobbs Group, which is headed by Dobbs.
"You put out an article that is being used by the left-wing press as a hammer on me," Dobbs told Macdonald.
"Even Lou Dobbs, the emblem of this get-tough approach on immigration enforcement, even he has been unable to manage his property [so that] there will be no undocumented workers," Macdonald said.
Dobbs said he has done nothing wrong and is being targeted.
