Romney only looks like an insider.
The people of Massachusetts may know the former governor as a bipartisan moderate, yet he sold himself on the national stage as "severely conservative."
Is he moderate or is he conservative?
That was Romney's job -- and he didn't quite pull it off.
I suspect that the Republicans nominated Romney partly because he spent so much money acquiring the nomination but also because his personality seemed suitably vague.
But to win the primaries, Romney still needed the votes of that big block of conservatives.
For the record, the conservative movement never entirely bought Romney's conversion.
He won primaries largely thanks to the support of people like him, and he only won because there are so many people like him in the Republican Party.
With unemployment running high and debt spiraling out of control, we might have expected Romney's ability to make money to be a plus.
Romney insisted that he left Bain before it committed its greatest sins, but the image of Mitt cheerfully declaring, "I like being able to fire people" stuck in the minds of many voters.
My theory is that Romney flourished because the format was like a corporate job interview: question after question, a little light sparring, an emphasis upon "pep" ("Gee, I'd just love to run your country.
It worked because Romney did what the GOP was waiting for him to do all year.
What next for Mitt Romney?
I hope the conservative movement and the pundits will be just as charitable to him
