"If you're trying to do commerce between Portland (Oregon) and Seattle, there is no way right now," said Bob Calkins, a spokesman for the Washington State Emergency Operations Center in Camp Murray, near Tacoma.
"The problem is, the one real good detour is just as flooded," Calkins said.
The rainfall swept across virtually all of the state, but its biggest effects occurred along the western half of Puget Sound, Calkins said.
"It was pretty traumatizing to all of us."
Only 260 of them sought shelter Wednesday night at the 39 shelters for people, Calkins said.
"The larger issue is, as people go to their homes, they may be walking through floodwater that is contaminated by sewage," he said.
