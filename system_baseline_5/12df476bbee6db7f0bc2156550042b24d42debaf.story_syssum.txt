"It's pretty tough all the way around," said Stephen Dane, a fire spokesman.
Approximately 1,200 firefighters are working the blaze, with the help of helicopters, bulldozers and conventional engines, Dane said.
They said, 'It's mandatory.'
"There's still a bit of distance before the fire would get to Bald Mountain, the ski resort area, but they are protecting the area just in case," he said.
"As some of the other large fires in Idaho such as the Elk Fire have ramped down, we have been able to transfer a lot of resources from there to the Beaver Creek Fire," said Jennifer Mislivy, a fire spokeswoman.
