Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN) -- Pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine have decided to go ahead with a Sunday referendum on greater local powers, they said Thursday, defying a call by Russian President Vladimir Putin to postpone the vote.
The move escalated the turmoil rocking the country.
Putin also said that direct talks between Kiev authorities and representatives of the pro-Russian sympathizers in southeast Ukraine were key to settling the crisis.
The Kyiv Post said he was captured by representatives of the Donetsk People's Republic.
A majority of Ukrainians agree their country should remain a unified state, according to a poll released Thursday.
Three times as many Ukrainians say Russia is having a bad influence on their country as say it is having a good impact (67% vs. 22%)," it said.
Moscow has repeatedly said they are only carrying out exercises.
It also said Thursday that U.S. citizens should defer all travel to Crimea and eastern regions
Kiev and many experts in the West believe the separatists are backed by Moscow and fear that Putin is fomenting trouble to increase his influence in the region.
Moscow says right-wing, ultranationalist groups are behind the violence in Ukraine and that it has no direct influence over the pro-Russian groups.
Kiev has said it is stepping up security measures ahead of the holiday.
