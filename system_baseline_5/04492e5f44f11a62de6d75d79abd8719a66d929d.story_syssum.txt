Denmark's capital city, Copenhagen -- host to the U.N. climate summit which starts today -- is already one of the greenest cities in Europe.
"It is, by far, the largest conference we have ever held and the largest political conference in Europe," the Bella Center press manager, Lars Lemche told CNN.
"If numbers continue to grow, it will be the biggest political meeting the U.N. has ever held," he said.
Inside the conference center delegates will eat from a menu that is 65 percent organic and drink water that has come out of a tap rather than a bottle.
Until about two weeks ago it's not been talked about a lot in the press and maybe a month ago half the people in Denmark didn't know there was going to be a conference," he told CNN.
And now that the conference has started, 6000 officers will be on duty during the conference.
Last week, police unveiled a 22-ton vehicle armed with a water canon which will be used if trouble flares during the conference.
So the city council have been trying to pre-empt it by sending postcards saying please refrain from going to these areas.
As Copenhagen hands over to the U.N. for two weeks, the world's eyes are now turning to negotiations which precede the arrival of U.S. President Barack Obama and company.
