(CNN) -- If you've ever had a group of friends who have meant the world to you, take a look at the old black-and-white photo that accompanies today's column.
It wasn't to be.
In 1960, the three had been teammates on The Ohio State University basketball team that won the national collegiate championship.
But the thing you could never really know -- the secret that belonged only to them, as it does with any group of friends -- was what it was like to be inside of it.
The old team was history.
I watched those friends on the court at every home game on their way to the championship; I watched that magical basketball friendship form and grow and become so strong that their team became the finest in the country.
"It's probably something the rest of us can never fully comprehend," said Lee Caryer, a sports historian who wrote the book "The Golden Age of Ohio State Basketball," and who knows every member of that championship team.
They started off as small-town Ohio boys who didn't even know that the others were alive: Jerry Lucas of Middletown, Larry Siegfried of Shelby, John Havlicek of Martins Ferry.
But the friendships not only lead the way home.
The friendships are home.
