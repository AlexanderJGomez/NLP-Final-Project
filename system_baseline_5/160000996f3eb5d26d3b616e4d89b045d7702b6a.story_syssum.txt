Los Angeles (CNN)Hours after California Attorney General Kamala Harris began raising money for a bid to replace Barbara Boxer in the U.S. Senate, billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer outlined the case for his own run Tuesday and said he would decide soon -- setting up the likelihood of an exorbitantly expensive contest that could have two Democrats facing off in November of 2016.
Steyer and Harris would be among the most formidable contenders for Boxer's seat, along with former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who has said he is "seriously considering" a run.
His NextGen Climate Action Committee spent more than $74 million in the midterm elections -- much of it Steyer's money -- trying to defeat candidates who had expressed doubt about climate change, but they had little demonstrable success in a Republican wave year.
Harris, the former district attorney of San Francisco who was just re-elected to her second term as attorney general, was the first to formally declare her candidacy since Boxer announced last week that she would not run for re-election in 2016.
"I will be a fighter for the next generation on the critical issues facing our country.
Speculation had swirled around the possibility of a heated race between Harris, 50, and Newsom, 47, who could have potentially split the Northern California vote, clearing the way for a Southern California candidate like Villaraigosa.
Therefore I will not seek election to the U.S. Senate in 2016," Newsom said.
