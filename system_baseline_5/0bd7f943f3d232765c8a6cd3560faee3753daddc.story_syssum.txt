The region's three big players -- Etihad, Emirates and Qatar Airways -- announced orders for 393 new commercial planes.
Later Hogan trumped his Boeing order with an announcement for 87 Airbus jets worth $26.9B at list price, including 50 A350 aircraft, the twin-aisle competitor of the 777X currently in development.
But it was Dubai's Emirates that revealed the largest order with a $76B deal  for 150 Boeing 777X planes, plus an additional 50 Airbus A380s, worth $23 billion, to bring its order of the superjumbo up to 101.
"With around $100B worth of orders, this makes it the largest aviation product launch," said Boeing Chairman and CEO Jim McNeary.
Finding room for the new aircraft in Dubai should not be a problem as the Al-Maktoum airport is the city's second international hub and predicted to be the world's largest when completed.
Hogan predicts passenger numbers for Etihad to grow by 14% annually for the next five years, while Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al-Maktoum, Emirates' CEO, believes the numbers will come as more countries open up.
