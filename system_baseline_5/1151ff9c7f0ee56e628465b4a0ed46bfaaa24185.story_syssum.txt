Biden said Operation Iraqi Freedom is over, but promised that "American engagement with Iraq will continue" with the new stability mission.
"Our fighting men and women were given a mission in Iraq that was as complicated as any in our history, an assignment that taught us that war is the realm of uncertainty," he said.
Odierno, who said Iraqi security forces are ready to take the lead there, recalled the wartime period as one of Iraqi heroism.
"It is time for Iraq to move forward," Odierno said.
But he said that "the past few years in Iraq have been marked by steady progress" and he envisions a "stable, secure and unified Iraq."
The U.S. combat mission in Iraq officially ended at 5 p.m.
"The United States has paid a huge price to put the future of Iraq in the hands of its people," Obama said from the Oval Office.
The war in Iraq has claimed the lives of more than 4,400 U.S. troops.
Before Obama's speech, some Republicans had urged him to acknowledge that the 2007 U.S. troop surge in Iraq ordered by then-President George W. Bush had worked.
"You might recall that the surge wasn't very popular when it was announced," McConnell said.
Fewer than four in 10 said that the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan were extremely important to them.
