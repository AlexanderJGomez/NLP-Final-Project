In the meantime, consumers will feel the pain as devices potentially get more expensive and software changes begin to creep into their Android smartphones.
Friday's ruling was very sobering for the Android device manufacturers that have driven this growth.
Android phone makers will be scrambling to develop temporary workarounds to steer clear of any potentially infringing Apple patents.
Sure, Android consumers could always turn to Apple, but some are turned off by the company's one phone per year release schedule and continued hesitancy to incorporate the latest mobile advances such as 4G and larger screens.
Beyond that, every device manufacturer will be thinking outside of the "rectangular slab form-factor" box in an attempt to create the next big consumer trend.
Of course, Apple does have patent and design agreements with Microsoft and both companies have a mutual interest in slowing Android growth.
This ruling will encourage accelerated innovation from device manufacturers, which will move beyond the constraints of a single form factor.
Today's constraints will define how the industry will innovate tomorrow.
