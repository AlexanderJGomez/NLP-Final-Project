(CNN) -- I thought I was prepared for North Korea.
No matter where we went over the next nine days, the gaze of Kim Il Sung, or his son, Kim Jong Il, the current ruler known as the "Dear Leader," would follow us, from portraits hung on buildings, monuments, bridges ... to lapel pins on the chests of almost everyone we met, including the two men who greeted us, Mr. Jang and Mr. Song, who would be our guides, minders and controllers for the duration of our stay.
The streets of the North Korean capital reminded me of Moscow in the 1960s.
For several days we pestered our North Korean guides to take us to markets where the first tiny buds of capitalism are sprouting, the government allowing people to sell fruits and vegetables -- one way of relieving the food shortage in the North.
Mr. Jang and Mr. Song must have studied at the same guide school.
Suddenly, the young one, 29-year-old Mr. Jang, sporting a sleek black pompadour and a smirk, told us to stop.
Our older guide, Mr. Song, a former diplomat, was more flexible.
In Pyongyang we asked to see some of the everyday life in North Korea and our guides finally took us to the city park, a magnificently beautiful expanse of hills and trees.
They simply smiled and kept dancing.
The North may have a hard-edged image in the world of fierce militarism and, just as in the old Soviet Union, much of life is run like the army, with group -- not individual -- activities the norm.
It's much the same here in Pyongyang yet there is one sign of changing times in today's North Korea: a flash, here and there, of modest jewelry, unthinkable just a short time ago.
It's a question I asked myself so many times in Russia and it hounds me here in North Korea.
Do they believe in Kim?
Its back is toward the United States.
Its mouth is toward Russia."
In the mountains a two-hour drive from Pyongyang, there is a massive museum cut into the mountainside, built to house all the gifts given by international leaders to Kim Il Sung and his son, Kim Jong Il.
Mr. Jang and Mr. Song stand reverently and bow.
The Great Leader stares blindly into the distance.
