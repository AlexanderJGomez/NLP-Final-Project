In addition, about half of Pakistanis (51%) said they think the May 2 raid on bin Laden's home in Abbottabad will adversely affect their country's relations with the United States.
Only 12% of respondents said they had a positive view of the United States and 8% said they were confident that U.S. President Barack Obama would do the right thing in world affairs.
Asked whether they believe the Pakistani government authorized the raid, 29% said it did, 23% said it did not and nearly half said they did not know.
Yet extremist groups are still unpopular, with just 12% of Pakistanis expressing a positive view of al Qaeda, down from 18% last year.
The second was conducted May 8-15 -- after bin Laden was killed -- solely in Pakistan among 1,251 Pakistanis.
The pollsters said there were few differences between the first and second surveys, implying that bin Laden's killing had little impact on public opinion in Pakistan about the United States or other issues covered by the survey.
And former cricket star Imran Khan attracted the most favorable rating for a politician with 68% approval of those surveyed, up from 52% last year.
But just 27% said they had heard a lot about the attacks, up from 14% last year.
More than half (61%) said they are unnecessary and 89% said they think they kill too many innocent people.
