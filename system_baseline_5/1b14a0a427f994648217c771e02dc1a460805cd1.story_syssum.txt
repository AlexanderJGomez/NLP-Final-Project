Marquez equaled Valentino Rossi's record of 10 podium placings in his rookie season, set back in 2000, and became the first rider since the Italian in 2008 to win four successive races.
"I am very happy with the result, because after all the problems with my injury and the doubts we've had at the last few races, we took a big step forward with my mental preparation today," he said.
"Today was better than Indy, especially because my gap to the front is half what it was there," the Yamaha rider said.
"I think I had my best start in all my career in MotoGP, I took four positions and in the first laps I was really quick.
