The 220,000-square-foot addition will be used to find cures for childhood cancers, and will double the Huntsman Cancer Institute's research space, said the 76-year-old businessman and philanthropist, father of former Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman Jr.
says Huntsman.
He raised the rest of the funds from donors like The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
"It was just something that in my heart I've always believed, that if you are generous and help others, you'll be blessed in your own life.
That dedication goes back decades.
Huntsman himself has also battled cancer, and has survived prostate cancer, mouth cancer and two types of skin cancer.
