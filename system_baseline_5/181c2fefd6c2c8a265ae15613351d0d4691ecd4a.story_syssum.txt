Soon, those photos spread on social media, with Twitter users mimicking her passed-out pose and adding the hashtag #jadapose.
Jada and her mother  filed a police report about the incident June 22.
Jada chose to show her face with the support of her mother, Sukiedia.
Jada isn't the only alleged assault victim moving to reclaim her name and image.
"With the case of Jada, the very technology that was used to make matters worse was used to improve matters," said Stephen Balkam, who has a teenage daughter and is CEO of the Family Online Safety Institute.
Even as public support for Jada is swelling, it's clear that online abuse isn't going away anytime soon.
More teens are pushing back at this meme-ification of violence by speaking up and creating communities of kindness.

Resources on A Platform for Good can help guide conversations with teens about their digital reputation.
Parents "should encourage their kids to be up-standers and not bystanders when they see something as negative as what was happening to Jada," Balkam said.
As for Jada, supporters are calling her "brave" and a "hero."
