The FDLE investigated allegations made by a group of men who said they were beaten and sexually abused when they attended the school about five decades ago.
The claims provided here are an example," he said.
"FDLE is whitewashing this thing like you wouldn't believe," said Colon, who was interviewed by the FDLE in the investigation.
The FDLE said its investigators interviewed six former staff members from Dozier and more than 100 former students and their relatives.
"There was little to no evidence of visible residual scarring," the report said.
Some of the accusers said the graves -- marked only by white steel crosses, rusted with the passage of time -- contained the bodies of boys who were beaten to death by school workers.
Colon said he reacted to the beatings and other events he witnessed by burying the pain inside.
Do it!
But the FDLE report said there were inconsistencies in the story and a lack of evidence.
Colon said angrily.
He said the boys at the school who misbehaved were "spanked."
Colon says the FDLE's report about what happened at the school is wrong, and he wants to do his own investigation.
