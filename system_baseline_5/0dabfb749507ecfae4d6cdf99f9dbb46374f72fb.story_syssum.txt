(CNN) -- DNA has linked the slayings of three women, Philadelphia police said Tuesday night in announcing they are looking for a serial killer.
Analysis showed the three were killed by the same assailant, Clark said.
The location, the similar nature of the attacks and the descriptions of the attacker led police to suspect they are connected.
The victims all were choked, police said.
All victims were white females involved in prostitution and narcotics, police said.
