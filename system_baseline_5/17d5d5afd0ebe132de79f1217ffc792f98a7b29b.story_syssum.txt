McClain told her fiance "she was pregnant and had given birth to a child, by him," said Montgomery County Sheriff's Capt.
The car struck Golden as it left the scene, the station said.
Police believe the kidnapping was the motive for the shooting, the report said.
The baby was found safe about six hours later at the residence of the suspect's sister, authorities said.
His wife was dead when he reached the hospital, he said.
"The defendant confronted Mrs. Golden and shot her multiple times in the parking lot," then took the baby and left, the report said.
McClain returned to the apartment as the investigation was continuing and asked to speak to police, the report said.
"She admitted to shooting Mrs. Golden and taking her baby," the arrest report said.
Authorities said Tuesday that Golden and the woman parked next to her at the doctor's office apparently spoke to one another or argued before the shooting.
She's just a mom doing her best to take care of her kids, and I miss her," Hartis told CNN affiliate KPRC.
I mean, you hear about a lot of shootings and other types of crimes, but somebody kidnaps a baby, 3 days old, and the mother to be shot?
That's really scary."
