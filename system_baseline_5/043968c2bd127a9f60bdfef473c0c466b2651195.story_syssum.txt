The country's federal state of Lower Saxony became the last region to scrap tuition fees in mid-October, which means that studying in Germany is now completely free even for international students.
Germany has had a long tradition of free education, introducing fees only in 2006 when the constitutional court ruled that moderate tuition fees were not at odds with the country's pledge for education for all.
But before you pack up and go, be aware that studying in Germany can be a very different to campus-based life common in the U.S. and Britain.
Social life for international students can also be harder to form, as many German students study in their home town and often live with their parents, or share an apartment with friends.
