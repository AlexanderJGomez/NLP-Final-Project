They probably got confused with another guy or something," Hernandez said.
More likely, Hernandez was one of hundreds of undocumented immigrants released from detention because of looming budget cuts set to take effect Friday absent congressional action.
An exact number of released detainees has not been released; ICE characterized it as "several hundred."
"Detainees with serious criminal histories are a detention priority and have not been released," she said.
Hernandez said he believes some of those released with him are repeat offenders who have been previously deported.
He wants to know exactly how many detainees were released, and where, and the reason for each person's detention.
Hernandez said he doesn't understand what all the fuss is about.
