The pressure to participate is intense.
For Koreans, drinking is considered a way to get to know what someone is really like.
"I didn't really like it in the beginning," says Charles Lee, a Korean-Canadian who came to Seoul to work for a South Korean company.
Drinking is such a big part of Korean life that Seoul traffic is said to correspond with the city's drinking culture.
One of the first things Koreans often ask when meeting someone new is their age.
By raising your glass or pouring alcohol with one hand, you are establishing yourself as a senior person.
It's always a good idea to find out people's drinking habits beforehand.
Unless you have an airtight reason, refusing alcohol is considered a mood killer and deemed rude.
One of the most popular venues in Korea for business drinking is the karaoke bar.
This entails a person of your choosing drinking your glass for you, but it also means they get a wish.
