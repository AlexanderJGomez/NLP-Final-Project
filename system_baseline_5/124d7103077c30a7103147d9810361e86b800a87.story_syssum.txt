(CNN) -- Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said Monday he will appeal a Superior Court's decision to reverse Monsignor William Lynn's conviction for covering up crimes of offending priests.
"I am disgusted by the Superior Court's cavalier, disregard for the child victims of pedophile priests and Monsignor Lynn's role," Williams told reporters.
Williams said it is undeniable Lynn, now 62, was responsible for endangering the child.
