(CNN)  -- Opposition candidate John Evans Atta Mills has narrowly won Ghana's presidential election, the Ghana Electoral Commission said on its Web site.
"On the basis of the official results given, the results of the run-off election in the Tain constituency in the Brong Ahafo Region, which was held on the 2nd January 2009, it is my duty to declare Professor John Evans Atta Mills the President-elect of Ghana," Afari-Gyan said, according to the government's Web site.
Mills is a law professor who served as vice president from 1997 to 2000 under Jerry Rawlings.
A decade later, Rawlings led the country through the transition to a stable democracy with multi-party elections.
