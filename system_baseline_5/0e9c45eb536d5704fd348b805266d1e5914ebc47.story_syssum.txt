Nina and Edgar Otto say their cloned puppy crosses his paws like the original dog did.
"We just got him because we wanted to have Lancelot more than just the 11Â½ years," Nina Otto said.
No," Edgar Otto said, adding, "This is a really sweet dog, and ... we're very happy that we did it."
They say Lancy walks just like Lancelot and crosses his paws like him, too.
"This dog was immediately accepted by the nine dogs," Edgar Otto said.
About two months later, 1.3-pound Lancy was born in a single litter birth.
But, the Ottos say, he's taken a particular fondness to a bush planted at the spot where his original, Lancelot, died last year.
The Ottos can do whatever they want with their money, but "a shelter dog just lost out on a great chance of having a home," said Cherie Wachter of the Humane Society of Broward County, Florida.
"The only reason I don't go to the Humane Society is because I would bring every one of them home," Nina Otto said.
"Think about this," he said philosophically.
