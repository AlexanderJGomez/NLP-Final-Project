But on 10 minutes the referee took the decision that essentially ended the game as a contest.
Siena battled on gamely, and on 26 minutes Massimo Maccarone escaped three defenders on the edge of the Milan box to bundle through before firing over on the stretch as Thiago Silva came across to put him under pressure.
But 18 minutes from time he rose unmarked in the box to head home a David Beckham corner.
Simone Perrotta opened the scoring on 17 minutes after a scramble at a corner and then Toni turned home Mirko Vucinic's cross on the stroke of half-time.
