(CNN) -- He's known as "The Little Master" and now Sachin Tendulkar can lay claim to being the only man in cricket history to reach 100 international centuries.
"A year ago when I got my 99th hundred the media began talking about it.
I was not playing for my 100th hundred.
It took only a little gloss off the earlier milestone for 39-year-old Tendulkar, who is India's most high-profile sporting icon in a country where cricket is a religion.
His century provoked an outpouring of joy on home soil after a long wait.
Tendulkar became the first man to reach 50 centuries in 2000 and surpassed West Indian batsman Brian Lara's record for the highest number of Test runs in 2008.
Tendulkar recorded his 99th international hundred over a year ago as part of India's successful World Cup campaign on home soil.
But since then he has failed to bring up three figures on India's tours of England and Australia as well as the home series against the West Indies -- twice being dismissed in the 90s.
