British designer Thomas Heatherwick aims to change that.
"There can be a mentality that can easily exist here that sees the desert as a surface to be covered up, instead of maybe celebrating its uniqueness," says Heatherwick, who recently unveiled plans for proposed 1.3-million-square-foot Al Fayah Park.
Al Fayah Park, he hopes, will be offer the city's residents a viable alternative.
The domed park will also give the otherwise flat city an undulating quality.
"The partial shade will mean we can use half the quantity of water that the current site used, and create more lushness in the process," he says.
