Salt spreaders and plows rumbled through Arlington, where sub-freezing temperatures hung in the air amid a mix of debilitating sleet and snow that canceled hundreds of flights Friday, raising questions about whether the Super Bowl host was ready for the rash of inclement weather.
The big game will be played in Cowboys Stadium -- a domed arena with a retractable roof.
Ice and snow slid off the stadium roof Friday and caused injuries to workers below, authorities said.
"We have been planning for this for a whole year," Librio said of Sunday's match-up between the Green Bay Packers and the Pittsburgh Steelers.
The New Meadowlands Stadium, co-owned by the New York Giants and the Jets, won the bid to host Super Bowl XLVIII in East Rutherford, New Jersey.
Sunday's game, Super Bowl XLV, is scheduled to begin at 6:30 p.m ET.
