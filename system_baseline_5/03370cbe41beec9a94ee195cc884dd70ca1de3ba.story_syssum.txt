Welcome to John and June Sturgeon's indoor train garden, a collection of model trains the couple have been sharing with friends and neighbors every holiday season for nearly 15 years.
John still has the train, and many more.
Last year, more than 1,200 people followed the lit path to the backyard garage, including regulars like Jason Gauchier and his two children, who come at least once a week when the display is open.
The Sturgeons have worked consistently to make additions to the train garden.
...
Well, it's 29 cars plus the engine makes it 30," John says.
The Sturgeons open their collection for 20 nights each year leading up to Christmas.
