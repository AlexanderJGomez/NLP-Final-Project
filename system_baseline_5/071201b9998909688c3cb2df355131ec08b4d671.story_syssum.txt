While Obama spoke of the strong bonds, President Lee Myung-bak said he will win over American critics of the pact, which was approved by Congress Wednesday.
Obama and Lee earlier Thursday said the trade agreement is promising for both economies.
It will promote green jobs and clean energy, another area where we're deepening our cooperation," Obama said.
Obama and Lee also said they will continue to cooperate on efforts with respect to North Korea.
Lee is a reliable ally for Obama, especially when it comes to U.S. policy on North Korea.
