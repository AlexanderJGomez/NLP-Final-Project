One year on, reminders are never too far away, from the broken buildings to frequent aftershocks that rattle the city every day.
The tremor brought down buildings in the city center in the middle of the working day, trapping workers and triggering a national state of emergency as rescuers scrambled to save lives.
One year later, Christchurch remains locked in recovery mode, a city carved into zones labeled by color to indicate the severity of the earthquake damage to homes and land.
"They said that our house was sinking towards the river.
"It's a city of two parts really," said Matt O'Connell, the earthquake recovery coordinator for the Catholic Diocese, who works in the same office as Boyd.
"Even just on one street we met a family there who are struggling for food who had eight to ten people living in a two-bedroom house," he said.
The February 22 quake was one itself, after a larger, magnitude 7.1 quake the previous September.
There was further damage, no one was injured, but it was a psychological blow for many people," O'Connell said.
Population figures released in October, the first numbers made public since the quake, showed more than 10,000 people had left the city in the year to June 2011.
On the eve of the anniversary, the city buried the unidentified remains of four people who were killed in the quake in a new cemetery.
