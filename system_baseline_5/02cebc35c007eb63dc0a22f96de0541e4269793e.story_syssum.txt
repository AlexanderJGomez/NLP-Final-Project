Fuller and other journalists were interviewing the general -- better known as Seh Daeng -- in makeshift barricades that protesters have set up in downtown Bangkok.
The protesters' barricades appear as a combination "of 'Mad Max' and some medieval scene," Fuller said.
Fuller said he was just inside the barricades when he was interviewing Seh Daeng.
Seh Daeng -- or Red Commander -- is a controversial public figure, even within the protest movement, Fuller said.
"He's a renegade in all sense," Fuller said.
