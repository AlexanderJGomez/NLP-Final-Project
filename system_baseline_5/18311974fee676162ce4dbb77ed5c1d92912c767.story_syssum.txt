"This is the end of an era and so I have decided to leave my position as chairman after almost 23 marvellous and unforgettable years," read a statement from Di Montezemolo.
"Ferrari is the most wonderful company in the world.
Since 2008, however, Ferrari have been starved of such successes, with the team having now gone nearly six years without either a Drivers' or Constructors' World Championship title.
Di Montezemolo first arrived at Ferrari in 1973, becoming assistant to the manufacturer's founder, Enzo Ferrari, before going on to manage the team from 1974.
"I wish the shareholders, particularly Piero Ferrari who has always been by my side, and everyone in the Company the many more years of success that Ferrari deserves," Di Montezemolo added.
