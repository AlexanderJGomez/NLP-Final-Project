"(The Palestinians) were throwing stones, and the (Israeli) soldiers throw the tear gas.
Plastic bullets," Zayed said.
"This is the first time they're shooting to kill here," Zayed said, speaking to CNN while standing on the exact spot outside his home where the two boys were filmed being shot.
CNN producer Kareem Khadder was filming the clashes in Beitunya on May 15.
As he walked toward the Israeli military positions in front of Zayed's door, Nouwarah suddenly fell forward, landing briefly on his hands, before rolling over to lie on his back.
Though Khadder didn't know it at the time, he was filming two Israeli security troops firing their rifles at the Palestinian protesters at the same exact moment when Nouwarah was shot.
As he was walking away from the Israeli positions, he suddenly fell to the ground and struggled briefly to get up.
The boy was shot just a few steps from where Nouwarah had been wounded.
Nouwarah appeared to have gone to the anti-Israel protests directly from school on the afternoon of May 15.
"We were surprised when we took the school backpack back from the hospital to find this bullet inside," said the elder Nouwarah.
Siam Nouwarah said he was saving it for a forensic examination.
Regarding the CNN video of the Israeli security forces firing rifles at the Palestinian demonstrators at the moment when Nouwarah was shot, Lerner said the weapons being used had an attachment at the end of the barrel for firing rubber-coated projectiles.
Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department has joined several human rights groups calling for an investigation into the deadly incident.
