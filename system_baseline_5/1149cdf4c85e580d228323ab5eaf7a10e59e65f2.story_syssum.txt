(CNN) -- IndyCar said it has launched an investigation into the 15-vehicle wreck that claimed the life of driver Dan Wheldon and expects to have preliminary findings within weeks.
"He's focused on what's been needed from him to provide for the feedback to Dallara and be consistent and concise," Phillips said then of Wheldon.
IndyCar on Tuesday said it was saddened by Wheldon's death.
Two drivers seriously injured in the wreck -- J.R. Hildebrand and Pippa Mann -- were released Monday from the University Medical Center in Las Vegas, said IndyCar.
They're not heavy cars," Wertheim said.
The loop in Las Vegas is 1.5 miles, one mile shorter than the iconic Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
