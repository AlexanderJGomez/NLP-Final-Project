(CNN) -- The mother of a 25-year-old woman killed in a Boston hotel more than a week ago said Friday that she will remain haunted by her daughter's death for the rest of her life.
Police have said that Brisman, a model from New York, advertised as a masseuse on the online classifieds Web site Craigslist.
One of the bullets passed through her heart, killing her, prosecutors said.
She was held at gunpoint and bound, prosecutors said.
McAllister said Markoff "is the wrong man" and "was set up."
In executing a search warrant at Markoff's home, police found a firearm, along with restraints and duct tape, he said.
He said the incident "may be related to similar crimes occurring in the Boston area" but that had not been determined.
