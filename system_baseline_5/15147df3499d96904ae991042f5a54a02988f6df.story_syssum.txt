Chelsea is in the middle of a heroin epidemic.
In Chelsea, according to Betz, the majority of illegal prescription pill sales take place behind closed doors, but a heroin deal can be made in the heart of downtown Chelsea, at a busy part of town called Bellingham Square.
Betz says in Chelsea, one small dose of heroin runs $10 to $40 depending on size and quality.
Betz and his team will use the information to build a case against the dealers and secure search warrants and arrest warrants.
But Betz says Chelsea is not so different from any other town when it comes to drugs.
Betz says small cities often have a tougher battle against drugs than bigger cities because of lower income and resources.
What's more, much of the drug problem in Chelsea doesn't come from inside Chelsea, Betz says.
They come here, and we'll ask them how did you end up here from a suburb of million-dollar homes, and they'll say they got hooked on opiates, they ran out of money, they're not available there like they are here," says Betz, "The easiest way to look at it is, drugs have no borders."
Still, Betz knows that each day is a new day, where the effort to end the heroin problem in Chelsea continues.
