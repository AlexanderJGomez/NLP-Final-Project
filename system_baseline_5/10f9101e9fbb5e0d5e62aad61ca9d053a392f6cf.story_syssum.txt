His Botswana series presents the country from between 50 and 500 feet, providing a unique and captivating view of the savannah.
So it's kind of this hidden airspace to the human eye, and it just immediately struck me as a really powerful visual."
The project started in 2009 when Seckler visited Botswana for another assignment and had some downtime.
Seckler took thousands of photographs of the landscape itself, but found that even with strong compositions, the pure landscapes could become harder to make sense of.
Part of what makes the photos in Botswana work is that they straddle a line somewhere in between.
"For me it was capturing a really unique vision of our world, a beautiful landscape from a unique perspective, and framing moments that create interesting contrast between living things, whether they be animals or flora, and the earth itself."
Seckler says he's been flattered by the response to the series, and credits its positive reception in part to a dearth of public exposure to aerial photography as art.
