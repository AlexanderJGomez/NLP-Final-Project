London (CNN) -- Phone hacking was widespread at the Daily Mirror newspaper when Piers Morgan was its editor, a former employee testified Wednesday, stopping just short of saying Morgan definitely knew about it.
It doesn't necessarily follow that it was unethical," Morgan said.
"Piers Morgan has no additional comments re: the Leveson Inquiry or Heather Mills.
In August, Mills told the BBC that a journalist working for a Mirror Group publication admitted hacking her voice mail.
In the past, Morgan has vigorously denied ordering phone hacking at any point during his career.
Also on Tuesday, Jay, the inquiry lawyer, repeatedly tried to use Morgan's own words against him to show he knew more about hacking than he admitted, citing his books and interviews in print and on the radio.
Much of the inquiry -- and a related police investigation -- focus on allegations of phone hacking by the News of the World.
Testimony by former staff of News of the World and News International last week focused on how much News International chief executive James Murdoch knew about hacking by his employees.
