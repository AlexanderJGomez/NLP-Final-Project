(EW.com) -- Tom Cruise rang in the New Year smiling, as "Mission: Impossible -- Ghost Protocol" led the box office with an estimated $31.3 million over the three-day (Friday to Sunday) weekend.
In second place was "Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," which rose 9 percent for $22.1 million.
This is because the first "Sherlock Holmes" opened on Christmas weekend, thereby inflating its initial figures.
In its first full weekend, Steven Spielberg's equine epic "War Horse" finished fourth with $16.9 million.
Finally, in fifth, was David Fincher's "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo," which rose 28 percent for $16.3 million.
The $90 million adaptation of Stieg Larsson's bestselling novel has so far grossed a decent but somewhat disappointing $57.1 million in 12 days.
