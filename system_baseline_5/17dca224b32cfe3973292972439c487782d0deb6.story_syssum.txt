Washington (CNN) -- "Our foreign policy is just spinning out of control" one senator said.
I don't care," Kerry said when Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a committee veteran, complained of what he predicted would be failed diplomatic efforts on Syria, Iran and Middle East peace.
On Tuesday, Republicans who joined Democrats in backing the resolution last year castigated Kerry and the administration for what they characterized as an ineffective Syria policy.
Obama has rejected any chance of U.S. troops joining the Syrian fight, but Kerry said the President believes arming the opposition could change the Syrian leader's "calculation" of how the conflict will proceed.
Obama had decided back then to attack, Kerry said, and the President's resolve led to the agreement brokered by Russia for Iran to turn over its chemical weapon stockpiles to international control.
"We came up with a better solution -- to get all of them out by working through the diplomatic channel with Russia, and we have an agreement which is now working out with 54% removed" so far, Kerry said to Corker.
Initial sanctions imposed because of Russia's recent move to annex Crimea from Ukraine already had an impact, Kerry said, telling the panel the Russian ruble currency had been devalued by 7%.
To Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the committee's chairman, a main topic was international talks with Iran intended to prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon.
McCain said failure appeared certain for three initiatives under Kerry -- the Geneva agreement for Syrian talks, the ongoing talks on Iran's nuclear ambitions, and the Israel-Palestinian talks.
"We'll see where the reality is as we go down the road here," Kerry responded.
It's a tough issue, but your friend, Teddy Roosevelt, also said that the credit belongs to the people who are in the arena who are trying to get things done, and we're trying to get something done."
