The election of 2004 was seen as a referendum on the Iraq war.
Aznar's replacement, Jose Luis Zapatero, ended the Spanish commitment to Iraq and sundered the close relationship with the United States.
Indeed for a long time, Zapatero seemed not to comprehend that Spain faced any economic challenges at all.
Spain created nearly half of all the net new jobs created across the whole continent of Europe in the years between 2000 and 2005.
Spain had signed up for the euro currency back in the 1990s.
The advent of the euro deprived Spain of that option.
If the price of German goods and services declined inside Spain, then logically the price of Spanish goods and services (including vacations) must have risen to Germans.
By 2008, construction accounted for a staggering 16% of the Spanish economy.
The bubble pops.
That causes a recession, which causes asset values to tumble more, which causes debts to go into default -- and the whole economy painfully unwinds.
It will take a grand rethink of the whole euro currency project, a rethink that either emancipates Spain to quit the euro and export enough to repay its debts or else reduces the debt enough that Spain can sustain its expensive new currency.
