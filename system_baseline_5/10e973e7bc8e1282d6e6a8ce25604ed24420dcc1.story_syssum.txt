Paul Montalbano's testimony in federal court on Tuesday came on the 11th day of proceedings to determine whether Hinckley can spend more time visiting his mother in Virginia and might eventually be released as a permanent outpatient.
Hinckley's experts say his most serious mental diseases are in remission, that he's made progress and can make even more if he's allowed more time outside his mental hospital.
Witnesses for the government say Hinckley is isolated and has made no friends during his trips to Virginia.
The hearing resumes on Wednesday and could conclude this week.
