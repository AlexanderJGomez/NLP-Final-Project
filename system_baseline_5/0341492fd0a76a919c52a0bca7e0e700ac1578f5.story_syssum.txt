Four people died when they contracted listeriosis after consuming celery that had been processed at the SanGar plant, said Carrie Williams, a department spokeswoman.
Six of those cases -- in Bexar, Travis and Hidalgo counties -- were linked to chopped celery processed at the SanGar plant, the state health services department said.
"The FDA and the state have not turned over to us the documentation supporting their findings," Galvan said.
About 100 SanGar workers have been idled by the plant closing, and the company needs to reopen soon if it is to survive, Galvan said.
State health inspectors said they believe the bacteria found in the chopped celery may have contaminated other products at the company's plant.
The strain of bacteria is relatively resilient -- with an incubation period of three to 70 days, Williams said -- and some foods can be contaminated after cooking but prior to packaging.
The state justified its closure of the SanGar plant, citing Texas law that authorizes such actions if conditions pose "an immediate and serious threat to human life or health."
