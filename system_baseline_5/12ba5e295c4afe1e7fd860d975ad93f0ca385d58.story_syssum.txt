The Motofone F3 is a very thin (about 9mm thick) candy bar-style phone with a small e-ink display -- a technology with extremely low power requirements, since it mostly draws power only when the screen changes.
According to Joire, the phone's lithium ion battery "lasts for a month or more on standby, with something like 200 hours of talk time."
Joire was planning to take her "zombie apocalypse" phone to the Burning Man gathering (August 30-September 6 in the Nevada desert).
Also, she plans to blog about her zombie apocalypse phone when she returns.
And of course, program in the numbers of your zombie apocalypse phone tree.
Better to give them a head start early than a head shot later.
