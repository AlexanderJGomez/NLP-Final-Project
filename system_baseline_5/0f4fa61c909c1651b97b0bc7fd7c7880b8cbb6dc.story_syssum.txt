The home side responded to the Windies' first innings of 590 by reaching 281-3 at stumps on Thursday, with Rahul Dravid becoming only the second player after Tendulkar to pass 13,000 runs as he made 82.
Tendulkar, who has scored seven tons against the Caribbean team in all formats of the game, registered his 63rd half-century in Tests as he hit five fours and a six from 133 balls faced.
He survived a scare on 38 when he was dropped by Carlton Baugh.
West Indies have set a big target and it's important to save the follow-on," told the Cricinfo website.
