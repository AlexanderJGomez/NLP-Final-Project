There aren't many NFL players who influenced the game like David "Deacon" Jones.
Clearly, Jones didn't mince words.
"Deacon Jones was one of the greatest players in NFL history," said Redskins General Manager Bruce Allen.
"Jones could split helmets with his head slap, and his outside speed rush was devastating," wrote Paul Zimmerman, aka Dr. Z, in Sports Illustrated.
As a Ram, Jones perfected the head slap.
So effective, the NFL banned it.
It was Deacon Jones."
During his entire time with the NFL, Jones missed just six games.
