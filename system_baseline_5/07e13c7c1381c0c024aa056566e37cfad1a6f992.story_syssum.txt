"It is a sacred thing to create a face," says Wallace Chan, 58, the Chinese artisan jeweler that produced the piece.
The dialogue of gemstone, color and light gives it life.
It's not the first time that Chan has "created" a human face in a jewel.
"When you work from the back of the jewel, right is left, top is bottom and deep becomes shallow.
This is a painstaking process, but for Chan it is also a meditative one.
"My mind is one with the work, and my physical self is removed from the gemstone," he explains.
He also experimented with using gems to fix each other in place, rather than metal settings, as well as new methods of cutting jade.
In the Eighties he began to practice, using cheap crystals.
These pieces of jewelry carry such an aura of exclusivity that it is rare to find a Chan piece on the open market.
Most of his work is sold directly to collectors, who are loath to sell them on.
