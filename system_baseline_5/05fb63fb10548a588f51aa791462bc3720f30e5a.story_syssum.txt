Now that they are home, or soon to be home, our country has a solemn obligation to help them transition back to civilian life.
Today, nearly one in five women who are veterans have delayed or gone without necessary health care in the past year.
Today, one-third of the Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers lack a staff gynecologist and 18% of VA clinics have yet to hire at least one doctor specializing in women's health.
Nonetheless, one in three VA health centers does not have enough sexual trauma specialists on staff.

For example, many are unable to take part in specialized mental health services, such as post-traumatic stress disorder support groups, because child care is unavailable.
