London (CNN) -- The widow of poisoned Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko asserted Tuesday that only a public inquiry will bring her justice in the death of her husband.
On Tuesday, Coroner Sir Robert Owen said he is waiting for a response from the secretary of justice on his petition last week to hold a public inquiry instead of an inquest.
Emmerson charged Tuesday that a foreign office minister made what he said was an "improper approach" to Litvinenko's widow while British Prime Minister David Cameron and Putin met in Sochi, Russia, last month.
Garnham said nothing improper occurred.
In that hearing, Emmerson said Litvinenko was working for the British intelligence service MI6 and had been tasked by MI6 with working also for the Spanish intelligence service as it investigated Russian mafia activities in Spain.
The men were both to provide intelligence to the Spanish prosecutor investigating Russian mafia links to the Kremlin and to Putin, Emmerson said.
"In effect they used a ... radioactive weapon, a weapon of terror against a British citizen in broad daylight in the streets of London endangering lots of other people," Lucas said.
What we do know is that the British government doesn't want to get into detail about how they know about it, and that to me suggests that they were tapping Russian phones, reading Russian diplomatic communications, bugging Russian officers."
