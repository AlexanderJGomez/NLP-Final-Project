Jackson Irungu is quitting Kenya after being targeted for being gay.
There is no way to corroborate such incidents with the police because homosexual Kenyans are just too afraid to report them.
"They have a weapon to which they defend themselves," says Pauline Kimani, a leader of an umbrella organization for gays in Kenya.
A few people defend gay rights on the streets of Nairobi.
"Amongst traditional Kenyan people, it was unheard of," says Pastor Kuchio.
As a result, most homosexuals in the country have to hide their sexual preference for fear of social stigma, say gay activists in Kenya.
But for an openly gay man Kenyan like Irungu, progress is too slow in Kenya.
