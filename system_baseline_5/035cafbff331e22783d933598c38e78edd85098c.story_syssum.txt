The commemoration by the President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins, will take place during the first state visit by an Irish leader to the United Kingdom.
Dan Mulhall, the Irish Ambassador to London, has said that Dublin is "now willing to look at the facts of history" rather than shying away from them.
The spokesperson stressed that both state visits are "pivotal moments in our shared history."
A palace spokesperson said last month that the Queen herself has become a symbol of the warming relationship between the two countries.
