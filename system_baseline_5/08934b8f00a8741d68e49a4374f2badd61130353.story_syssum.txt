(CNN) -- The race is on to locate the latest Banksy on the streets of New York.
Banksy knows that his reputation was made on street corners, not in establishment hang-outs like the auction rooms of London and New York.
Next to each piece is a toll-free number that the finder can call to receive an audio commentary of the work whilst standing in front of it.
The lingering question is: Will anyone locate Banksy himself and publish that picture on Instagram?
