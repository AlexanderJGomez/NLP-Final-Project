A third dramatic image is striking.
Founder Sara Khazem has learned that these young photographers' own lives are not that different from the children they photograph.
A photographer herself, Khazem launched Capturing Neverland in Lebanon when she was just 22 years old, fueled by her passion for photography and her inspiration to help underprivileged children.
For many of these children, this is their first time even holding a camera.
 "I gave one a guitar once," Khazem said.
The children of Capturing Neverland range from eight to 16 years old.
"I love being a photographer who can show the world what I see," wrote one of the children.
The conclusion of the workshop doesn't necessarily mean the children will end their exploration of photography.
Last March Khazem conducted her sixth workshop -- this time in Marrakesh, Morocco -- working with another nongovernmental organization like her own that helps underprivileged children.
That's evident from what some of the children said after finishing the program.
