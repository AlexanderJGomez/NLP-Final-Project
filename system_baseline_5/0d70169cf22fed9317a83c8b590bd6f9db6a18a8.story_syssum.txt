Without identifying any particular group or individuals, Leung said this was not "entirely a domestic movement" and that there was "obviously participation by people, organizations from outside of Hong Kong, in politics in Hong Kong, over a long time.
Leung was speaking in the wake of further clashes over the weekend between protesters and police in the city's Mong Kok district after the authorities attempted to reopen roads in the area to traffic.
Eighteen police officers were injured, Hong Kong police said.
The city's deputy leader, Chief Secretary Carrie Lam, said Saturday that televised talks with pro-democracy protesters would take place on Tuesday, with Lingnan University President Leonard Cheng, a former adviser of Leung, as moderator.
Leung has repeatedly said Beijing will not retract its decision.
Protesters are demanding the freedom to vote for a candidate of their choice and the immediate resignation of Leung.
