Olympic officials claim -- quite falsely -- that they would never mix politics with the games.

Olympic officials have admitted they are afraid to trigger a walkout of Arab countries.
Spitzer, who said, "Hatred and revenge are not a part of me," insisted she fervently believes in the Olympic ideal.
Anouk said of Munich 1972: "We just want one word from the IOC that this wasn't just a regular Olympics, that our fathers were killed there."
The ongoing petition for a moment of silence clearly states that this should not be a political moment.
German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle supports the moment of silence.
In Italy, 125 MPs also signed a letter to the IOC in support of the moment of silence.
