WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The man who revealed that Valerie Plame worked for the CIA said that he was "extraordinarily foolish" to leak her name.
Armitage said he had seen a memo that said Plame was publicly chairing a meeting, so he assumed her CIA employment was not a secret.
However, that doesn't take away from what Mrs. Plame said.
Wilson and Plame have accused Rove and other Bush officials of leaking her identity as a CIA officer in retaliation for her husband's emergence as an administration critic.
