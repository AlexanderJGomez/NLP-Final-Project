But, aware of the program that started this month, Sable took a $4,500 federal credit this week to trade in the Jeep and buy a new, more fuel-efficient Chrysler PT Cruiser.
"I'll never get $9,000 for this old vehicle [any other way].
The exact credit offered through the program --- officially called the Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save Act of 2009, or CARS -- depends on how many more miles per gallon the new vehicle gets.
New cars must have a combined city/highway fuel economy of at least 22 mpg.
Radtke and her husband this month got a $4,500 CARS credit for trading in their 2000 Isuzu Trooper (15 mpg) to buy a new Volkswagen Jetta SportWagen, a diesel-powered car that the program lists as getting 33 mpg.
The couple would have bought a new car without CARS, but the credit probably allowed them to get a nicer car than they otherwise would have, Radtke said.
Also, people looking to get rid of their under-18-mpg vehicle might find they can get about the same or more than a CARS credit by selling it.
Like Sable, Callahan, 39, got $4,500 this week to turn in the old vehicle and buy a new PT Cruiser.
"Without the incentives, I probably wouldn't have purchased a brand new vehicle," Callahan, who runs a science outreach program at the University of Utah, told CNN after filing her iReport.
