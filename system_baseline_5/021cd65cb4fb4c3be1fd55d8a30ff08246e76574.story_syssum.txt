Authorities released two surveillance tapes taken from the front and rear of the Billingses' home.
Investigators believe one motive in the deaths was robbery, but "we believe there are other motives," Morgan said.
Nine of the couple's children were home at the time of the incident, Morgan said, and police believe three of them saw the intruders.
Two of the people in the photo are Sumner and the younger Gonzalez, but authorities want to know who the other man is, Morgan said.
"It leads me to believe that this was a very well-planned and methodical operation," Morgan said.
Asked whether the suspects entered the home planning to kill the couple, Morgan said authorities do not know.
Markham said earlier the family does not know any of the three suspects.
