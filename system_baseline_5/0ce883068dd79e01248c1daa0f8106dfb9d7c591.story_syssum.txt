In this excerpt from his memoir Measure of a Man, Greenfield describes how an encounter with an SS guard at Auschwitz led him to pick up a needle and thread for the first time, and how tragedy taught him the power of clothes.
Martin Greenfield: It was our second day inside Auschwitz.
As soon as my father offered up my skills, two Germans walked toward us to take me away.
I then did something I should not have done, something stupid: I ran.
I snapped my head back over my shoulder and saw the dog closing in.
I shoved his head with both hands.
The two soldiers tromped over to retrieve the dog and make sure he was uninjured.
That day, my second inside Auschwitz, was the last time I ever saw my father.
Still, I grabbed a brush and an SS soldier's shirt and scrubbed hard and fast.
I scrubbed so hard the bristles ripped the collar.
The shirt was trash to the soldier but not to me.
To this day I still don't know why, but when I got up the courage, I slipped the soldier's shirt on and wore it under my striped prisoner uniform.
They wanted to please the Germans, so some of them would be hard on us so the Germans would not punish them.
And so I wore the shirt.
They did for me.
