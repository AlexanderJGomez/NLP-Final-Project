"I really want to go to Southeastern, but if not, I'll have to stay down here," she says while walking along her damaged street.

Amanda, Deshawn, Shantia and Brandon are among the approximately 30,000 students who attend public schools in Orleans and St. Bernard Parish nearly two years after the storm, down from more than 75,000 before Katrina hit.
