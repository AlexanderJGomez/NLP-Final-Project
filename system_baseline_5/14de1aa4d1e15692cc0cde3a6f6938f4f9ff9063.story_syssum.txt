Despite chemotherapy, some breast cancers recur, like a "smoldering fire that flares up," Dr. Otis Brawley said.
By chronic disease, doctors mean "the way we think of diabetes or heart disease as chronic diseases, where people could live in peaceful coexistence with cancer, as opposed to the cancer continuing to advance," said Brawley, who also is CNNhealth.com's conditions expert.
How long it will actually take to cure cancer is anyone's guess, but Obama's initiative is encouraging, he said.
But breast cancer can come back even after 10 years, he said.
"I have many patients who will come back and say, 'Except for the fact that you tell me I have cancer, I don't know it,' " he said.
Some breast cancer patients take medications for 10 years to prevent recurrence, said Dr. Stephanie Hines, physician at the breast center at the Mayo Clinic's Breast Cancer Center in Jacksonville, Florida.
Metastatic lung cancer and metastatic breast cancer, on the other hand, are more likely to one day become "chronic diseases," which would be treated throughout a person's life rather than eliminated, Brawley said.
Cancer specialists compare these breast cancers to "a smoldering fire which flares up every once in a while" and requires more water, Brawley said.
