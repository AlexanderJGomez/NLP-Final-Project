(CNN) -- As Superstorm Sandy slammed into the East Coast on Monday night, one Twitter user in New York City posted a flurry of alarming reports about fallout from the storm -- from plans to shut down all power in Manhattan to floodwaters pouring into the New York Stock Exchange.
"BREAKING: Con Edison has begun shutting down all power in Manhattan," read one tweet.
And he contributed to the confusion surrounding reports, which proved to be false, that the New York Stock Exchange had flooded.
Stuef identified the account owner as Shashank Tripathi, a hedge fund analyst and campaign manager for a candidate for Congress.
He also announced his resignation from the campaign of Republican Christopher Wight, who is seeking New York's 12th Congressional seat.
In a statement posted Wednesday afternoon on his campaign site, Wight said he was "shocked and disgusted" by Tripathi's behavior.
At least one elected official has asked that criminal charges be considered in the case.
New York City Councilman Peter Vallone says he has asked the Manhattan district attorney's office to look into the possibility that Tripathi's tweets were the digital equivalent of shouting "Fire!"
