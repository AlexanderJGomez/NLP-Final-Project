Stephens' lawsuit is "meritless and barred by the statute of limitations," Clash lawyer Michael Berger told CNN Tuesday.
"I am a gay man," Clash, 52, said in a statement in November.
Each lawsuit contends that the men only realized in the last year or so that they suffered psychological and emotional damage from their encounters with Clash.
"Clash smoked crystal meth while engaging in sexual activity with Sheldon," the lawsuit said.
Clash resigned from his job on "Sesame Street" after the first lawsuit was filed in November.
