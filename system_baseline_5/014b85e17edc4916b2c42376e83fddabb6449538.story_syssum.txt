For years, professional surfer and cancer survivor Dean Randazzo has been among those in the frigid waters, wearing a full wet suit, hoodie, gloves and booties.
"He has absolutely paved the way for any surfer that wants to become a professional from New Jersey," says DePhillipo.
Randazzo became a professional surfer in 1990, yet he still couldn't find a sponsor to support him.
"Dean has paved the way," DePhillipo says, "There's never been a surfer from New Jersey or the Northeast that's made the World Tour."
Currently residing in California, Randazzo frequently returns to New Jersey.
But as Randazzo or actually any Jersey surfer will tell you, the passion doesn't waiver with the weather.
