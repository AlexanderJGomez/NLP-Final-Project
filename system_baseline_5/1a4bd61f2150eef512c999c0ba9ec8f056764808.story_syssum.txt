The 397-meter long vessel was running on a low-sulfur fuel while in port, something its owners say reduces toxic sulfur dioxide emissions by 85%.
"The bigger the ship the lower the fuel consumption, that's one thing," said Thomas Riber Knudsen, Asia Pacific CEO of shipping line Maersk.
So far the most toxic of pollutants from ships, like sulfur dioxide, have been the main focus of the IMO program and also other regional regulations.
Its Green Shipping Initiative offer incentives such as reduced port fees for ships in return for using low-sulfur fuel.
However the company's managing director, Chew Hwee Hong is sanguine about the potential for any green shipping technology to succeed without the push of uniform regulations.
"I would say a good 95% of (shipping industry green initiatives) is incentivized or is driven by international regulations," he said.
There is a genuine commitment to the ecological cost but I suppose the fact that we have a very strong economic reason to take action adds to the urgency."
