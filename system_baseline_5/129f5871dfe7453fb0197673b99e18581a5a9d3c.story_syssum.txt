(CNN)Dozens of militants -- believed to be ISIS members -- attacked several Iraqi security posts and checkpoints in western Iraq's Anbar province Tuesday morning, leaving at least 11 people dead and 18 others wounded, security officials in Iraq said.
Also Tuesday, ISIS militants attacked the Albu Risha police station in northern Ramadi, killing several police officers and injuring at least two other people, the security officials said.
Anbar is home to Al Asad Air Base, where 320 U.S. troops, mostly Marines, are stationed as part of an effort to advise and assist Iraqi forces fighting ISIS.
