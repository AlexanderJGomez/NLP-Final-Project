(CNN) -- One person was killed and dozens injured after unrest broke out overnight at an Australian detention center for asylum seekers on a remote island in Papua New Guinea, authorities said Tuesday.
The unrest on Manus overnight followed "low-level demonstrations" at the center on the island, Morrison said.
Most of those hurt in the riots have been treated locally, but two severely injured people are being transferred to Australia, Morrison said.
The person who was killed suffered a head injury outside the center and died on the way to a hospital, he said.
