Kaka waves to supporters during Milan's match with Fiorentina on Saturday.
Milan's supporters are on Kaka's side, because they believe it is club officials who want to sell him.
"Hands off Kaka" read one banner, while another said: "I thought the devil could not sell its soul, but I was wrong," referring to Milan's devil's head logo.
Likewise, the 5,000 supporters who signed a petition to keep the Brazilian star in Milan would have to pay $100 a week each to match the offer.
"I belong to money" it read, referring to the "I belong to Jesus" t-shirt Kaka has displayed occasionally after scoring a goal.
Was he saying goodbye to them -- or to a $150 million move to Manchester?
