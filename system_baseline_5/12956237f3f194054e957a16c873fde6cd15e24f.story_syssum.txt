Atlanta (CNN) -- A Georgia judge Friday dismissed an emergency motion filed by the ex-wife of music mogul Usher Raymond seeking temporary custody of their son.
The judge then addressed Usher's ex-wife, Tameka Foster Raymond: "Your standards for caregivers are rather high," Goger said, pointing out that most people have been watched by a grandmother or aunt.
Foster Raymond also said Usher does not keep her informed about who is taking of their children or the doings in the children's lives.
Foster Raymond said Usher's aunt is incapable of keeping up with the two children.
She kept repeating "that's chaos" as she wiped her eyes, and the judge told her to get off the stand.
When asked by Foster Raymond's attorney if she can pick up more than 25 pounds, Oden said: "Sometimes, it just depends on how my back is feeling.
Five-year-old Usher Raymond V is recovering from Monday's accident at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Hospital, according to the lawyer for Foster Raymond.
That case hadn't been heard by the time the swimming pool accident happened Monday, so Foster Raymond filed Tuesday for an emergency hearing on the matter.
