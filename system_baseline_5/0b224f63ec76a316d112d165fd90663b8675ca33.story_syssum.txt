Tianjin, China (CNN) -- In a gleaming classroom at Chong Hua High School in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin, students peer at onion slices under microscopes.
For more than a decade, the Chinese government has selected tens of thousands of top minority students from Xinjiang and placed them in high schools in eastern China -- the heartland of the Han, the country's biggest ethnic group.
After passing a strict entrance exam Mamat joined the Xinjiang class.
"We are just building future talent," says Li Zhenchong.
"The political goal is to try and create a patriotic ethnic minority cadre pool that will hopefully go back to Xinjiang and serve the Party state," says Professor James Leibold, a political scientist at Australia's Latrobe University.
He says the Party could be failing.
For Mamat, the Xinjiang Class is the only opportunity to get a strong education and he says he wants to go to college and then back to his home to develop the region.
