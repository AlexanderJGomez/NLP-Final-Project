In a country where bleaching creams are frequently used to chemically lighten skin tone, one savvy entrepreneur is fighting against the disfiguring practice.
Alhaji Mustapha Oti Boateng: I started with Chocho cream -- the natural skin restorer and beauty soap.
AB: My father was a herbalist and my grandfather was a herbalist I tried to recall all those things that when I was young they sent me to the bush to collect.
AB: They gave me the opportunity to go and I traveled to Japan where I started odd jobs...
I came back with about five buses and started a transport business, but unfortunately for me it was all accidents, one after the other.
AB: This name "Chocho" is in the memory of a dear friend, who has passed on.
AB: The economy is always fluctuating.
AB: I'm not educated but I'm always happy when I see children in school.
AB: Nobody should think that because they didn't go to a classroom to sit on a chair I'm not educated.
We can always educate ourselves wherever we go.
