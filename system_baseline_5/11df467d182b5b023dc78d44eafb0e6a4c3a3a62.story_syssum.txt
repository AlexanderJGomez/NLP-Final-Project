(CNN) -- Here's what Katie Roche expected when she went into the hospital for spine surgery: two titanium rods, a bone graft, 17 screws in her vertebrae, eight hours in the operating room, and a week's stay in the hospital to recover.
The study looked at 10.5 million pediatric patients from 1997 to 2006, of whom 21,274, or 0.2%, had C. diff, as the bacteria are commonly called.
What's really disturbing, he says, is that these children didn't have to get sick.
Doctors found Katie had an infection -- not C. diff, but another bacterium -- and did a surgery to clear it up.
"I was throwing up all the time, and was so weak that one day I just blacked out in my hospital bed," she remembers.

"There should be no difference whatsoever between precautions for the parents and precautions for the staff," Pronovost says.
"But the reality is it's your child's life on the line, so it's worth taking a risk."
