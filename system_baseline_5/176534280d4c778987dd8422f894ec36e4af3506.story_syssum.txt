It all started in 2004 when the late Abu Musab al-Zarqawi formed an al Qaeda splinter group in Iraq.
Its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi said his group will now be known as Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant.
The 'L' stands for Levant which is a translation of "al-Sham" -- the word the group uses to refer to itself, Bergen said.
Khalidi said: "How you translate 'al-Sham' determines whether you have an 'L' or an 'S' in English.
ISIS is an English translation of  the acronym in Arabic for Al-Dawla Al-Islamiya fi al-Iraq wa al-Sham, or the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham.
CNN has been referring to the organization as ISIS, shorthand for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
It is the straight Arabic shorthand for the group known as: al-Dawla al-Islamiya fi Iraq wa al-Sham, commonly used in the Arab world and among many Arab media outlets and politicians.
"Those who disagree with them, call them DAIISH," Khalidi said, adding that the jihadists have objected to the name.
