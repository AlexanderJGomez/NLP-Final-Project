(CNN) -- My friend Brian Hull and I were both born 40 years ago today.
In our class, it was me and Brian.
Over time, we became friends.
One day in ninth-grade Spanish class, he rebelled against Miss Kahn's selected topic of conversation and instead suggested that we discuss the ongoing battle over Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court.
To this day, when I'm in an uncomfortable social situation, I'll wonder, "How would Brian Hull handle this?"
Whatever the reason, the absences and missed assignments were taking a toll, and things came to a head in English class.
In the movie version, this is where I would say that he aced that exam and got his act together and excelled at everything he did thereafter, and it was all because of a little help from his friend who was born on the same day.
I do know that he eventually pulled things together and that we both survived high school and moved on with our lives.
This is the 18th birthday he's missed.
I think about whatever is going on in my life at the time, and how trivial it all suddenly seems.
He wrote in my yearbook junior year, "I'll give you a call over the summer, and maybe we can go play a championship-like tennis match at a court within close proximity.
We never played tennis, and we never saw each other over that summer.
When I think about him today, I wonder who the other Brians in my life are right now -- am I squandering any opportunities to play tennis with them or see them over the summer?
