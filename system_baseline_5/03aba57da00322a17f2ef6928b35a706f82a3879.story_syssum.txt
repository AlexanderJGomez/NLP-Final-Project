So how do you become a Davos delegate?
Unless you're an anchor for one of the many broadcasters covering the event; an academic; a faith leader; a Young Global Leader (young people with great potential selected by the WEF from all fields of business); a social entrepreneur; or from an NGO, the average cost to a business to send each delegate is close to a whopping $20,000.
However corporate CEOs may choose to come by helicopter, which costs around $9,500 for a return flight.
Finding accommodation in Davos during the week of the World Economic Forum is not easy, with a limited number of large hotels.
With all the above boxes ticked, it is essential to have a plan once you have run the gauntlet of airport-style security -- there are 4,000 Swiss troops in Davos this week -- and made it inside the newly-extended Congress Center with the correct color of identity pass.
$40,000-per head well spent.
