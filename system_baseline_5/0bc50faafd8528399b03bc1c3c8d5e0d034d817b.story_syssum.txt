In April, video of a U.S. military helicopter strike in Iraq that killed two Reuters journalists raised questions about the attack, as well as how WikiLeaks got the military tapes.
"All the information in a society, all the happenings in a society, is relevant to choosing to support" a government, political parties and particular leaders, Assange said in an interview posted on WikiLeaks on June 1.
At the same time, Assange said, WikiLeaks always provides to the public all the video or documents available so that viewers can decide for themselves.
Assange, an Australian journalist depicted in media reports as a former computer hacker, described WikiLeaks in a January interview as run by five or so full-time people supported by hundreds of volunteers.
For its own legal troubles, Assange said, WikiLeaks relies on lawyers donated by mainstream media outlets including The Associated Press and the Los Angeles Times.
A U.S. Army intelligence analyst was arrested two months later, allegedly for leaking classified military information, the U.S. military said.
Now Assange is described as living on the run, and the Iceland Parliament has passed a proposal intended to make the country a haven for whistle-blowers such as WikiLeaks.
