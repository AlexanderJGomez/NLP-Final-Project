Attorney Joe Tacopina said Rodriguez was one of many athletes who consulted for Biogenesis.
When asked why he wouldn't say unequivocally that Rodriguez didn't use performance-enhancing drugs, Tacopina again cited confidentiality considerations.
"...
"While we believe that your public comments are already in breach of the confidentiality provisions of Major League Baseball's Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program (the "Program"), we will agree to waive those provisions as they apply to both Rodriguez and the Office of Commissioner of Baseball with respect to Rodriguez's entire history under the Program, including, but not limited to, his testing history, test results, violations of the Program, and all information and evidence relating to Rodriguez's treatment by Anthony Bosch, Anthony Galea and Victor Conte," he wrote.
