"However hard airlines try, the reputation of food on board planes is not very high," says Peter Jones, former chair of the International Travel Catering Association.
"Clearly, celebrity chefs are hugely successful and airlines are trying to overcome this stereotypical view of their food being unpalatable or stodgy," adds Jones, who is now professor in hospitality management at the University of Surrey in the UK.
"Airlines select products to go on their planes that are consistent with their brand image and the celebrity chef is another factor that makes up a portfolio of an airline's brands," says Jones.
"It contributes to the 'we care for you' and 'we-offer-great-service' feeling some airlines are trying to create," says 't Hart.
Some airlines, including Turkish Airlines and Etihad, are going one step further and bringing chefs on board to cook and prepare meals whilst in flight, he adds.
He adds that the technology on a plane is limited and the safety considerations of cooking whilst in the air means that those charged with preparing food on board will be restricted in what they are able to create.
