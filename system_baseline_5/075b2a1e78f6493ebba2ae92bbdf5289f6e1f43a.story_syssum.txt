Harold Henthorn, 58, appeared before a federal judge in Denver on Thursday to face a first-degree murder charge in the death of Toni Henthorn, who died after falling off a cliff in Rocky Mountain National Park in September 2012.
Harold Henthorn said his wife's death came when she slipped while taking a picture.
A federal indictment says Harold Henthorn "willfully, deliberately, maliciously, and with premeditation and malice" killed Toni Henthorn, a 50-year-old ophthalmologist.
Bertolet said the family was immediately suspicious about the death because Harold Henthorn kept changing his story about what happened.
Bertolet said it wasn't until after his sister's death that his family learned the details surrounding the death of Harold Henthorn's first wife.
His sister was living in Mississippi when she met Henthorn on the Internet, and he was in Colorado, Bertolet said.
Bertolet said Harold Henthorn controlled the couple's finances.
If convicted in the death of Toni Henthorn, Harold Henthorn faces life in prison without parole and up to a $250,000 fine.
