Earlier this week, European Union data watchdogs, fighting to protect our privacy in an age of big data, put pressure on Google over the privacy of user information.
And in the same way that a future in which "promethean" data companies like Google rule the world now appears strange.
The EU is concerned about the way in which Google has, since last March, been pooling the data of its individual users across its popular services like search, Gmail, Google+ and YouTube in order to bundle them up for advertisers.
But in the eyes of the EU, those of us using products like YouTube, Gmail or Google+ are being, to borrow a Microsoft coined neologism, "Scroogled" by Google's new privacy policy.
But Google Glass opens an entirely new front in the digital war against privacy.
But there's something particularly troubling about Google Glass.
According to Google co-founder Sergey Brin, quoted by tech website Mashable, "Glass will also have an automatic picture-taking mode, snapping pics at a preset intervals (such as every 5 seconds)."
And the terabytes of data sucked up every five seconds by its omniscient glasses will, of course, flow to Google.
And Google Glass could, I fear, become the focal point for all our data in a world where privacy no longer exists.
You see, the whole point of Google Glass is actually to successfully engineer serendipity.
After all, when we wear these devices, those clever engineers at Google will know where we are all the time.
But what to do?
No, Google Glass must be opaque.
