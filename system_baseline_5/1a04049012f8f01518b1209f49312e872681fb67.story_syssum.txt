The Vatican has been under fire since Pope Benedict XVI lifted the excommunication of Bishop Richard Williamson almost two weeks ago, days after Swedish Public Television broadcast an interview in which Williamson said the Nazis had not systematically murdered 6 million Jews during World War II.
Williamson's position on the Holocaust is "absolutely unacceptable and firmly rejected by the Pope," Bertone said.
"I believe that the historical evidence is strongly against -- is hugely against -- 6 million Jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of Adolf Hitler," Williamson said in the Swedish interview, which also appeared on various Web sites after broadcast.
Williamson and three other bishops who belong to the Society of Saint Pius X were excommunicated by Pope John Paul II in 1988.
Ruckdaeschel decided to launch his investigation in Regensburg because the Williamson interview was conducted at a seminar of the Society of Saint Pius X, of which Williamson is a member, in the nearby town of Zaitzkofen.
The pope -- who was born in Germany and was a child during the Nazi period -- rejected Holocaust denial in public statements on January 28.
