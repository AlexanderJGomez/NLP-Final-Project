McKenna Pope's Change.org petition earned more than 40,000 signatures and the support of celebrity chefs who backed her request to change the Easy-Bake Ultimate Oven's girl-centric pink and purple packaging to include boys, too.
The company did not say whether it would change the packaging to include boys in its marketing.
Now, boys and girls can choose any color oven they want!"
Others, including the Toy Industry Association, said toys come in different colors based on feedback from consumers and retailers.
