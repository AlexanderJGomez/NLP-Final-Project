(CNN) -- Russian tennis chief Shamil Tarpischev apologized Saturday for referring to Serena and Venus Williams as the "Williams brothers" during a TV chat show.
"The statements made by Shamil Tarpischev on Russian television with respect to two of the greatest athletes in the history of women's tennis are insulting, demeaning and have absolutely no place in our sport," she said.
"Serena and Venus (Williams) are without doubts outstanding athletes," he said in a statement released by Russia's tennis federation.
Meanwhile, Serena Williams was handed a tough task when the draw was made Saturday for the WTA Tour Finals in Singapore.
He beat Viktor Troicki of Serbia 6-4 6-3 and will play rival and top seed David Ferrer in the final.
Only three spots are still on offer for the finals after U.S. Open winner Marin Cilic booked his place by reaching the semifinals of the Kremlin Cup.
