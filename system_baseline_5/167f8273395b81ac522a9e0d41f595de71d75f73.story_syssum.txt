(CNN) -- Nokia is getting into the tablet business.
The Lumia 2520 tablet will cost $499 and run Windows RT 8.1, a limited variation of the Windows 8 operating system that uses that system's tile-based touchscreen feature.
The Nokia Camera app is getting an update across all Nokia devices.
It's unclear what kind of different direction Nokia's products will take when Microsoft is fully in charge, and where the new 2520 tablet will fit in with Windows own similar Surface line.
Instead of making an Android-based smartphone like most non-Apple companies, Nokia took a bet on a third operating system, Windows Phone 8.
Nokia also announced three new Asha devices on Tuesday.
Aimed at developing markets, they can also hold a charge for up to a month.
