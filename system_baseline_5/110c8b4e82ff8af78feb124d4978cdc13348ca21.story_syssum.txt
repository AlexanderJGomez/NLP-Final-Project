Pauley had been leading an 18-strong patrol of the United States First Armored Division in the city of Tal Afar when he was hit by the blast.
Private First Class Jody Missildine of Plant City, Florida, just 19 years of age, had died that day, April 8, 2006 and Pauley blamed himself.
"I battled three or four years of just helplessness, anxiety and depression, until I was introduced to the Wounded Warriors Project," Pauley says.
He suffered other life-threatening injuries, and a lacerated liver, spending months in the Walter Read Army Medical Center in Washington where Pauley would be sent two years later.
Like Pauley, his army days were over and with discharge came the same sense of helplessness and loss.
On Monday, slice or no slice, both will be hoping to take their "A game" to a nationwide tournament which has the express purpose of raising money for the Wounded Warriors charity.
"We've hit a chord within the golfing community," Hill tells CNN.
Pauley recalled in his personal blog the moment he first saw Missildine's grave site, writing: "I was cold, nearly shivering.
Lara, who works full-time for Wounded Warriors, will perform similar speaking duties at 1757 Golf Club in Dulles, Virginia before showing off his golfing skills.
Lara is thankful for his every moment after his near brush with death, and always thankful to Wounded Warriors from rescuing him from the depths of despair.
Having already presented a check for $735,000 in January, Hill hopes this year's fundraising will break through the $1 million mark.
"It's a great way to raise money and awareness for the Warriors, " Lara says.
