Baghdad (CNN) -- Violence across Iraq has claimed nine lives in the past two days, officials with the nation's interior ministry said Monday.
In northeastern Baghdad's al-Shaab neighborhood, a roadside bomb exploded near a minibus Monday, killing one civilian and wounding five others, the officials said.
They had been closed for four months.
One of al-Nujaifi's bodyguards was wounded, the interior ministry officials said.
Five civilians were wounded in a roadside bombing in eastern Baghdad on Monday, and two employees of a security company were wounded in another roadside bombing in southeastern Baghdad.
However, assassinations, gunfire and bombs remain regular occurrences.
