(WIRED)  -- When Microsoft and Facebook announced that they were partnering to integrate Facebook and Bing for social network-powered search, it confirmed something I thought Monday: Windows Phone 7 is the real Facebook phone.
Every aspect of Windows Phone 7 is geared to social networks: phone, contacts, gaming, photos, even Office.
Microsoft tried to explicitly build a social networking phone featuring Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and MySpace with the Kin.
Microsoft's Joe Belfiore outlined a scenario where users could take a photo on their phone that's then uploaded to Facebook automatically, without even opening the Facebook app.
It's the exact strategy that Zuckerberg outlined in his interview with Michael Arrington, where he explained why Facebook wasn't building its own phone.
In order to do that, Zuckerberg explained, you need to find a company that was willing to incorporate social networking from the operating system up -- not just adding a layer on top of it was already doing, but making that the focus of the device and its services.
In order to get outside of itself, Microsoft partnered with Facebook early on -- it still owns part of the company -- and Facebook helped shape Microsoft's social strategy.
And Bing is already embedded in Facebook, in the form of maps and search results.
And search is one of just three buttons on every WP7 phone.
The Xbox people were showing how to chat about a Netflix movie with your Facebook friends on Xbox live.
The only places where Microsoft and Facebook are "underdogs" are search and smartphones.
