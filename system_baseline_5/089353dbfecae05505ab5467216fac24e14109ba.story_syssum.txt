If we could see off camera, we might see Bieber's attorney subtly shaking his head in frustration.
What is a deposition?
But a deposition is not a trial.
An argumentative witness like Bieber is a dream come true for his opponent.
Watch, for example, when he answers: "Guess what?
You can't answer if you don't know the question:  Bieber can be seen interrupting questions to answer.
Depositions are not soapboxes:  At a deposition, you will never "show up" the other side's lawyers.
Bieber."
At a deposition, the lawyer asks the questions, not the witness.
Bieber may not like the questions, but he takes his chances with the judge if he refuses to answer.
Bieber's opponent benefits from each additional word Bieber says, because that's part of another sentence the singer needs to testify consistently with at trial.
In text form, sarcasm doesn't read like sarcasm:  Sarcasm is using words to indicate (sarcastically) the opposite of what you really want to say.
For the most part, you're on your own: Bieber's lawyer actively objected to protect his client, but deponents often feel like their lawyers aren't getting involved enough.
He can object "for the record," which means the judge can later decide if the answer is ultimately admissible at trial.
Bieber appears on the video to really think about the meaning of the questions and his answers.
