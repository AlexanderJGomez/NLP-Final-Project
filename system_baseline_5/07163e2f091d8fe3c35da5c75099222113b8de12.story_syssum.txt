The justices aren't weighing the fate of the entire statute this time.
Those bringing the case say that the words "established by the State" in a subsection of the law make clear that subsidies are only available to those living in the 16 states that set up their own exchanges.
They say the IRS -- one of the agencies charged with implementing the law -- was wrong to offer tax credits to individuals who live in states that only have federally run exchanges.
But when only a few states acted, the IRS tried to "fix" the law and wrote a rule allowing subsidies for those living in states with state-run exchanges as well as states with federally run exchanges.
Congressional opponents of the ACA such as Republican Sens.
Verrilli said it was "abundantly clear" that some states would not establish their own exchanges and that if the challengers win, those living in states with federally facilitated exchanges would "face the very death spirals the Act was structured to avoid."
Those living in states with their own exchanges would not be in danger of losing their subsidies as a result of a ruling against the government.
The crux of their argument is that if it were not for the tax credits for premiums, they could not afford health insurance and thus would be exempt from the individual mandate to purchase health insurance.
As things stand now, however, the government has not pressed the issue before the Supreme Court.
