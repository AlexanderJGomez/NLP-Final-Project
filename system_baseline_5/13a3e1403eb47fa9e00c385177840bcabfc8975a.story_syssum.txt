At the Santa Clarita Studios in Valencia, California -- about 30 miles north of Los Angeles -- some staffers weren't able to get to work Monday, due to traffic on area roadways and concern about their homes, according to Variety.
The show was shooting at a Marine Corps air station in Irvine, about 40 miles southeast of Los Angeles, and had to cancel filming at 7:30 a.m. at one of the base's hangars due to smoke from the Santiago fire.

A number of upscale Los Angeles-area lodgings, including the Peninsula and Four Seasons hotels in Beverly Hills, reported a flurry of bookings, according to Variety.
Those guests might not be able to stay long, though: with a number of group bookings scheduled for later in the week, the walk-in guests may have to find other arrangements.
Malibu, one of the areas most directly affected by the fires, is the home of a number of celebrities, including Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson, Mel Gibson, Jennifer Aniston, Victoria Principal and Sting.
Sean Penn has lost two trailers to the fires, according to the TV show "Access Hollywood."
The fire has shut down a stretch of the Pacific Coast Highway that runs through the area.
