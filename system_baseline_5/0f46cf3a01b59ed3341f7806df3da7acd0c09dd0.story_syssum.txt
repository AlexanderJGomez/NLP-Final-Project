Washington (CNN) -- The Department of Defense announced Tuesday that capital charges have been refiled against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other alleged co-conspirators in the September 11, 2001, conspiracy to allow prosecution before a military commission at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, naval base.
In military terminology he is the convening authority of the military commissions, the equivalent of a civilian criminal court.
The Obama administration had considered transferring some terror suspects to the United States for prosecution in either special military or civilian courts.
