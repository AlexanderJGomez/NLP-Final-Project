(CNN) -- "Our Nixon" is mostly comprised of Super 8 home movies made by three of President Nixon's closest aides: H.R.
Dwight Chapin also told us that they had planned to donate copies to the official presidential records.
But the home movies took an unexpected path during the Watergate investigation, when the FBI confiscated the contents of Ehrlichman's office, including a box of a duplicate set (copies) of the home movies.
Congress was concerned that Nixon would destroy papers relevant to the Watergate investigation, so it passed the Presidential Records and Materials Preservation Act of 1974 ("PRMPA"), 44 U.S.C.
While the Supreme Court ultimately upheld the PRMPA, it did not determine whether Nixon was entitled to compensation for his papers.
In 1980, Nixon filed an action for just compensation under the Takings Clause, which he eventually won, after more than a decade of litigation.Nixon v. U.S., 978 F.2d 1269 (1992).
Under the PRMPA regulations, purely personal material was removed from the home movies and returned to Haldeman, Ehrlichman and Chapin.
We paid for the National Archives to make standard definition video transfers of the preservation negative, and we began editing "Our Nixon" with these.
Since at the time the Nixon Library did not have a budget allocated to apply their standard 16mm inter-negative preservation technique to this collection, and since we desperately wanted to use it in our film, we proposed to pay for archival-quality digital scans.
This suited both our needs as filmmakers and the Nixon Library's interest in experimenting with an affordable method of digital film preservation.
