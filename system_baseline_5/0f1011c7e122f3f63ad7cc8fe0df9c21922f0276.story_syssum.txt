MUMBAI, India (CNN) -- Shweta Gupta knows exactly what kind of groom she wants: he should be educated, well settled and live in a good location --- one that must be in India.
Why?
"Many Indians working abroad have come back due to recession hitting foreign countries and I don't think recession has affected India that much," said said.
Arranged marriages are still the norm in India and parents play an active role in choosing a life partner for their children.
Shweta Gupta is currently pursuing an MBA in Mumbai and is confident of getting good job offers in India --- another reason she would not want to risk that by going abroad.
So, who is in?
"It will be a help -- more than a help -- to have a working partner," he said.
"My marriage should be fun, it should be remembered by all people," she said.
