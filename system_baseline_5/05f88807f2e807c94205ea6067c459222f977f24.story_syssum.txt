(CNN) -- Climate scientists are getting desperate.
The immediate trigger for the letter Virginia State Attorney General Kenneth T. Cuccinelli's recent demand that climate scientist Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State University, produce a large volume of paperwork related to his scientific research and communications with fellow scientists during his years at University of Virginia from 1999 to 2005.
It's also made Mann a target for those who don't want to admit that global warming is a real problem.
Mann testified about his work in the U.S. Congress in 2003, in hearings sponsored by Sen. James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, who has called global warming a "hoax."
Perhaps no scientific name is more associated with global warming than Roger Revelle, mentor to Al Gore, who first warned of the risks of human-caused climate change in the 1950s.
In 1992, a paper was released that claimed Revelle had changed his mind about global warming and no longer believed it was a problem.
But it isn't just climate scientists who have been vilified, personally attacked, and threatened with lawsuits and congressional investigations.
If you tried to argue that global warming is not a market failure, you'd just look silly.
Science is arcane and scientists are frankly often incomprehensible.
The real crime is that our best science is being undermined by ideologues, confusing us about some of the most important issues of our time.
