(CNN) -- Inmates at a prison in Cuba have made a set of hidden-camera videos to expose the conditions there, publicizing the filth and decrepitude of the facilities despite the risk of retribution.
The videos -- obtained by CNN through a dissident journalist -- show derelict cell blocks overlooking a seedy exercise yard.
Combinado del Este is a Cuban maximum security prison about 10 miles southeast of Havana.
CNN cannot verify the authenticity of the videos, obtained through Dania Virgen Garcia, a dissident journalist in Cuba whose blog is called Cuba por Dentro.
And in the long term, he added, the prisoners may believe it is worth the risk to make the videos and publicize their conditions.
Getting attention is a way of forcing the government not to mistreat you."
