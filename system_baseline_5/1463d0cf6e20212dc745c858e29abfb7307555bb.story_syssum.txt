Virgin chief Richard Branson has put a time frame on his plan to launch tourists into space, claiming he and his family will blaze a trail for hundreds of fare-paying passengers by blasting off in December 2013.
Virgin executives said the figure was a milestone as it exceeds the existing number of space veterans.
"The initial flights will be sub-orbital, which will give people a taste of space," he said.
Outlining details of his new satellite service, LauncherOne, Branson said the two-stage rocket would also be carried into launching position by WhiteKnightTwo.
"Some people will want to focus their time looking out of the vehicle, looking down at the planet or Milky Way, whereas others may want to do spins or tricks," Whitesides told CNN.
My guess is it will be as simple as saying 'OK everybody; get back in your seats.
Branson, meanwhile, confessed he hadn't yet planned his time in space.
Adam Wells, Virgin Galactic's head of design, said the cabin's interior was being kept as minimal as possible to reduce weight and maximize space for floating.
He will be the first Portuguese poet to be read in space.
As Virgin Galactic's chief pilot, David Mackay is likely to helm the first flights and may even break records for space travel as he clocks up at least one voyage per week when the service is up and running.
