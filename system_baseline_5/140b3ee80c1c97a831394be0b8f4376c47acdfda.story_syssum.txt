Radar data from air traffic control can provide tracking data that will indicate the flight path, altitude and direction the A320-200 followed.
With Malaysia 370, radar data was sketchy; satellite data has been the primary source in determining the track and thus the search area.
Airline pilots always attempt complete avoidance, steering a wide berth around thunderstorms.
And let's not be misled by the reported request of Flight 8501 asking air traffic control for a higher altitude.
Yes, it is possible to "top" a thunderstorm cell, but most airline pilots attempt to turn away from the weather because turbulence can still be encountered above a building storm cell.
Perhaps a high altitude stall occurred and the airplane never recovered.
For the moment, I am keeping my fingers crossed that a search and rescue operation will find survivors.
