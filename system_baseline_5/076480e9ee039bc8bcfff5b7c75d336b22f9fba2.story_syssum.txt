At almost any other school in the country, the 11-year-old friends would be in fifth grade.
The move to do away with grade levels throughout the Adams County School District began three years ago.
"Every single student is getting an individualized education," said Hodgkins Principal Sarah Gould, who helped usher in the reform at her school two years ago.
Unlike traditional schools, students at Hodgkins can move up a learning level anytime they're ready, not just at the end of the year.
"The time is right for a system that focuses on individual students and lets them progress at their own pace," said education researcher Robert Marzano, who is helping the district develop standards-based learning, a system that was first introduced in the 1960s.
School board president Vicky Marshall said the district needed something drastic to turn it around.
That's just not going to happen," she said.
Standards-based learning in the Adams County School District is currently in place in kindergarten through ninth grade, and will be integrated through all high schools by 2014.
Of the approximately 300 schools that have attempted to enact this system, Battino said, half haven't been able to stick with it.
School Board President Vicky Marshall explained that it would take three to five years for any type of major reform to show results.
Discipline problems, Gould said, have decreased 76% in the past two years -- a sign, she said, that the system is working.
