That's more than the 45% who said they opposed same-sex nuptials.
"There's been a huge swing in the last decade," said Jones.
"I join with many across the spectrum of American faith communities in my hope that the Court's ruling will permit same-sex marriage in all 50 states," the Very Rev.
In a reverse of traditional arguments against gay marriage, some members of these groups say their religious rights will be curtailed if states do not allow them to perform same-sex nuptials.
Despite vocal opposition from the U.S. Catholic Bishops, for example, 60% of Catholics now favor same-sex marriage.
While 36% supported same-sex marriage in 2003, now 62% do.
Separate surveys conducted by PRRI and other groups show much of the newfound religious support for same-sex marriage is coming from younger Americans.
Politicians may pivot on same-sex marriage, but Bible-believing Christians should not -- even if public opinion turns against them, said Denny Burk, a professor at Boyce College, a Southern Baptist school in Louisville, Kentucky.
Still, Burk said he doesn't doubt that more millennials accept same-sex marriage, and he fully expects the Supreme Court to legalize gay weddings countrywide this June when the justices render a decision in Obergefell v. Hodges.
