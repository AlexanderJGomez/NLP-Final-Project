(CNN) -- A few dozen protesters picketed the restaurants of acclaimed chef Thomas Keller last weekend, over his use of an ingredient that has become a lightning rod in the culinary world -- foie gras.
"We are the easiest target in the world for a couple of reasons, one our accent, it's called foie gras, it's a French word," Daguin tells CNN.
The liver, in the center of the bird's body, stores fat the bird traditionally uses on long migratory flights.
D'Artagnan gets its foie gras from Hudson Valley Foie Gras, two hours north of New York City, which produces about 375,000 pounds of the delicacy a year.
"The idea that you can produce the products that we produce -- that are a delicacy -- by mistreating animals is just completely, it's inconceivable," Henley says.
"When we force-feed ducks and geese and we stop the force-feeding, the liver recesses to normal," Daguin says.
Those opposing the production of foie gras have succeeded in getting California to adopt a law that will make it illegal to serve or produce in 2012.
But foie gras producers say they're being targeted by people whose ultimate goal is a meat-free world.
Chef Dan Barber, inspired by the work of a Spanish foie gras producer, Eduardo Sousa, has begun experimenting with  "ethical foie gras,"  harvested from geese allowed to roam Stone Barns Center in Pocantico Hills, New York., foraging for food, according to their natural feeding cycles.
"That they are not destructive -- to me that's the most important thing."
