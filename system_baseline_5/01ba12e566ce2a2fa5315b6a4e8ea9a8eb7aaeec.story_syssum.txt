President Bush says his wife told him that as president, he should watch his words carefully.
"   Watch President Bush talk about his regrets Â»
My answer is, bring 'em on," he said then.
To some it said, well, Bush thinks the war in Iraq is over, when I didn't think that.
In the wide-ranging interview, the president also discussed his Monday meeting with President-elect Barack Obama and said he consulted former President Clinton before his meeting with the future commander in chief.
Bush described the atmosphere in his Oval Office meeting with Obama as relaxed and said he offered the future president advice on the transition process.
Bush said he plans to return to Texas after he leaves office January 20 and "may write a book" but otherwise has few plans.
"I want people to know what it was like to make some of the decisions I had to make," he said.
It is good for our country that people have hope in the system and feel vested in the future and President-elect Obama has a great opportunity," Bush said.
I am just as American as he is American, and it is good for our country that the president succeeds."
