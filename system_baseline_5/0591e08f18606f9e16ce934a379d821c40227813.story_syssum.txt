Why?
One of the two Turkish F-16s patrolling the area launched a missile at the Syrian plane and it crashed in the area of the town of Keseb, in Syrian territory near the border, Turkish armed forces said.
Sunday's SANA report said the Syrian jets were pursuing rebels in the area.
Syria shot down a Turkish plane in 2012, and the two sides have exchanged artillery fire in the past.
