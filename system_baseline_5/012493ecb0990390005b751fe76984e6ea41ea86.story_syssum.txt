Stephen Schwarz has received a grant and low-interest loan from the state to help keep his business going.
Schwarz is one of the lucky ones.
Before Katrina, there were about 800 restaurants in New Orleans.
"I think eventually, there are going to be places that go out of business," Schwarz says.
Schwarz also operates Michael's Catering.
"In the last year, it really got to the point where catering is 40 percent of our business," Schwarz says.
"Word of mouth is very important, because if you get one bad review, there are tons of restaurants that people are just waiting to try," she says.
Schwarz says.
Between the catering gig and the restaurant, Schwarz has about 28 full- and part-time employees.
