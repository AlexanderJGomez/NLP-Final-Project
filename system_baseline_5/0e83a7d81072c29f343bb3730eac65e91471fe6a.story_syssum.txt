Milan striker Mario Balotelli was targeted by visiting fans throughout the match, and referee Gianluca Rocchi called the game to a halt in the second half to warn the crowd via the public address system.
He told reporters at the post-match conference: "There's no point in interrupting the game.
People go to the stadium to watch the two teams but there's always these uncivilized people."
FIFA president Sepp Blatter said he was "appalled" by the abuse at the Milan-Roma game.
The Italy international striker was also involved in another controversial incident during the Roma match, which ended up with teammate Sulley Muntari being sent off after manhandling the referee.
The draw mean third-placed Milan ended the weekend two points ahead of Fiorentina in the race to win a place in the qualifying rounds of the European Champions League next season, with one match still to play.
Hamsik had earlier set up Cavani's leveling header with 17 minutes to play.
