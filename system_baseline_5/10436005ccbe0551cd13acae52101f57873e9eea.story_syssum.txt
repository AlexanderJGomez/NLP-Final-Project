(CNN) -- Start-ups are fighting a war for talent in Silicon Valley, and the companies that actively welcome men and women are going to win it.
But the rise of the brogrammer joke and its ensuing backlash has some benefits: It helps talented women choose worthy employers, it gives a name and face to a problem that plagues the industry and it publicly shames some of the most sexist offenders.
As a woman and a software developer, crossing Klout off the list of places where I might work helps me narrow my options.
That's one small way brogrammer culture is actually useful.
Tech start-ups founded by women are few and far between, but they're highly attractive to female and male candidates who don't want to join a boys' club.
Most of the time, they simply don't know any better.
But humiliation is an effective behavior modifier.
They'll want to work for the most attractive companies -- the ones who built welcoming, diverse teams.
Brogrammer culture celebrates frat house values, youth over experience and men over women.
