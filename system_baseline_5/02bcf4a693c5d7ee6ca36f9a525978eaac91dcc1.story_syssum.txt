NASA's Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite is scheduled to drop its Centaur upper-stage rocket on the lunar surface at 7:31 a.m.
NASA hopes the impact will kick up enough dust to help the LCROSS probe find the presence of water in the moon's soil.

"The initial explosions will probably be hidden behind crater walls, but the plumes will rise high enough above the crater's rim to be seen from Earth," Day said.
If you don't have a telescope, or you live in areas where daylight will obscure the viewing, NASA TV will broadcast the crashes live.
The spacecraft will guide the rocket to its crash site.
The Fremont Peak Observatory near Monterey, California, will open up its doors early Friday to allow people to watch the event through its 30-inch telescope.
Samuels said a special low-light, infrared video camera will be hooked up to the telescope so that the audience can watch the rocket strike the moon.
Darrick Gray, who teaches atmospheric sciences at Ray-Pec High School near Kansas City, Missouri, said he's planning to take 17 students -- all juniors and seniors -- to watch the lunar impact .
He said he hopes the event will influence his students to pursue careers in science.
"Being as we do live here in Missouri, we're away from the hub [of astronomy]," Gray said.
