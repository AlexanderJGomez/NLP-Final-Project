Kristen Diane Parker, who worked at Rose Medical Center in Denver, has admitted to secretly injecting herself in a bathroom and using unclean syringes as replacements for patients, investigators said.
Nine patients who had surgery there during that time have tested positive for hepatitis C. Investigators are looking into whether they contracted the virus from Parker.
Rose Medical Center is contacting 4,700 patients who had surgery at Rose during the time Parker was employed there.
However, hospital officials do not believe that many patients were exposed.
