Jay Inslee said he is suspending executions while he is in office, meaning he will issue reprieves when any capital cases come to his desk for action.
And in death penalty cases, I'm not convinced equal justice is being served," the first-term Democratic governor said.
Inslee said his action had nothing to do with mercy.
"Let me say clearly that this policy decision is not about the nine men on death row in Walla Walla," he said.
State law gives Inslee the authority to stop death warrants from being issued.
Eighteen states have officially banned capital punishment as a matter of law, including the District of Columbia.
Both of Oregon's executions since the Supreme Court allowed the death penalty to resume in 1976 happened during Kitzhaber's first administration as governor, from 1995-2003.
