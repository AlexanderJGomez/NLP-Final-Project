The office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said it was still trying to determine exactly what happened at Camp Ashraf, near Baquba.
But Shahriar Kia, a spokesman for the MEK, said 44 of its members were killed.
The officials said there were casualties from the raid, but they said they could provide no further details.
The U.N. Assistance Mission in Iraq said Sunday that only 100 members of the MEK remained at Camp Ashraf.
Sunday's clash at Camp Ashraf follows news that Iraq's internal strife killed 804 people and wounded more than 2,000 in August, according to the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq.
Sunni-Shiite frictions have escalated since an April incident in Hawija, in northern Iraq, where Iraqi security forces raided a site used by Sunni protesters to demonstrate against the Shiite-led government.
