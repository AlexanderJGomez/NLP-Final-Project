These are just a few samples from the arsenal of degrading language Limbaugh deploys on women, people of color, lesbians and gays, immigrants, the disabled, the elderly, Muslims, Jews, veterans, environmentalists and so forth.
At least this most recent incident has turned a spotlight back on the vile, damaging statements Limbaugh has been promulgating for years.
Spectrum is a scarce government resource.
In keeping with this obligation, individual radio listeners may complain to the FCC that Limbaugh's radio station (and those syndicating his show) are not acting in the public interest or serving their respective communities of license by permitting such dehumanizing speech.
This isn't political.
Limbaugh has had decades to fix his show.
