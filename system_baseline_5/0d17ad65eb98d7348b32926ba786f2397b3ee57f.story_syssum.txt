A defense official initially told CNN Manning was moving to the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, but later corrected that information.
Defense officials said at a briefing that an evaluation aimed at determining whether Manning is competent has been completed, and there was no need for him to remain in the Washington area.
Amidst reports that Manning had been forced to sleep without clothing and was confined to his cell 23 hours a day, Crowley had criticized how Manning was held at Quantico, calling it "ridiculous and counterproductive and stupid," according to news reports.
Last month, the Army notified Manning that he faces 22 more charges in connection with the alleged downloading of secret information from computers in Iraq, bringing to 34 the total charges in the case.
A statement from the Army said the prosecution team "has notified the defense that the prosecution will not recommend the death penalty," but technically it is up to the commander overseeing the case to make the final decision.
