Beat Richner of the Kantha Bopha Children's Hospitals, who first alerted Cambodia's health authorities about the unknown disease, said that as of Friday he knew of 64 cases in which only two children have survived.
A majority of the identified cases were in children under 3, the health ministry said.
We hope to have a better picture in the coming days," said Dr. Ly Sovann, a deputy director at the ministry.
"They are hospitalized," he said.
"WHO supports the Ministry with the investigation and detailed analysis of each of these cases to find out the cause," wrote Dr. Pieter Van Maaren, a representative of WHO in Cambodia in an e-mail Friday.
