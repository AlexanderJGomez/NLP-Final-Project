Jones, who is originally from Stourbridge in the West Midlands, England, appeared on stage in front of a studio audience with a partner 40 years her junior.
We're absolutely over the moon.
The Stourbridge News reported that Jones was a professional dancer in her youth.
From there, the routine becomes even more physical and ends when Nico flips Jones upside down and over his shoulder, drawing a standing ovation from the judges and the crowd.
Before finding fame, the unmarried 48-year-old lived in a modest home in a small town in Scotland with her pet cat.
