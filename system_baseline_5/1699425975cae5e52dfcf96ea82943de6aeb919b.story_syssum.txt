LONDON, England (CNN) -- An American professor doing research in London stumbled across a series of previously unknown letters written by, to, and about Benjamin Franklin, a stunning find that sheds new light on early U.S. history.
The letters are important in large part because they offer a "wealth of new details" that affect modern understanding of Franklin, writes Alan Houston, the political science professor who discovered the letters in the spring of 2007.
Houston had been working at the time on a book on Franklin, "Benjamin Franklin and the Politics of Improvement," published last year.
Franklin went all over Pennsylvania trying to persuade farmers to lend their horses and wagons to Braddock and his men.
Eventually, Franklin managed to get the farmers to agree, and within weeks, Braddock and his men were on the march.
Houston said he believes the documents he read at the British Library are copies of that collection.
Birch and Franklin were friends in London, both members of the Royal Society, and Houston said he believes the copies were made sometime between 1757 and 1758.
They form part of the massive Birch Collection containing the hundreds of volumes of his copies that Birch bequeathed to the library on his death, said Shaw.
