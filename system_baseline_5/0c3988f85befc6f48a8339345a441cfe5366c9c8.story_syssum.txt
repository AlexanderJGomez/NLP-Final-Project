But in order to soak up Dubai's eclectic diversity, you have to prepare for another truth: "Dubai is worth a trip, but not all that glitters is gold," iReporter Holger Bauer said.
"It's a crossroads of many cultures," iReporter Derek Matthew Koebbe said.
"You can get a very good view and 'lay of the land' by going up to the top floors of buildings, such as hotels or the Burj Khalifa," Anderson said.
And while visiting the Burj Khalifa, located in the heart of downtown Dubai, don't forget to explore the "large variety of trendy restaurants, aesthetic pools and fountains, and upscale shopping," she said.
The Dubai Mall, the largest mall in the world, features a choreographed fountain show, according to Anderson.
Dubai, home of the extravagant, also has the world's only 7-star hotel, the Burj Al Arab.
"Another must see is the gold and spice souks near Dubai Creek," Koebbe said.
Once you get there, take a ride on the Dubai bus system for a fun way to sightsee.
If you want to explore Dubai's more natural offerings, get outside the city.
"Dubai is such a beautiful and uniquely diverse destination," Koebbe said.
You'll find older traditional souks on one corner, then on the next, the very American-like Mall of the Emirates with an indoor ski resort, Ski Dubai.
