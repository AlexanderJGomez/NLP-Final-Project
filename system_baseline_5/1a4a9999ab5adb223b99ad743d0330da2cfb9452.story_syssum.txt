Time for all those members of Congress to go home, meet with their constituents, get their input on health care reform and take back what they have learned from the voters.
Above the video of the event, the site says "... this is a must watch and a must emulate at town halls across the country over the next month."
Especially when it comes to an issue as complex as health care.
Their bad behavior is a derivative of the questionable quality of the political debate they listen to every day.
Too bad they actually support the rest of reform, and are still running positive ads about the effort.
I hate to sound like Pollyanna, but members of Congress are actually doing some real work.
One of those working the hardest, Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, was derided at a town hall recently on the matter of his own health insurance.
But the health care dilemma remains, no matter how loud the discussion.
