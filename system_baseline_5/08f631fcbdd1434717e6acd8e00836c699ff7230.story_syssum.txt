These boys say they were kidnapped by the Taliban and trained to be suicide bombers.
Brainwashed against people like you and me," she said.
CNN was given limited access to about a dozen boys.
What did the Taliban ask them to do?
They said the Taliban especially poisoned their minds against the Pakistan army.
They said, 'put your stuff in the car.'
I asked the psychiatrist, Dr. Fareeha, if she believes the boys are capable of killing.
The army freed the boys during fierce fighting with the Taliban.
Fareeha told Army chiefs that these boys were just a tip of the iceberg.
