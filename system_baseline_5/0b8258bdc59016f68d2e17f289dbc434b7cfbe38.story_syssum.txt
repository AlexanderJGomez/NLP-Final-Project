(CNN) -- The remains of Amber DuBois, a 14-year-old San Diego, California-area girl who was missing for more than a year, have been found, police said Sunday.
Amber DuBois' parents, who police said were notified of their daughter's found remains Saturday, attended the press conference.
"We have been working closely with San Diego Sheriff's Office, and our investigators are working with theirs in case there is a connection," Lt. Robert Benton with the Escondido Police Department said last week.
Maher did not mention any suspects during his brief news conference Sunday.
