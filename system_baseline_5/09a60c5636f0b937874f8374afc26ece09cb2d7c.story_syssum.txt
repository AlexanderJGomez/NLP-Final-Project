(CNN) -- A day after 20 million gallons of water gushed out of an old, broken water main, UCLA had quite a mess on its hands Wednesday -- and it still was trying to figure out how big.
Those vehicles that aren't trapped appear to have some level of water damage, Schmader said.
"
Video from KTLA showed workers using machines and squeegees to dry the court and push water out of the arena.
Whether we'll be able to save that court, I don't know," Schmader said.
UCLA academic and residential halls were not affected, and classes continued Wednesday.
Repair work on the pipe won't be completed Wednesday, but thanks to water rerouting, no one was out of water service because of the break, said Jeff Bray, superintendent of the city's Department of Water and Power.
About 1,000 gallons a minute were still leaking from the pipe Wednesday afternoon, said Jim McDaniel of that agency.
