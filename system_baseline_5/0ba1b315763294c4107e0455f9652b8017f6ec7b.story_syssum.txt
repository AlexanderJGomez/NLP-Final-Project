Felix Baumgartner is aiming to jump from a higher altitude than anyone ever has -- 120,000 feet (about 23 miles), more than three times the cruising altitude of the average airliner -- with nothing but a space suit, helmet and parachute.
Art Thompson, the technical project director for the mission, said only one back-up balloon is now available to carry out the attempt.
When the launch occurs, Baumgartner expects to spend two or three hours on the ascent in a capsule hanging from the helium balloon.
The attempt has serious risks.
While reaching such speeds can cause stress on an aircraft, planners for this jump believe there will be little effect on Baumgartner because he will be at an altitude at which there is so little air that shock waves are barely transmitted.
You know, I'm living a good life.
BASE is an acronym for buildings, antennas, spans and Earth -- the four things from which you can jump.
You have to be focused.
Cameras on the ground and on the capsule will transmit live images of his attempt.
The record for such a jump is currently held by Col. Joe Kittinger, who in 1960 jumped from 102,800 feet as part of a U.S. Air Force mission.
