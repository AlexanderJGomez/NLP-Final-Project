So, how do the latest version of the iPad and the Kindle Fire HD stack up?
The 16GB version of the Fire comes in at $299, or $200 less than the comparable iPad.
While Amazon obviously closed the gap significantly, the iPad still has a bigger screen than the Fire.
Until now, the Kindle Fire has been a WiFi-only device, and some of its new models remain that way.
The $50 is well under what AT&T and Verizon charge for a year of data on the iPad.
When the first iPad launched, AT&T offered data plans starting at $15 per month, or $180 per year, for 250 megabytes of data.
There are more than 225,000 apps designed specifically for the iPad.
But while the Kindle Fire runs a modified version of Google's Android operating system, it only runs apps available from Amazon.
