He drank and got high on weed.
"I knew that there was something better," Schuffenhauer, 36, said last week as he readied for his third Olympic Games.

Track and field was to be a turning point; he had real friends now and the parents of one of his teammates eventually would adopt him.
His conversion to bobsledder came thanks to a friend who told him there was a new track in Park City where the U.S. team was training for the 2002 Winter Olympics.
One of the Olympic team members on the top U.S. four-man team tested positive for steroids, so Schuffenhauer was called into duty.
He and Savage had to solve a dilemma: either he would give up on the idea of another Olympics or he would go back to full-time training with the team.
"It's been amazing that she's been able to stand by me," he said of Savage, now his fianc√©e.
The bank kicked them out, and Savage and the kids moved into a rental while Schuffenhauer went away for seven months at a time.
He remained resolute that he would make the Olympics even though he was now an alternate.

But Schuffenhauer has faced improbable many times before.
Asked if those chapters will take written form one day, he said he had considered it, but right now he has a family to return to.
