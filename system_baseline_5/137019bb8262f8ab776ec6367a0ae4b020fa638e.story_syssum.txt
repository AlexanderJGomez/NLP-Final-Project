Maybe they crave the love of an adoring public, or perhaps they see the movies as a way to leave their mark on the world, to be immortalized on celluloid.
So Connie Nielsen is not your typical movie star.
I try to do as good work as I can do, I try to grow in my art and reach for truth," she says.
The movie made Nielsen an international star and she scored other successes with "One Hour Photo" in 2002, and "The Hunted" in 2003.
But Nielsen has refused to be pigeonholed, seemingly drawn to difficult roles in controversial movies.
Of her choice of subject matter, Nielsen says that rather than making a political point she is trying to show the human aspects of the conflicts.
But Nielsen makes it clear that her career is not the focus of her life and she stresses the importance of making time outside the movies.
Perhaps her commitment to her art, her interest in social issues and her disavowal of fame simply reflect her Danish upbringing, but there's no doubt that compared to many other Hollywood stars Connie Nielsen is a breath of fresh air.
