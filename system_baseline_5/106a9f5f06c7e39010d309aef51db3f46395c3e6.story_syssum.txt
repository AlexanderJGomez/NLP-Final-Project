"I have said 'zero tolerance' is one thing, but I have also said the social and cultural implementation of football is important -- but now it's to rebuild the image of FIFA, that's number one, and I have already started," Blatter told CNN in his first sit-down interview since the election.
Zero tolerance means that if you commit something outside the play of field, you will have a punishment," the Swiss administrator said.
For me, going together with people it's only for the interest of FIFA because I have represented FIFA for 36 years -- it's my FIFA," Blatter said.
Warner has since backed down, for legal reasons, on threats to release "a football tsunami" by making public his email correspondence with Blatter.
And if this committee of solutions or the ethics committee have the impression that they should do something then let them take the decisions," Blatter said.
The solutions committee will be chaired by a FIFA official, with Blatter dismissing suggestions that it should be an entirely independent body.
"The football family has asked me to solve the solution inside FIFA and not outside FIFA," he said.
