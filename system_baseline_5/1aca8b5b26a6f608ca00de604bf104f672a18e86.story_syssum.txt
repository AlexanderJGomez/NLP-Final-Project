(CNN) -- A Texas judge denied a Planned Parenthood request for a temporary restraining order Monday that would have extended the organization's ability to participate in the state's revamped Women's Health Program.
Rick Perry issued a statement welcoming the move.
With the temporary restraining order denial, women may not be able to access care through the Texas Women's Health Program at Planned Parenthood clinics, pending the result of the January 11 hearing.
We only wish Texas politicians shared this commitment to Texas women, their health, and their wellbeing."
