There was one on the wood-panelled ceiling of the ballroom and later, when we checked back through all the pictures, we discovered that another had appeared on the photograph we took of the reception before meeting or tour guide.
"It was a film that shows nothing but ambiguity.
But for some fans of the film, ambiguity leaves a void which must be filled with conspiracy theories.
Which is good," said Harlan.
