Moammar Gadhafi was born in the central Libyan desert south of Sirte in spring 1942.
He then enrolled in secondary school in Sebha, where, for the first time, he had access to Arab newspapers and radio broadcasts, notably the "Voice of the Arabs" news program from Cairo.
Over time, the Gadhafi regime created a unique form of direct democracy consisting of a nationwide system of congresses and committees designed to give the impression the Libyan people were running the government.
In fact, Gadhafi, the remaining Revolutionary Command Council members, the Free Unionist Officers and revolutionary committees appointed by Gadhafi tightly controlled the political system from the start, making all important decisions.
By 2006, the United States had achieved full commercial and diplomatic relations with Libya for the first time in 25 years.
