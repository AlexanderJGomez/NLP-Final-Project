The diminutive lunar explorer, known as Jade Rabbit, or "Yutu" in Chinese, was about halfway through a three-month mission to study the moon's crust when it suffered a potentially crippling breakdown, said state media.
During a lunar night, which lasts about 14 Earth days, the moon's surface temperature can plunge to minus-180 Celsius.
Named after a mythical rabbit who lives on the moon, Yutu was a source of national pride when it launched into space last December along with the lunar lander Chang'e-3, named after the moon goddess who kept Yutu by her side.
"If I can't be fixed, everyone please comfort her."
Despite the setbacks, even the little Rabbit seemed aware of the odds it had overcome.
I was just in my own adventure story - and like every hero, I encountered a small problem," said the Rabbit.
