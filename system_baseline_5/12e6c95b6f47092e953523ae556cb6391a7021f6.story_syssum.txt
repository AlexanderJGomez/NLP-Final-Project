Dr. Mitra Roses of the Pan American Health Organization said some hospitals were performing between 30 and 100 amputations a day after the earthquake.
"We're having a generation of amputees," said one medical worker.
Amputees may have trouble getting to work, she said, and the problem is compounded if those people perform manual labor, which requires greater use of their limbs.
Young amputees face different issues, said Stuart.
Parents of children with lost limbs may also find it hard to adapt, she said.
Even before the earthquake, he said, "we were only really touching the need at the time."
Anticipating the need, the group Physicians for Peace has begun to collect prosthetics, crutches, canes, walkers and wheelchairs.
Used prosthetics will be particularly beneficial in Haiti, where manufacturing artificial limbs is likely to be difficult, said Heather Mills, a U.N. Association goodwill ambassador.
"I'm fully aware that they're not going to need the limbs for weeks, but it takes weeks to coordinate," Mills said.
"Prosthetics need to be fitted -- they're not off the shelf -- so you need technicians there," Stuart said.
