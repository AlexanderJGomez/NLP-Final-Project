After the president's speech, Elizabeth Alexander will read a poem she is writing for the occasion.
Alexander is a 46-year-old Yale University professor and a friend and former faculty colleague of Obama's.
Alexander: I think that the fact that President-elect Obama has decided to have a poem in this ceremony is a wonderful affirmation to the power of language, the way in which poetry gives us distilled and mindful and careful language that can both give us a moment of pause, a moment of contemplation and that can also ... look at the world from a slightly different angle.
...
Alexander: By writing and teaching.
Alexander: It's amazing, isn't it?
Alexander: Oh my goodness, so much.
...
Alexander: That would be fun.
Alexander: I think what I was trying to say is that at the end of the day, demographics doesn't really tell you about how your work is going to be received.
... On the one hand, I have devoted much of my work to African-American culture.
Alexander: They are so excited, and that's of course a lovely thing.
Alexander: Can you imagine?
