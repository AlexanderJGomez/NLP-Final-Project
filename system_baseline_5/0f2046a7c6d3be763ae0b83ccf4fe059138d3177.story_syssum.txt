FBI agents searched the Watergate apartment in Washington where Robert McFarlane resides seeking evidence of his alleged connection with Sudan.
He is a humanitarian.
The FBI said they had found a series of e-mails to McFarlane which agents believed to be from someone in the Sudanese intelligence service.
McFarlane's Sudanese contact, according to the FBI, was a diplomat named Mohammed Hassen Babiker, whom the FBI said it learned was an intelligence operative for Sudan.
