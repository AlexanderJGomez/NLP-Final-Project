Messi, the reigning FIFA world player of the year, also netted a hat-trick for the defending champions, who have beaten Real in their last four league meetings.
"The Clasico is obviously an important match because we will play against a direct opponent," he told the official Real Madrid website.
And this from Guardiola, who will be hoping his team can capitalize on home advantage to make it five wins in a row in the biggest derby match of all.
That's all," claimed Mourinho, who masterminded a Champions League semifinal victory over Barcelona as Inter Milan coach last season.
Ronaldo, who tops the La Liga scoring charts with 15, just ahead of Messi, claims the match is so much more than an individual battle between the pair.
"Real will come to Camp Nou with revenge in mind," Messi told AFP.
