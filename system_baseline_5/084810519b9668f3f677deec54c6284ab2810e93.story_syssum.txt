(CNN) -- A 19-year-old gunman who killed eight people and then himself Wednesday at the Westroads Mall in Omaha, Nebraska, left a suicide note, police said.
Hawkins said in the note he loved his friends and family, but "he was a piece of s--- all his life, and now he'll be famous," she told CNN.
A Creighton spokeswoman said a second female was undergoing surgery and was in critical condition Wednesday afternoon.
"He just said he wanted to thank me for everything I'd done for him ... and he was sorry," Maruca Kovac said.
"I said, 'Come home and we'll talk about it,' " she said.
"He just kept firing," she said.
Warren, the police chief, said the victims included five females and three males, not including Hawkins.
Maruca Kovac said she was unaware Hawkins had any guns, although she said he knew a lot about them, as did his stepfather.
"My kids are devastated," she said.
"You're in such shock, it's hard to think.
