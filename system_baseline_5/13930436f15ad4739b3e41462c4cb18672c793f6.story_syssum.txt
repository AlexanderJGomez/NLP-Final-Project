Sarah Palin.
Simply put, Palin is my people.
Some say the deciding factor was when Koch described life in upstate New York as "sterile" and said he dreaded living in the "small town" of Albany, if elected.
"I think [Palin] had something of a polarizing effect when she talked about how small-town values are good," Powell said.
It wasn't.
"What is this hatred for conservatives and small-town people and Sarah Palin?"
The idea isn't that people who live in small towns have better values than people who live in cities.
During a recent interview with the conservative newspaper, Human Events, Palin was asked if she thought her humble background accounted for some of the flak she got from the media.
Palin acknowledged that she didn't come from elite stock, but said that she was grateful for that.
Too bad many Americans don't understand Sarah Palin.
