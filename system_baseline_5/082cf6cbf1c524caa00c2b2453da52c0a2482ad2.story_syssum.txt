(CNN)The nurse in Texas seemed to have taken all the precautions needed to protect herself from Ebola.
She is in critical condition and being treated by 50 health care workers, Spanish authorities said Monday.
Or could there be more to it?
The workers are supposed to double their gloves in some situations, she said.
"It is possible in the coming days that we will see additional cases of Ebola," Frieden said.
The CDC is still compiling a list of health care workers who came into contact with Duncan, the official said.
"I think it needs to be put into context that ... you can't make an extrapolation that this is now a danger more so to the American people," said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
"There are too many unknowns at this point, and it is absurd to transport potentially hazardous Ebola waste across state lines," Caldwell said Sunday.
"They have the management, the processes, the implementation in place that if an Ebola patient comes in, just right away they know what to do," said Gavin MacGregor-Skinner, who teaches public health preparedness at Penn State University.
And 85% said their hospital hasn't provided education on Ebola where the nurses can interact and ask questions.
"The time to act is long overdue," she said.
