He said earlier in a statement that he was sorry for the trouble he has caused, said New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly.
Police found human remains in Aron's freezer and a trash bin which they believe are those of the boy, who went missing Monday afternoon.
Police said Aron, 35, made statements Wednesday implicating himself in the death of Kletzky.
Police said Aron went to the wedding, but have not been able to confirm that Kletzky actually went with him, as no one has said they've seen him.
Aron, a clerk at a maintenance supply company, did not appear to have known Kletzky, Kelly said.
Aron's ex-wife, Debbie Aron of Memphis, Tennessee, said she has been in "total shock" since she heard the news.
"Even as I talked to him not long ago, everything was fine, no indications that anything was wrong."
