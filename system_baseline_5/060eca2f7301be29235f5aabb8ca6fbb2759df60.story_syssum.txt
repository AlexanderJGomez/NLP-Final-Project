But five years later, local officials say the city is much safer, and plans are underway to lure foreign tourists and investors back to Juarez.
U.S. Rep. Robert "Beto" O'Rourke of Texas was one of those on a leg of the Juarez tour.

More than 3,000 people were killed in the city just four years ago, but so far this year there have been 89 killings, according to Castaneda -- a dramatic decrease in the violence.
Another factor that may have helped: The turf war between the Juarez and Sinaloa cartels essentially ended, with the Sinaloa cartel claiming victory in the battle for the trafficking route in Juarez.
"For Juarez to be considered a safe city, there's a long way to go," says Sergio Meza, executive director for Plan Estrategico de Juarez, an independent organization that works to improve the city's quality of life.

American companies Delphi, Honeywell, Flextronics and Lear are among those that ramped up hiring and investment in Juarez over the last year.
Americans who, before the violence, came to Juarez for bargain shopping have not returned in the numbers seen before the spike in violence.

"To go through what Juarez went through, you see life there again.
