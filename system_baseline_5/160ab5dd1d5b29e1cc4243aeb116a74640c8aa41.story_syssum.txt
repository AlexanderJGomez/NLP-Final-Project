(CNN) -- A reporter last week asked me if many people cared about the release of individual records from the 1940 Census.
Each image from the 1940 Census is a lined page called a population schedule, containing the records of up to 40 individuals.
Now the 1940 census records are available for free, and millions of people are accessing them.
The fascination with the snapshot of the United States provided by the 1940 Census runs beyond any one individual's search for her or his own past.
The release of the 1940 Census records will allow them to shed a light on a United States very different from how we live now.
The 1940 Census gave the country in 1940 a snapshot, one moment frozen in time.
Unemployment fell from around 15% for the week before Census Day 1940 to around 4.7% by 1942.
Because Americans opened their doors to census takers in 1940 and the survey interviewers who followed them, the United States had the information President Franklin Roosevelt assured them was necessary "to guide us intelligently into the future."
