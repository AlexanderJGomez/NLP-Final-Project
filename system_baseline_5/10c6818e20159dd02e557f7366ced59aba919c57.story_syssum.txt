(CNN) -- Not for the first time Mario Balotelli, who plays for one of Europe's biggest soccer teams AC Milan, is in the spotlight again.
Silvio Berlusconi, as well as world football head Sepp Blatter, backed Boateng for taking a strong stance against prejudicial abuse, though the FIFA president noted that walk-offs are not a long-term solution to the problem.
A lot of Italians wouldn't necessarily see it as racist, but that doesn't mean it isn't.
Foot thinks how Balotelli responds should such an incident occur again in the future could shape how Italian football tackles racism.
I think it will happen.
"I think the Boateng incident was really positive because it put the issue on the agenda and said, 'We're not going to take this anymore' and he was backed by the authorities which was really good.
"There hasn't been a debate in Italy about racist language.
Meanwhile, speaking from the Africa Cup of Nations in South Africa, where Ghana play Burkina Faso in Wednesday's semifinal, Kwadwo Asamoah, who plays for Milan's Serie A rivals Juventus, called for an end to racist abuse in football.
"Football is about coming together," the 24-year-old Ghana international told CNN.
