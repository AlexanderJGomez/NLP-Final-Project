The strange sounds -- variously described as rattling pipes, clanging metal, thunder or firecrackers -- have continued on and off since early Sunday night in just one part of the small town of 4,600, located about 180 miles northeast of Madison.
Speaking to Clintonville residents Thursday night, Kuss said the U.S. Geological Survey has determined that "our community did in fact experience an earthquake that registered 1.5 on the earthquake magnitude scale."
"It was just pop-pop-pop," she said.
No, said one one tongue-in-cheek Twitter user.
Based on the data from eight seismic monitoring stations, Kuss said the USGS finally determined on Thursday that earthquakes were to blame.
While the cause of the shaking has been solved, it's still not clear if the rattling in Clintonville is over, Kuss said.
And that means small quakes are actually felt by residents, unlike in California where the energy is absorbed.
When asked why Clintonville residents heard such strange noises during the apparent quakes, Caruso said all seismic shifts generate noise but these sounds cannot be heard during major quakes.
"(It) rattles the ground like a speaker ...  so it's common for people to hear what they describe as sonic boom sounds accompanying earthquakes.
