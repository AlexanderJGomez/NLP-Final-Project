The sickening execution, recorded and released online for the world to see, came with a warning to the U.S.: ISIS showed another captive American journalist, believed to be Steven Sotloff, and threatened to kill him too if the U.S. does not stop helping those fighting to stop ISIS advances.
First, obviously, it cannot give into ISIS threats and must continue helping dislodge ISIS from northern Iraq where it is engaging in ethnic cleansing against Christians and other minorities; kidnapping, raping and selling women; and massacring people.
There are few people on Earth who are not horrified by ISIS.
ISIS is the enemy of anyone who does not belong to ISIS.
Before ISIS, we knew that human beings are capable of unspeakable brutality.
When ISIS calls itself a state, it is not hyperbole by very much.
ISIS views the videos of mass executions, of severed heads on poles and of crucified men, as a way to keep its enemies frightened and weakened, and a way to tell prospective recruits that it is fearless in its war to create an Islamic caliphate ruling over all the world's Muslims.
There have been reports of hundreds, even thousands, of Europeans training, fighting and killing alongside ISIS.
Graduates of the Syria war, from where ISIS pushed into Iraq, have killed in Europe.
ISIS can simply not be allowed to keep a foothold in the Middle East.
If it proves insufficient to turning back the bloody ISIS tide, then it must be revamped.
That suffering has now extended to Iraq, and it will only become more widespread if ISIS is not stopped.
