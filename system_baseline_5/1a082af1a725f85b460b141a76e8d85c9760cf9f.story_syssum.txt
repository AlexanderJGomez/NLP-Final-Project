"I still use [microblogging website] Weibo for a lot of things but new things like Pengpeng come up all the time -- this one is pretty good actually.
Launched in June, Pengpeng is a new mobile phone app that combines games and online chat.
"We have four million users which makes it one of the fastest growing mobile apps in China," Tian told CNN.
"We see mobile social apps as something like an amusement park -- you come and you're always playing with other people; you meet them in a 'no pressure' way," he says.
While Facebook still dominates the social media landscape globally with 1.32 billion monthly active users (MAU), its Chinese rivals are starting to close the gap.
Nevertheless, the progress of Chinese social media is keenly monitored in the West where companies such as Facebook and Google hope to one day re-enter the market.
"Sites such as UMi and Mimi are gaining more and more users -- it won't become mainstream however," Wang says.
As for Pengpeng, users are as anonymous or as open as they want to be.
