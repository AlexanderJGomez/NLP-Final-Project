This year's co-hosts Equatorial Guinea and Gabon are the smallest nations ever to hold the event -- which is also known as AFCON -- giving rise to concerns about security, as well as travel and tourism infrastructure.
Oil-rich Equatorial Guinea and Gabon are the smallest countries ever to ever host the Africa Cup of Nations, with a combined population of just over two million.
"Each of the co-hosts could perhaps not afford to host a competition of 16 teams alone.
"When you award AFCON to places like Burkina Faso, Mali, Angola or Gabon, you find that coffers for sporting infrastructure that would be normally be difficult to open suddenly emerge and you're leaving a legacy of football infrastructure," he told CNN.
The deadly attack on Togo's team led to questions about the tournament's organization and security, but according to Gleeson, the Africa Cup of Nations can't be judged by similar standards to the World Cup or the European Championships.
Suleiman said security arrangements are the responsibility of the host nations, not the ruling body.
"Finally hosting the tournament means so many opportunities for Gabon and its people," he said.
"The security in Gabon will be the best organized of any country which hosted the tournament before us.
"We would not have had all these beautiful stadiums in Africa without the AFCON.
Each country will host matches in two cities.
In Gabon a new 40,000-seater stadium has been built in the capital Libreville, with help from the Chinese government, and will host the final.
The qualified nations are: Group A -- Equatorial Guinea, Libya, Zambia, Senegal; Group B -- Ivory Coast, Sudan, Burkina Faso, Angola; Group C -- Gabon, Niger, Morocco, Tunisia; Group D -- Ghana, Botswana, Mali, Guinea.
