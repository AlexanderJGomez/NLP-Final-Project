The 84-year-old "Lion of Harlem" wants two more years in Washington, but on Tuesday, voters will decide if his time is up.
The congressman said he didn't put up much of a fight.
This time, Rangel said he's ready.
Since 2012,  Espaillat has been gearing up for Round 2.
If voters want a change now, it may be a measure of how much the district has changed since Rangel went to Washington in 1971.
About being able to afford to live in the community where you are now," said Schumacher.
The 13th Congressional District now has a Hispanic majority.
"We never had a political battle in my congressional district in 43 years based on where you were born or what religion you have," Rangel said while campaigning Saturday.
The congressional race is the only item on the ballot.
