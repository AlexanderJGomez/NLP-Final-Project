It's going to be worth it; Beck knows precisely where he needs to be to get the perfect picture when the overwhelming gold medal favorite Shaun White performs.
He knows where to be to get the shot he wants because Beck and his assistant, Kohjiro "Kojo" Kinno have been photographing White for months, learning his every move and tendency.
"We're trying to frame it just right," Beck said on the drive from his hotel to the venue.
We want to get their faces if we can."
It's almost like a pitcher without his catcher, though the understated Kinno often is the one who shakes Beck off.
Just before setting off for the hill, Beck gets a call from Steve Fine, SI's director of photography.
Beck and Kinno agree; it's not a clean shot from where Beck will be, but they can try and see what Fine says.
"I don't suggest anything to those guys," Beck said.
There's one big issue, though, with White.
Beck says when he has used a remote-fired camera, he's able to get other snowboarders in the frame perfectly, but White soars so high that much of the time he's at the top of the frame, if he's even in the picture.
Celebration photos always play well, but only the photographers at the bottom will have White right in front of them.
Back in the work area, Beck says not everything went well.
At least 75 percent of photography is problem solving, he said.
Beck says that during one practice run a TV cameraman ran in front of him, snapping pictures on his phone.
There is a picture, looking up the pipe of White, cast against a clear night sky, soaring through the air, on his way to a gold medal.
