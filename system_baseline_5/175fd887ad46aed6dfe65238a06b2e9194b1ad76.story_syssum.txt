(CNN) -- The Iranian exile group Mujahedin-e-Khalq has been removed from a State Department terror list, officials said Friday.
"The Secretary's decision today took into account the MEK's public renunciation of violence, the absence of confirmed acts of terrorism by MEK for more than a decade, and their cooperation in the peaceful closure of Camp Ashraf, their historic paramilitary base," the statement said.
"They do not conceal their anger and disappointment and are trying hysterically to counter Secretary Clinton's decision with their lobby groups in the United States, the United Kingdom and Europe.
Mujahedin-e-Khalq is considered by many in the administration to be a bizarre cult-like organization, prompting concerns about its behavior.
The last major convoy of 680 members of Mujahedin-e-Khalq arrived this month at the temporary relocation site at a former U.S. military base near Baghdad International Airport, the U.N. mission for Iraq said.
Camp Ashraf was established in 1986 after former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein invited members of Mujahedin-e-Khalq to relocate to Iraq in an effort to undermine the Iranian government, which was then at war with Iraq.
