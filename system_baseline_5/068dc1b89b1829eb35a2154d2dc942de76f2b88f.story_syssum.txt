At least 200 were injured in Suffolk where a twister destroyed several homes and businesses, said Bob Spieldenner of the Virginia Department of Emergency Management.
A third twister damaged several homes near Lawrenceville, about 70 miles south of Richmond, said Bryan Jackson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, which confirmed all three tornadoes.
Furniture, fences and mounds of other debris were tossed in streets, parking lots and lawns.
An emergency shelter will be established by Monday night, Suffolk spokeswoman Dana Woodson said.
