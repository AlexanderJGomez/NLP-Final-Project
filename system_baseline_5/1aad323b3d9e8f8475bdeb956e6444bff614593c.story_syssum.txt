"Secretary Shinseki has dedicated his life to his fellow veterans, and nobody is more committed to completing the work that lies ahead," said a VA statement by Drew Brookie, VA spokesman.
In an exclusive report two weeks ago, CNN interviewed a retired VA doctor from Phoenix who charged that more than 40 American veterans have died waiting for care at the VA hospital there.
Many of the veterans, the doctor and other VA sources told CNN, were placed on a secret list created by VA managers to hide the wait times of veterans seeking medical care.
The director of health care at the U.S. Government Accountability Office, Congress' watchdog organization, told CNN on Monday that even the VA does not truly know how many American veterans are waiting for care across the country.
Draper said some of the VA numbers and details of wait times are "unreliable."
"The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) takes any allegations about patient care or employee misconduct very seriously.
Veterans deserve to have full faith in their VA care.
We applaud their demands for accountability at the very top of the Department of Veterans Affairs."
