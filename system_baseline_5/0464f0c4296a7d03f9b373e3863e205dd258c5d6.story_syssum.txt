It also comes from groups and individuals -- male and female -- who long to see more women headlining major Hollywood films.
No.
Doing so, however, may dismiss the lack of diversity that persists onscreen and behind the camera in Hollywood movies.
In 2013, only 29% of 4,506 speaking characters evaluated were female.
Across top-grossing films from 2002 to 2013, only 4.2% of all directors were female.
Only three black women were directors across 700 popular movies between 2007 and 2014.
For female directors, the financing structure, subject matter, and even perceived confidence of filmmakers creates a barrier to career progress.
Applied to Hollywood, the rule would stipulate that women and candidates from underrepresented backgrounds be considered or even interviewed when hiring film directors.
Then, the only unreal thing about "Ghostbusters" will be the ghouls and goblins, not the women busting them.
