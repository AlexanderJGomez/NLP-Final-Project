Common also performed at "CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute" last year.
Common: I started (the foundation) with some of my team members because we wanted to give back to the youth who didn't have some of the opportunities we had.
My whole life growing up, I was doing the little things that I could do (to help people).
I want to empower them first by letting them know that they are loved and people do care.
But they have other people that do care.
My mother told me before going there: getting invited there, that is an important place to be because that is where a lot of people that do the real work are.
These are people who do work for real in the world helping people.
Common: A hero to me is someone who is able to take whatever talent, gift, personality, quality and utilize it to help build others.
