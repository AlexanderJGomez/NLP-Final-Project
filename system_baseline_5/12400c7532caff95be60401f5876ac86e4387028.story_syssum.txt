(CNN)My son Jason Rezaian and his wife were taken at gunpoint from their apartment in Iran more than 200 days ago.
Jason, a dual Iranian-American citizen, has been at Evin Prison, held on suspicion of somehow posing a security risk to Iran.
When I visited my son in Evin on Christmas Day, he told me: "I will be a model prisoner if I am granted my rights under Islamic law.
In fact, in the early months, I was told the Iranians were asking Jason, "Where is your mother?"
There are apparently three separate security apparatuses, and Jason seems now to have been handed off to a legal branch (the judiciary) that appears to be taking its time scheduling his trial.
Anyone with knowledge of Iran knows that nothing happens during the two weeks following Nowruz, a period when even newspapers don't publish, so it can only be assumed his trial date might not be set before April 6.
This week, Iran is celebrating the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.
But our patience ran out some time ago, and it is difficult, nearly impossible, to maintain respect for a system under which someone who was born and raised American is being detained "as an Iranian" even as his rights under Iran's own laws are being so flagrantly violated.
Please review the evidence and release my son or ensure that he receives a fair trial immediately.
