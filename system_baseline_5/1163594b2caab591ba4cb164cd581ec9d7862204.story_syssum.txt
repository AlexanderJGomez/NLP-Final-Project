The future isn't hard to excavate in Greece.
But today, in a Greece wracked by the most serious economic crisis for at least a century, the truth about the country's economic future is mostly the opposite of these advertisements.
In Greece today, the future is mostly characterized by fear rather than opportunity.
It's a digital renaissance and it's being pioneered by a new generation of talented young Internet entrepreneurs who are trying to reinvent not only the Greek economy and society, but also Greece's role in today's global economy.
There's a "big opportunity" in Greece, Doxaras told me because -- given the relative insignificance of the local market - start-ups have to be global, both in their organization and their market.
In the Greek digital economy, even the smallest business have to be multinational.
Like Doxaras and Frantzolas, Plakopita's confidence in the digital Greek rebirth is rooted in the wealth of human talent in Greece.
As Stavros Messinis, the co-founder of CoLab told me, Greece remains a "tough environment" for entrepreneurs.
As Warp.ly CEO Doxaras explained, most Greeks -- even its younger generation -- don't "get" the idea that Greece, if it wants to compete in the 21st century global economy, has any other option but to become a start-up nation like Israel.
John Doxaras even warns that a euro exit might result in significant power cuts thereby cutting off local digital companies from their lifeblood -- access to the global network.
Yet in spite of the danger of a complete economic meltdown, the future remains full of opportunity for Greece's young digital entrepreneurs.
