When the May 26 directive was issued, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said dispersant use should be cut by 75 percent.
Gulf Coast environmentalists say it's another sign that the federal agencies monitoring dispersant use are not being tough enough with BP.
The directive states that BP must ramp down dispersant use by "75 percent from the maximum daily amount used."
The EPA and Coast Guard say they're trying to keep dispersant use to around 18,000 barrels a day.
The EPA continues testing the chemical dispersant Corexit 9500, which has been used by BP since the beginning of the oil disaster.
