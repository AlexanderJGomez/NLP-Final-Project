"I see an artist pictured with her best friend.
These words from well-known music artists' rights advocate, educator and industry commentator, Moses Avalon, illustrate the degree to which the music industry is in rapid change.
Almost symbolic of this change is the significant deal between social networking web site MySpace and three major record labels -- Sony BMG, Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group -- to form MySpace Music.
While most experts believe record labels and the wider music industry have a strong future, there are mixed feelings about MySpace Music as a panacea for album sales.
Long-time music industry figure Bob Lefsetz was more critical of the new venture.
Working against the record labels is a plethora of other online music promoters.
Not for a second, said Avalon.
But, if you are talking about someone who wants a worldwide hit or to sell a million or more CDs there's still no way to do that other than through a major record label," Avalon said.
Lefsetz told CNN that record labels had too many valuable catalogs to disappear, but he felt they would decline if they did not find a new business model.
Avalon also forecasts more deals where 'sales' can be regained as music gets bundled in with products.
It's not going to be a corporation, it will be an entrepreneur," he said.
Dubber, meanwhile, is not convinced that the music industry will find a new model.
He questions whether it would be fair to celebrate artists only for their album sales when other musicians may not gain the same recognition for having 500,000 downloads from a Web site.
