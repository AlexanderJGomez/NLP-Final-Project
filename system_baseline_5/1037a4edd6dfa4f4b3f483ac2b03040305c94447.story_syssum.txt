Each of the five "tree rooms" making up this hotel deep in Sweden's arboreal forest, just south of the Arctic Circle, is designed by a different Swedish architect, and each is suspended up to six meters from the ground.
Each stylishly furnished room sleeps two to four people and -- this is Sweden, after all -- has access to the site's Treesauna.
This back-to-basics wooden tree house perched atop a 100-year-old walnut tree overlooking a mountain stream is a short drive from some of the Algarve's best beaches.
Decked out in simple furnishings, each room sleeps between two and four people -- each also has its own wooden terrace, a transparent roof for star gazing and compost toilet at ground level.
