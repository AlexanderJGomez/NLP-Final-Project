And why shouldn't they?
And therein lies the rub: An online connection isn't necessarily a real-life success, and people aren't always who they say they are.
In the movie, Schulman meets and falls in love with a woman online who is not exactly (or at all) who she says she is.
"If the person is hesitant or reluctant, reconsider meeting," Joseph says.
Joseph says you may want to reconsider if:
"You would be shocked how casual people tend to be when meeting their online crushes and you don't wanna feel awkwardly overdressed," Schulman says.
Better to make it a social event and go bowling or something," Schulman suggests.
"You never how things will go down," Joseph notes.
