(CNN) -- Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II are to be made into saints this weekend in an unprecedented double papal canonization.
Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli, the man who would become Pope John XXIII, was the third of 13 surviving children born to a family of farmers in the tiny village of Sotto il Monte, near Bergamo, northern Italy in November 1881.

Strictly speaking, he wasn't the first Pope John XXIII
Today, Pope Gregory XII is considered the only true pontiff from that period: Benedict XIII, John XXIII and his predecessor Alexander V are all regarded as "Antipopes," which is why Roncalli became John XXIII, and not John XXIV when he was elected pope.
In October 1962, with the U.S. and Russia teetering on the brink of nuclear war, Pope John XXIII helped to bring both countries back from the edge, urging President John F. Kennedy and Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev to exercise restraint.
Unlike other saints, Pope John XXIII only performed one miracle
Pope John Paul II, who is to be canonized at the same time as John XXIII, is said to have cured a French nun of Parkinson's disease, and a Costa Rican woman of a cerebral aneurism.
Indeed, some would say that his canonization is already long overdue.
