In its first report last September, the inspector general concluded that the incident in which Secret Service agents brought prostitutes to their Cartagena hotel last spring caused no security threat before President Barack Obama arrived in the country for a summit.
The report made no recommendations, which signaled the watchdog's satisfaction with how the incident was handled.
At a hearing by the Senate Homeland Security Committee in May, Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan insisted the incident was an aberration.
In addition to the Secret Service agents, 12 military personnel also were cited for their role in the scandal in Cartagena.
