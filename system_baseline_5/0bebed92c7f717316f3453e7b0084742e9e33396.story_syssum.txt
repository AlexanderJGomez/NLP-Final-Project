Paraguay's President on Saturday named a new interior minister and national police chief following clashes between police and peasants that left at least 17 dead.
Three of the police officers were flown to Asuncion for treatment, the official news agency said.
Rodriguez lamented the loss of life, but said the peasant leaders did not order the attack on police.
"All the resources of government security and strategic air are working at this moment to restore calm and tranquility to this region of the country," he said.
