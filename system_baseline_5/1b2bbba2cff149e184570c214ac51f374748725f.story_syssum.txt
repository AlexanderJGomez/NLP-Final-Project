Could we plan for what will happen centuries from now if we wanted to?
Will there even be people centuries from now?
"A large sector of the West Antarctic ice sheet has gone into irreversible retreat," according to Eric Rignot, a glaciologist at the University of California, Irvine, who led one of the teams.
Warming air is intensifying the winds that sweep round the Antarctic, but it's not warming air that is melting the glaciers there.
But melting land ice will have a big effect on sea level rise.
And so will we all.
People 200 years from now?
Many of us will have children who will live to this century's finish line.
Between then and now, there will likely be more devastating Sandy-like hurricanes as winds intensified by warmer waters devastate shores.
It doesn't matter whether they live around the block or in the next state or in the future.
When I was in high school in the 1970s, I learned that we were too dependent on other countries for energy, and that oil and coal are non-renewable and polluting, and that we needed to begin a shift to harnessing clean renewable energy sources.
Globally, we're not exactly coming together to stabilize climate and institutionalize clean energy.
But collectively we simply aren't.
So, let's not worry about the people of Bangladesh, Kiribati, New York and Miami, or the 23rd century.
