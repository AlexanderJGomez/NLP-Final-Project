(CNN) -- Police charged an 18-year-old with murder in the case of a University of Florida student last seen eight days ago, a police spokesman said Friday.
Police told Aguilar's family about the murder charge -- and, with it, the presumption the college student was dead -- about an hour before the public announcement, Tobias said.
Bravo told investigators that he'd gotten into "an altercation with Aguilar" on the night the college student went missing, police said.
Bravo's family initially volunteered to help in the search, only to be politely turned down by Aguilar's family, Kozlowski said.
