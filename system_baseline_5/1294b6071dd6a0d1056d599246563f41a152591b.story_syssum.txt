Taking a cue from some of its competitors, Apple on Tuesday announced a smaller version of its popular iPad tablet -- the iPad Mini.
The iPad Mini's display will be nearly an inch bigger than those of competitors like Amazon's Kindle Fire and Google's Nexus 7.
Pre-orders for the devices begin Friday, and the Wi-Fi only iPad Mini will go on sale in stores November 2.
"This isn't just a shrunken-down iPad," Schiller said.
Schiller opened by unveiling the new version of Apple's top-selling MacBook, the 13-inch MacBook Pro.
Both the Mac Mini and the new MacBook Pro begin shipping today.
The Kindle Fire is great for buying books, movies and shows from Amazon, and the Nexus 7 has Google's well-stocked Play store for media and apps.
The smaller iPad's screen is expected to have the same aspect ratio, so those apps would work the same on the new device.
"If you can do everything on the smaller iPad you can on the larger iPad -- that plus the added convenience of being able to take it with you more places could take the wind out of the sales of Amazon."
A smaller, lighter device is more portable, and people might not be as afraid of taking a cheaper tablet out into the big bad world where it would be less protected.
