Erika Murray was arraigned September 12 on a bevy of charges stemming from the discovery of the dead infants at her home the day before, but she has not been charged in their deaths.
Rivera also "presumably" did not know about the ones that had died, at least according to the account Murray has told authorities, Halpern said.
Halpern said that while his client's explanation "is not based in reality," the situation  Murray came to be in was the result of fear, not malice.
Why?
"I feel certain that she did not do anything to harm any of these children," he said.
This was not the first time a 51A had been filed when it came to that home, according to a Massachusetts Department of Children and Families spokeswoman.
"Our investigation will continue for quite some time," said Joseph Early, the Worcester County District Attorney.
