Damascus, Syria (CNN) -- A top adviser to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad defended the regime's actions Tuesday, arguing that the government is not attacking peaceful protesters, despite widespread witness reports of a fierce crackdown against displays of dissent.
Shaaban said the government would like "to talk to peaceful demonstrators" and is not opposed to peaceful protests.
Rami Abdelrahman, head of the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, told CNN Tuesday that 1,342 civilians and 343 security personnel have died since the protests erupted.
The Turkish government said Tuesday that 10,757 Syrian refugees have crossed the border.
Alawites are an offshoot of Shiite Muslims.
But some of those who have been risking arrest or bodily harm as al-Assad tries to suppress a wave of anti-government protests said the people in the hotel don't necessarily speak for them.
And this is our biggest problem and our biggest challenge," she said.
"No government in the world would kill its own people," she said.
