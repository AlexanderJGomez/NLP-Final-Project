CNN: Before Bo Xilai's trial, many commentators predicted it would follow a tight script but that doesn't appear to be the case.
All of a sudden, in my view, Bo has decided not to cooperate, but not completely.
Li: Bo as a person, as a leader, is unpredictable.
Li: Of course there would have been deals made before, otherwise the leadership would not be willing to pursue the charges.
In July, they put forward only three charges: Bribery, corruption and abuse of power.
He made a lot of people nervous about his self-promotion campaign -- that's the real reason, not about corruption.
Li: If you follow the reaction in China most people think that Bo did well, including people who really do not like him.
Some people who previously really hated him now tend to forget all the awful things he allegedly did.
He claimed he was betrayed by some bad guys.
Bo Xilai and his defense lawyer came across very well -- that was also a surprise, in many ways.
Is it that the case, or will it be business as usual after the verdict?
Li: The Bo case has revealed the fundamental flaws of the political system and the widespread phenomenon of corruption and power abuse.
That strategy, although it's rational, will probably not resonate very well -- you leave some potential problems for the future as they fail to use the case to consolidate and uplift public confidence in the legal system.
The worst is probably the life sentence, and the most lenient probably 15 years.
