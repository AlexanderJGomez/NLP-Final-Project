Pyongyang, North Korea (CNN) -- The last thing Thomas Hudner said to mortally wounded pilot Jesse Brown was that he would come back for him.
On December 4, 1950, Hudner, now 88, was part of a six-plane formation providing air support for U.S. Marines on the ground fighting Chinese troops during the Korean War.
When a Marine helicopter landed to stage a rescue, Hudner had to make the agonizing decision to leave Brown.
If the Chinese troops didn't claim Hudner, the Korean winter would.
In a rare show of cooperation with a country it often calls the imperialistic enemy, North Korea has given permission for Hudner to return to Chosin Reservoir.
Arms and medical supplies also froze in subzero temperatures.
Hudner told CNN he didn't think the trip would ever happen.
The group is not planning on attending the commemoration.
The timing of the invitation to the U.S. veterans is likely intentional, but for Hudner, the focus is bringing closure to his Korean War experiences and to Brown's family.
