Some Potter fans, under the leadership of Slack, have come together to bring the spirit of "Dumbledore's army" to life.
In the "Potter" books, "implications toward public policy are profound," Slack said.
Slack sees parallels between the magic in the "Potter" books and expanding one's mind to come up with solutions in a creative way.
Earlier this year, the Harry Potter Alliance conducted a book drive for children around the world, an effort led by "Potter" actress Evanna Lynch.
The campaign takes Dumbledore's ethics and beliefs and translates them to the real world.
Rowling herself has praised the Harry Potter Alliance, one of Slack's proudest moments.
All of these things are happening in Darfur.
Rowling has also written personally to Slack about his efforts.
Members of the Harry Potter Alliance, 4,500 of whom make up the most hardcore group, are inspired by what it has done.
Like Slack, Bolton condemns the "Muggle mindset," what members call an ignorance of or refusal to act on the important issues facing the world.
"There are issues I didn't know much about or hadn't thought about too deeply that I'm now involved in, like Darfur," Bolton said.
"It has introduced me to new issues and new ideas."
