The ban would have included sodas, energy drinks, fruit drinks and sweetened teas.
In fact, the Board of Health has the power, indeed the responsibility, to regulate sugary drinks for the sake of city residents, particularly the poor.
Why?
The so-called "war on sugar" is not a culture war, it is a public health imperative backed by science.
At least public health officials rely on science and try to craft rules that have a chance of workingâ€”if not in isolation, then in combination with other obesity control measures such as food labeling, calorie disclosures, trans fat restrictions and access to affordable fruits and vegetables in schools and poor neighborhoods.
The industry stoked the fires of public discontent with its campaign against the "inconsistencies" in the soda ban.
Consider one of the judge's major arguments: balancing public health and economic considerations is "impermissible."
But the Board of Health has authority to act in cases where there is an imminent threat to health.
Members of the Board of Health, moreover, are experts in public health, entitled to a degree of deference.
Rather than recognize the public health effects of large sugary drinks, they chose to fight, reminiscent of Big Tobacco.
Most New Yorkers oppose the portion ban, while politicians in other states are scrambling to show their disapproval.
If consumers really want, they can buy several smaller drinks.
Because when it is shown to be successful in New York, it will be emulated in major cities in America and worldwide.
