Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Protests broke out Friday throughout Northern Ireland against a decision by Belfast City Council members to stop flying the Union flag year-round.
In all, four police officers were hurt, with one requiring hospital treatment, and two people were arrested, police said.
Belfast has been at the center of a wave of protests prompted by the City Council's December 3 decision to limit the flying of the flag to 18 days per year.
Northern Ireland authorities have accused loyalist extremists of exploiting the decision by Belfast officials to end the century-old tradition of flying the Union flag over City Hall 365 days a year.
The majority of Ireland gained independence in 1921 following two years of conflict.
