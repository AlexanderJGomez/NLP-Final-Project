(CNN) -- President Obama's Ambien finally wore off, and thus he began the second presidential debate with Mitt Romney.
He lacked passion in the previous debate, but when answering the first question from the audience Tuesday night, Obama brought the heat.
But for me, it's the primacy effect taking off.
Here are some examples of Obama quoting Romney.
Moving further forward in the debate, Romney used the same technique responding to the sixth question, when asked what the president had done or accomplished to earn our vote.
It was Romney's best moment of the debate.
It's good for Romney that this wasn't the first debate, because Obama's performance was much stronger Tuesday night.
