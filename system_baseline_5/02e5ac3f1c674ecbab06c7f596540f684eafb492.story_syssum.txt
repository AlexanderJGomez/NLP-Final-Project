Yet for Maroney, it wasn't simply a fun opportunity -- it's part of a larger goal to one day become a working actress.
I've always been drawn to it and I've always wanted to pursue it, just like gymnastics," she said.
But "after it's all said and done with the Olympics and Worlds and whatever I get the chance to do, I think that would be my time to really get into acting, something that I want to have as my job when I'm older," she said.
"It was my first time ever doing anything like that," Maroney said.
"Gymnastics, you're in the gym eight hours a day and acting, that's a full-time job as well.
I really like the character Rose on the show ... and I thought if I was ever going to be on the show, I'd really want to play her, and then I ended up being her best friend.
I really just take things one step at a time.
"Right now, I'm only 16, and gymnastics will always be a part of me," she said of her future plans.
So I'll really be getting into trying to work for the next Olympics, and in between that I'll be doing, hopefully, little things like what I just did."
