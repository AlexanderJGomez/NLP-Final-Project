Featuring passenger comforts such as bigger windows, larger overhead bins and better ventilation, United's Dreamliner is set for its first flight at 7:25 a.m. November 4 from Houston to Chicago O'Hare International Airport.
It's efficient and performs well, and it's also a very good-looking aircraft.
Cheaper to operate: The plane also saves money on fuel because its body is made from lightweight composite materials.
