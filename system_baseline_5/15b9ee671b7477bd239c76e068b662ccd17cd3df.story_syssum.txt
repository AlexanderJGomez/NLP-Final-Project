Judge Sonia Sotomayor would be the first Hispanic person to serve on the Supreme Court.
Sotomayor has called her mother her inspiration and said she instilled in her the values of education.
Her story of battling past obstacles is an inspiration for all Hispanic people, said Roberto Ramirez, president-elect of the Puerto Rican Bar Association.
Ramirez said Latino people have been waiting a long time for a person of Latino descent to be nominated to the court.
"It's here!
The nomination also makes the court a more accurate reflection of America's racial demographics, Ramirez said.
Sotomayor's nomination "helps to create a tapestry of this country that is very reflective of the people who live in it," Ramirez said.
Sotomayor will inspire young Latinas to chase their dreams, she said.
But Sotomayor's nomination serves as proof, she said.
