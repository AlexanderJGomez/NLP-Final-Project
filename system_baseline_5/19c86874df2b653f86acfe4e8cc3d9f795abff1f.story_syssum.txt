The rare moments Christos Sourovelis can take a break from running his own painting business, he can be found toiling away on his family's dream house in the suburbs of Philadelphia.
A month-and-a-half later police came back -- this time to seize their house, forcing the Sourvelises and their children out on the street that day.
Authorities said the house was tied to illegal drugs and therefore subject to civil forfeiture.
Authorities use a civil forfeiture law that allows them to seize people's property when that property is connected to the sale of illegal drugs.
Unlike criminal forfeiture, the civil law allows authorities to seize property without the owner ever being convicted or even charged.
Philadelphia filed nearly 7,000 petitions in one year alone, according to the class action lawsuit, in which the Sourvelises are plaintiffs, along with other Philadelphia citizens.
The Pennsylvania Attorney General's office says about $7 million went straight to the salaries for the Philadelphia District Attorney's office and the police department in just three years.
The Philadelphia District Attorney's office told CNN it seizes property only as a last resort, and added that it is limited in what it can currently say because of the pending litigation.
That's it."
After eight days of sleeping on a family member's couch, the Sourvelises were let back into their house, but only on the guarantee they would ban their son from the house -- a heartbreaking decision, they say.
The Philadelphia District Attorney's office told CNN it strictly follows the state law in an effort to crack down on drug abuse.
