One of those arrested claims to have an alibi, according to Russia's Sputnik News.
Nemtsov, one of President Vladimir Putin's most outspoken critics, was shot in the back on a Moscow bridge as he walked with his girlfriend near the Kremlin in late February.
Putin has been informed of the arrests in connection with Nemtsov's death, Russian media said, citing Federal Security Service director Alexander Bortnikov.
Dadayev was the deputy commander of one of the Chechen Republic's Ministry of Internal Affairs groups, Sputnik reported, adding that Gubashev worked at a security firm in Moscow.
Many opposition sympathizers and people close to Nemtsov have pointed the finger at Putin and the Russian government he leads.
Nemtsov had also been arrested several times for speaking against the government.
There was also business magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who backed an opposition party and accused Putin of corruption.
