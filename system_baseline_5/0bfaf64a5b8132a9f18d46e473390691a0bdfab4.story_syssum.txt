"Is this the American National Anthem or the Mexican Hat Dance?
-- Mr.CheckYaDm@DJ_BMONEY
Now, which do you think represents what it means to be an American?
Meanwhile, De La Cruz took the high road.
My father and my mother told me that you should never judge people by how they look.
When I hear stories like this, I get sad.
De La Cruz is a Mexican-American born in San Antonio.
"My father was actually in the Navy for a really long time...People don't know, they just assume that I'm just Mexican.
The next chapter will be where some Mexican-Americans actually turn on De La Cruz for appearing to distance himself from Mexico.
De La Cruz was invited back to perform an encore of the national anthem at Game 4.
"To be invited back to sing the national anthem is just amazing because now I know the San Antonio Spurs like how I sing," Sebastien said.
It was the American thing to do.
