(CNN) -- Two Florida school administrators face contempt charges and possible prison time for saying a prayer at a school luncheon.
The ACLU filed suit last year against the district on behalf of two Pace students who alleged that "school officials regularly promoted religion and led prayers at school events," according to an ACLU statement.
On January 28, "Lay asked Freeman to offer a prayer of blessing during a school-day luncheon for the dedication of a new fieldhouse at Pace High School," according to court documents.

"It is a sad day in America when school officials are criminally prosecuted for a prayer over a meal," said Mathew Staver, founder of Liberty Counsel and dean of the law school at Liberty University, founded by the late Rev.
"We're not going after individuals," said Glenn Katon, director of the Religious Freedom Project for the ACLU of Florida.
Lay is not facing jail time for praying, he said, but for violating a court order.
Neither Lay nor Freeman has been placed on leave, according to the school district.
