The PS4 sold 1.25 million units in the United States during November, while the Xbox One sold 750,000, said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Morgan, in a recent note to investors.
With the XBox One starting at $499, and the PS4 at $399, Pachter says the the $100 price difference is responsible for Sony's success: "The reason Sony beats Microsoft is solely the price.
"These are two systems that are well-balanced to keep the furious battle between Xbox and PlayStation going for the next decade ... which can only be good for gamers everywhere," says David Hutchinson, chief video games writer for The Times of London.
Seven years ago, Microsoft pushed development on the Xbox 360 so that they could put their console on the market a year ahead of the PlayStation 3.
At the industry's E3 conference in June, not long after Sony went public with their early release date, Microsoft announced they'd priced their console $100 more than Sony's PS4.
"Xbox were wise to backtrack on their initial idea that you wouldn't be able to easily resell secondhand games or pass old games onto friends more than once," says Hutchinson.
"Casual gamers I think have moved on most likely to mobile platforms.
Smith says: "[Xbox One] does gaming as well, but it is targeted towards a much broader audience and I think there is a risk in that gamers look at it and say: 'This is not for me, this is not built for gamers first' ...
"The joint dominance of the Xbox 360 and the PS3 marked a great era for the gaming public," he says.
