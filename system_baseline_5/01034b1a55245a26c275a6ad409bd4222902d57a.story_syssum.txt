(CNN) -- Elvis was singing in the men's room.
In the men's restroom, every time I've gone in, Elvis Presley's voice is singing.
.
The signature: Barbara Hearn Smith.
But now, in the dwindling weeks of 2011, in the BrickTop's men's room, here was Elvis singing, and here was Barbara Hearn's autograph.
"Well, I suppose it's all right if my name is on a restroom wall," she said.
Jim Smith went out to their car, where he knew there was a photo of Elvis and Barbara; he brought it into the restaurant, and she signed it so the waiter could give it to the boss when he came in.
Why?
But back to Barbara Hearn: She said she first met Elvis when she was working at Goldsmith's Department Store in Memphis with a friend named Dixie Locke, who was dating Presley.
Elvis?
In the photo, Barbara is prim in a white dress with dark polka-dots; Elvis is slouched and shirtless.
I said yes, I thought it was.
("I didn't hold it against him at all," Barbara told me.
"That year of 1956, I saw him go from being barely famous to a super-duper star," she said.
She said she'd had no idea, until I told her.
