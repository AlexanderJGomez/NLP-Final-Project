The 25-year-old Spain international could be out for up to a month, Barcelona's Web site reported on Tuesday, meaning he may not be fit to return until the club's final domestic league match against Real Valladolid on May 16.
Valladolid remained second from bottom despite giving former Spain coach Javier Clemente victory in his first home match.
Clemente has earned four points from two games since taking over as Diego Costa headed the opening goal four minutes before halftime and fellow striker Manucho scored the second eight minutes after the break.
Tenerife stayed in the third relegation place, one point above Valladolid, despite registering a first away win this season, 2-0 at mid-table Sporting Gijon.
