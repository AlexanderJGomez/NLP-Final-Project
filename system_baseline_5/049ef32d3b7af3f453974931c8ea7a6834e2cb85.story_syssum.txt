Washington (CNN) -- On the 47th anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington on Saturday, the first sight on the National Mall for thousands of marchers was a four-story art installation that displayed four images and quotations of Martin Luther King Jr..
Michael Murphy, an artist from Georgia, created a four-story structure that celebrates King to honor King's spirit and to counter the rallies by Beck and the Rev.
In fact, the political climate surrounding King's 1963 march was tougher.
But King and the civil rights movement provided a moral vision that made it possible for the U.S. to find a way out of those ugly times.
Protests in New York, Philadelphia, Newark, Chicago and San Francisco took a dramatic turn toward incivility.
"You haven't got no time to cry no tears for no Jews," he called out at the Harlem Unity Rally.
Segregationists in Congress even expressed hope that violence would ruin the march and the civil rights movement.
But amid what Garry Wills called America's second Civil War, the civil rights movement embraced the idea that the best way to gain rights was to appeal to everyone's hearts and meet "physical force with soul force," as King put it.
By the time of the March, King understood that America could be changed only by winning over the other side.
King planted himself in front of Jones.
Everyone remembers King's speech at the March for four words: "I have a dream."
King warned that even the most innocent and decent people would continue to suffer.
So buck up.
It all seems so clear now, but it wasn't back in 1963, not for most people anyway.
Who's our King?
