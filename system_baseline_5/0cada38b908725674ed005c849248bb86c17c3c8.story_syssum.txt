The woman, who was pulled out Friday from the remains of the garment factory, was found in that pool of water, rescue official Lt. Col. Moazzem Hossain told CNN.
The rescue was a bright spot against the grim recovery.
Gupta said the woman likely had some sort of access to food, although people have been known to survive a couple of weeks without it.
It is believed Muncie had some access to food and water, although details remain murky, he said.
While Reshma's outlook is favorable, food will have to be reintroduced slowly, Gupta said, noting that Muncie had lost 30 pounds while buried under the Haitian rubble.
