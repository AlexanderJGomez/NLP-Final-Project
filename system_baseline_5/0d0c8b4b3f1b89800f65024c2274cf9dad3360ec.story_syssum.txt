The documents reveal what investigators found in Jackson's bedroom the day after his death.
Another sworn statement written by Martinez several weeks later -- and made public earlier this week -- provided a more extensive list of drugs found by investigators at Jackson's bedside.
A source with knowledge of the probe told CNN Thursday that a test later showed that a brown, sticky substance found in the search was not heroin.
The coroner announced two weeks ago that the report on Jackson's death was completed, but that police asked for it to be withheld until completion of the criminal probe.
