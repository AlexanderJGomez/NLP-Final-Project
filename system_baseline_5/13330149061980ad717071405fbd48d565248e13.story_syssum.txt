The Earned Sick Time Act, which now goes to Mayor Michael Bloomberg, will require private businesses with 20 or more employees, to provide five paid sick days annually, beginning in April 2014.
"People who are sick or who need to care for a loved one should be able to take time off without the fear of losing their job or not having money to pay the bills," City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn said.
If Bloomberg does veto the bill, the City Council can override the veto with a two-thirds vote.
Currently there are no federal legal requirements for paid sick leave, according to the U.S. Department of Labor website.
