Indian police have arrested a second man in connection with the rape of a 5-year-old girl in New Delhi, a police spokesman said Monday.
The situation has taken on another sordid aspect after the girl's family said that police officers had tried to bribe them to keep quiet about the case.
In a recent report, the Asian Center For Human Rights cited statistics it said showed 48,338 child rape cases were reported in India between 2001 and 2011.
The 5-year-old girl's case sparked protests in New Delhi last week.
