The U.S. should be prudent in exporting this natural resource, which has led to resurgence in domestic manufacturing, but I believe that the liquefied natural gas we do send overseas should be shipped on U.S.-flagged tankers and crewed by U.S. licensed and unlicensed mariners.
To transport gas via the ocean, the world must rely upon two countries to build these tanker vessels: Japan and South Korea.
We can do that by reinvigorating an innovative shipbuilding industrial base, and by requiring that liquefied natural gas exports be carried on American bottoms, we can provide a new long-term market to sustain this revitalization.
First, recognizing at present that there are no American shipyards building liquefied natural gas tankers, how can we require such exports to be carried on U.S. ships that are not being built?
We must seize the exportation of natural gas as an opportunity to reinvigorate the domestic maritime industry and bolster our national defense.
We are a maritime nation, and we can build liquefied natural gas tankers in America.
