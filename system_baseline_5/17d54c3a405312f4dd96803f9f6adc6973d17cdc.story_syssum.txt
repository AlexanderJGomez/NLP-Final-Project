LONDON, England (CNN) -- With Quentin Tarantino's recent disclosure that Brad Pitt "pulled out a brick of hash" for the pair to smoke during a meeting about Tarantino's new film "Inglourious Basterds," the two movie icons could today be mistaken for old roomies.
At this stage, however, Tarantino was still not entirely convinced Pitt would be the best choice.
At this point, he was worried Pitt could already be committed for the next few years.
"It was a lot of fun working with Brad, which wasn't very surprising," Tarantino told CNN.
