Tokyo (CNN) -- A simmering dispute over islands in the East China Sea began to bite into trade between China and Japan on Tuesday as Chinese protests prompted Japanese companies to suspend work there.
Meanwhile, on the disputed islands, two Japanese men carried out a small-scale protest of their own Tuesday when they jumped from a fishing boat and swam to shore, spending a short amount of time on land, the Japanese Coast Guard reported.
China reasserted that claim last week, sending ships to patrol the area after the Japanese government announced it would buy several of the islands from a Japanese family.
But Japan's decision "really inflamed public opinion in China," he said.
A total of 11 Chinese government ships were near the islands on Tuesday afternoon, the Japanese Coast Guard said, adding that it had warned the vessels not to enter Japanese territorial waters.
"The U.S. handed over the islands to Japan for its own purpose during the Cold War," Guo Xiangjiang, the deputy director of the China Institute of International Studies, told CNN.
Japan's attempts to portray the purchase as a routine internal real-estate transaction, with the islands passing from one Japanese owner to another, has failed to placate the Chinese authorities.
