Knowing next to nothing about what they might encounter in the dark recesses of the hotel, Indian Army commandos decided to go back in -- and were met by terrorists firing mercilessly, throwing  grenades and continuously switching positions.
Watch what it was like inside the hotel for commandos Â»
"We did not know the layout of the hotel," the commando told reporters.
"Then we heard gunshots on the second floor and we rushed toward the fired shots," he said.
The attackers had a clear advantage, commandos said, because it was apparent from their movements they knew the hotel's layout.
As the commandos approached one of the rooms, attackers opened fire at them and said all the people in the room were dead.
But the attackers knew all the doors, he said.
"Within the first exchanges of fire, we could have got those terrorists -- but there was so many hotel guests -- there were bodies all over and blood all over.
In trying to rescue hostages and trapped civilians, commandos had to convince guests they were there to help, not terrorists trying to trick them, Indian Army Lt. Gen. Noble Thamburaj said.
Once they arrived, the sources said, commandos had no precise maps of the hotel layout or its access points.
While local police and other officers were at the scene, the sources said, the commandos and army special force units are the only ones equipped and trained to rescue hostages.
