Surely no one saw this coming after the U.S. stunned Russia in the group stage and scored 20 goals in its first four games.
"The way we played the last two games we didn't deserve (a medal)," U.S. captain Zach Parise told NHL.com.
"We didn't show up," U.S. forward Max Pacioretty told NHL.com.
There was also disappointment for the U.S. in arguably Saturday's biggest event, the men's slalom, on the penultimate day of the Olympics as Ted Ligety couldn't complete the second run.
Top spot went to Austria's Mario Matt, a feel-good story since the 34-year-old became the oldest man ever to claim alpine skiing gold.
"Not all the best guys had the chance to make it down, unfortunately, but it is what it is," Ligety told the U.S. ski team's website.
Bjoergen led a Norwegian sweep in Nordic skiing's 30-kilometer race to pick up her third gold of the Games and 10th Olympic medal overall -- no woman has gotten more at the Winter Games.
Vic Wild, born in the U.S. before switching nationalities to Russia when he married a Russian snowboarder, became the first athlete to win two snowboarding gold medals at the same Olympics when he triumphed in the men's parallel slalom ahead of Slovenia's Zan Kosir.
I would have moved on.
Russia has 29 medals, leading the U.S. by two, and is tied with Norway for 11 golds.
