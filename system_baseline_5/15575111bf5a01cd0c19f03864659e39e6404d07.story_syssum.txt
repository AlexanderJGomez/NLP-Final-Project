"It's alarming," says O'Neal.
For O'Neal, the fight against diabetes is personal.
"[Critics] would automatically say, 'He's out of shape,' but I wanted to just relax during the summer, hang out with the family, and then work my way into basketball-playing shape," says O'Neal.
"It's a different world we live in now," says O'Neal.
In addition to raising awareness on how to prevent diabetes through a healthy lifestyle, O'Neal says he also wants to help diabetics better manage their disease.
