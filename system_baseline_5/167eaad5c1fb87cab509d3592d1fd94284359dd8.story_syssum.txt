If you're Antoinette Tuff, who works in the front office at Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learning Academy just outside Atlanta, you don't run.
This brief outburst of emotion, moments after police entered the school Tuesday, was in stark contrast to her cool, calm demeanor as heard earlier on that 911 call.
"He doesn't want the kids, he wants the police, so back off," she said in the call.
"It's going to be all right, sweetie," she tells Hill at one point in the call.
He could, too.
This ending is thanks largely to Tuff, said McCray, the woman who fielded her 911 call.
School staff regularly train for dangerous situations involving trespassers and emergency protocol, school district spokesman Quinn Hudson said.
"Her name, Antoinette Tuff, says everything about her," said Brian Bolden, the school principal.
Tuff was scheduled to be off that day, but because of a shift change, she ended up right where the school needed her to be.
Counseling was made available to the kids, and the school understands that some children might not be ready to come back right away, he said.
Police spokeswoman Mekka Parish has said they would include aggravated assault on a police officer, terroristic threats and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.
But that county's district attorney, James Wright, said Wednesday that there's no indication that Hill completed them.
Being from DeKalb County, Hill "possibly had been there (at the school) before speaking with some people in the administration," Davis said.
"He entered a school, an elementary school with children in it ... to do one of two things: Either to do harm to those children and/or any first responders."
While he fired some rounds at police -- and one officer shot back at him -- no one was hit outside either.
