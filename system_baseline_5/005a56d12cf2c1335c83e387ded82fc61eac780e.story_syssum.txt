The embodiment of the rule of law internationally has been the U.N. Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights -- direct results of the devastation inflicted by the Nazi regime in Germany during the Second World War.
In 1945 the U.N. Charter was ratified by the U.S., the UK, and the majority of the 50 states who had originally agreed to this framework.
But this is not what happened 10 years ago at the behest of U.S. President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
getting in first) on the basis of a perceived future threat.
This argument, which was false, became the main basis for invasion because the only other route to war had been closed off by international law.
Tony Blair insisted to the British public that he would only support a war if a second Security Council resolution authorising the action was passed, but the resolution never came.
This was why Bush and Blair were not prepared to allow the weapons inspectors, who were in Iraq, any more time.
I believe George W. Bush and Tony Blair should be tried for war crimes as defined by international law.
Four transgressions were agreed -- war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, and the crime of aggression.
Whilst the act of aggression cannot be prosecuted, war crimes committed thereafter can be.
The UK has such a provision, but when put to the test by UK citizens seeking arrest warrants in relation to the planned visits of Israeli political and military leaders -- who were potentially responsible for war crimes in Gaza -- the UK government reprehensibly placed impediments in the way of its future use.
The whole episode regarding the Iraq War is a tawdry tale that has subverted the rule of law and tarnished the reputation of international law.
