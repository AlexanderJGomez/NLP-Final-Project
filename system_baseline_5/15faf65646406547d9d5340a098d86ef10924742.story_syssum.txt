Facing another boring day at work, a Toronto car repair shop worker decided some weed would be just the thing to make the day fly by.
The police forwarded the tweet to an account for a man listed on the board of directors for the repair shop chain.
Big smh to all of y'all," said one tweet.
MANNNNNNNN."
The York Regional Police explained in a later tweet, "If you shouted on a busy street corner about illegal activity & we drove by, we'd intervene.
Think of Twitter as a virtual street corner."
