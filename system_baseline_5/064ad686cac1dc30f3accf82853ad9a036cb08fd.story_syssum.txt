"While I believe that Rabbi Ralph Messer has good intentions during his message at New Birth, I understand that the ceremony he performed on Sunday, January 29th, caused harm to the Jewish community, for which I am deeply sorry," Long wrote.
Video from the ceremony showed Messer wrapping Long in the Torah scroll, which he said was recovered during the Holocaust.
He then directed four men to lift a seated Long in his chair and parade him before the New Birth congregation.
There's no Jewish coronation ceremony where someone is wrapped in a Torah and made a king, he said.
Norry said Messer doesn't appear to be an ordained rabbi in the Jewish faith.
He settled out of court.
