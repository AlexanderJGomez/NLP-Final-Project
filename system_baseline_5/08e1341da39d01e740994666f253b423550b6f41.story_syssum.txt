The concept is relatively new (launched last October), so as of now, Houssard and Alfano are still in talks with various airlines.
The idea of in-flight gambling may seem like a new one, principally because no airline is currently doing it.
However, the idea of in-flight gambling re-emerged a few years ago.
"Casinos were just an idea, along with many other ideas we talked about a few years ago," a Virgin spokesman told CNN.
Ryanair announced in 2004 that it would introduce gambling through an in-flight entertainment system, though this too has yet to come to fruition.
Houssard and Alfano also don't see online gambling as competition to their own concept.
The Casino Jet Lounge isn't just a bar or entertainment idea.
The biggest obstacle to in-flight gambling, however, is a legal one.
A lot of things are changing."
