Editor's note: Rich Roll, one of Men's Fitness magazine's "25 Fittest Guys in the World" in 2009, was the first athlete to compete in the Ultraman World Championships on an entirely plant-based diet.
I mean very winded.
I was fat, unhappy and fed up.
I don't care how old you are, how many kids you have or how little time you think you have.
Not a vague, wishy-washy notion that I should "get in shape," maybe "eat better" or possibly "go on a diet," but rather a specific long-term plan to enhance my wellness in a way that would not only stick, but fit within the parameters of my busy life as a full-time lawyer, husband and father of four small children.
And not only did I keep the weight off, I was the most fit I had ever been in my life.
But my point is that change starts with a decision followed by baby steps along a new, consistent trajectory that, over time, can lead to dramatic results.
I'm nothing special.
Set a goal: Vague, nonspecific notions of "getting fit," "going to the gym," or "eating better" are all fine, but they are not true "goals" and all too typically devolve, paving the way for relapse to old habits.
A good support network is a key to success.
But beware of the negative dream crushers.
I feel quite strongly that a nutrition program built entirely around plant-based foods and completely devoid of animal products is optimal.
Personally, I cannot overemphasize the difference this has made in my own life, a secret weapon for enhanced athletic performance and overall long-term wellness.
One day at a time: Large goals can seem insurmountable.
Maybe I'll eat it tomorrow, just not today."
No matter how busy you are, if you are truly honest about this inquiry, I guarantee you can make some cuts and carve out some time.
Positive change is always within your grasp, and today still remains the first day of the rest of your life.
