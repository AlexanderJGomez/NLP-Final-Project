Key West, Florida (CNN) -- For more than 20 years, the bulletproof museum case housed a small piece of yesteryear: a gold bar recovered from a sunken Spanish galleon.
"This is a special piece," said Melissa Kendrick, executive director of the Mel Fisher Maritime Museum in Key West, Florida.
"That's why these crimes don't make a whole lot of money for the criminals," said Robert Wittman, a former FBI agent who once headed the FBI's Art Crime Team.
Then, after a security guard left this part of the museum, a man can be seen reaching into the case housing the gold bar and placing the little piece of history into his pocket before exiting the museum.
What makes the crime so shocking, police said, is that the thieves were able to snap the glass at its edges.
The stolen bar is one of dozens of gold and silver bars retrieved from the bottom of the sea.
Wittman, the former FBI agent and author of "Priceless: How I Went Undercover to Rescue the World's Stolen Treasures," said the market is incredibly small for these high-profile objects.
Ten, 15, sometimes 20 years, because the thieves couldn't get rid of them," he said.

Key West authorities said they believe the thieves were not locals and that they are probably long gone.
