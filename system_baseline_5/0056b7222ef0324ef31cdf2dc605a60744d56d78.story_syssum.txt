(CNN) -- World number one Caroline Wozniacki suffered another morale-sapping defeat at the French Open as she was dumped out by 28th seed Daniela Hantuchova.
"She played very well today, better than me for sure," Wozniacki told a press conference.
The Argentine set the tone by taking the first four games of the match, and though she dropped the second set, Stosur's 35 unforced errors counted as Dulko wrapped up the match.
Russian third seed Vera Zvonareva beat Anastasia Rodionova, from Austria, 6-2 6-3 and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, the 14th seed, triumphed over Nuria Llagostera Vives, from Spain, 3-6 6-3 6-3.
