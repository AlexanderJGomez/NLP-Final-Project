Each year the tuition goes up, students bring out banners and loudspeakers, shave their heads, take over the university president's office and use other creative methods to get the schools to cut back on tuition.
Stories of students and fathers committing suicide due to the pressure of tuition circulated in the local media earlier this year, and students are frustrated with President Lee Myung-bak for not having kept his campaign promise to reduce college tuition by half if he was voted into power.
Whatever the promise, students say the cost of tuition and living is too high.
"I wasn't sure if the education I was receiving was worth all these loans," Lee said.
At least for tuition fees I can take out loans for now," said Lee.
"I can't ask my parents to shoulder all of that for me, so I'm usually working part-time jobs non-stop," Lim said at the protest.
"I personally want the tuition to be cheaper, but I think that's not something I can do on my own.
