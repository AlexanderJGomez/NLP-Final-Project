(CNN) -- It's the height of summer in Paris, and the director of the most famous art museum in the world is queuing like any other tourist.
Why?
It's an ambitious vision for the 220-year-old gallery, an institution so steeped in prestige that Martinez underwent an interview with French President Francois Hollande before being offered the role.
But then, Martinez isn't like previous directors.
How?
It's part of a growing Louvre empire, with another gallery set to open in Abu Dhabi in 2015, exhibiting 300 works from French museums.
"No," says Martinez.
