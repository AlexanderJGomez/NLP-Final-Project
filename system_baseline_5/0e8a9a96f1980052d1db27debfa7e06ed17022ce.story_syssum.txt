So far critics haven't found a lot of evidence that the pair can go home again in terms of replicating what made the first film beloved (and yes we remember the 1995 animated TV show "Dumb and Dumber: The Series" and the 2003 movie prequel "Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd").
Here are a few examples.
The series about a teenaged private detective ended in 2007 but the "Veronica Mars" motion picture landed in theaters in 2014 after a successful Kickstarter campaign.
Look up "cult classic" and "Arrested Development" will be right there.
It took 23 years to get a sequel to the wildly popular 1960 horror film "Psycho."
The original "Tron" was released in 1982, also known as the early days of CG special effects.
Many from the original cast were on board for the new series "Girl Meets World" which premiered in June 2014 and found Cory and Topanga now married and the parents of a pre-teen daughter named Riley.
The HBO series about a washed-up TV actress desperate to get back into the game never gained traction and only lasted one season in 2005 despite a devoted fan base.
That happened in November 2014 when the network brought it back years later for a second season.
