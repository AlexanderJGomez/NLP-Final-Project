"Unlike the Obama campaign, Gov.
Romney is running a campaign based on jobs and the economy, and we encourage everyone else to do the same," Romney's campaign manager Matt Rhoades said in a written statement.
Gingrich blamed the super PAC blitz and the Romney campaign ads for his eventual loss in the Sunshine State.
Indeed, Obama's campaign also realized it could benefit from super PAC money, despite the president's vocal opposition to the 2010 Supreme Court decision.
"This decision was not made overnight," one campaign official said. "
I guarantee it."
