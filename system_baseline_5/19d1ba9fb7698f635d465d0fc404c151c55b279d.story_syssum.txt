The time has come for all to accept that terrorists cannot be treated as criminals.
Finally, even terrorists not bent on committing suicide attacks are often "true believers" who are prepared to proceed despite whatever punishments the legal system may throw at them.
Nor should terrorists be treated as soldiers, a dignified profession and calling.
As such, terrorists are not without any rights.
Or terrorists may be kept at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, or shipped to countries that do not abide by our rules or maybe only to those that do.
