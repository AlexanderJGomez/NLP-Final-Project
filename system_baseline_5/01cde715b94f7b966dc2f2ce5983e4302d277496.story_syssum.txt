Just over half the public says that it's bad for the country that the GOP controls the House of Representatives, according to a new national poll conducted after the end of the partial government shutdown.
This is the first time since the Republicans won back control of the House in the 2010 midterm elections that a majority say their control of the chamber is bad for the country.
We just didn't win," Boehner said at the end of the shutdown.
Only 12% of those questioned say they approve of the job Congress is doing, just two points higher than the historic low in CNN polling.
According to the survey, 44% also say they have more confidence in Obama rather than the GOP in Congress to deal with the major issues facing the country today, a 5-point drop from last year; 31% say they have more confidence in congressional Republicans, unchanged from last December.
According to the poll, just more than four in 10 say they favor the law, with 56% opposed to it.
The health care numbers are little changed from late last month, just before the start of the shutdown.
