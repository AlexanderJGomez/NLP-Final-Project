Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- A former University of Central Florida student found dead in his dorm room of an apparent suicide, alongside weapons and a backpack of bombs, planned a larger attack, officials said Monday.
The chief told CNN's Erin Burnett that he believes Seevakumaran built the bombs himself, but authorities were still trying to figure out how Seevakumaran was going to carry out his plan and whom he was going to target.
Police believe that Seevakumaran then went to his room to pick up the weapons.
Beary said police are still investigating to find out "what made him tick," but early indications were that Seevakumaran had very few friends and had anger issues.
"Nobody said what was going on with a bomb and the shooting.
The university said it was providing food and counseling for the evacuated students at its Veterans Academic Resource Center.
"He was just above us," Graham said.
