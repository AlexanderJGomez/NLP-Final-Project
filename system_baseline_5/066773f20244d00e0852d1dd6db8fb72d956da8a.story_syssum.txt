Christin Howard, a 20-year-old hair dresser, was attacked by a group of men on Detroit's Riverwalk during the Motor City Pride event on Sunday.
At one point I thought they were going to kill me," Howard said.
"No one should have to endure an attack like Christin Howard did ... pride celebrations offer people in our communities an opportunity to feel safe in expressing our authentic selves," said Yvnoone Siferd, director of victim services for Equality Michigan.
The Detroit Police Department is investigating and calls the attack a hate crime.
