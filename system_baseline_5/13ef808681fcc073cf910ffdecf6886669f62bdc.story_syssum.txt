Fannie Mae foreclosed on the Akron, Ohio, home of Addie Polk, 91, after acquiring the mortgage in 2007.
But Polk didn't run from the troubling eviction notices that were placed time and time again on her door in Akron, Ohio.
Polk, made news last fall when she shot herself during an eviction, died Monday at the Arbors at Fairlawn nursing home near Akron.
After Polk's ordeal last October sparked national outrage, Fannie Mae moved to halt the foreclosure process and "give her the house," company spokesman Brian Faith said at the time.
Akron Sheriff's Deputy Donald Fatheree, in a telephone interview with CNN on Tuesday, said he'd personally been to Polk's door about six times to deliver eviction notices.
"Never did reach her, but always left notes," Fatheree said.
"This bill does nothing for the Addie Polks of the world," Kucinich said.
