Okorie Okorocha, the lawyer who initially filed the lawsuit in federal court last week, said his second client called him Thursday morning and said he was fired.
Allred said Tuesday that she and John Doe #1 would discuss if a new lawsuit would be filed against Travolta.
That dismissal was "without prejudice, which means that he is still legally entitled to file a lawsuit against John Travolta if he chooses," Allred said.
"John Doe 1 and John Doe 2 contacted my offices and neither I nor anyone in my law firm solicited either of these two clients.
"Clients come to me," Allred said.
"If Travolta doesn't take responsibility, I'm going to file those cases," he said.
