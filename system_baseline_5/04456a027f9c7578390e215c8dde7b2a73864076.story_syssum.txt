Zhukova said the lawmaker had confirmed a newspaper report identifying a colonel in Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service as the source who tipped off U.S. officials.
The paper quotes a source who says the U.S., fearing that the Russian intelligence agency would pull its agents from the U.S., rounded them up and arrested them.
He betrayed either for the money or he was caught for something.
The colonel's son also fled Russia for the United States not long before the spies were arrested, according to the paper.
