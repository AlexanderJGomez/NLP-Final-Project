(CNN) -- Help trickled in Thursday, three days after a magnitude-7.7 earthquake struck off Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that has killed at least 311 people and left more than 400 missing.
Urgent needs are expected to include clean water, food, blankets, clothing, medical attention, emergency shelter and hygiene kits, said Ita Balanda, a program manager for the World Vision aid organization in Padang, Indonesia.
Monday's quake generated a "significant" tsunami, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said.
Some of the missing might include people who are unaccounted for after fleeing to higher ground, said Henri Dori Satoko, head of the Mentawai Islands parliament.
... For Mentawai villagers, the warning is late, as they are very close to the tsunami source," said Sanny Jegillos of the U.N. Development Programme.
Indonesia's government has since warned residents of West Sumatra province to stay alert and stay away from the coastline for up to five days because of the possibility of more earthquakes, Balanda said.
