Virginia police said earlier that someone may be helping Jeffrey Scott Easley, 32, subject of a felony abduction warrant in the case of Brittany Mae Smith.
"As to what relationship Jeff Easley and Brittany may have between them is irrelevant," Lavinder said.
Easley and Brittany are believed to have bought several other items at a Salem, Virginia, Walmart before they disappeared.
She would not provide details of an autopsy.
Lavinder asked Easley to safely return Brittany so that she could attend Tina Smith's funeral.
Police are "confident" that the girl is with Easley, Lavinder said.
Nobody seemed to know where she was," said Roanoke County Police Lt. Chuck Mason Monday, according to CNN affiliate WSET of Lynchburg, Virginia, adding that police were concerned her disappearance "has something to do with the homicide."
Hall said authorities don't yet have a specific search area, as they are uncertain which direction Easley might be heading or how far he might have gotten.
