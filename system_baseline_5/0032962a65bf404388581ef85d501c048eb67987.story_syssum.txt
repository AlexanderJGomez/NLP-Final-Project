Not for nothing was the name Nixon, Bush or Dole on the GOP presidential ticket from 1952 to 2004.
But a fresh-out-of-the-oven CNN presidential poll shows a fractured GOP field of newcomers with no clear front-runner while the Democrats have given an unprecedented lead to a brand name of their own: Hillary Clinton.
But that doesn't seem to be the case for Ryan, who emerged from the 2012 presidential race arguably damaged by his association with the Romney campaign.
And then, at the bottom of the barrel, come two 2012 aspirants: Texas Gov.
Far from being strengthened by their 2012 campaigns, these two candidates seem weakened by the experience.
Below Biden are first-term Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 7%, New York Gov.
She will also be positioned as the candidate of the 51%, compelling to women of all ages and even possibly competitive among Republican women in this incarnation.
And while successful governors like Cuomo and O'Malley have earned the right to be taken seriously as presidential candidates, the party faithful don't seem to be much interested in buying what they are selling at the moment.
