(CNN)  -- A commuter airliner that crashed Thursday in upstate New York, killing 50 people, underwent violent pitching and rolling seconds before impact, with passengers experiencing twice the normal force of gravity, a federal investigator said Sunday.
Chealander said the plane's de-icing system was turned on 11 minutes after the flight left Newark, New Jersey, for Buffalo, and remained on for the entire flight.
The plane was on autopilot during its approach to the Buffalo airport, Chealander said.
"To say that they should not have been flying on autopilot is not correct," Chealander said.
Offering more details, Chealander said Sunday that the plane's nose pitched up 31 degrees, then down 45 degrees.
Chealander said the NTSB's investigation of the crash site indicated that the two propellers on the turboprop aircraft were in place when the crash occurred.
