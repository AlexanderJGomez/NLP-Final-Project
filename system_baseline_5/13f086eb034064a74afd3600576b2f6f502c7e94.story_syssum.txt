A Thai army spokesman said the two nations had planned meetings between their defense ministers to discuss a cease-fire.
The spokesman said Cambodians unsuccessfully attempted to seize Ta Muen and Ta Kwai temples on Tuesday night, leaving one civilian dead.
Cambodia has said three of its troops have been killed in the fighting.
