But perhaps no pardon is as confounding as the case of Harry Bostick.
When Barbour pardoned Bostick in January, the convicted DUI felon was sitting in an Oxford, Mississippi, jail cell for violating the terms of a previous DUI sentence and was awaiting formal charges from yet another drunken driving accident in October that ended in the tragic death of 18-year-old Charity Smith.
The Mississippi Parole Board and Barbour have issued statements saying they didn't know Bostick had another DUI arrest in October.
It came after his pardon case had already been reviewed.
The letters detail what friends described as Bostick's slide into alcoholism after the tragic death of his teenage son in a "freakish house fire" and after Bostick's divorce, according to pardon and parole documents obtained by CNN.
On September 30, the Mississippi Parole Board sent its review of the Bostick case to Barbour.
The Mississippi Parole Board and Barbour are at a loss to explain how Bostick's pardon could have unfolded the way it did.
Bosticks' pardon application packet sent from the Parole Board to the governor's office is filled with references to the "expedited investigation into the circumstances surrounding Bostick's crime," meaning his third DUI from 2009.
Linda Smith, Charity's mother, worries her teenage daughter's death has been forgotten in all of this.
A beautiful person," said Linda Smith.
One of the paintings was a gift from Charity Smith to her mother.
