Over the next decade, the African Wildlife Foundation is building 15 conservation-themed primary schools in some of Africa's most remote regions -- areas that are also highly strategic from an environmental standpoint.
Bergin notes that when it comes to education in Africa, resources go first to schools in the city, then to those in the surrounding towns.
"We work in a lot of parts of Africa that are remote, but this takes the cake," says Bergin.
Architectural firm MASS Design Group has partnered with the African Wildlife Foundation to build the schools.
They know how to build with rainfall in mind," says Michael Murphy, CEO of Mass Design.
Like Bergin, Murphy views the schools project as a means to really impact the continent.
"They could build tens of thousands of schools in the next decade," says Murphy.
