(Financial Times) -- South Korean financial regulators will investigate the Seoul branches of Standard Chartered and HSBC in light of money laundering allegations against both banks by regulators in the US.
One former senior regulator said that financial watchdogs in South Korea -- which has long seen the US as its most important ally -- would be particularly concerned by any suggestion of illicit dealings with Iran.
"The Korean financial regulators have always been quite mindful of the US sanctions and the regulations related to Iranian counterparties," he said.
It reached a preliminary agreement in April to sell its Korean retail business to Korea Development Bank, but talks broke down last month.
