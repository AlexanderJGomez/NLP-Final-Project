On Monday Rolls-Royce posted its best results in its 107-year-history with 3,538 cars -- which cost upwards of Â£200,000 ($308,000) -- sold in 2011, a 31% rise over the previous year's figure.
The booming Rolls-Royce sales figures come days after its former sister company, Bentley, posted a 37% rise in global sales, also on the back of rising sales to China and the U.S.
In the 1970s, 545,000 people were employed in Britain's car factories, making 15 million cars during that decade.

The Rolls-Royce brand was doing well, he said, because it married British heritage with BMW's sales and marketing expertise.
Industry analyst Paul Nieuwenhuis said that while many customers bought luxury cars "by the meter" -- that is to say they care more about the image than the machine -- modern Rolls-Royce cars were exceptional vehicles.
The rights to use the Rolls-Royce name have been owned by BMW since 1998 when Vickers sold off Rolls-Royce Motors, which also made Bentley cars.
