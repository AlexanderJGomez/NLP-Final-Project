Turns out, some insurance companies say they are receiving data from the administration that is incomplete, duplicative or contradictory, making it difficult to get an accurate count of new enrollment.
But it's incorrect to say that's the only problem," an insurance industry official said.
But sometimes that data come with conflicting information, showing for instance, someone who enrolled and then canceled a plan, said an insurance industry executive.
An administration official did not dispute there have been problems with data sent by the government to insurers.
So far, the buzz in the insurance industry is that enrollment numbers are falling short of projections.
