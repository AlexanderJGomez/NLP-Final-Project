And Foxy Loxy is concerned there will be massive job losses and our economy will crash.
Here's why:
This year, the sequester would slow the growth in federal spending by just $85 billion, from an expected, pre-sequester budget of $3.64 trillion -- less than a 2.3% reduction.
It is true that the cuts are not spread equally across all types of federal spending.
That would leave domestic discretionary spending, after adjusting for inflation, at roughly the same level as 2009.
In fact, defense spending would really be cut, in the sense of actually spending less, over the next two years.
Keeping all this in perspective, over the entire 10-year period covered by the sequester, defense spending would average roughly $100 billion more each year (after adjusting for inflation) than we spent at the height of the cold war.
If our economy can't survive spending cuts of that size, we truly are Greece.
Given that the private sector generally puts those resources to a more productive use, it is likely that government spending destroys more jobs over the long run than it creates.
