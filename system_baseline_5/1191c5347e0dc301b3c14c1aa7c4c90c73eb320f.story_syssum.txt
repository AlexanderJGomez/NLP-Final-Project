Dulles, Virginia (CNN)Two quick-thinking passengers in the third row of a United flight to Denver tackled and subdued a man who was heading toward the cockpit, other travelers on the plane told CNN on Tuesday.
She said the unruly man had come down the aisle, screaming about the plane going too slow and flailing his arms.

Lindstrom said two other people helped keep the man on the floor for the 20 minutes or so that it took the flight crew to return to Dulles.
The plane returned to Dulles around 10:40 p.m., said Kimberly Gibbs, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, which runs the northern Virginia airport.
As of late Tuesday evening, the passenger had not been arrested or charged with a crime, officials said.
CNN's Rene Marsh reported from Dulles Airport, and CNN's Steve Almasy and Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta.
