(CNN) -- Five days ago, Justin Bieber wasn't worried about a thing.
For the past week, we've heard little from Bieber that didn't include him hanging out with friends.
We know that Bieber flew down to Miami on a Monday, and the reports of what he's being doing there -- aside from his recent arrest -- include spending $75,000 in a strip club.
But before the police arrived, Bieber and his car companion -- who's been identified as model Chantel Jeffries -- were captured enjoying a night drive, an image shared on Bieber's friend Khalil's Instagram account.
Obviously, given the circumstances, we can imagine that the star won't be sharing any Twitter updates for a while.
