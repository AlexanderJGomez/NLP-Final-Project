Spain international Diego Costa scored the winning goal midway through the second half after a much improved Liverpool took an early lead and can count themselves unlucky after having a goal disallowed and strong claims for a penalty waved way.
Liverpool lost that game 1-0, with a much improved performance, which some saw as a sort of vindication for Rodgers.
Cahill would soon get his chance to make amends after smuggling home a lose ball following a Chelsea free kick into the penalty area.
Yet Liverpool will count themselves unlucky not to have won a penalty after Cahill was again involved in another controversial moment in the game.
It was quite obvious.
The win saw Chelsea extend its lead at the top of the Premier League to seven points, but only briefly.
Spain international Juan Mata scored the only goal of the game after coming off the bench.
From the resulting free kick from the first disallowed goal, City goalkeeper Joe Hart passed the ball straight to Austin who slotted the ball home again.
Premier League top scorer Sergio Aguero leveled the score, despite being both offside and handling the ball in the build up, before a late Martin Demichelis own goal appeared to have handed QPR an unlikely victory.
