(CNN)  -- I am Shane Stanford.
A race against time.
And, so, the race began.
And, oddly enough, I would not trade it with anyone.
No color can adequately define a mosaic, any more than one hardship, failure or achievement can define a person's life.
I run to make life matter, seeking more than the right way to go, but actually going there and watching the race mean something.
