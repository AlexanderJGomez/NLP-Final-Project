Airline industry experts insist standards of in-flight food are improving.
But the criticism passengers target at airline food is not always warranted, Miller argues.
Miller acknowledges that there have been cut backs on catering across short-haul flights and a decline in spending on food in long-haul economy.
Austrian catering company DO & CO has transformed the food served onboard Austrian Airlines and Turkish Airlines flights.
Good quality airline food not only depends on the quality of raw ingredients, he says, but also the intangible elements of good cuisine.
Austrian Airlines has won the Skytrax award for Best Business Class Catering for the last two years.
And for Austrian Airlines, one unique selling point is its food.
British chef, Gordon Ramsay is one of Singapore Airline's "Culinary Panel"; Juan Amador works with Lufthansa; and United Airlines enlisted the services of U.S. chef Charlie Trotter to inspire its in-flight menu.
But he does acknowledge that some chefs have influenced a new style of in-flight cuisine.
But on long-haul flights, airlines are restrained in what they can cut.
