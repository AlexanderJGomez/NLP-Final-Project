(CNN) -- Finally, after days of listing on a disabled Carnival cruise ship without electricity and working toilets, thousands of passengers finished disembarking early Friday morning at the Port of Mobile.
The Carnival Triumph, became a major media story, when it caught fire off the coast of Mexico.
The beleaguered CEO went on the ship as passengers departed and delivered another apology.
"The hallways were toxic," said Reyes, who said she would never go on a Carnival cruise again.
Despite the ordeal, many passengers had nothing but praise for the crew, saying they had worked long shifts to make sure their guests were as comfortable as possible.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials, Coast Guard members and a Carnival team boarded the ship before it arrived in port to help speed efforts to get passengers off as quickly as possible, he said.
Marissa Jenks said her family reported they had a hot meal Thursday morning and crew members were trying to clean up the ship as it neared port.
Poret said toilets on the ship worked on and off, but were too inconsistent to trust.
The incident aboard the ship scared Poret's daughter and a friend taking the cruise with her, Poret said.
Aboard the cruise ship?
The cruise line said it would give each passenger $500, a free flight home, a full refund for their trip and for most expenses on board, as well as a credit for another cruise.
"The passengers on the ship aren't going to have a great deal of recourse when they get home," he said.
In 2010, the Carnival cruise ship Splendor lost power after an engine room fire, leaving it drifting off the Pacific coast of Mexico.
After this ill-fated cruise, the Carnival Triumph won't host vacationing passengers until at least mid-April.
