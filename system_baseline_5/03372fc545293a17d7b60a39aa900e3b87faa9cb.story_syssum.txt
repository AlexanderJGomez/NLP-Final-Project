But Schaefer saw nothing remarkable about her decision.
Schaefer ultimately raised more than $250,000 for the school, which was completed in 2006.
Though she'd hoped to name the school in memory of Medhine, the government -- which runs the school -- instead named it the Lidia Secondary School, telling Schaefer, "We want it to be your name so that more people [will] be like you."
Schaefer still sets aside her tips and wages to support her school and has kept up her fundraising efforts to buy supplies.
Her colleagues and clients say Schaefer serves as an important reminder that people don't need money or power to make a difference.
