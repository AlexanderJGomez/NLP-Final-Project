But the current crisis follows a months-long standoff between Thai authorities and protesters opposed to the government of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva.
Violence erupted again last week when protesters once again ignored an ultimatum to end their occupation in downtown Bangkok by Wednesday.
Authorities have urged protesters to evacuate the protest area by Monday afternoon or face up to two years in prison for violating the order.
Media and analysts in Thailand say civil war may be looming, between the Red Shirts and the so-called "multi-colored shirts" (who support Abhisit).
Some protesters argue that the Red Shirt movement should negotiate with the government to reach a settlement.
Those protesters donned yellow shirts (the color of the king) and occupied the two main airports in Bangkok, until finally the pro-Thaksin government was brought down by a court ruling.
Thaksin's supporters then picked a color to distinguish themselves from the Yellow Shirts.
Thaksin rode to power by enacting populist policies which gained huge support from the rural poor.
If you sport red, you think Thaksin was the only prime minister to offer the rural poor a voice and real benefits; if you wear yellow, you view him as akin to Ferdinand Marcos: greedy, self-serving and dangerous.
Thailand's relations with Cambodia are especially frosty since Thaksin was appointed economic adviser to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen.
Many western embassies have shut their doors and are warning their citizens against travel to Bangkok as violence in the city continues.
