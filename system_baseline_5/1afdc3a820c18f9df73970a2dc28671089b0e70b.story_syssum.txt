(CNN) -- The Department of Homeland Security has ordered U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents to verify, "effective immediately," that every foreign student who wants to enter the United States has a valid student visa, a U.S. government official told CNN on Friday.
Tazhayakov's student status is less clear.
"The fact that a foreign national was able to re-enter the U.S. with what appeared to be a valid student visa, while Customs and Border Protection officers were unaware that his visa status had become invalid, represents a serious hole in our national security," McCaul told CNN.
"It's surprising that the administration isn't already verifying that any student coming into the country has a valid student visa," Grassley said.
Grassley sent a letter and list of questions Friday to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, asking her about the apparent visa lapse with Tazhayakov and other possible loopholes.
