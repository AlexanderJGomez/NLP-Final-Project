"Stereotypes in the media reduce Indian country to the Plains Indian in a headdress," said scholar Adrienne Keene, a member of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma whom Wilbur photographed for the series.
"(Project 562) gives people an opportunity to see the diversity in Indian country and reframe what they think of when they think of Native Americans."
The project is also building relationships in Indian country, cultivating bonds among Wilbur, the participants and also connecting them to elite institutions like the Tacoma Art Museum, Keene said.
"The project is for the people, not just native people but everyone," Wilbur said.
Letting them decide is central to the project, Wilbur said.
Wilbur and Keene knew each other before Project 562 through their efforts in a larger movement in Indian country to change negative perceptions of Native Americans.
"We talked about how to me, being a real Cherokee means I can go to those places and feel a connection with the land and know my ancestors stood there thousands of years ago," she said.
The concept of identity is fluid from person to person and generation to generation, Wilbur said.
"The life we live is for the people," Wilbur said.
"That's what I was raised for, to find my gift and share it with the community."
