(CNN)In 1982, songwriter San Bao fell in love with musical theater  -- then an alien art form in China  -- when he saw a videotaped version of CATS, which became the longest running musical in Broadway history.
"It takes time for people to appreciate this art form," said San Bao.
But high ticket prices mean these shows reach a limited audience, and it's typically only the most accessible Broadway hits that resonate with a Chinese audience, says Zhou Yinchen, the head of the Folk Music and Musical Research Center at Peking University's Academy of Arts.
Nonetheless, the rave reviews audiences have given to these shows make musical producers like San Bao confident that combining Broadway showmanship with Chinese plot lines will one day result in a sure-fire hit.
"The musical industry is China is still immature," he said.
