Marlon Jackson: I talked to Frank Dileo, Michael's manager.
Michael looked great.
Jackson: He wasn't in a wheelchair.
Jackson: May 14 was the last time I spoke with him.
Jackson: I've been trying to get a hold of my mom.
I talked to my brother Jackie and he said, "Marlon, is it true?"
Jackson: Michael had passed.
People are at the hospital, at the Jackson family home in Gary, Indiana, at his star on the Walk of Fame.
Jackson: I never knew the effect the Jackson 5 had on people until I began traveling with a major broadcasting network, and people would say our songs were the reason for them getting married.
Michael was known all over the world, and that's why people care, and it's nice to see that people care.
Jackson: He's going to live on.
The memories, all the great things he has done, and my family is going to miss him.
Jackson: And that's the way we saw him, as a younger brother.
It hurts right now.
