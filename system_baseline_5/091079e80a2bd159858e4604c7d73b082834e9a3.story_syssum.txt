While other kids his age spent their Saturday shopping at the mall or tossing around a football, Tolbert traveled from Shippensburg, Pennsylvania, to Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington dressed in a navy blue Civil War reenactment uniform and armed with a brass bugle.
Taps, traditionally played at military funerals and also known as "Butterfield's Lullaby" or "Day is Done," were born during the Civil War along the James River.
Others, like Tolbert, chose them for their significance.
For those who did serve in the military, playing taps in Arlington National Cemetery is one of the greatest honors for a bugler.
Allison Cummings, a patrol officer from Hudson, New Hampshire, usually plays taps at law enforcement funerals and ceremonies in her home state, but said playing in Arlington was a unique experience.
Even from that age, I remember visiting here when I just started playing," said Cummings, dressed in a black uniform trimmed in gold with her trumpet hanging by her side.
