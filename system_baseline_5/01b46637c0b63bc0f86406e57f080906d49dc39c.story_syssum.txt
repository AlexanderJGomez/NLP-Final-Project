He will go by the name of Chaz.

It may come as a surprise for many people in this country to recognize that many of us who are transsexual are not embarrassed, ashamed or otherwise apologetic of who or what we are.

Because transgender people are here to stay.
These are not things to fear.
That is not something to fear.
