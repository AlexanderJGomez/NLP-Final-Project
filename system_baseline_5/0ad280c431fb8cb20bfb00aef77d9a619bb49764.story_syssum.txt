In an upcoming issue of Rolling Stone magazine, Williams talks about the convicted rapists after a news report about the case appeared on a nearby TV screen during the interview.
Of the victim, Williams also says in the interview: "She's 16, why was she that drunk where she doesn't remember?
For someone to be raped, and at only sixteen, is such a horrible tragedy!
"I am currently reaching out to the girl's family to let her know that I am deeply sorry for what was written in the Rolling Stone article.
