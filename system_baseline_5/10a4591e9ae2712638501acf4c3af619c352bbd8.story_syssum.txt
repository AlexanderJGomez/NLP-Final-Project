The arrest was made by police from Lakeland, Florida, the Polk County Sheriff's Office and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, who were accompanied by FBI agents, he said.
The FBI said Holt worked for Wiles at the time he disappeared.
When he vanished without a trace, fellow employees said they were stunned.
Without disclosing details, agents said the investigation led them back to Holt and his whereabouts the day Wiles disappeared.
When CNN interviewed them last year, Wiles' mother, Pamela, said, "We're willing to work with them and do anything to get him back.
The FBI will not reveal what makes agents believe Wiles is dead.
