(CNN) -- It's the worst-kept secret since Adam Lambert's sexuality: Apple is expected to unveil a new iPhone on Tuesday.
All will become clear at 10 a.m. PT on Tuesday when Apple hosts its iPhone "launch" event at its headquarters in Cupertino, California.
-- The phone will be called the iPhone 5 or iPhone 4S.
-- The phone will have a "teardrop" back, meaning it's fatter at the top than the bottom, according to the blog This is My Next.
That e-mail Apple sent to journalists: "Let's talk iPhone."
-- It's possible Apple will unveil not one -- but TWO iPhones.
-- Based on Apple's past iPhone release patterns, the phone (or phones) will likely go on sale later this month (most bloggers predict mid-October).
It wouldn't be the first time Cook helped with an Apple presentation -- he appeared onstage in January when the company unveiled an iPhone on Verizon's network -- but it would be his first time as headliner.
