Former officers normally become civil servants -- a dead end for Hao as a physical examination that includes HIV screening is mandatory for government job applicants and HIV-positive candidates are disqualified.
Their most recent outcry was triggered by a Commerce Ministry proposal that would bar people with HIV from entering bathhouses, including those offering spa and massage services.
"HIV transmission in a bathhouse or spa setting is not possible, and the use of such facilities by people living with HIV poses absolutely no risk from a public health perspective," the China office of UNAIDS said in a statement.
Liu and Hao both recounted their difficulty in accessing medical care as many public hospitals still turn away HIV-positive patients when they seek treatment for other illnesses.
Last month, another HIV-positive man in Jiangsu Province sued local officials, when he was denied a government job despite scoring the highest among all applicants.
"What's really dreadful is the ignorance on HIV/AIDS and the prejudice against AIDS patients."
"We have brought the topic of HIV/AIDS into schools but we only talk about the harm caused by the disease," said Meng Lin, who tested positive for the virus some 20 years ago and now runs the China Alliance for People Living with HIV/AIDS.
