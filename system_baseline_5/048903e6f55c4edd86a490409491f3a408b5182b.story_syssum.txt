St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch told CNN affiliate KMOV that his office planned to begin presenting the case to a grand jury Wednesday.
The most high-profile figure in President Barack Obama's administration to visit Ferguson, Holder has stressed that the federal government is on the case and listening -- both to protesters calling for Wilson's arrest and for an end to what they describe as a heavy-handed police response, and to residents and law enforcement officers challenged with looting and violence from some in the crowd.
That said -- for all the symbolic significance of a sitting attorney general visiting the site of an active investigation -- what happens in the St. Louis County courts may more likely impact activists' bottom line: justice for Brown's family in the form of Wilson's arrest.
Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman who has been a protest fixture, thinks installing a special prosecutor would be smart given the African-American community's distrust of the county prosecutor and law enforcement in general.
While not as large in number as previous days, protesters were out again Wednesday night.
Officers -- lined up in front of businesses, wearing helms and shields -- responded by sprinting after young men.
Ron Johnson, who is in charge of security, later told reporters someone threw urine on police.
Police arrested 47 people, Johnson said, including a car full of people who he said were armed and threatened to shoot an officer.
Looking at crowd members through the scope of a gun sends the wrong message, he said.
In addition to meeting with Michael Brown's parents, Holder talked at nearby Florissant Valley Community College about his own experiences as a black man with racial profiling -- including once when police flagged him down for no apparent reason in Washington, when he was a federal prosecutor.
