I know, because I'm a child of Alzheimer's.
That's right.
Alzheimer's is a disease that kills.
An Oscar for "Still Alice" is shining the brightest light yet on Alzheimer's, but light isn't enough anymore.
Today nearly two-thirds of those with Alzheimer's are women -- that's more than 3.2 million women.
So, in partnership with the Alzheimer's Association and so many inspiring women already working on the front lines to fight this disease, we have launched the Wipe Out Alzheimer's Challenge, a multipronged campaign powered by women's brains.
And why is it that women in their 60s are so much more likely to get Alzheimer's than breast cancer?
Is there an Alzheimer's connection with depression or with diabetes?
Yet, as the Alzheimer's Association tells us, "the costs to all payers for the care of people living with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias will total an estimated $226 billion, with Medicare and Medicaid paying 68 percent of the costs."
So Wipe Out Alzheimer's is stepping in.
They'll reach out to help and encourage women whose loved ones have Alzheimer's.
It's time for the narrative around Alzheimer's to change.
We want to do the same with Alzheimer's.
The race for the Oscar may be over, but the race to wipe out Alzheimer's is on.
