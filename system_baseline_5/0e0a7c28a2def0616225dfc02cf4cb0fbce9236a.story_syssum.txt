Last year, a French court sentenced Noriega to seven years in prison for money laundering.
The U.S. government has portrayed Noriega as the ultimate crooked cop -- a man who was paid millions by the Medellin drug cartel in Colombia to protect cocaine and money shipments.
Noriega and his attorneys had argued the United States was violating the Geneva Convention by not sending him back to Panama, where he was seized by U.S. troops after the United States invaded that country in 1989 in Operation Nifty Package.
While in U.S. custody, Noriega suffered from prostate cancer and had a stroke.
