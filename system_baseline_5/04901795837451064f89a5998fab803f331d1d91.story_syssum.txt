Now, perhaps Borussia Dortmund can claim similar after crushing Real Madrid 4-1 in the first leg of its Champions League semifinal Wednesday.
Barring the prospect of miracles at Camp Nou and the Bernabeu next week, Dortmund will contest the first ever all-German Champions League final against Bayern Munich at Wembley on May 25.
"The first 25 minutes were great and then we lost a bit of our game.
The fresh faced innocence, the youthful zest, the unbounded energy, all these traits have helped shape a Dortmund side, which is quickly winning the hearts of football fans across the globe.
Lewandowski led the line, a lone warrior refusing to be tamed by a Real defense appearing more and more desperate as the night progressed.
Real would have expected Dortmund to start at breakneck speed, but even it was taken aback by the pace, power and ferocity of the German side.
Ronaldo's strike, his sixth in six consecutive Champions League games, appeared to have left Dortmund in a daze.
Dortmund were rampant and the hugely impressive Gundogan almost added a fourth when his fierce effort was brilliantly tipped away by Lopez in the Real goal.
"I think Dortmund were the best team by far," Real boss Mourinho told Sky Sports.
"They won every individual battle on the pitch, they were stronger physically and mentally so I think they deserve it.
"We know everything about Robert Lewandowski, every detail possible and we lost him in three goals.
"It will be very difficult in the return leg at home but we must remain confident and try to react," Real captain Sergio Ramos told reporters.
