(CNN) -- The recently renewed violence in the Mideast claimed more lives Sunday as Israeli strikes killed at least 16 people in Gaza and a Hamas attack on a border crossing wounded four Israeli civilians.
Hamas said it fired 23 mortar shells at the site.
At least 117 rockets were fired at Israel on Sunday, the IDF said via its Twitter account.

Israel, the European Union and the United States consider Hamas a terrorist organization.
Also Sunday, the Israeli military said rockets from Syria hit various locations through the Golan Heights.
Israel has waged an offensive in Gaza against the militant Palestinian group Hamas and the stream of rockets fired into Israel from Gaza.
During the offensive, Israel destroyed more than 30 concrete-lined tunnels that led from Gaza into Israel.
The kidnappings were not approved by Hamas leadership or its military wing, he said, stressing that this acknowledgment does not equate to a claim of responsibility.
