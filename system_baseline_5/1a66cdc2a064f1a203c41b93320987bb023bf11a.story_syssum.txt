US security officials and politicians have repeatedly identified Huawei as a threat to US national security -- an allegation the Chinese company has consistently denied.
Although Huawei has done business with 45 of the world's top carriers, it failed to get contracts from any leading operators in the US.
Two years later, Huawei bid for a multibillion-dollar contract to supply network infrastructure to Sprint Nextel, one of the top US operators, but lost after the US government intervened.
But October's congressional report made it even more difficult for the company to do business in the US, Huawei executives say.
William Xu, the unit's chief executive, said its goal of generating $15bn in revenues from the business by 2017 -- a target set just last year -- was "too optimistic".
