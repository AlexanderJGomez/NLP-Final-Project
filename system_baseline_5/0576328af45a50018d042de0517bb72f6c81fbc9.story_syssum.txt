The IRS is trying to reach people who do not normally file tax returns so they can apply for stimulus checks.
The commissioner said the IRS received 72 million calls in May this year, compared with 19 million in May 2007.
One occurred when the Social Security numbers of approximately 1,500 taxpayers were inadvertently disclosed when the IRS routed the stimulus payments to the wrong bank accounts.
To receive a stimulus check, people had to file a 2007 return.
