But for Aerin Lauder, the 44-year-old granddaughter of Est√©e Lauder, who founded the eponymous make-up company, the legacy has been an inspiration rather than a burden.
AL: It is an amazing legacy and I think she is always looking down at me very proud.
We traveled every weekend, I experienced incredible new cultures, museums, cities and it really opened up my eyes.
AL: Because beauty is global.
But I think that is really important because it is my name on that product, and I think it should be the best it can possibly be.
AL: I think you can get inspiration from anything.
I think the Internet is a great way to get inspiration.
