The announcement that Russia's prime minister, Vladimir Putin, will run for president in next March's election and will, if elected, appoint the current president, Dmitri Medvedev, as his prime minister brings to mind one of the most famous lines of Italian literature.
It will provoke a temporary burst of indignation from Putin's many critics in the West, some of whom saw in Medvedev a champion of liberalism and civil rights.
Unless Western leaders seek to punish Putin for his return, there is no reason to think it will undermine the "reset" of recent years.
Despite rumors of disagreements between the two leaders -- or, more often, their aides -- Putin and Medvedev have always worked together as a close-knit team.
Putin's priority has been to keep mainstream Russians loyal.
Although the economy shrank by 8% in 2009, government spending grew from 34 to 41% of GDP.
Although Putin's -- and Medvedev's -- approval ratings have fallen in the last two years, the decline has been relatively slow.
As prime minister, Medvedev will be plunged into the operational details of managing the economy at an unusually tricky moment.
Medvedev's first task will probably be implementing unpopular cuts to rein in public spending.
Yet there is also the chance that he will survive for long enough to see reforms bear fruit -- and claim a share of the credit.
