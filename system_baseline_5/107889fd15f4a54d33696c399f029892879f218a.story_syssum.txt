Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan must report to jail by June 17 to begin serving a 120-day sentence for a necklace theft charge, a judge ordered Wednesday.
Lohan likely qualifies to serve her sentence in home confinement, instead of a jail cell, but the probation officials will decide that, Whitmore said.
Lohan is already two days into completing her 480 hours of community service, including 360 hours at the Los Angeles Downtown Women's Center.
Sautner said she's asked Los Angeles police to keep the paparazzi away from the center while Lohan performs her service.
