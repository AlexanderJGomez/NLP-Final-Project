(CNN)Mullah Mohammed Omar is "still the leader" of the Taliban's self-declared Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.
"Another caliph has announced himself to the world, and the Taliban has been silent.
Omar was famously camera-shy during the Taliban's six-year rule over most of Afghanistan.
Omar then all but disappeared after a U.S.-led bombing campaign routed the Taliban from Kabul in 2001.
According to the biography, Omar was born in 1960 in a village called Chah-i-Himmat in Afghanistan's Kandahar province.
The Taliban biography makes no mention of the fact that the U.S., allied with Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, helped arm and bankroll the mujahedeen until the Soviet army withdrew in defeat in 1989.
The Taliban biography says that Omar and his compatriots "launched their struggle and fight against corruption and anarchy" after an initial meeting in Kandahar in June 1994.
Though Taliban militants have continued to battle the U.S.-backed government across Afghanistan, Omar has not been seen or heard from in years.
