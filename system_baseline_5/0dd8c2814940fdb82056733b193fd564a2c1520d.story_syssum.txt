(CNN) -- In Florida, one could coin a new term for black bears: Pets.
He -- or she -- stayed in the hammock for about 20 minutes, said photographer Rafael Torres, who snapped pictures of the bear from 60 feet away.
But there was a handful of black bears roaming the neighborhood at the time of the attack, they said.
Officers were afraid the bears would get hazardously close to humans, and they killed one bear that was frequenting her feedings.
