On April 26, 1986, the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant's reactor No.
It's now cracked, rusted and leaking radiation.
The reactor sits at the center of a 1,000-square-mile "Exclusion Zone," a quarantined no-man's land complete with border guards, passport control and radiation monitoring.
That story is partly embodied in an unlikely community of some 130 people, called "self-settlers" who, today, live inside the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.
Many villages were bulldozed after the accident, others remain -- silent vestiges to the tragedy, and home to the ubiquitous wild boar.
One self-settler, Hanna Zavorotnya, told me how she snuck through the bushes back to her village in the summer of 1986.
When I asked Hanna about radiation, she replied: "Radiation doesn't scare me.
When the Chernobyl accident happened a few decades into Soviet rule, they were simply unwilling to flee an enemy that was invisible.
"So what."
The World Health Organization predicts more than 4,000 deaths will eventually be linked to Chernobyl.
Of the old people who relocated, one Chernobyl medical technician, whose job is to give annual radiation exposure tests to zone workers  said: "Quite simply, they die of anguish."
How could this be?
Are home and community forces that can rival even radiation?
Radiation or not, these women are at the end of their lives.
