Sure, teenagers dominated the figure skating podiums at the Sochi, Olympics, but here in the United States and around the world, a growing number of skaters lacing up to compete are well into their 30s, 40s, 50s, and beyond.
"Someone dared me to skate when I was 30," Schwartz said.
"I realized there was no program for adult skating," she said.
Schwartz was named chair of the first U.S Adult Figure Skating committee in 1995.
"I fell in love with it again," said Delano.
And Schwartz says one woman from Lake Placid, New York, is well loved by many adult skaters.
"(She's) well into her 80s now, who still skates at adult nationals, and is an inspiration," said Schwartz.
