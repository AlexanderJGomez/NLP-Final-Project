For those who doubt the movement has moved toward the mainstream, the Tea Party Express will join CNN on Monday night to host a nationally televised forum where eight GOP presidential candidates will vie for tea party support.
"We're not a protest movement anymore; we've morphed into something else," said Matt Kibbe, president of FreedomWorks, which has helped support tea party groups around the country.
Tea Party Express Co-Chairman Amy Kremer said as the movement continues to mature, tea partiers are increasingly recognizing their activism can change outcomes in Washington.
Though tea party leaders maintain the movement will not become a political party and comprises activists of all political stripes, Kremer said most tea partiers expected better from their GOP elected officials.
The question now is whether the tea party will push candidates far enough to the right during the primaries that it could hurt their chances at winning a general election.
The early involvement may prove to have heightened importance this election cycle if the Republican Party begins to coalesce around the candidate they feel can best defeat President Barack Obama, said Pat Griffin, a GOP strategist and senior fellow at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at St. Anselm who is not affiliated in the presidential race.
Griffin said that could make members of the party more cautious in choosing a nominee.
"The tea party is an organic movement that was largely created by people who were frustrated by Washington," he said.
You cannot crush that out given the noise coming out of Washington these days."
