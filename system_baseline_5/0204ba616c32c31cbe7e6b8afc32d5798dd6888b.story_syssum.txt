Baghdad, Iraq (CNN)Iraqi forces appeared Wednesday to be making progress on the third day of a major offensive intended to push ISIS fighters out of the city of Tikrit.
Despite the reported Iranian assistance, the Iraqi forces face no easy task as they seek to advance on Tikrit.
Tikrit fell to ISIS in June of 2014, after the group's capture of Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul.
On Monday, Iraqi forces approached Tikrit from several fronts, Iraqiya TV reported, engaging with ISIS north of the city at al-Alam and south of the city at al-Dour.
Prime Minister al-Abadi, who is also commander in chief of the armed forces, said on Twitter that he would "oversee the operation to liberate Tikrit" from ISIS.
