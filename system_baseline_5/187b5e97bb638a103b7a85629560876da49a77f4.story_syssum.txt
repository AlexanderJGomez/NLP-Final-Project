The words were so simple, but to people who were feeling utterly abandoned and who needed help, those words meant so much.
Sometimes, in the midst of all the bad news, in the midst of the mistakes this country inevitably makes, we lose sight of how much the people of the United States are counted on by those in need.
Someone to travel many miles, with the will and the means to heal.

It is not the first time the United States has been chastised, and it will not be the last.
The words refer to the American search-and-rescue teams who work past the point of exhaustion as they seek signs of the living among the rubble, and they refer to the Americans back home who, during difficult economic times in the U.S., have donated their money to help people who, for now, have no way to say thank you.
We will at times focus on the trivial and the coarse.
At such times, we might do well to pause and recall the sound of those four words.
