Lake Turkana, Kenya (CNN) -- Richard Leakey has spent a lifetime exploring Kenya's Turkana Basin searching for the origins of man.
On the shores of Lake Turkana -- the largest desert lake in the world -- they don't need to know the science of climate change.
Sometimes it is hard to see the effects of climate change, but not at Lake Turkana.
"I think the prospect of many of these half million people living around the lake today of having to relocate to cities and to slums and to abandon their culture, abandon their ancestral land, become paupers in their own land, I think it is very real," Leakey says.
Climate change does affect the Turkana people, says Ikal Angelei from the Turkana Basin Institute.
Leakey says that anyone skeptical about climate change should visit the Turkana Basin.
This lake is the Turkana's life," Maraka says.
This place has helped unlock humanity's past.
