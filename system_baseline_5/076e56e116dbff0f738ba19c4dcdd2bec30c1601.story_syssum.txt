Todd Krim, who founded Give Back Hollywood -- which helps connect celebrities and charities -- says he thinks there's a true desire by celebrities to get involved.
I'm a lawyer and ... in 2003 I met a lot of celebrities and reality stars in social circles who were wanting to give back but didn't know how ...

Krim: I would say I think Justin Bieber, I have to say...
Krim: -- I'd like to see more ... of the people behind the scenes get more involved: producers, directors, the talent agencies and the people who support the celebrities ... they have a say in whether a celebrity participates in certain things.
It should just be automatic... and it's something that the whole team from the publicists to the agents ... that should all be their focus.
