Washington (CNN) -- A House panel voted Thursday to subpoena the White House for documents related to the solar energy company Solyndra.
"This finally got the attention of the White House counsel," who then met with lawmakers Wednesday, he said.
Federal analysts looking at the proposed Solyndra loan in 2009 warned then of possible problems, as well as pressure from the White House to speed up a decision, according to a memorandum released last month by congressional investigators.
White House Chief of Staff William Daley announced last week that he is ordering a 60-day independent review of the state of the Energy Department's loan portfolio.
