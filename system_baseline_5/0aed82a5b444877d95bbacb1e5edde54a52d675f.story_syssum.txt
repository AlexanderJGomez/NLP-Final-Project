Hawking, on the other hand, has lived more than 40 years since he learned he had the disease, which is also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease in America and motor neuron disease, or MND, in the United Kingdom.
The British physicist also embodies the idea of empowering people with ALS to live life to the fullest, said Dr. Lucie Bruijn, scientific director for the ALS Association, in an e-mail.
This empowerment theme is part of the mission of the ALS Association, she said.
Hawking's case is also unusual because his condition was diagnosed at a young age, said Sharon Matland, vice president of patient services at the ALS Association.
Barry said she knows of a man in Ireland who has lived with the disease for 30 years -- but only about 5 percent of people with ALS live longer than 10 years.
Hawkins said he first experienced weakness in his legs and arms, typical symptoms of the disease.
People with ALS may also find it difficult to lift their arms or feet, Matland said.
Typically, the ultimate cause of death is respiratory failure, because ALS affects the muscles used for breathing, she said.
In the UK, the MND Association is funding a trial for lithium, which has produced promising results in mice, Barry said.
"I would encourage everyone to recognize how terrible this disease is, and encourage them to support the ALS Association and research projects," he said.
