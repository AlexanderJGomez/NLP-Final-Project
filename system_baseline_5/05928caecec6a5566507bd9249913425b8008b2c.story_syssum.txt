(CNN) -- Though Sir David Frost doesn't see his 1977 interviews with former President Richard Nixon as "an intellectual 'Rocky' " -- in the words of "Frost/Nixon" playwright and screenwriter Peter Morgan -- he does agree that the sessions had their "adversarial" moments.
Nixon famously let down his guard, a moment depicted in in "Frost/Nixon," the new Ron Howard-directed film starring Frank Langella as Nixon and Michael Sheen as Frost.

The original Frost/Nixon interviews are now available on DVD, and Frost has been pleasantly surprised at the public's interest.
Many reviewers have made much of a scene in which a drunken Nixon makes a late-night phone call to Frost, an event that never happened.
But what they got, they got ... absolutely right."
