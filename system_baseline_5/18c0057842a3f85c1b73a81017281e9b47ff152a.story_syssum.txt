Unfunded pension debt, which in Detroit stands at $3.5 billion and is roughly one-sixth of the city's total debt, is a national problem that has already put other city and state governments on the same road to insolvency.
Quite simply, cities and states need to consider switching from the prevailing "defined benefit" pension plans to the "defined contribution" plans common in the private sector.
Worse yet, city pension debt is dwarfed by that of state pension debt.
Pat Quinn at one point suggested a federal bailout of the state's pension debt, a call that has been echoed by many for Detroit.
Both defined benefit plans -- which purport to guarantee a set income for life -- and 401(k)-type plans carry with them some risk for public employees.
In the case of defined benefit plans, Detroit shows that taxpayers may not always be able to pay what the government promises.
But other cities and states can still prevent the crisis from boxing their own public workers into a similar financial bind.
