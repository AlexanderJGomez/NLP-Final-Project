(CNN) -- Khaldoon Khalifa Al Mubarak is CEO of Mubadala Development Company.
CNN's John Defterios met Mubarak in Abu Dhabi and began by asking him about Mubadala's recent purchase of a 7.5 percent stake in the U.S. investment firm, Carlyle Group for $1.35 billion.
So it's a very good fit for us, it's a very good deal for Mubadala and I think it's the right step.
Mubarak: We've met with all the executives at Carlyle, we've looked at their track record.
Defterios: That's an understatement.
Mubarak: It's been a tremendous roller coaster ride over the last couple of years, and the growth in Abu Dhabi, the growth in the region and the growth that Mubadala has gone through is tremendous.
Mubarak: Well Ferrari has been a very exciting and interesting investment for us.
But beyond that, we created a strategic alliance with Ferrari.
Mubarak: Mubadala now is focusing on creating a good corporate institution.
Mubarak: Abu Dhabi has typically been very conservative in its approach.
It's a 23-year plan that looks at the growth of the city and makes sure that the growth of the city is in line with the aspirations of the government, with the aspirations of the people and in line with the type of developments that are being put forward from the real estate private sector and the industrial sector that is now growing at a pace that you don't see in many other places.
