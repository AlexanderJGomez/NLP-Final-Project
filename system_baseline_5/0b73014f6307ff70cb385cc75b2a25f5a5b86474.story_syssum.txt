(CNN) -- Despite periodic violence and continued unresolved issues, Sudan's president on Sunday authorized the reopening of all border crossings with South Sudan, state news reported.
Their leaders have faced international pressure, from the likes of the United Nations and the African Union, to resolve their disputes and come to a lasting agreement.
Sudan and South Sudan have been under increasing pressure from the African Union and Security Council to resolve the matter peacefully.
Last week, four peacekeepers with the African Union-United Nations Mission in Sudan's Darfur region were killed and eight injured in an ambush by unidentified attackers.
