"A once-shuttered warehouse is now a state-of-the art lab where new workers are mastering the 3-D printing that has the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything," Obama said.
"And I ask this Congress to help create a network of 15 of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is made in America," Obama said.
No one is known to have created an entire working firearm with a 3-D printer, although usable parts of one reportedly have been printed.
It's also MakerBot that's been at the forefront of of the move to put 3-D printers in the hands of the general public.
While some consumers may have new visions of 3-D printers in their garages, Obama was speaking mostly of the technology's industrial potential.
Apple has announced it will begin manufacturing some of its iMacs in the United States this year, a fact Obama noted in his speech.
