Ebola has orphaned thousands of children in West Africa, and relatives are terrified of taking them in for fear of infection, the United Nations said.
In Liberia, the children's aid agency said it is training additional mental health workers to ensure children affected by the deadly virus get the support they need.
"The vast majority of the children affected by Ebola are still left without appropriate care.
"Untold numbers of children are dying anonymously at home or in the streets," Save the Children said.
Meanwhile, Sierra Leone's President Ernest Koroma is missing an Ebola donor conference in London because his British-chartered plane had technical problems, the British Foreign Office said Thursday, an hour before he was due to give a news conference with British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond.
