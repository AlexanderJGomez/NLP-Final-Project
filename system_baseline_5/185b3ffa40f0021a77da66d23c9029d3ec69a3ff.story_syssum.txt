Rolling Stone labeled the Everly Brothers "the most important vocal duo in rock," having influenced the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Simon & Garfunkel and many other acts.
They became international sensations over the next five years with tunes such as "Bye Bye Love," "Wake Up Little Susie," "When Will I Be Loved" and "All I Have to Do Is Dream."
Phil and Don were born in the business, the offspring of country and western singers Margaret and Ike Everly.
In 1957, they found a Felice and Boudleaux Bryant song, "Bye Bye Love."
"Bye Bye Love" was "the first thing that really killed me," Paul Simon once recalled.
Their remaining years were highlights by occasional shows, hall of fame inductions and various other honors, including a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997.
