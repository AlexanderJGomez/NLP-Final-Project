Sean Penn plays San Francisco City Supervisor Harvey Milk in "Milk," directed by Gus Van Sant.
Civic elections might seem like small beer, but the persecution that compelled Milk to run for office is no trivial matter.
Ironically, the devoutly "normal" White is the one who is truly messed up.
The strategy is sound; the execution, nearly flawless.
"Milk" may be a little too homogenized for some tastes.
Like "Philadelphia" and "Brokeback Mountain," it's careful how it advances its agenda (and it does have one).
