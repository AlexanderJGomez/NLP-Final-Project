(CNN)Police rescued 37 babies and a 3-year-old girl after busting a child trafficking ring in eastern China's Shandong province, reported the state-run China Central Television.
The babies are then sold after the women give birth," says Chen.
They let the babies eat instant noodles," said Hou Jun, a local police officer.
Child trafficking has become a major concern in China, as traffickers seek to profit off a growing demand for healthy babies from potential adoptive parents both in China and beyond.
A Chinese obstetrician was also convicted for selling babies after telling their parents they were sick in early 2014.
