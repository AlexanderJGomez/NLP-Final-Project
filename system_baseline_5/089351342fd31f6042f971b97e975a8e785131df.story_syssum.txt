I don't know if Hillary Clinton is going to run again.
It is to support the president's agenda and it is to support Democratic candidates up and down the ticket in 2013 and 2014.
A: No.
Q: Let's talk money.
When it comes to money are there concerns that you won't have the cash to do what you need to do and how will you retire that debt?
We are going to have what we need to accomplish our goals this cycle, but we're still working to retire that debt and Democrats can help us out by going to Democrats.Org and giving what they can.
Are there specifics you can share?
There are going to be a lot of competitive races where we can pick up seats, we think.
They are doing the heavy lifting and at the DNC we are going to be helping them out however we can, while really helping to do what we can to help the president's agenda.
I don't know if Hillary Clinton is going to run again.
That's why I'm over here.
Right now that's the goal, is to do what I can to help the party do as well as it can in the midterm elections.
