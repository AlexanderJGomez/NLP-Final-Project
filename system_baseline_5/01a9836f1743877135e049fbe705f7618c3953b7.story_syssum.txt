ROOSEVELT, New York (CNN) -- When Lisa Brown moved into her rental house on Long Island last summer with her three daughters, she says, it felt like a new beginning.
Brown and her family are being evicted not because of anything they did, but because her landlord defaulted on the mortgage and the house fell into foreclosure.
Brown had no idea the house was in foreclosure.
"You know, I'm paying rent, and she's putting it toward her mortgage, I didn't see the problem."
Klein says rental properties are involved in 50 percent of all foreclosures in New York, and he is working on a law to warn renters of foreclosure proceedings ahead of time and to keep them from losing their security deposit and being evicted with nowhere to go.
Brown was astonished to learn that her landlord rented her the house when she knew she was losing it.
She says that money is gone.
The broker who rented her the house and who was paid $1,900 says he did not know the house was in foreclosure.
The bank that foreclosed on the house, and now owns it, offered her $1,000 to get out, but she says she's lost close to $6,000 and has nowhere to go.
For now, though, she says she will adjust her dreams and find another place for her family to live.
