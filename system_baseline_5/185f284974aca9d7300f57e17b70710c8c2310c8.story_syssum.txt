(CNN) -- More than 160 protesters were arrested Sunday during a violent opposition strike in Bangladesh, police said.
Iqbal Khan Chowdhury, additional home secretary for Bangladesh, told CNN that road traffic in the city of Dhaka was relatively less.
The opposition BNP called Sunday's general strike, the first in Bangladesh in over three years, to protest against the governance of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
In the meantime, the BNP's Alamgir said his party would hold a public meeting Monday in Dhaka as a mark of protest.
