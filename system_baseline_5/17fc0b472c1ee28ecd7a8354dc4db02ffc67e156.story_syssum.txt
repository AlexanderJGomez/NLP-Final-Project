(CNN) -- The assistant coach of Togo's national soccer team is among the victims of Friday's machine-gun attack on a bus carrying the squad to a tournament in Angola, the country's official news agency reported Saturday.
The team was headed to Angola for the tournament when it was attacked near the border between Angola and the Republic of Congo.
Emmanuel Adebayor, the Togo team's captain and a star for England's Manchester City team, said he and his teammates met Saturday morning "before deciding that they wished to pull out of the tournament," the Manchester City Football Club Web site said.
"We vehemently condemn the ignoble action, lament the loss of lives, and we reiterate our commitment to guarantee security so that the CAN ORANGE 2010 (tournament) will firm itself as a great sporting event and a manifestation of friendship and solidarity among the African people," an Angolan government statement said.
Arriving Saturday with a high-level delegation to Cabinda, Angola's Prime Minister Antonio Paulo Cassoma insisted his government provided proper security.
The tournament -- one of the world's biggest -- is Angola's first major sporting event since a 2002 peace deal brought the southern African country's decades-old civil war to an end.
Togo striker Thomas Dossevi, who plays for French team Nantes, told CNN "armed rebels" with AK-47s had opened fire.
