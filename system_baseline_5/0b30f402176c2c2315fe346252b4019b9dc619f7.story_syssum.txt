Mark McGwire apparently felt it was the right thing to do.

Yes, Mark McGwire used steroids and human growth hormone.
Twelve years after shattering Maris' record, five years after his embarrassing, I'm-not-here-to-discuss-the-past congressional testimony, the deflated Paul Bunyan of baseball told us that he used PED, and that he was very, very wrong.
Well, very wrong.
"The only reason I took steroids was for my health purposes," McGwire said.
"The names," McGwire said, "I don't remember."
And there lies the reason I have trouble forgiving and forgetting: Mark McGwire doesn't see it.
