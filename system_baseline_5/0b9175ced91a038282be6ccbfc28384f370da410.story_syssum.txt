Moscow (CNN) -- A friend of mine who grew up in a small Soviet town realized he was gay by age 15.
...
And it basically means that you cannot publicly say anything positive about being gay or tell a child that there is nothing wrong with being gay or being raised by gay parents.
President Vladamir Putin himself said in a recent interview that in Russia "people of nontraditional sexual orientation are not discriminated against" and that they are valued and equal citizens of the Russian Federation.
Worse, several legislators have just introduced a bill to deny parental rights to one or both parents of "nontraditional sexual orientation."
When questioned about the discriminatory legislation, Russian officials often chide critics for exaggerating -- this is not the Soviet Union, and gay people live in Russia freely.
