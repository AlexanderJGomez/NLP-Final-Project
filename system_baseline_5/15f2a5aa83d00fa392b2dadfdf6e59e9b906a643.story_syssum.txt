(CNN) -- Scores of people died Thursday in and around the restive Syrian city of Hama, activists said, corroborating reports of widespread casualties a day after the start of a new military clampdown targeting protesters.
The activist group, citing the medical source, said scores more were wounded.
People who tried to leave, he said, were being shot.
One of the sources is a representative of the Syrian Revolution Coordination Union, an opposition group.
At that point, the demonstrators returned to the mosque and closed themselves inside, the sources said.
The move came a day after the U.N. Security Council issued a presidential statement condemning the Syrian government's crackdown on protesters and calling for an immediate end to violence by all parties.
"It's crucial that a U.N. Human Rights Council fact-finding mission to Syria is able to investigate the situation as soon as possible," said Jose Luis Diaz, Amnesty International's representative to the United Nations.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said Syria's citizens should solve their problems themselves, state-run RIA Novosti said.
It said an opposition leader in the city reported that the government had launched a series of measures to punish residents.
That's because it is questionable whether the move, absent constitutional reform, could end decades of single-party Baathist rule.
