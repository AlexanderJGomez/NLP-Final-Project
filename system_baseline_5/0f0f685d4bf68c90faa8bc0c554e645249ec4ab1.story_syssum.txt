That was the mantra in Hong Kong as the clock ticked down to the British colony being handed back to China in 1997.
Why?
Yes, there will be one person, one vote, but Beijing has said they want to control who Hong Kong's voters are allowed to vote for.
Yet Hong Kong has hardly exploded in anger or frustration.
"The number of people joining us (for a long-planned sit-in protest) will not be as big as we expect, because of the very pragmatic thinking of Hong Kong people," he admitted.
Before 1997, the pragmatists were doing what they could to have a Plan B -- a way of getting out of Hong Kong if they needed to -- or working hard to ingratiate themselves with Beijing.
And neither Beijing nor Hong Kong's leadership can ill-afford to ignore them.
