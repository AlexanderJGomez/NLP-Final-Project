Four people were reported killed in Metro Manila, two in Central Luzon, and one in Catanduanes, the Office of Civil Defense said.
But storm alerts were also issued for more than 40 other areas, including Metro Manila, the state weather bureau Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) said.
On Tuesday, weather officials said the storm was packing top winds of 140 kph (87 mph).
Santa Ana said people in the capital remained calm as the rain kept coming down, although one part of eastern Manila had to be evacuated because of flooding.
Dacalanio said the winds had uprooted street lights and brought down trees and road signs, but that luckily there was no flooding near his home.
