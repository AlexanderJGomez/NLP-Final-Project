Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan was released from home confinement at 10:20 a.m. Wednesday, 35 days after she began serving her sentence for misdemeanor theft and probation violation, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County sheriff said Wednesday.
"I am not happy about house arrest," Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Saunter said during a hearing last week.
Lohan failed an alcohol test administered by a probation officer on June 13 and was ordered to go before the judge for a probation violation hearing last week.
Lohan entered drug rehab last year to avoid a jail sentence imposed by another judge.
"It would appear that the defendant's criminal conduct is increasing in seriousness and severity," the probation report said, yet it suggested she serve her sentence on probation and not in jail.
