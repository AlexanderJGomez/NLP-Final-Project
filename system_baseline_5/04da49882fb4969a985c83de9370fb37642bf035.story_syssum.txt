Plan B, also called the morning-after pill, is intended to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex.
On March 23, a federal court ordered that Plan B, an emergency contraception pill, be made available over the counter to those 17 and older, the agency said in a statement on its Web site.
In August 2006, the FDA approved the sale of Plan B without a prescription to those 18 and older, but those 17 and under needed a prescription to obtain it.
"Indeed, the record shows that FDA officials and staff both agreed that 17-year-olds can use Plan B safely without a prescription.
This decision is common-sense policy that will help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and protect the health and safety of all women."

"Parents should be furious that the FDA is putting their minor daughters at risk," the group said.
