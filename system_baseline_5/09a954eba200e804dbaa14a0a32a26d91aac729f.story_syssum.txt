One day after the Gulf Cooperation Council released a statement urging Yemen President Ali Abdullah Saleh to transfer powers to his vice president, thousands of protestors returned to the streets Monday for marches and opposition leaders are vowing not to back down.
"The opposition wants everything and President Saleh is still the most powerful person in the country," GCC's Ganadi said.
"No initiative will save Saleh from the crimes he committed against the peaceful youth," Anesi said.
Last week, Saleh said he welcomes the council's efforts to help resolve the political crisis in his country.
An eyewitness claims hundreds of protesters attended an anti-government march in streets of Sanaa, and other cities across Yemen.
"We will not differ with the revolution youth and we will support them," Yahya Abu Osbaa, a senior JMP official said.
"In the end, I can assure you that we will agree on terms," Osbaa said.
