"Due to several consecutive years (the late '80s through the mid-'90s) of negligent and gross financial mismanagement, Dionne Warwick has realized the current necessity to file personal bankruptcy," Warwick publicist Kevin Sasaki said in a statement to CNN Tuesday.
"In light of the magnitude of her tax liabilities, Warwick has repeatedly attempted to offer repayment plans and proposals to the IRS and the California Franchise Tax Board for taxes owed," Sasaki said.
Warwick recently took a credit card debt management class, it said, perhaps relating to a $20,000 Visa debt.
"Warwick has spent many years of her career raising funds for several humanitarian and philanthropic causes without compensation," Sasaki said.
