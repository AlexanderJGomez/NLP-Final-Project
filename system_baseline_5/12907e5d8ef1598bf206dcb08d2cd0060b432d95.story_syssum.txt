But in fact, the insanity defense is raised in less than 1% of felony cases, and it's only successful in a fraction of those.
In 1843, the English House of Lords articulated the first modern insanity test in the infamous M'Naghten case.
The M'Naghten rule was thereafter widely adopted almost word for word in the United States.
The Durham rule was also criticized as vague and overly broad; many states rejected the test, and in 1962, the American Law Institute, or ALI, announced yet another insanity defense, which enjoyed immediate popularity with many legislatures and judiciaries.
As it stands today, some 46 states have an insanity defense, and 45 of those have insanity tests based on either M'Naghten or the Model Penal Code tests.
Some states don't even have the insanity defense.
It may seem strange that a medical-sounding determination like insanity has different definitions from state to state.
Arthritis, psoriasis and a sprained ankle are the same in Mississippi as they are in Oregon.
And ultimately, that's what this debate will always boil down to -- whether a state is free to legislate with unfettered discretion in accepting or not accepting an insanity defense, or, if insanity is a constitutionally guaranteed option, outside a state legislature's jurisdiction.
With a success rate so low, many would say the insanity defense is effectively abolished already.
