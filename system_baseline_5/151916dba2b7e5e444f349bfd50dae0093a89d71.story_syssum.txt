(CNN) -- Gore Vidal, the eclectic author who faithfully chronicled the major shifts and upheavals in the United States in books, essays and plays, has died.
Vidal also appeared in a number of films, including the political satire, "Bob Roberts," where he played a U.S. senator.
Throughout his life, Vidal didn't shy away from controversy -- either actively courting it or inviting it through his acerbic one-liners.
The more they communicated, the more impressed he was by McVeigh, Vidal said.
Vidal "was always a gadfly," Bram said.
Author Truman Capote once said he felt sad about Vidal, "very sad that he has to breathe every day."
... And because I'm a writer, people think that I'm this poor little fragile thing.
He was born Eugene Luther Gore Vidal on October 3, 1925.
From the congressional record, from American history, poetry," Vidal said.
The book "got reviews everywhere," Bram said.

Following his lucrative TV stint, Vidal returned to writing and produced three widely acclaimed novels that cemented his reputation as an internationally best-selling author: "Julian" (1964), about the Roman emperor who wanted to restore paganism; "Washington, D.C." (1967), the first of his fictional chronicles of American history; and "Myra Breckinridge" (1968), a satirical treatise on transsexualism.
"I would say that since 1945, the United States, which was absolutely the 'mandate of heaven,' as Confucius would say, had fallen upon us," he told CNN in 2007.
"We share a plot, and I'll be there," Vidal said.
