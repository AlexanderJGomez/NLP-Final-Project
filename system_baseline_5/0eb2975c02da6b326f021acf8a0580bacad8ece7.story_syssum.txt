The United States and the European Union "stand with the people of Ukraine" in their fight for the right to choose alliances with countries other than Russia, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Saturday.
"Russia and other countries should not view the European integration of their neighbors as a zero-sum game," Kerry said.
"Today Ukraine is on all our minds," he said. "
As people across the country are taking to the streets, Ukraine's political destiny is still in the balance."
The future of Ukraine belongs with the European Union."
Lavrov also said the United States and the European Union appeared to be trying to push their own ideas on Ukraine.
"Freedom of choice is being imposed, and Russia is not going to engage in this," he said.
"We are deeply concerned by increasing reports of protesters disappearing and being beaten and tortured, as well as by attacks on journalists," Carney said.
Ukraine's Interior Ministry has said it is investigating what happened to Bulatov.
