Alain Tremblay of the New Brunswick Royal Canadian Mounted Police said Wednesday.
Tremblay said the python was kept upstairs in a custom-built glass enclosure similar to an aquarium.
The snake was found in the same room as the boys, Tremblay said.
The necropsy showed the snake was in good overall health, Tremblay said.
The Humane Society documents 17 people who have died in incidents in the United States related to the snakes since 1978, 12 of them since 1990.
