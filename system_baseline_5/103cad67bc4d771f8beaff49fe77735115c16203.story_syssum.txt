(CNN) -- As we gear up for the 71st annual Golden Globe Awards on Sunday, allow us to turn the focus to the real winners of the show: besties Tina Fey and Amy Poehler.
In addition to being one of the stars of the late-night comedy show, the show's creator and producer Lorne Michaels hired Fey as a writer in 1995, and she would later become the show's first female head writer.
Fey is married to composer Jeff Richmond, who wrote music for her hit NBC show.
Neither has won in those years, though Fey won in 2008 before Poehler was nominated.
But while Fey has two daughters, Poehler has two sons.
