The Northeast will begin cooling slightly Friday, the service said, but the heat is expected to continue with forecasts in the low 90s and high 80s across the mid-Atlantic states.
More than 700 sprinklers were available in parks across New York City, said Parks Department spokeswoman Vickie Karp.
Farther north, Boston, New York and Philadelphia reached, respectively, 95, 93 and 97 degrees, the service said.
In the past decade, heat has been the second-leading cause for weather-related fatalities, the service said.
