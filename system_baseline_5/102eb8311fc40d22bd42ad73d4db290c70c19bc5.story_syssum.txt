A new study published in the January 2008 issue of Archives of General Psychiatry found the prevalence of autism cases in California children continued to rise after most vaccine manufacturers started to remove the mercury-based preservative thimerosal in 1999, suggesting that the chemical was not a primary cause of the disorder.
Do these findings suggest that autism isn't linked to mercury in vaccines?
They reasoned that if mercury exposure in vaccines was a major cause of autism, the number of affected kids should have dropped after thimerosal was removed.
But advocacy groups say it's too soon to determine whether autism rates were affected by removing thimerosal from vaccines.
As many as one in every 166 children in this country is found to have autism, and doctors still don't know why.
Doctors are now looking for signs of autism in children as young as 18 to 24 months.
Several things pushed companies in this direction.
In 1997, Congress passed a bill that mandated review of products containing mercury, which led manufacturers to begin removing thimerosal from vaccines two years later.
