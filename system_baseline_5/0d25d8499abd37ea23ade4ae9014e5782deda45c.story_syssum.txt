WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush lifted an executive order banning offshore oil drilling on Monday and urged Congress to follow suit.
"In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil, and that means we need to increase supply here at home," Bush said, adding that there is no more pressing issue for many Americans than gas prices.
Bush, signed the executive order in 1990 banning offshore drilling.
Experts say offshore oil drilling would not have an immediate impact on oil prices because oil exploration takes years.
With oil now selling for $145 a barrel, companies are almost assured of profiting from offshore drilling, Scott said.
