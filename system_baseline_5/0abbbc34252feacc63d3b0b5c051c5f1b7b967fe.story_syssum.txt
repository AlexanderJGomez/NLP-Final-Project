A couple from Georgia was traveling to a Craigslist transaction last month when they left their suburban Atlanta home in hopes of buying a 1966 Ford Mustang.
The seller drew a gun on them in an attempted robbery, but one of the buyers was carrying a handgun and fatally shot the seller, police said.
Remember this is a business transaction, so never reveal Social Security numbers, home or business addresses or banking information.
Have a cell phone in your hand during the entire transaction and be ready to call 911 at the first sign of trouble.
Disable caller ID when calling the buyer or seller on the phone.
Use a cashier's check instead and make it a non-negotiable term of the transaction.
Never conduct your transactions at night.
Find a neutral site to meet -- never at your or someone else's home.
