No one should believe, however, that simply replacing the secretary with a new person will solve the Veterans Administration's problems.
The real challenges in developing a 21st century Veterans Administration are challenges of systemic reform that go far beyond any single person or even a new senior leadership team.
Trying to fix the VA by replacing the secretary but not the whole system is like trying to obtain white beads by replacing the person dipping blindly into the bin.
There is no bank teller involved.
More than 314,000 work full time for the VA compared to 202,000 in the Marine Corps (potentially shrinking to 150,000--at which point there would be half as many Marines as VA bureaucrats).
Just the size of the VA training system is enormous.
At VA facilities, veterans wait twice that time on average and that understates the problem in especially mismanaged sites.
This means that one out of four veterans in those sites was experiencing a wait more than 12 times longer than the national average.
Every effort to integrate Department of Defense and VA medical record systems has failed.
In other words, even though military health costs are growing rapidly and taking up more and more of the DoD budget, the Department is failing to modernize its system and to integrate it with the VA.
Anyone upset at today's Veterans Administration should consider the founding of the Veterans Bureau in 1921 and take comfort that the admittedly appalling corruption or mismanagement we see today pales in comparison to that which marked the first two years of the original Veterans Bureau.
As the scandal broke, President Harding summoned Forbes to the White House and "took him by the neck and shook Forbes 'as a dog would a rat,'" as Amity Shlaes writes in her book "Coolidge," ending the tenure of the first director of the modern Veterans Administration.
