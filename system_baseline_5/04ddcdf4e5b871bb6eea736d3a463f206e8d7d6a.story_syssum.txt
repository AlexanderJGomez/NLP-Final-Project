Chrisette Michele's album "Epiphany" debuted at No.
"I always eat grapes before I go on."
Michele: I have epiphanies all the time, because I'm always thinking.
And the reason why it was an epiphany was when I first started, I was so afraid that maybe they won't like me.
Michele: "Epiphany" is about a girl who's sitting on her couch and saying "You know what?
I'm sick and tired of waiting for him to come home."
Michele: One way is that I didn't write some of the songs.
Michele: Ella Fitzgerald.
I get excited when we talk about jazz.
Michele: I'm an advocate of music in schools.
Michele: When I was in school I used to prank my teachers all the time.
I also love Adele's new album.
Those are two that are on my radar.
