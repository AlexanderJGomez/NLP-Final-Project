Up to 1 meter (3.2 feet) of water was expected in some areas, said Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, as the Chao Phraya River spilled into the city of 12 million people.
"There is water from underground coming up," said Pracha Promnok, chief of the Flood Relief Operations Center.
"We are confident that we will not be affected," Toopetch said.
In the resort town of Pattaya, fleeing Bangkok residents found it hard to get a room in hotels overflowing with European tourists, the Bangkok Post reported.
Thanyarat Hemkittiwat said she was planning to leave Bangkok to stay with relatives outside the city.
The floods, caused by monsoon rains that saturated rivers, have killed 373 people nationwide and affected more than 9.5 million people, authorities said.
