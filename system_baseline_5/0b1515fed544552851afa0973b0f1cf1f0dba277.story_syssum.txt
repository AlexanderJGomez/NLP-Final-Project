(CNN) -- English Premier League club Liverpool have appointed Brendan Rodgers as their new manager.
"I promise I'll fight for my life and for the people in this city," said Rodgers.
Liverpool have been on the hunt for a new manager after sacking Dalglish following a disappointing season, in which they achieved their lowest ever Premier League finish.
He took over at Swansea in 2010 and led the club into the Premier League at the first time of asking after a win in the playoff final against former club Reading.
The 21-year-old made 37 Premier League appearances for Liverpool last season, after joining the club from Sunderland in June 2011.
