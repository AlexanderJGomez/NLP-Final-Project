Viki, a site where dramas, telenovelas, comedies and movies from the globe are translated by fans, gives a glimpse into the cross section of the world's entertainment interests.
"Really good story lines are universal," said Viki's CEO, Razmig Hovaghimian.
The most popular shows on Viki -- many of which are Korean because of more flexible licensing agreements -- have been translated into nearly 70 languages including Cherokee and Greenlandic.
Vela estimates she has subtitled nearly 52 hours of content on Viki, usually between English and Spanish.
"The treasured thing we learned from Viki is that we saw a world where it is run not by money, but run by passion," said Viki's co-founder Jiwon Moon.
The business students wanted to build a way to subtitle content and get shows, film and content to travel beyond the native country.
"The diversity of content exposed to U.S. audience is very limited," said Ho, who is Korean.
"That was the right show to start at the right time," Hovaghimian said.
Viki had to convince broadcasters that fan-powered subtitles could be trusted and also that there were new foreign markets hungry for their content.
"We realized there is a 72-hour window that if you don't have translations on the content, typically pirate sites create translations," he said.
"If we only licensed popular shows, that would've been a miss," Hovaghimian said.
When a certain number of fans request the shows, Viki looks into acquiring rights.
"There's something that's resonating," he said.
