Having been deemed America's Glastonbury by the music industry -- the highest accolade in the festival world -- Bonnaroo will attract more than 80,000 people to Manchester, Tennessee, beginning Thursday.

"Festivals have been one of the few bright spots in the music industry in the past few years," said Doree Shafrir, RollingStone.com's senior editor.
Location, Robertson said, is another seller for the festival.

"Music is just the entry point for this platform for all arts -- for people to be creative," he added.
