(CNN) -- Renewable energy is generating a lot of political heat.
Around the world renewable energy is going through a rebirth.
The modern renewable industry -- wind, solar, and other forms of energy -- was born with a great deal of excitement in the 1970s and early 1980s.
The European Union's energy policy is now predicated on using renewables to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 80% by 2050.
Over the last decade, growing support by governments for renewable energy has been critical to its development.
Germany and Denmark took the lead in repowering renewables with a new system of electricity rates that blended the higher cost of renewable power into the overall price.
Jerry Brown signed a new law requiring that a third of California's electricity be renewable by 2020.
Success there would be a major breakthrough for renewable energy
In the case of renewables, much of the focus is on cost reduction.
The costs of solar energy continue to come down, and many of the new approaches under development and in the lab are aimed at further cost reductions.
That adds to the cost pressures on renewable energy.
As costs go down, more solar will come into use around the world.
In other words, wind and solar have much ground to cover, and it will take time.
Renewable will be part of a growing global business that will be measured in hundreds of billions of dollars.
