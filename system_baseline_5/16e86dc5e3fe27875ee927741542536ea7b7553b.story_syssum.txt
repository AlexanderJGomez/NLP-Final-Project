Police have more than one confession in the case and the individuals will be charged with murder, said Robert Parker, director of the Miami-Dade Police Department.
The police investigation revealed the suspects thought the house was empty, Parker said.
The men knew Taylor lived at the house, Parker said.
A police report said someone forced a window open and left a kitchen knife on a bed.
He did not play in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay.
