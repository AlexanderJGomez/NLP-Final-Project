Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's former security chief testified that he worried at times that the singer might overdose on drugs, but he didn't think he was an addict.
Jackson called him between 20 and 30 times from his hotel room "in the middle of the night," LePerruque testified.
Under cross examination by Jackson lawyer Deborah Chang, LePerruque said Jackson's intoxication appeared to be consistent with someone drinking alcohol and taking sedatives to sleep.
He also never witnessed Jackson take medications, he said.
LePerruque said he never confronted Jackson about his drug use because he "didn't want to put him on the defensive."
The incidents of slurred speech and incoherent late night phone calls did not happen over the entire time LePerruque worked with Jackson, he said.
he said Jackson asked him.
LaPerruque said Jackson was "very devastated" by what he thought was the betrayal of trust he had with Bashir.
LaPerruque said he never believed the criminal charges against Jackson were true.
He lost 27 of them, he said.
