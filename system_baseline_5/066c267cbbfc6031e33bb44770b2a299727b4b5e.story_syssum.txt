London (CNN) -- A funeral took place in London Friday for Mark Duggan, the father of four whose death after his cab was stopped by armed police led to protests that expanded into four days of rioting.
Speaking outside the church where Duggan's funeral was held, Jarrett told CNN little had changed in the decades since then.
"I actually condemn the looting and the burning of buildings," he said, "but I understand the situation behind and the frustration and anger behind it.
London's Metropolitan Police said in a statement beforehand that a senior officer had "met with the parents and family of Mark Duggan and discussed the policing arrangements" for the funeral.
Prime Minister David Cameron said last month that Duggan had been shot by police but the IPCC has yet to reach a formal conclusion.
