KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The soldiers had barely arrived in Iraq before they got new orders -- get ready for Afghanistan.
Watch soldiers leave Iraq, arrive in Afghanistan Â»
The battlefield in Afghanistan is very different than Iraq.
As the United States shifts its focus from Iraq to Afghanistan, the military has deemed route clearance so important to the operations in the Kandahar area that it is airlifting the entire battalion to the new battlefield.
Lt. William Hutaff, one of the first soldiers to leave for Afghanistan as part of an advance party, had his flight delayed several times and waited almost two days before he could board one of the cargo planes.
Leaving the aircraft, the soldiers said they were tired and looking to get into their new housing units.
But the compound assigned to the battalion proved to be a lot worse for wear than the troops expected.
"There is still a lot of work to be done here," said Fitzgibbon.
