If that isn't a wave out there on the horizon, it is, at the moment anyway, a big, Republican-leaning ripple.
"It's much better to be a Republican candidate than a Democratic candidate, at least at the moment," says veteran GOP pollster Whit Ayres.
"I am now expecting a substantial Republican Senate wave in November, with a net gain of at least seven seats," the veteran prognosticator Stuart Rothenberg wrote Monday.
"I don't see any evidence of a wave like we had in '06 or '08," says Ayres.
Even so, his job approval rating is stagnant at 43%, and the percentage of Americans who think things are going badly in the country stands at 55%, up from 50% in April.
But for now, the numbers are compelling: A weak President and a worried electorate are the trademark ingredients of a wave.
