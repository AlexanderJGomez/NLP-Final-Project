In exchange for use of the base, the United States provides about $180 million in aid to Kyrgyzstan each year, Cooley said.
Although the United States does not pay rent for use of any bases in the world, Cooley said, about $60 million of the Kyrgyzstan aid is considered payment for access to the Manas facility.

"Kyrgyz are great," Cooley said.
Nearly two-thirds of the nation's citizens belong to the Kyrgyz ethnic group, while nearly 14 percent are Uzbek and more than 12 percent are Russian, the CIA World Factbook says.

"China has moved in, but it's been a very recent development," said Cooley.
