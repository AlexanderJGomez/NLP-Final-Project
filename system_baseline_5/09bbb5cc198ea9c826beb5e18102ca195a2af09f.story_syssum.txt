For Moscow, the drama that has been unfolding in Ukraine for the past three months is a domestic and an international issue.
Ukraine is the key to that project.
And Crimea is the key to Ukraine.
The initial Russia move to occupy Crimea was designed to protect Russian naval equities on the Peninsula.
If the current conflict does not spread to other parts of eastern Ukraine -- where there is a sizable population that is demanding closer ties to Russia -- then Crimea could join the ranks of other "frozen conflicts" in the post-Soviet space.
Occupying Crimea and raising tensions in eastern Ukraine to prevent Ukraine from moving toward more Western influence is a top priority for the Kremlin.
Given Russia's determination not to back down from Crimea, the United States and its allies will have to focus on containing the advance of Russian troops beyond Crimea and trying to ensure that an unanticipated local conflict between groups under the control neither of Moscow nor Kiev could not precipitate a broader armed struggle in Ukraine.
