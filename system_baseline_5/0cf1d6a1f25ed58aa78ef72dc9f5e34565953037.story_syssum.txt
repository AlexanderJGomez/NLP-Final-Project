(CNN) -- What do NSA leaker Edward Snowden and a red panda at the National Zoo in Washington have in common?
And both have connections to China: Red pandas are native to southwestern China while Snowden recently traveled to Hong Kong, off southeastern China.
First reported missing at 8 a.m. Monday, Rusty was finally captured around 2:30 p.m. about a mile away from his enclosure, zoo officials posted to Facebook.
Although WikiLeaks claims to know his exact location, no one else seems sure.
"Now Putin has a Super Bowl ring, Ed Snowden AND a red panda," tweeted @MicahGrimes.
"Is there bamboo in Ecuador?"
This isn't the first escaped zoo animal to inspire an attention-getting parody account.
The @NationalZoo account thanked its fans on Twitter and Facebook for helping recover Rusty.
