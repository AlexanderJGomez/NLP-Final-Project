Léogâne, Haiti (CNN)  -- Joanie Yestin walks through a small alleyway to what used to be home, now a pile of concrete and crushed belongings.
A block had fallen on him.
Yestin, like many of Haiti's almost 10,000 Boys and Girls Scouts, decided to contribute her share to the earthquake relief effort.
The Scouts have one other advantage: They are young.
Yestin and her friends broke out in a song about being together; it was the only way to get through life's tribulations.
By night, they sleep under the stars.
"I will do my very best to help others because that is what I have been trained to do," she said about her five years in the Scouts.
Or worry that her education was in peril.
"I love the way we work together," she said of the Scouts.
