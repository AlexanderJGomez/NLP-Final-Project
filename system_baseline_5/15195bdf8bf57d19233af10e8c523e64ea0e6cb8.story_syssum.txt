"The team had been number one in the world, or close to it, for a lot of years during the disappointment of not winning it," McCaw told CNN's Human to Hero series.
I certainly appreciated it.
"It is something very unique to New Zealand," McCaw said.
To not have that 'but' anymore was pretty satisfying," McCaw said.
He suffered heartbreak in 2003, losing in the World Cup semifinals to arch-rivals Australia, and in 2007 the All Blacks crashed out ignominiously against France in the quarterfinals, leading McCaw to reconsider his future as captain.
Unlike Dan, I've still got a chance of playing and somehow, any old how, that's what I've got to do."
The injury crisis was mounting, and McCaw had his own worries.
While Kirwan was one of New Zealand's star backs, McCaw would go on to follow in the rugged boot prints of legendary forwards such Wayne Shelford, Michael Jones and Josh Kronfeld.
Having finally landed New Zealand's holy grail, McCaw is hoping to play at the next World Cup in England in 2015, when he'll be 35.
"I'm pretty keen to get away and have a look at places I've haven't been before and where rugby is not something people know too much about.
When I go home to the old man we sit and talk way more about flying than rugby," McCaw says in "The Open Side."
When he returns from his sabbatical in mid-2013, McCaw knows that the rugby world will be trying to knock him and the All Blacks off their pedestal.
I know what it's like, I've tried to knock off the world champs the following year.
