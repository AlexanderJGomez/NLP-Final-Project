But as neural devices become more complicated, and go wireless, some scientists say the risks of "brain hacking" should be taken seriously.
"Neural devices are innovating at an extremely rapid rate and hold tremendous promise for the future," said computer security expert Tadayoshi Kohno of the University of Washington.
Some might question why anyone would want to hack into someone else's brain, but the researchers say there's a precedent for using computers to cause neurological harm.
"It's evidence that people will be malicious and try to compromise peoples' health using computers, especially if neural devices become more widespread."
Despite the risks, Kohno said, most new devices aren't created with security in mind.
But the paper gives a very compelling argument that this is important, and that this is the time to have neural engineers collaborate with security developers."
History provides plenty of examples of why it's important to think about security before it becomes a problem, Kohno said.
"The first thing is to ask ourselves is, 'Could there be a security and privacy problem?'"
