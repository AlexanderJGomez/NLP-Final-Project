The mysterious image captured by Chris Aitchison at Tantallon Castle in eastern Scotland.
Aitchison insists he did not tamper with the image and cannot explain it.
Wiseman solicited such photos from around the world and collated them for the conference.
The photographer insists no one was around when he took the picture; skeptics say the mirror could be reflecting the headrest or be the result of digital manipulation.
But the "ghost" in the Scottish castle has generated the most attention.
It is also possible that a member of the public was standing there when the picture was taken, Wiseman said -- in which case, he hopes they will come forward.
"I think it's probably a person who's been caught in slightly odd dress," Wiseman told CNN.
Palace officials insisted at the time that no one was in the room, and they were at a loss to explain the figure.
