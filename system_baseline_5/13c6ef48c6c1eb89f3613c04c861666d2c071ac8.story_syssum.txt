Japan's birth rate of 1.34 is below the level needed to maintain the country's population.
Keidanren, Japan's largest business group, with 1,300 major international corporations as members, has issued a plea to its members to let workers go home early to spend time with their families and help Japan with its pressing social problem.
The 5:30 p.m. lights-out program is one simple step toward helping address the population problem.
"It's great that we can go home early and not feel ashamed," said employee Miwa Iwasaki.
