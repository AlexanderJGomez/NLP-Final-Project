T.J. Lane, a remorseless killer who escaped from an Ohio prison where he was serving three life sentences for a school shooting, has been captured.
Lane was serving consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole for his attack at Chardon High School on February 27, 2012.
"You never plan on someone escaping and certainly someone of that notoriety, you would think that they would take special precautions to prevent this," Ian Friedman, who represented him at his trial, said late Thursday.
A Correctional Institution Inspection Committee report in April said the facility was over capacity by 217 inmates.
Chardon is about 190 miles away from Lima.
Chardon schools will be closed Friday, but counselors and other support services will be provided, the school district superintendent said.
Lane pleaded guilty last year to three counts of aggravated murder, two counts of attempted aggravated murder and weapons-related charges.
"For everyone in that courtroom -- the victims, their families, the prosecutors, defense -- everyone in that courtroom was just absolutely taken aback," said Friedman, who hasn't talked to Lane in about a year.
