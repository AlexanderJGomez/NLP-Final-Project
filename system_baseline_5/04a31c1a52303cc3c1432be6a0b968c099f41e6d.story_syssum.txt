New York (CNN) -- Buddy "Cake Boss" Valastro's gastronomical gifts were of little help when his 32-foot Boston Whaler got lost in heavy fog in New York Harbor.
Valastro said they were lost about 20 minutes before he called for help.
"I can't see the city," said Valastro, who had owned a boat for about six years.
"I saw him but I don't think he saw us," he recalled.
The boat moved slowly in the dense fog, he said.
Valastro said a fire department vessel responded about 10 minutes after his distress call, followed later by a police boat.
"I want to bake them a cake," he said.
