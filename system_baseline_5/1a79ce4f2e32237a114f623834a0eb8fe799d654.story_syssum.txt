(CNN) -- A body was recovered in the vicinity of a boat accident in the Delaware River, a Coast Guard spokeswoman said Friday.
We've never had a problem with this boat," said Chris Herschend.
Officials said people reacted quickly after the collision.
While the boat was in the river and waiting for help, it was hit by a barge, he said.
Herschend said the company is investigating and assisting fire and police officials.
Asked by reporters Thursday whether the barge was at fault, Herschend said, "I don't want to speculate.
Herschend said the company is checking on whether the captain told people to jump off the boat moments before impact.
The boat is upright on the bottom of the river, Blackburn said.
One passenger suffered a broken jaw, Gaitlin said.
