(CNN) -- Formula One's 12 teams have struck an agreement to secure the future of the sport until 2020, Bernie Ecclestone has exclusively told CNN.
"You'll have to wait to see if Mercedes have but I'm confident everything with Mercedes will be fine," Ecclestone added.
"I appreciate and support Mercedes probably more than anyone in F1," said Ecclestone.
Ecclestone also suggested that reports of Formula One listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange might be premature.
