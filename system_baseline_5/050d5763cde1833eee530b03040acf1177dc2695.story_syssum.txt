A global industrywide Airline IT Trends Survey shows that more than 90% of the airlines surveyed are increasing their investment in mobile capabilities to ease the hassles of getting through the airport and improve the in-flight experience.
While some airline apps allow travelers to make flight reservations (a feature that Delta has not introduced but promises is coming), the world's largest carrier is one of the few airlines that gives customers the ability to adjust travel itineraries from their mobile device.
The airline eventually could offer other services on its mobile app that are already listed on its website, such as the ability to search for hotel and car rental reservations, Skrbec said.
But integrating outside products and services into airline apps is not the only way that airlines hope to customize the passenger experience while increasing revenue.
American, United and Continental airlines currently offer airport maps in their mobile apps, with Delta soon to join them.
Amadeus's report estimates it will take three to five years for most airlines to find a way to integrate augmented reality into an airline app.
Currently, airline apps only offer tickets with their specific carrier, and mobile customers can't take advantage of the flexibility offered by airline alliances.
But those airlines that fail to take the full leap into the mobile world will quickly find themselves in the minority.
