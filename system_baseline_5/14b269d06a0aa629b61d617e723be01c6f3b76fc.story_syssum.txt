After much to-ing and fro-ing by the Iranian authorities, Ghobadi says he couldn't believe it when he found out Saberi had finally been freed, before the end of her sentence.
He said it felt as if the the authorities were playing games with himself and other supporters of Saberi as they gave different timescales for her release -- "two weeks, four years, eight years."
Although Saberi was unable to be with Ghobadi on the red carpet, Ghobadi says she have kept in close telephone contact since her release, checking on how the film has been received.

Now, Ghobadi says, he is planning to go to New York this week to be with Saberi, who is currently staying in Vienna with her family.
Ghobadi says he wants to start a family and get married to Saberi as soon as they can.
