These two recent, racially charged incidents have some wondering if the school affectionately called Ole Miss is still stuck in the old days.
And an attorney for one of the three students sought for questioning in the statue incident said Friday there is video evidence that absolves his client.
Danny Blanton, director of public relations for Ole Miss, said he is not aware of any video of the incident.
"We believe the three folks we've identified and provided information to prosecutors about were involved" in the desecration of the statue, he said.
"It's unclear at this time if the incident is related to the incident last Sunday on campus," Oxford Deputy Police Chief James Owens said.
James Meredith became the first black student admitted to Ole Miss in 1962.
Ironically, James Meredith has said he is no fan of the statue, that he disapproves of it on biblical grounds and believes it should be removed from campus.
Not only would it expel the three students, the fraternity said, it was going to indefinitely suspend the whole Ole Miss chapter.
"I think it's absolutely terrible what they did," freshman John Choat said.
"Really a shame!!"
"Because it is not just white people towards blacks, it is blacks towards whites, whites towards Mexicans ..."
