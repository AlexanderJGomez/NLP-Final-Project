That was pretty much the last thing I remember," Beatty recalled eight years later.
When Beatty came to, his legs were pinned under the wreckage.
Beatty spent a year recovering at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, and he hoped to build a house for his wife and two young sons when he returned home to Statesville, North Carolina.
The land was donated by Beatty's father, and volunteers pitched in to help while Beatty supervised.
When the house was finished, Beatty and Gallina decided to "pay it forward" to help other disabled veterans.
"There's thousands of veterans right here in our midst," Beatty said.
"The Gulf War vets have a lot of issues, and we know there are people who got hurt in Bosnia, Kosovo ... Vietnam," Beatty said.
Beatty and Gallina also want to help those who can't afford to buy their own home, many from the younger generation.
Beatty and Gallina believe that working with community members makes a big difference to veterans, who can often feel isolated and socially withdrawn.
"Every time I turn around, it's a new person saying hello," Taylor said.
"
Beatty and Gallina say their new mission is more than just providing veterans with accessible homes; it's about encouraging communities to get involved with those who served their country.
I've seen the uniforms hanging in the closets," Beatty said.
But when Purple Heart Homes built a wheelchair ramp in front of his home, it changed his life.
For Beatty and Gallina, their work is about giving all veterans the same level of respect.
"Regardless of when you served, where you served ... we're all the same," Beatty said.
