Evidence indicates Betty Parente and the two daughters died from blunt-force trauma and asphyxiation, said Baltimore County Police Chief Jim Johnson.
"Baltimore County Police has learned of allegations that William Parente may be involved in questionable financial dealings," Johnson said.
The bodies were found Monday after a housekeeper told hotel management about 3 p.m. that the door to the room was locked and there had been no response from inside, county police spokesman Bill Toohey said Monday.
The bodies of Betty Parente and the two daughters were found on a king-size bed in the hotel room, while William Parente's body was found in the bathroom, police said.
There was no evidence they were restrained, Johnson said.
Hill said police believe the family was together Sunday morning for breakfast, and they know what time the card key was last used to unlock the room.
"There's a safety net in place," he said.
