Facebook and Google have added new translation tools, but they take different approaches.
Facebook Inc. and Google Inc. are two Web companies trying particularly hard to make this happen, and they've released a number of updates to their translation services in recent weeks.
Facebook aims to translate the Web using an army of volunteers and some hired professional translators.
How it works: Real people are at the heart of Facebook translation plan.
These crowd-sourced edits -- which work kind of like Wikipedia -- make Facebook's translation service smarter over time.
The update allows sites to install a translation gadget on their sites through Facebook Connect, a service that lets Facebook users sign in on other Web pages.
How it works: Google's computers learn how to be translators by examining text that's already on the Web, and from professional Web translations posted online, said Franz Och, a principal scientist at Google.
Size: Google claims to be the largest free language translation service online.
Google also recently unveiled a translation service for Google Docs, which lets anyone upload a document to the Web and have it translated into a number of languages for free.
And there's a new Firefox add-on from Google to help people translate the Web more quickly.
Also, Google lets people spot translation errors, suggest new wordings and translate its interface into languages Google's computers don't speak just yet.
