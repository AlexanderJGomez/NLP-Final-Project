The 26-year-old will face European Ryder Cup teammate Luke Donald in Sunday's final at Dove Mountain's Ritz-Carlton course after the Englishman made light work of his matches against Americans Ryan Moore and Matt Kuchar.
"I was not thinking about the number one spot as I was sure I would get the opportunity again over the next few weeks, I just wanted to win the match.
1 Kaymer won both of his matches at the 18th, surviving a late rally from Jimenez after leading by four holes at 14.
Donald then thrashed U.S. Ryder Cup player and 2010 PGA Tour money list champion Kuchar 6 & 5 in the first semifinal to be completed.
Yang, who beat U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell on Friday, was never ahead in the match and trailed by four holes after the eighth, then Kuchar matched his four consecutive pars to 17.
