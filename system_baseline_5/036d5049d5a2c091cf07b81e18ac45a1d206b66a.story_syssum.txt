Former President Bill Clinton, who has been campaigning for President Obama and taking on the GOP, went off-script several times.
But at another level, the debate between these two men is part of a bigger debate about what kind of campaign the Democrats should run: a campaign of articulation or a campaign of triangulation.
One strategy, which has been the preference thus far for President Obama, is a campaign of "articulation," a campaign in which a candidate lays out a clear set of themes and ideas to distinguish himself from the opposition.
The other kind of campaign, the campaign of "triangulation," is one that Bill Clinton mastered in 1996.
In 1996, Clinton perfected this kind of campaign.
He agreed to legislation that ended the existing welfare system and made deficit reduction his priority.
Obama understands that the danger of a campaign of articulation is that he would not be able to capitalize on the issues that convince many moderates to go to or stick with the Republican Party.
If he does not, and he takes the triangulation bait, Obama could end up becoming a surrogate for the Romney campaign.
