(CNN) -- The former stepson of singer Usher Raymond remained in critical condition in an Atlanta hospital Tuesday, four days after he was injured while riding in an inner tube at a north Georgia lake, his family said.
Jeffrey Hubbard, a 38-year-old Atlanta man, was driving the personal water craft, the investigation report said.
Kile's mother is Tameka Raymond, who was married to Usher for two years until their divorce in 2009.
