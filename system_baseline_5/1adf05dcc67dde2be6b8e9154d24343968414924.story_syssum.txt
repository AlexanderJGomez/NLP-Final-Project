Before that stop was over, the officers had seized $100,000, which the men said was money to play poker.
It's called Civil Asset Forfeiture, and it was started in the early 1980s by the Justice Department.
In the case of the two poker players in Iowa, months after their money was taken, they reached a settlement in which most of the money —$90,000 — was returned.
Now, however, they are suing to get the rest of the money back and have asked for unspecified damages.
In a small Nevada county two hours driving time east of Reno, a single deputy sheriff has been responsible for more than a dozen cash seizures in 2014 alone, according to a lawsuit filed on behalf of motorists whose money was taken.
One of them said their colleague, Dove, "had been going through a tough time" and had called them to complain about our presence.
The Justice Department recently said it was backing away from the civil asset forfeiture actions it had been taking for nearly three decades.
"With this new policy, effective immediately, the Justice Department is taking an important step to prohibit federal agency adoptions of state and local seizures, except for public safety reasons," said Attorney General Eric Holder.
