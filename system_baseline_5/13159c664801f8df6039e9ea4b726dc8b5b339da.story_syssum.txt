Yet this tale has taken a sudden and unexpected twist: The killer got a pardon and a hero's welcome.
Thomas de Waal, an expert on the Caucasus with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told CNN world energy markets would be disrupted in a conflict since an oil and a gas pipeline carrying Caspian oil curves around the conflict zone in Azerbaijan.
Not long after Safarov arrived in Azerbaijan, though, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev pardoned him.
"Mr. Safarov has been glorified in Azerbaijan as a national hero at all levels -- including the top level," said Zohrab Mnatsakanian, Armenia's deputy minister of Foreign Affairs.
Sabine Freizer, director of the International Crisis Group's Europe program, said world powers have taken note.
The disputes between the countries over Nagorno-Karabakh and other territories remain an "unresolved conflict of the Soviet period," Freizer said.
And Azerbaijan's oil and gas wealth is making its way into the budget for a military preparing for war, Freizer said.
Hungary defended its extradition and said it received assurances the killer would carry out his term.
Azerbaijan has strong military links with Turkey and they (Armenia and Azerbaijan) are both on the border with Iran," de Waal said.
Markedonov said a deteriorating conflict could spawn an arms race.
De Waal said diplomats must work harder now.
"If there is any silver lining to this dark episode it could be that the international community pays more attention to the dangers of a new Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh," de Waal wrote in his column.
