Mohamed Nasheed was the first democratically elected president of the Indian Ocean nation in three decades.
"This is a situation where the first democratically elected president in the Maldives is taken down by a former dictator and his supporters," the spokesman said.
Chakrabarti said he felt the coup was "the end of democracy in the Maldives.
The police officers appeared to have sided with the Progressive Party, which is loyal to former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who ruled Maldives for 30 years before Nasheed defeated him.
In 2008, Nasheed became the country's first democratically elected president in 30 years.
But demonstrators said at the time they were protesting economic conditions, created by reforms imposed by Nasheed.
Nasheed was arrested as a journalist several times and held as a political prisoner.
Maldives is also grappling with a very likely possibility that it will go under water if the current pace of climate change keeps raising sea levels.
