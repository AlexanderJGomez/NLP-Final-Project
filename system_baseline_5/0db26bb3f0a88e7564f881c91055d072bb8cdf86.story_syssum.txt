This should be the day Nigeria steps into the spotlight and basks in the glow of hosting the World Economic Forum in Africa.
But Nigeria does have a couple of obvious economic black-eyes, most notably an inability to close the wealth gap between the North and South, which in turn has given fuel to the Boko Haram movement and, by extension, radical Islam.
But if one heads North to Borno -- the birthplace of Boko Haram -- per capita income is just $1,631.
In Borno, alarmingly, 60% of the population lives in extreme poverty, according to the Nigeria Security Tracker.
After re-basing its economy in early April to take in services growth, Nigeria zoomed ahead of South Africa as the continent's biggest economy.
South Africa's President Jacob Zuma goes to the polls making the case that his country can serve as a springboard into the faster growing economies of West and East Africa, due to its lead in financial and trade services.
That is where Nigeria remains vulnerable.
