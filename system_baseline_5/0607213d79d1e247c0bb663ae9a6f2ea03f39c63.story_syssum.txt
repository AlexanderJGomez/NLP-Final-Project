But for many others, including myself, Twitter has become the new "Fight Club."
Chang's.
This is what Twitter is to many.
But there's an increasingly dark underbelly to these Twitter fights.
I know some reading this are asking: Why do you fight at all on Twitter?
Sure, you can do that, but as Tyler Durden instructively told us in "Fight Club": "How much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight."
In today's hyperpartisan climate, many just associate with like-minded people and consequently their views on political issues are never challenged.
Here's my plea to my fellow Twitter users: We need to make it clear that there's simply no place for that type of hate on Twitter.
If enough of us collectively speak out, Twitter can become a social media platform where users share info, joke around and even fight with each other, but all without being subject to hate.
