Twelve months ago, no one could have guessed that Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, North Korea's Kim Jong Il and al Qaeda's Osama bin Laden would be dead; Egypt's former president Hosni Mubarak and Tunisia's former president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali prosecuted and former Bosnian Serb army commander Ratko Mladic in jail.
Much has been written on the revolutions driven by people power youth movements in Tunisia and Egypt.
People power and nonviolent struggle driven by OTPOR, the resistance movement, brought an end to the rule of Slobodan Milosevic on October 5, 2000.
Milosevic was delivered to Hague in 2001, followed by former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, then Mladic.
Fifty out of 67 transitions from dictatorships to democracies in the last 35 years came from non-violent struggle.
There is a force more powerful at work shaping the new reality: Strategic nonviolent struggle.
Brave, young and oppressed people around the world are realizing there is immense power in nonviolent struggle.
That would mark 2011 as more than the "worst year for bad guys," but encourage and remind millions of oppressed in places like North Korea, Myanmar, Zimbabwe and Iran that power ultimately belongs to the people.
