Only about 6% of Latino voters agree that the GOP is the party most concerned for their interests.
But Republicans make a big mistake if they imagine that the Rubio choice will gain them many Latino votes.
More than one-third of Latino voters fear their home could go into foreclosure.
As glibly as pundits talk about "Hispanic voters," it's important to remember that a majority of American Hispanics identify themselves -- not as "Hispanics" -- but as Mexican-Americans, Cuban-Americans, and so on.
Under these circumstances, Republicans should be cautious about assuming that they can sway Latino votes with the symbolic politics of a Rubio nomination.
If that assumption was ever true, it is not true now.
And to the extent that symbolic politics can sway votes, Republicans should be looking to groups more receptive to the core Republican message than Mexican-Americans are likely to be.
Symbols of inclusion can work.
