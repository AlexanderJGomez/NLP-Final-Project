Readers have his latest book to digest.
But after Sussman's most recent book was complete, his editor says he changed his tune.
Taylor remembers Sussman riding around London on his motor scooter, with a publicist in tow, on his way to interviews to support his books.
"In some ironic way, it (his death) got a little bit more attention for the book in the UK," says Morgan Entrekin, president of Grove/Atlantic, Sussman's U.S. publisher, "as people wrote about the tragedy of his death and the fact that this was going to be his last book."
She says she yearns to talk to him each time she finds one of the inside jokes he scatters throughout "The Labyrinth of Osiris."
Sussman also wove his wife into all of his stories.
"All of those things that you would normally talk about," she says.
His agent says she has a manuscript Sussman wrote more than 10 years ago.
"It's an absolutely hilarious book," says Laura Susijn, his longtime agent and friend.
Susijn says the unpublished manuscript reflects its author even more than his subsequent novels, largely because it's so funny.
"I think it would be great if ... they can make a few bucks, or if they just want to make sure that the fans are happy," she says.
"For me, he's very much alive," Susijn says.
She says she would also be keen to publish her husband's early manuscript -- in time.
"That's basically his legacy," Susijn says.
