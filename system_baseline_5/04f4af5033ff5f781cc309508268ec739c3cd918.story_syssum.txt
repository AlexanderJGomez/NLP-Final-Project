The world may be watching the U.S. election, but China isn't concerned with who wins.
Chinese intellectuals, and indeed the public at large, believe that no matter who wins the race, America will have to be soft in its approach to our country because there is so much at stake.
While the Chinese people desire democracy, they are skeptical of the U.S. system because its elections don't seem to engender progress for Americans.
The U.S. elections are certainly an exercise in democracy, but wealthy individuals and corporations can now pour significant amounts of money and advertising into manipulating the public.
I don't think people like the way the debates and elections are designed, but at least they're an outlet for people to make a stand.
The one-party system in China is inhuman.
China and the U.S. are two societies with very different attitudes towards opinion and criticism.
Even my slightest, most innocuous move can -- and often is -- censored by Chinese authorities.
It is impossible to compare Chinese society with the U.S., as each system has its own dangers.
