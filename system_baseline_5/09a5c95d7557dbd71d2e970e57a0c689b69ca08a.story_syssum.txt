The alerts about a blue Nissan -- possibly carrying Ethan Anderson, 8, and sister Hannah Anderson, 16 -- were the first sent statewide in California under a new program that sends Amber Alerts about abducted children via text messages to millions of mobile phones.
But people had to sign up to receive the alerts -- only about 700,000 did -- and then designate the areas they wanted to get alerts for.
Cellphone owners now receive Amber Alerts, as well as emergency weather alerts, based on their proximity to the emergency, not the location of their phone number.
About 100 Amber Alerts, sent simultaneously to all compatible mobile devices within range of the cellular towers in the affected area, have been sent nationwide so far under the Wireless Emergency Alert program.
"We have stressed that these alerts have been used judiciously, sparingly," he added, when asked about irritated reactions to Monday's Amber Alerts in California.
Monday's alert was the third Amber Alert in California in 2013 to use the new system, although the first two were only broadcast to phones in specific counties.
"The fact that the alerts were broadcast indiscriminately to San Diego-area cellphones (and later, to all California phones capable of receiving text messages, as the alert went statewide) clearly annoyed a lot of wireless customers," he wrote.
