England has not had much to smile about in recent months but perhaps it will allow itself time to enjoy a rare moment of success.
Danny Welbeck, who recently signed for Arsenal after completing a move from Manchester United, scored both goals as England produced an encouraging performance.
Both goals came as a result of counter attacks with Welbeck finishing off Raheem Sterling's cross on 58 minutes after England had caught Switzerland short in defense.
Wayne Rooney, the new England captain, said the pace of England's front three was key to his side's success.
In Kiev, Ukraine suffered a 1-0 home defeat by Slovakia in with Robert Mak scoring the only goal of the game for the visitors.
In Group G, Russia benefited from two own goals as it overcame Liechtenstein 4-0 in Khimki.
