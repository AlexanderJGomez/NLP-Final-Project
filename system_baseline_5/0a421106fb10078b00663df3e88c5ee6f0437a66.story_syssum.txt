David Goldman is fighting for custody of his son after Bruna Bianchi Goldman died during another childbirth.
For nearly five years, Goldman has fought to regain custody of his son.
Goldman continues to press his case through the U.S. government.
Brazilian courts have refused to return Sean Goldman to the United States for any custody hearings that New Jersey courts have ordered and the Brazilian government has not intervened.
Fatherhood is not about making home movies and taking pictures, it's about sacrifice.
"And Mr. Goldman, while Bruna was still alive, failed to do so," Ribeiro said.
The next step in this case is uncertain.
