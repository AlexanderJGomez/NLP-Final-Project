Last year, I was covering the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington when I came across a stall selling old political pins.
None of the young conservative activists had a nice word to say about Nixon and many were quite hostile.
But a common theme running through each of these battles is "inflexibility."
In domestic policy, Nixon bowed to the liberal consensus of his era.
Nixon said he wanted "peace with honor" in Vietnam, which meant concluding the conflict in such a way that didn't undermine American military or political credibility.
But Nixon won re-election in 1972 partly on a reputation as a peacemaker with whom the Democrats could not compete.
Had Watergate not reduced his political capital so early in 1973, there's a chance Nixon would have pushed ahead with his agenda of a New Federalism and undone much of the liberalism of his first term.
Nixon, then, was a mix of ideals and prejudices, but all tempered by a respect for the possibilities and limitations of power.
The fact is that Nixon was often very popular with a lot of regular Americans.
Today, it's difficult to talk about Nixon as a model for contemporary Republicans because his political reputation is so tarnished.
Considering that record, moderate Republicans in pursuit of the White House have every cause to get misty-eyed when they hear the name Richard Nixon.
