(CNN) -- The little-known South African Louis Oosthuizen shocked the world of golf as he stormed to his first ever major win on Sunday with a runaway seven-shot victory at the British Open at St. Andrews.
Oosthuizen, who also has a home in Manchester, England, was born in Mossel Bay, South Africa.
"It was unbelievable what he (Ernie Els) did for me," Oosthuizen told the official British Open website.
However, Oosthuizen's stop-start career continued as he failed to play in a major after missing the cuts for the Masters, the British Open and the PGA Championship in 2009.
Having missed the cut at the British Open in 2004, 2006 and 2009, few, if any, envisaged him collecting the trophy at the end of play on Sunday.
Yet Oosthuizen left Paul Casey, Lee Westwood and the world number one Tiger Woods in his wake, with his final round of one-under-par 71 giving him a 16-under total of 272 and his only major title so far.
