(CNN) -- Kyle White now has two pieces of metal to wear -- one, a bracelet inscribed with the names of his six comrades killed in an ambush in Afghanistan, the other, a Medal of Honor given to him for his valor that ensured that death toll wasn't higher.
And I vow to live up to the responsibility of doing so," White said.
A high school freshman when the Twin Towers fell on September 11, 2001, White joined the Army and was just 20 years old and 21 months into his military service when he faced the ultimate test.
His service had, like many other members of the military, earned him a ticket to Afghanistan as his platoon's radio telephone operator.
In an interview prior to the award ceremony, White told CNN how the group walked "down this little incline and looking into the valley, (when) I hear this single shot.
White administered first aid to one wounded soldier using the only cover available: a single tree.
White ran toward him, braving enemy fire.
White had to see, he said.
White figured he would be killed.
The soldier White had dragged to the tree earlier was hit again, this time in the knee, so the White wrapped his belt around the man's leg, creating a tourniquet.
Suffering a concussion, White managed to hang on, waiting for helicopters to evacuate him and others with him that day.
"It's something you still think about every day," White said.
White first returned home and trained other paratrooopers.
When it came time for White to re-enlist, he thought hard about whether doing so felt right.
"Without the team," he said, "there could be no Medal of Honor.
