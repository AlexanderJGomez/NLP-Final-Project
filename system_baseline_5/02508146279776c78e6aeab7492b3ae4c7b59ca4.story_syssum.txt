Mexico is known for its oil production, but it could be its less obvious flats of arid and marginal land that will be the future of Mexico's energy resources.
Jatropha-based biofuels are being increasingly used in Mexico, and agave -- the plant from which tequila is made -- is being studied as a new source for ethanol.
Chiapas began cultivating jatropha, whose seeds contain oil that can be extracted and converted into biofuel.
By 2015, the goal is to have 1% of all jet fuel in Mexico be biofuel, and by 2020, 15%, he said.
"Mexico has made the very important first step to be in a very priviledged place," Lopez said.
Agave can grow in arid land, and produces less than half of the carbon dioxide emissions produced by corn-based ethanol, Oliver Inderwildi, one of the study's authors, told CNN.
Mexico, the native home of agave plants, stands to benefit if such an ethanol industry takes off.
When that tipping point comes, Mexico will be ready, the experts said.
Without land reform, issues with land availability will continue, and Mexico will fall a decade or more behind other countries in the biofuels sector, Row said.
