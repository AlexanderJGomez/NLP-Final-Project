Rights groups accuse security forces and militia gangs of torturing civilians as world leaders warn that the nation is on the verge of a genocide.
The tiny, landlocked nation in central Africa is home to about 5 million people.
The riches from the minerals don't trickle down to the population, fueling resentment.
A coalition of rebels named Seleka ousted President Francois Bozize in March, the latest in a series of coups since the nation gained independence.
What happened after the president left?
That's nearly 10% of the population.
No.
Political turmoil is nothing new for the Central African Republic.
Ousted government officials have long accused Seleka of going after the country's vast minerals.
Rebels capitalized on the army's weakness and went on a rampage, human rights groups say.
The country descended into anarchy and the United Nations warned that "the seeds of a genocide are being sown."
Rights groups say Seleka is a predominantly Muslim coalition.
The Central African Republic is surrounded by countries struggling to emerge from years of conflict.
The United States sent special forces to the region last year to help hunt down Kony, the brutal leader of the Lord Resistance Army.
The current president has tried to distance himself by disbanding Seleka, Human Rights Watch says.
"They want to create a religious war by all means possible," he says.
An African Union force is already in the nation.
That potential force could number about 6,000 troops and 1,700 police personnel.
