A two-hour boat ride across the vast waters of Lake Tanganyika follows.
"The magic of Gombe is two factors," said Emily Boehm, a PhD candidate at the Jane Goodall Institute Research Center, here to study the chimps.
Researchers like Emily come from all over the world to study the chimps at Gombe.
Before the program began, chimpanzees were thought to be herbivores but Goodall saw them hunting monkeys and eating meat.
Despite the behavioral and genetic similarities, however, the chimps proximity to rural human settlements can often be problematic and detrimental to their own well-being.
In the dense forest and woodlands of Gombe, chimpanzees and other species are protected from the most destructive aspects of human behavior.
"In my opinion, chimps are important for the country's economic growth," said Aristides Aloice Kashula, a Gombe-Masito Program forest officer.
That's a sentiment that Jane Goodall herself would be sure to endorse.
