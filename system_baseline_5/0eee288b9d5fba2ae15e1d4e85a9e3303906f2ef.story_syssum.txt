Bynes had headed back to her apartment by the time police arrived, but she let officers in when they knocked on the door, according to Pisano.
Bynes said she had opened her window "for fresh air" and didn't throw out any drug paraphernalia, claiming the officer "lied" when he claimed she did.
"The cop sexually harassed me, they found no pot on me or bong outside my window," Bynes tweeted.
Bynes was charged with endangerment because the paraphernalia could have hit someone below.
Earlier this month, the actress was sentenced to three years probation for driving on a suspended license.
