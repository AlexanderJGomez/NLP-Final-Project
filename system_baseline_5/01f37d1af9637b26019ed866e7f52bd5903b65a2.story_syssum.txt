Washington (CNN) -- Macy Friday can't remember what she was thinking when -- mouth agape, eyes bugged -- she shook hands with Hillary Clinton in Denver this week.
What does she like about Hillary Clinton?
I was just like, 'Wow.'
They went into a coffee shop and we were like, 'Oh no, they are going to leave.'
(long pause) I turned back at my family and I, like, I, you know, made the face.
Macy: I like her because, like, she is running for president and a lot of people think that girls shouldn't be president because they are not as smart or they shouldn't have the same rights.
Macy: I didn't know, too, too, too much.
Did I already say Taylor Swift?
Macy: Maybe!
Macy: Yes, totally.
CNN: Thanks Macy...
