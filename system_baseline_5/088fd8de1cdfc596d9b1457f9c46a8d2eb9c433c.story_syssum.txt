On Sunday, it was discovered that the 900 million-person social network was "testing" a feature that would let people see a digital list of the people who were nearby in real life.
It's easy enough to change back, as the site Lifehacker and others have detailed, but that little invasion of the hub of digital identity -- the Facebook Timeline -- was enough to make quite a few Facebookers fire back at their digital overlords.
"Up next: Facebook inside your underwear drawer!"
But it seems like every week has been feeling a little like that.
Do we hold Facebook to too high of a standard?
This theory is put forward by the blog the Next Web, which says Facebook is buying too many new companies -- Instagram, Glancee -- and trying too many new things.
At Facebook, 2 million complaints per week are handled largely by computers and a staff of a few hundred people.
Chances are, most of your friends are on Facebook, so even if you try to go to a competing network like Google+, it might be as fun as talking to your cat.
And it doesn't help to know that, in mid-May, you were worth only $1.21 to Facebook.
"How much does Facebook value its users?
The more content you absorb, the less valuable your own posts seem."
