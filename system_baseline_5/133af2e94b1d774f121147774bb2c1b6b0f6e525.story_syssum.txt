(CNN)  -- Harry Kewell scored a dramatic extra-time winner as Australia beat holders Iraq 1-0 in the quarterfinals of the Asian Cup in Doha Saturday.
Chances were few and far between in the first half of normal time, although McKay and Kewell came close just before the break.
Meanwhile, South Korea beat Iran 1-0 in in the later quarterfinal, again after extra-time, to set up a last-four meeting with Japan.
South Korea dominated for most the match but created few clear-cut chances at the Qatar Sport Club stadium.
