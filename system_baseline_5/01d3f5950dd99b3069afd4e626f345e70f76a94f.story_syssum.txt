Property crime was down 0.5 percent.
That's a small decline from 14,722 in 2010, but it's a decrease of nearly 17 percent from a decade ago.
Guns were used in two thirds of the nation's murders last year, 41 percent of robberies, and 21 percent of aggravated assaults, the report showed.
That report actually showed crime increasing last year, but attributed the change to a jump in simple assaults.
He also noted the increase that the Justice Department reported was from an all-time low in the crime rate the previous year, suggesting crime is entering a low level where police officials hope it will stay for some time.
