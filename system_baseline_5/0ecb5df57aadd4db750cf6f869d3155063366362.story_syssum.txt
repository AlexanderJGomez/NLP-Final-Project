There's the surveillance photo that the FBI says shows him carrying a backpack among the people who thronged the finish line of last year's Boston Marathon -- a backpack that federal agents say held one of the bombs that killed three people and maimed more than 200, severing limbs from many of them.
His lawyers have laid the groundwork for a case that argues that Tsarnaev, now 20, was under the "domination and control" of his brother Tamerlan, who was killed in the chase.
Even if the defense can convince the jury that most of the blame lies with Tsarnaev's dead brother, "They still have to deal with several people being killed and many other people being injured for no reason that would make sense to just about anybody, other than someone who was mentally ill or believed in terrorism," Tabak said.
Tamerlan was run over by his kid brother as they battled police who were closing in, according to the indictment against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.
It says Dzhokhar Tsarnaev downloaded jihadist literature to his computer, including the first issue of al Qaeda's Inspire magazine -- the one that shows how to build a bomb from a pressure cooker, the type of weapon used on Boylston Street.
FBI agents checked out the tip, found no information linking Tamerlan to terrorism and asked the Russians to let them know if they had anything else to support their claims, according to an inspector general's report released last week.
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's lawyers might be able to spare their client's life if they can show jurors that Tamerlan held "an unusual sway" over his brother, Tabak said.
And in Boston, a grim anniversary will soon give way to another year's marathon.
