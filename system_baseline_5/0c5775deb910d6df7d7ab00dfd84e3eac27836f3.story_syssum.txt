A new French law making it a crime to publicly deny the Ottoman Empire's genocide of Armenians a century ago was ruled unconstitutional Tuesday by France's Constitutional Council.
"We hope France will from now on be in a constructive attitude for the dispute between Turkey and Armenia on history to be considered on a fair and scientific basis, and will make contributions that support a solution rather than further deepening the problem," the Turkish ministry said.
Sen. Herve Marseille, one of the bill's supporters, argued that since France already recognizes the Ottoman-era killings as genocide, the same standard that applies to Holocaust denial should apply to the Armenian case.
"And up until now, when we contest the Armenian genocide, there is no punishment.
Tomorrow will there be a question of a Vendee genocide?"
Erdogan announced that Turkey was reviewing its ties with France.
The genocide debate is also a source of tension between Turkey and the United States, another NATO ally.
