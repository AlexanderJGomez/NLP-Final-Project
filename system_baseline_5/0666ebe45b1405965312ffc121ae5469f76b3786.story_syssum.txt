Relief is in sight for the Midwest this weekend, however, as higher temperatures make their way eastward, according to CNN meteorologist Chad Meyers.
An Arctic air mass over the Plains will cause severe wind chills through Saturday morning, the National Weather Service reported.
The citrus growing regions in Florida and Texas will have to keep an eye on their crops as the cold air remains in the area, Meyers said.
Saturday night is expected to be the coldest, with lows in the teens and below in some areas, the weather service said.
The most snow -- about 10 feet -- is expected to fall in Canada's Whistler Blackcomb, the venue for the Olympic Alpine skiing event.
CNN's Dave Alsup, Hank Bishop and Sean Morris contributed to this report.
