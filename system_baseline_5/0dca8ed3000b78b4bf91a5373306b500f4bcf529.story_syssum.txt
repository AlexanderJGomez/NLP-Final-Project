Washington (CNN) -- The screen is black and white.
"No one had attacked anyone like that before," said Robert Mann, a Louisiana State University professor who literally wrote the book about the Daisy ad.
The end of the spot, which never even mentions Goldwater or shows his image, encourages viewers to vote for Johnson.
Goldwater had listed the use of small nuclear weapons as a possible way to defoliate parts of the Vietnam jungle and destroy key infrastructure used by communist guerrillas.
"It was almost like a crusade not to have Goldwater become president," said Sidney Myers, the creative director at Dane Doyle Bernbach at the time who helped make the ad.
"It was a commercial that went viral before there was a 'viral,' " said Drew Babb, an advertising creative director who teaches political ads at American University.
Myers, now 82, said he was listening to soundtracks of children with sound engineer Tony Schwartz, another mastermind behind the Daisy ad, and they came across sound of a child counting from one to 10.
Her parents -- one a fan of Goldwater and the other of Johnson -- had no idea their daughter would be featured in a political spot.
It's a political ad for Johnson!'
"My grandmother had instilled this fear in me that I shouldn't comment to people that I'm the Daisy girl because, you know, it wasn't necessarily a good thing that I was in that ad," she said.
