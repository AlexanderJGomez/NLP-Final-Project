Although a judge has found two Steubenville teenagers guilty of raping a 16-year-old girl in a case that showcased jaw-dropping examples of teenage alcohol use and tawdry text messaging -- all wrapped in allegations of a cover-up -- Ohio's attorney general said Monday it's now time for a grand jury to look at whether anyone else should be charged.
"We hope that from this something good can arise," she said.
The girls -- one 15, one 16, both from Steubenville -- were in a juvenile lockup Monday night, awaiting an appearance before a judge Tuesday morning, Jefferson County Sheriff Fred Abdalla said.
The grand jury will begin meeting around April 15 and could take "a number of days" to complete its work, DeWine said.
Authorities accused Mays and Richmond of putting their fingers in the girl's vagina while she was too drunk to consent, an act that constitutes rape under Ohio law.
Both Mays and Richmond must undergo treatment and will have to register as sex offenders, Lipps ruled.
"She continues to be a victim and be victimized ... over and over," he said.
Nevertheless, "They're going to have to answer to it," he said.
"I hope this sends a warning," he said.
"I'm afraid people are going to walk away and say this was all about Steubenville," DeWine said.
"It's not.
DeWine said.
