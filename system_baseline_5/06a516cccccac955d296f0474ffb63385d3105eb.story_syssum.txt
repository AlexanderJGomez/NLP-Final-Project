It reports that sales of his latest album, "Unorthodox Jukebox," rose by 164% after Mars took to the Super Bowl stage with the Red Hot Chilli Peppers.
In January, "Unorthodox Jukebox" won Mars his second Grammy, this time for best pop vocal album.
As is customary, Mars did not receive an appearance fee for his Super Bowl performance.
"With the added exposure from the Super Bowl, he could easily push prices closer to the $120 average of his halftime show predecessor, Beyonce."
