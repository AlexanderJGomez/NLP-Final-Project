Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- Some of the families camped outside the San Jose mine, waiting for rescuers to reach 33 workers trapped underground, fear Chilean President Sebastian Pinera may be playing politics with the rescue operation in an effort to boost his popularity.
Along the central and southern coast, some Chileans accuse the government of being too slow to rebuild after the February earthquake and tsunami.
The Chilean research company said the increase was "directly related with the rescue operations of the trapped miners in the San Jose mine."
The sister of another trapped miner accused rescuers of delaying the switch-on of a recently-assembled oil rig -- the so-called Plan C drill -- until Pinera arrived Sunday.
The woman, who asked not to be named for fear of unspecified reprisals, said she did not bother to wait in the hot sun to meet the president Sunday.
"We have to be calm.
Away from reporters, Pinera first visited a powerful oil drill that has been transported to the mine to assist in the rescue.
Sunday was the first day that all three drills were working simultaneously, Pinera said.
