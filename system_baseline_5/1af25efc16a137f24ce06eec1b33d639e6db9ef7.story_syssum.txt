"About a dozen years, I've been trying to do it," David Bohrman, CNN's senior vice president and Washington bureau chief, said to Blitzer on "The Situation Room" on Wednesday.
Chuck Hurley, the Washington bureau's senior producer of video and the staffer tapped by Bohrman to manage the execution of the "hologram," called it simple chroma-key technology that's been taken "to the Nth degree."
On Tuesday night, Blitzer could only see Yellin on a TV monitor across the studio.
Instead, for the past three months, the company has been perfecting it for CNN's election coverage, Oz said.

Hurley said considering it was CNN's first real "test launch" with the high-end gadgetry, they were "beyond thrilled."
Hurley and Oz both said they couldn't put a price tag on the total cost of such technology.
The day after her virtual appearance in New York, Yellin said this kind of new technology is what keeps television news entertaining, even when it's presenting important political stories.
Now, in hindsight, Yellin only wishes she could have come up with a better "Star Wars" joke.
