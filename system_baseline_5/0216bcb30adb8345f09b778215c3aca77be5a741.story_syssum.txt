A federal judge struck down Oregon's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage Monday.
Multnomah County began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples minutes later, the county said in a statement.
It's amazing," he said.
Ten years ago, Rouse said, the first same-sex marriages in the United States were celebrated in Massachusetts.
Meanwhile, the National Organization for Marriage, which opposes same-sex marriage, said it had filed a motion with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals asking judges to block McShane's ruling.
The Oregon ruling continues a near-unbroken string of state and federal court victories nationwide in the past year for supporters of same-sex marriage.
Groups supporting same-sex marriage applauded the Oregon ruling.
Separate federal appeals courts in recent weeks heard challenges to same-sex marriage bans in Utah, Oklahoma and Virginia.
Also Monday, a federal judge said Utah must recognize the marriages of more than 1,200 same-sex couples who obtained marriage licenses earlier this year after a court struck down that state's same-sex marriage ban.
In Oregon, officials are taking the opposite tack, praising the judge's ruling overturning their state's same-sex marriage ban.
"Today is a win for love, for families, and for freedom."
