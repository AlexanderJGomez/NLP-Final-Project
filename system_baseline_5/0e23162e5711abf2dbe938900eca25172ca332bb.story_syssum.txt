That's why it is imperative and urgent that the Obama team and their allies take a deep breath, pull themselves together and get this war effort on solid footing.
Who knew after so many contradictions from the administration?
Even as a coalition grows of nations proclaiming their support, questions also rise of just how much -- or how little -- they will actually do.
The administration expresses confidence that a reconstituted Iraqi military along with Kurdish forces, working with American air power, can destroy ISIS in Iraq, but so far, press reports are skeptical.
In truth, Obama and the military have been able to work together in a professional way through most of his administration.
The Obama team has doubted the loyalty of several of its generals, while the military has doubted the competence of the President and his national security team, especially in the second term.
The military worries that Obama and his team will micromanage, especially in Syria -- something that President Lyndon Johnson did with disastrous results in Vietnam.
An additional challenge the administration faces is that the President has now announced America is going to war, but there are virtually no signs of mobilization on television.
In coming days, through his time at the United Nations and back in the White House, the President must dramatically seize the reins of leadership.
We must not lose heart just because this war is off to a rocky start.
