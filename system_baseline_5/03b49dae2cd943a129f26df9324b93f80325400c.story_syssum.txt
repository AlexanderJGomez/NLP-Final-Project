London (CNN) -- After pleas to spare the life of British aid worker Alan Henning went unanswered by the so-called Islamic State terror group, his family is "numb with grief" with the news that he has been beheaded.
That is not to be."
The news of Henning's beheading came just days after Britain joined the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS, following overwhelming approval from Parliament.
ISIS then claimed its first British victim, aid worker David Haines, according to video that appeared online on September 13.
He was abducted by masked gunmen the day after Christmas, other people in the aid convoy said.
His interest was in the welfare of others," Barbara Henning said in the statement.
He does not believe a very large number of people sympathize or are even prepared to tolerate the kind of attitude shown by ISIS, he said.
