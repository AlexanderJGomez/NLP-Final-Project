Virginia Tech spokesman Mark Owczarski said Thursday that Xin Yang's killing was the first on the campus since April 16, 2007, when a shooter killed 32 people before turning a gun on himself.
Zhu did not say anything to the arresting officers, said campus police Chief Wendell Flinchum.
He began studies at Virginia Tech in fall 2008, Hincker said.
"Our hearts go out to the victim and her family," President Charles W. Steger said in a letter to the campus community.
