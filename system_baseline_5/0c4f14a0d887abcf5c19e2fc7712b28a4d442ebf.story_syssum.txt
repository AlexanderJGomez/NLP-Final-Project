(CNN)Most airline pilots have an above average ability to compartmentalize personal problems.
However, sometimes during the course of an airline pilot's career, or anyone's career for that matter, stress issues may manifest as depression.
As the world learns more about Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot on Germanwings Flight 9525, it is readily apparent that this young man had psychiatric issues far beyond clinical depression.
Considering the hoops Lubitz had to jump through to have established himself as a Germanwings co-pilot, it's curious to me how the red flags of his illness were missed.
Interaction among fellow enthusiasts is paramount to both enjoyment and safety.
Second, Lubitz had to compete successfully in a selection process just to have the opportunity to train through Lufthansa's flight program, a requirement of Germanwings employment.
The purpose of an MPL is to funnel airline pilot candidates having little or no flight time into the right seat as first officers.
As a 21-year-old flight instructor, I had that much flight time; it hardly qualified as a lot of experience.
Using both actual flight experience in a single-engine airplane and simulator time, the student receives about 250 hours of training.
After all, the selection process was most likely highly competitive, with other qualified candidates readily available.
Over the course of a career, an airline pilot spends thousands of hours sharing the confined space of the cockpit with colleagues.
Depending upon a pilot's monthly flight time, salary for pilots can be as much as 20% lower than the mainline carrier.
Perhaps enough of a disparity existed for Germanwings pilots such that medical leave benefits would not have covered Lubitz's absence.
Well, this is the primary purpose of accident investigation: Never allow the same tragedy to occur again.
