(CNN) -- Each Father's Day, I thank my father for giving me life -- twice -- the first time in the traditional sense and the second when he donated his kidney to me.
I was worried about the short recovery time, but he kept his sights on this adventure of a lifetime in addition to my regaining my health.
Waiting for an organ on the regular transplant list may take years.
I believe that many more people would do what my father did for me if they knew more about the transplant process and outcomes.
One day a year isn't enough to celebrate and thank my father for all he has done for me.
