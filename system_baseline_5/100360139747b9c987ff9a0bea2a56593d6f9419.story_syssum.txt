(CNN) -- Bayern Munich moved level on points with Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday, beating Wolfsburg 3-1 while the German Bundesliga leaders were held 1-1 at Bochum.
The result gave Bayern 45 points from 21 matches after a seventh successive victory, while Wolfsburg are now 20 points off the pace and just six above the relegation zone.
Fourth-placed Hamburg remained nine points behind the leaders after also dropping two points in a 3-3 draw at Cologne.
Livorno, who moved up to 15th place and also held AC Milan 1-1 last weekend, took the lead in the 26th minute with a header from diminutive striker Antonio Filippini before Juve defender Nicola Legrottaglie nodded in off the post to level four minutes before halftime.
Edison Cavani headed in Fabrizio Miccoli's free-kick to put Palermo ahead after 63 minutes, but Jonathan Biabiany leveled nine minutes later with a controversial goal which came while the hosts called for treatment for their scorer.
