(The Frisky) -- Matchmaker and dating coach Rachel Greenwald is responsible for 750 marriages, and she doesn't believe you will find the love of your life by waiting for him/her to spontaneously appear in line at the grocery store or sit next to you on the subway.
I had the opportunity to chat with Rachel and get a singles state of the union.
If love doesn't happen instantly, we're out of there.
Rachel points out that we are willing to put effort into other things in our lives -- our careers, our friendships, our hobbies, our living space --but we expect our love lives to come effortlessly.
"The stigma is all in your head," says Rachel.
Rachel suggests thinking of all the people in our lives as possible networking opportunities.
"How?"
There's no stigma about dating online anymore -- one-fourth of the people who got married last year met online.
But Rachel also recommends Twitter as an alternative source.
You can search something like "Singles, New York, film lovers," and find groups that meet in your area.
"Treat Facebook like an online dating profile," says Rachel.
Rachel suggests crafting the image you want to project on Facebook.
They know a thing or two about relationships, but more importantly, they know other single people who are marriage-minded.
"Doing online dating with a bad profile picture or going to a singles event and leaving after you scanned the room once is like looking for a job with a poorly written resume or applying for a sales job [when] you're an accountant," says Rachel.
Rachel says that there's no shame in hiring a dating coach.
