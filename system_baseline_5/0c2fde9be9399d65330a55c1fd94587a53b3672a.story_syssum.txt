Grosseto, Italy (CNN) -- The captain of the Italian cruise liner Costa Concordia "committed a tragic error," but his crew did their best to evacuate the ship's 3,200 passengers, the last survivor found aboard said Wednesday.
But, he said, Schettino "committed a tragic error.
He said he thought the ship was passing too close to the island, "but the captain drives the ship.
Schettino has said that after the impact, he ran the ship aground to keep it from sinking and limit its list.
"Consider that the ship was leaning very fast, it was a little difficult for us to put the people in safe, on the life boats," he said.
Most of the 3,000-plus passengers and the ship's crew of about 1,000 made it safely off the ship in less than two hours, he said.
Giampedroni was half-submerged in the chilly water flooding the restaurant when found.
