"Number one, it was a danger to the children that were playing out there in that heat, and secondly it would save electricity that people would need for air conditioning in their homes," said Molinaro, who'd been forced to sleep at his office that night because of a blackout in his own neighborhood.
"It felt like an oven in my home and on the street," Chen said.
In a nutshell, a smart grid is an automated electricity system that improves the reliability, security and efficiency of electric power.
"... not just the electric grid that underpins our lives," he said, "but also the human condition."
Failing to modernize the grid, he said, will threaten the U.S. position as an economic super power.
For example, a project to help Queens' Flushing neighborhood will "give us the capability to remotely control up to 26 underground switches," said Con Ed smart grid manager Thomas Magee.
On the other end of the spectrum, utilities in New York Pennsylvania and New Jersey averaged 214 minutes of total interruptions each year.
"As you can see, we have a long way to go," said Andres Carvallo, who played a key role in planning the smart grid in Austin, Texas.
"Austin is two to three years ahead of everybody else," said Carvallo, now chief strategy officer for the smart grid software firm Grid Net.
Replacing old-style electric meters with "smart meters" is often described as the first step in creating a smart grid.
Soon, when power goes out in a neighborhood with smart meters, utilities won't have to wait for customers to report outages -- the smart meters will alert utilities automatically.
One advantage of smart grid technology may be jobs.
