(CNN) -- On a number of occasions and in perfectly pitched and calibrated statements, President Obama has expressed his unequivocal support for the civil rights movement in Iran without appearing to interfere in Iranian domestic affairs.
Obama can help this budding seed of hope for civil liberties even more emphatically by altogether cutting the budget "to promote democracy in Iran," evidently channeled through the U.S. Agency for International Development.
The only thing it needs is the moral voice of the American civil rights movement to come to its aid.
If I were the president, I would reallocate that budget and spend it on enriching inner city public schools, enabling them to develop courses on modern Iranian and Islamic history.
Not just one but four swords of Damocles are now hanging over the Iranian civil rights movement.
But the other three swords are held over this movement from outside Iran, in fact from the United States government.
By wedding the freshly cut flower of Neda Aqa-Soltan's young life in the fertile soil of Rosa Parks' memory, Iranians and Americans will finally come together in their common dreams of basic human decency.
