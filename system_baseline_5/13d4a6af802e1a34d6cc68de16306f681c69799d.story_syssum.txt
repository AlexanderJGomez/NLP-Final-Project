Marion Christopher Barry, the 34-year-old son of Marion Barry, the iconic former D.C. mayor and council member who died last year, is running for his father's seat on the district's council.
Despite his name recognition, the path to the council will not be an easy one for Barry.
Barry was convicted of possession and served six months in prison.
Barry received 18 months of supervised probation for the plea.
