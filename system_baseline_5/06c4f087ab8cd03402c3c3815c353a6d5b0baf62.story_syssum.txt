Berlin (CNN) -- More than 300 wounded Libyans will arrive in Germany to be treated in hospitals within the next 10 days in an operation approved by Libya's interim government, the German Foreign Ministry said Friday.
An additional four will go to U.S. medical facilities in Germany, according to Major Janelle Jeffrey of the U.S. Africa Command, based in Stuttgart, Germany.
Four days later, the first military plane arrived in Germany with dozens of wounded Libyans.
Many wounded Libyans had already received treatment in Tunisia, according to Blasius.
