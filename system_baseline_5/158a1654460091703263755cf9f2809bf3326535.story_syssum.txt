(CNN) -- "Hello 'true believers,' this is Stan Lee," said the world-renowned comic book creator as he filmed a video segment for CNN.com.
"I never really think of which [business offers] to take and turn down, because almost everything that's offered to me sounds like fun," he said.
"All of my life in comics I have worked with artists, so I've collaborated with them," said Lee.
I've been so lucky that I have found and worked with that caliber of people," he said.
Through his prolific work and desire to entertain, Lee has influenced pop culture for 71 years.
He started working as a writer and proofreader in 1939 for the comic book company that would become Marvel.
Since 1965, Marvel superheroes have jumped from the pages of comic books to costume and toy stores, Saturday morning cartoons and blockbuster movies.
Many of Lee's superheroes and villains are complicated characters, allowing him to weave social discussions into comic book story lines.

said Lee, emphatically.
Lee makes many cameo appearances in movies based on his comic books.
Finding him in Marvel-based movies is almost like playing "Where's Waldo?"
If I could be in a movie called 'Cameo Man' and play all the cameos I've done, that would be my superpower.
