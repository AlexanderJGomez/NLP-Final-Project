(CNN)  -- "LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean" holds fast to the pirate code with great humor and animation, appeal for all ages and massive replayability after the main story mode is complete.
Players can use up to eight different characters on each level during story mode, but that can lead to a crowded screen.
Ellison said the settings are as iconic as they could be and the team tried to put the LEGO spin on the movies.
"Eight collectibles in each level and 10 ships in a bottle can be found," Ellison said.
Said Ellison: "The exploration game play ties into the ideology of 'Pirates of the Caribbean.'
Ellison said each scene has to be solvable for all ages, and the game teaches you what to do and where to look as it goes along.
"We will have some of the same locations but none of the dialogue (LEGO characters do not speak, only grunt).
Unlike previous LEGO games, which forced the two characters to stay in the same screenshot, "LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean" actually splits the screen as the characters walk away from each other.
There was never a time where a puzzle needed to be solved in split-screen mode.
Once each level is completed in story mode, free play mode is unlocked, allowing you to use any of the characters you have available to solve puzzles that couldn't be previously figured out.
The game is also available for the Nintendo 3DS, but there are only 16 levels, and you can use only one character during each level.
I mean, Captain Jack Sparrow ... is worthy of any would-be pirate.
