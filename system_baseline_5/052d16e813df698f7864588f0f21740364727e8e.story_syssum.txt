Hawking, one of the world's most famous physicists, is also a cosmologist, astronomer, and mathematician.
On his Web site, Hawking has written about living with ALS.
He added: "I have been lucky, that my condition has progressed more slowly than is often the case.
Hawking has been married and divorced twice.
The following are some quotes from that interview:
