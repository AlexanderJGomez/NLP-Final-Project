But in recent years, the fishing industry has come under severe threat as a result of the ongoing risk posed by Somali pirates roaming the waters off the Horn of Africa.
"Anything that disrupts the tourism or fishing industry or the maritime equilibrium is a very big problem for us," he adds.
"We need more assets and build up more our capacity to deal with the issue."
Pierre, who's been casting his nets for 12 years now, says his job was hardest during the worst period of the piracy -- in 2007 and 2008.
He says fish intake has fallen nearly 25% in the last five years.
Since 2006, the year the World Bank report takes as the starting point of piracy, exports of fish products from piracy-hit countries have declined by 23.8%.
"Five years ago, there was a lot of fish," says Pierre.
