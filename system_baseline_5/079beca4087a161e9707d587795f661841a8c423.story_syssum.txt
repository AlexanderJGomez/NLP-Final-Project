(CNN)  -- Two goals in three minutes from Abby Wambach and Alex Morgan put the United States into the final of the Women's World Cup with a 3-1 victory over France Wednesday.
Prolific striker Wambach put them ahead with a thumping header from a Cheney corner which left French goalkeeper Berangere Sapowicz with no chance.
"I think France played very well.
But Japan striker Nahomi Kawasumi equalized with a fine individual goal nine minutes later and put them ahead after the break.
