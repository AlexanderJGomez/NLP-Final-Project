Edinburgh, Scotland (CNN) -- The three main UK party leaders gave a joint promise Tuesday that Scotland will get extra powers if it opts to stay part of the United Kingdom in a landmark vote in two days' time.
In a speech Monday in Aberdeen, Scotland, Cameron made an emotional plea for Scotland not to "end the United Kingdom as we know it" and warned that there was no turning back if voters decide on independence.
"This is a decision that could break up our family of nations, and rip Scotland from the rest of the UK," he said.
The "Yes Scotland" campaign, led by Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond, says that only by voting for independence can Scotland be sure that it will have full control of its own taxation and spending.
"This is a decision for the people of Scotland to make," he said.
... We believe that the 'Yes' campaign has not answered important questions -- notably: What will the currency be?
There are also unanswered questions about tax increases and the fiscal implications of independence, Barber said.
