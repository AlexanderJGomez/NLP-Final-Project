Kandel won the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work with Aplysia -- or more specifically, for his work on the biological mechanisms of memory storage.
Dr. Eric Kandel: There are two forms (of memory).
One is complex forms of memory, which require the hippocampus and (are called) explicit memory storage.
You've got to see how a memory is formed.
Rather than studying the most complex form of memory in a very complicated animal, we had to take the most simple form -- an implicit form of memory -- in a very simple animal.
But if you have a long-term memory, you alter the expression of genes in the brain and you grow new synaptic connections.
Obviously human memory is much more complicated than memory of a snail.
We can learn things that they can't learn, obviously.
And this is what one finds with the learning process.
I remember having dinner with my wife before we were married and telling her, 'You know, I can see doing this for the rest of my life, but it's ridiculous.
Kandel: Well, I think it's a fascinating problem because it's so central to everything we do.
With Alzheimer's disease, you lose explicit memory, complicated memory, so he would have difficulty recognizing people.
And he did some beautiful paintings when he had fairly advanced Alzheimer's disease.
The other reason memory is so important is there is a number of a diseases that affect memory storage, and we'd like to know how they work so we can try to remedy them.
Kandel: The brain is the most complex object in the universe.
CNN: In 2004, you said that we could have effective memory drugs in two years.
With Alzheimer's disease, I think the understanding is surprisingly good.
By the time they come to us with symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, they've had the disease for 10 years.
Kandel: Well, you know, it's a relative thing.
