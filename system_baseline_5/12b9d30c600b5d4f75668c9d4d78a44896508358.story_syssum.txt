Giglio, Italy (CNN) -- Francesco Schettino, the captain of the ill-fated Costa Concordia cruise liner, wants to get back on the ship.
Defense lawyers for Schettino agreed with lawyers representing more than 200 civil parties against the captain, including Giglio Island and several passenger and environmental advocacy groups, in asking for a new examination of the ship now that it is upright.
According to recordings from the ship's bridge from the vessel's black box, Schettino had directed Rusli Bin to turn "hard to starboard" in English, but Rusli Bin can be heard asking "hard to port?"
Schettino, on the other hand, argues that the back half of the ship would not have hit the rocks at all if the helmsman had understood his directions clearly.
"In that moment, I asked the helmsman to turn the ship left, and he made an error and did not, and instead turned hard to the right," Schettino told the court.
No passengers died on impact.
