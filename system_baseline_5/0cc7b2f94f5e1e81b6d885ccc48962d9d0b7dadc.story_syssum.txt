HOLLYWOOD, California (CNN) -- Director Antoine Fuqua, the force behind films such as "Training Day" and "Shooter," turned his focus to creating CNN's exclusive short film "From MLK to Today," which airs at 7 p.m.
Antoine Fuqua: Because it's Martin Luther King, and because it's Barack Obama's story.
So why wouldn't I be here?
Not in an angry or negative way -- just to know where we come from, so we get a better sense of where we're going, and how to get there, and what not to do.
I don't think you can ever forget Martin Luther King and many other people who sacrificed, whose names we don't even know.
I didn't really know what it meant.
Fuqua: I remember a lot of racism.
Fuqua: Not really.
Fuqua: When I was a little kid, I used to sleep in my grandmother's basement, and I would read magazines, and books and things -- and I would dream of places I would go.
I remember thinking, "Well, if it's just a matter of money to leave my neighborhood, then I have to make money."
It reminded me of my world -- in the sense of being a young kid on the streets, growing up, seeing a lot of provocative images that I was probably too young to see -- and I would express them, and I would do little illustrations or I would paint on a wall.
Fuqua: Never.
You know, you need to have a white movie star in it."
So if Hollywood's not ready to embrace more stories about African-Americans -- and that's based on the money that the movies make -- then would the country really be ready to embrace a president?
CNN: As a director, you have this story about an unbelievable presidential election, where a first-term senator wins.
CNN: In the short film you're directing for us, you've drawn the parallel between Obama and Martin Luther King.
Fuqua: It is the passing of the torch between Martin Luther King and Barack Obama.
But more than anything, I would love people to walk away feeling like we've just begun.
