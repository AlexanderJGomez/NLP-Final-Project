NATO-led forces in Afghanistan and the U.S. military have repeatedly denied targeting civilians.
I'm scared I won't be able to go home.
In a statement released Sunday through the Idaho National Guard, Bergdahl's family said, "We hope and pray for our son's safe return to his comrades and then to our family, and we appreciate all the support and expressions of sympathy shown to us by our family members, our friends and others across the nation.
"As you can see, the American soldier is in good shape and good health, and he is being treated well based on the guidelines of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan regarding war prisoners," said a statement on Islamist Web sites accompanying the video.
The U.S. military said it believed Bergdahl may have been moved to various locations.
They were made available to CNN by U.S.
Days after Bergdahl went missing, a senior U.S. military official said Bergdahl and the Afghan soldiers were captured by low-level militants and then quickly "sold" to the clan and network led by warlord Siraj Haqqani -- believed to be deeply involved in the action.
A source with the U.S. military denied the claim that Bergdahl was drunk.
In the video, Bergdahl says he was captured as he was lagging behind a patrol.
