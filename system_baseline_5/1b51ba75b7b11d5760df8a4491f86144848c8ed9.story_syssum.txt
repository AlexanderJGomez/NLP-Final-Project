Free Syrian Army head Col. Riad al-Asaad, who is not related to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, was injured Sunday during a visit to the eastern province of Deir Ezzor, FSA spokesman Louay Almokdad said.
He is in stable condition after a blast targeted his car, the rebel group's spokesman said.
They are 90% Syrians and the rest may be from other Muslim countries," the rebel leader said in the video.
Al-Asaad also slammed the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, the main opposition alliance whose leadership largely consists of expatriates.
Moaz al-Khatib, the Syrian opposition leader, will be addressing the Arab League summit in Qatar this week "on behalf of the Syrian people," he said on the opposition Syrian National Coalition's Facebook page.
The speech, to be delivered in Doha when the league meets Tuesday and Wednesday, "has nothing to do with the resignation," al-Khatib said.
He wanted to step down, he said, "so I could work with more freedom unavailable to me within the official position of the organization."
