Prosecutors said Phillipos lied to investigators about being in Tsarnaev's college dorm room at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth after the bombing.
It is a crime to lie to law enforcement agents, and that is why Robel Phillipos was charged and why the jury found him guilty today.
"I don't believe that Robel Phillipos has ever been more angry at a person than he was at Dzhokhar Tsarnaev when Robel found out that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev did what he did in this case," Church said after the verdict.
According to court documents, Phillipos hadn't seen or talked to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev for at least two months before the bombing.
The jury found Azamat Tazhayakov guilty of obstructing justice and conspiring to obstruct justice in connection with the removal of a backpack with potential evidence from Tsarnaev's dorm room after the bombings.
Prosecutors said Phillipos repeatedly lied to investigators when he denied that he entered Tsarnaev's dormitory room and saw Kadyrbayev remove a backpack containing fireworks on the evening of April 18, 2013.
On April 18, Phillipos went with Tazhayakov to Tsarnaev's dormitory room, where he and Tazhayakov watched as Kadyrbayev searched through Tsarnaev's belongings and found a backpack containing fireworks.
Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov are both nationals of Kazakhstan who were temporarily living in the United States on student visas while attending the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth.
