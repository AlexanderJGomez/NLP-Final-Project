Jos√© Miguel Vivanco says conviction of Peru's ex-president is a warning to those who deny human rights.
It is one of the first times a nation's own independent courts have convicted a former leader for such serious human rights crimes and it sets an important precedent for a region that suffered so much from political violence and rights violations.
Just 20 years ago, it was exceedingly rare for even the most brutal leaders to be brought to book.
Since then, however, the tide has turned.
The Fujimori case stands out, though, because it was Peru's national court system which demonstrated the will, capacity, and independence to try its former president.
It is likely, however, that yesterday's verdict will help give momentum to efforts currently underway in many Latin American countries to bring other human rights violators to justice.
As Fujimori discovered yesterday, crimes they may be able to get away with while in power can come back to haunt them years later.
