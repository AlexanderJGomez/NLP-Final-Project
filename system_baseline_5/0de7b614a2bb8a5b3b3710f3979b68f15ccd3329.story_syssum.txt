The group accused of being behind the consulate assault, the Imprisoned Omar Abdul Rahman Brigades, is said to be pro-al Qaeda.
"Some groups, such as the Ansar al-Sharia Brigades in Benghazi and Derna and the Imprisoned Omar Abdel Rahman Brigades have been involved in increasing shows of force and outright attacks against Western and other targets in Libya in recent months," he said.
Officials are trying to demobilize and reintegrate the militias and bring these groups into the government security forces, he said.
Violence between warring militias and attacks against Western and moderate Sufi Muslim targets erupted in recent months, Wehrey said.
In Benghazi, there was a "rapid deterioration" of security before the U.S. Consulate attack.
Sufi mosques and tombs were among the sites targeted.
"Salafi militias have reportedly carried out assassinations of Gadhafi-era officials, taken over radio stations and shut down beauty parlors," Wehrey said.
In some cases, Wehrey said, the revolutionary brigades have become "very sophisticated."
Regarding the consulate attack, Wehrey said he thinks the strike "was a much more local affair" than one that involved al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.
Meanwhile, the country's provisional government has had to deputize revolutionary brigades for security work.
"For the citizens of Tripoli, Benghazi and other cities, all this is a stark and tragic reminder of the perennial problems of poor governance and the security vacuum," Wehrey said.
