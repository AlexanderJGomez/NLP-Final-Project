The Log Cabin Republicans had filed an emergency request with the nation's highest court to reverse the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals decision allowing the military to continue with "don't ask, don't tell" while the government appeals a lower court ruling that the law is unconstitutional.
They are likely to tackle the constitutional questions after the appeals court issues its ruling, if Congress or the White House does not act first to repeal the current law.
The appeals court later overturned the district court's injunction.
The appeals judges also noted that legislation pending before Congress to repeal the policy would render the case before them moot.
Gay rights groups say the policy violates the due process and First Amendment rights of military members.
"The military should not be required to suddenly and immediately restructure a major personnel policy that has been in place for years, particularly during a time when the nation is involved in combat operations overseas," the government said in its high court brief.
In response to the court case, Gates recently raised the level at which gay and lesbian troops can be discharged under "don't ask, don't tell" by ordering that it be done only by the secretaries of the Army, Navy and Air Force.
