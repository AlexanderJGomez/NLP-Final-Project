Below are some of the more interesting questions and my answers to them.
Moss: It's more an interest in the number 40.
Moss: One of the interesting things about the relationship between Jesus and John the Baptist is that John doesn't lay down his tools and follow Jesus after he baptizes him.
Moss: I'm so glad someone brought up DNA.
Moss: (These questions are on a similar topic, so I've chosen to answer them together.)
This gives us another -- arguably more historical -- perspective on why John was executed and provides further evidence about just how important John was in his own day.
In the Gospel of Luke, one of Jesus' disciples says, "Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples."
We don't know that the Lord's Prayer came from John, and personally I don't think it did; I think this is just how Luke shaped his version of events.
