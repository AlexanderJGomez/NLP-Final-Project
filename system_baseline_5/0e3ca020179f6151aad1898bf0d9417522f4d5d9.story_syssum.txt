(CNN) -- The commander of Libya's rebel army was killed in Benghazi along with two senior officers on Thursday, rebel leaders announced just hours after claiming big successes on the battlefield.
Younis, a onetime general in Gadhafi's army, told CNN in February that he switched sides after Gadhafi told him he planned to have Benghazi bombed -- a move Younis said would have killed thousands.
Earlier Thursday, the rebels said their forces had captured five towns and surrounded a sixth in the plains below the Nafusa mountain range, which borders Tunisia.
Ibrahim said rebels were now negotiating with Gadhafi troops inside Umm al-Far.
Rebel fighters last month suffered heavy casualties in a failed attempt to wrest control of al-Ghazzaya from forces loyal to Gadhafi.
