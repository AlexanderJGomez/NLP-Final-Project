The lawsuit "may be the first civil lawsuit of its kind on behalf of a child victim of sex trafficking against a buyer of a commercial sex act with that child," the victim's attorney, Gloria Allred, said at a news conference.
Taylor, who has said he was unaware that Fierro was underage when he had sex with her, was sentenced to six years' probation in March and assessed a $2,000 fine.
At the news conference Monday, Fierro said she was dissatisfied with the plea deal Taylor struck with prosecutors last spring.
The lawsuit seeks "compensatory and punitive damages" from Taylor, Allred said, but she declined to specify a dollar amount.
Going after Taylor in the lawsuit might deter would-be buyers of sex from minors from going through with the act, according to Allred.
