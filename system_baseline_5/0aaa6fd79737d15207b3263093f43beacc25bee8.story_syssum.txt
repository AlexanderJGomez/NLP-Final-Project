The car dropped 20 feet, and when it settled, Otto's left foot was trapped.
"It collapsed on car.
Each aftershock lowered the upper deck, bringing it closer to crushing Otto and Frediani.
That was October 17, 1989.
The fault line, known as the Cascadia Subduction Zone, could one day cause an even larger quake.
Oregon is not prepared for a megaquake, and few areas are, Madin says.
It is these factors that led the Oregon Resilience Plan to conclude that in a worst-case scenario, 10,000 people could be killed, and large areas of Oregon could be without transportation, electricity, water and sewer for several months to several years.
Using historic data, scientists like Dr. Chris Goldfinger, a marine geologist and professor at Oregon State University, can forecast the probability of another great quake.
For the south end of the Cascadia, there is roughly a 35-40% probability of having a major quake in the next 50 years.
We also need to strengthen or replace critical facilities like hospitals, fire and police facilities and schools," says Madin.
