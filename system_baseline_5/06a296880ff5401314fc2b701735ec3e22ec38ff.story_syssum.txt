Apps designed to connect like-minded people, both online and in the real world, are being promoted as potentially capable of generating the kinds of billions Facebook may or may not be worth.
Davison, 32, sees this as a powerful way to solve an imperfect social world in which many people try but fail to find the right friends, partners or employees.
Davison won't disclose how many people have signed up for Highlight to date, but our tests in London this week revealed a relatively thin pool of users.
"People freak out, they say it's creepy," he said.
Davison, who is currently expanding Highlight's two-man operation with half a dozen new hires, said he believes users will be won over by the ability to validate peoples' identities via Facebook or other existing social media platforms, and by the limited space in which the data is broadcast.
We think about it all the time and we want to be a simple product that people love.
While some may doubt Highlight's ability to persuade a mass-market audience to share with strangers, Davison's goals aren't without precedent -- largely thanks to a trail blazed by similar app Badoo.
Yet, said Ling, it recognizes that people are clearly willing to take a leap into the unknown.
"The social friction increases.
Users only share the information they want to share," Ling said.
And, said Ling, he is confident the space will grow as society opens up to the possibilities of sharing with strangers.
