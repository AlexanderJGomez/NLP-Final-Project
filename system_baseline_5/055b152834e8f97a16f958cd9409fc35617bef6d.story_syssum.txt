Before Wednesday, people outside of the Secret Service weren't familiar with Joe Clancy when President Obama appointed him to be the interim head of the agency.
One likely knock on Clancy that has been mentioned since his temporary appointment is that he was in charge of PPD at the time of the infamous Salahi gate crashing incident in 2009.
There was some talk of Clancy coming back when Sullivan left and before Julia Pierson was appointed, for either the number one or number two job, but he preferred to stay in the private sector at the time.
But now that Pierson is gone, agency veterans are thrilled Clancy agreed to come back.
