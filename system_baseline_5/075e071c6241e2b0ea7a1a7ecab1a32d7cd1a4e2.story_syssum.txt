Limassol, Cyprus (CNN) -- Cyprus is known for its sunshine, its ancient ruins and its delicious halloumi cheese, but one thing that is less well known is that it is also home to the oldest named wine in the world.
According to legend, King Richard the Lionheart of England was so taken with commandaria that at his wedding he pronounced it "the wine of kings and the king of wines."
In the coastal town of Limassol, on the sunny southern coast of Cyprus, the most popular brand of commandaria -- KEO St. John -- is produced to a recipe that is now protected by a legally enforced appellation, the only one held by Cyprus.
Some believe that Cyprus may have been the site of the earliest wine harvests in Europe, stretching back 5,000 years.
But when Lefteris talks of Cypriot wine, he speaks of "Nama", the more ancient name for what the crusading knights of the 13th century came to call commandaria.
Throughout his career, Mohianakis has worked in wineries around the world, and in his view, Cyprus is unique in its ability to grow sweet wine.
It is the sun and the soil.
I am just trying to give the vines the opportunity to express themselves through my wine."
