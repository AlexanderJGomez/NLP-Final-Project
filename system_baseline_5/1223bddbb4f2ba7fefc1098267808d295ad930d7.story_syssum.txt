She hopes to be back on Leno's show in a few years with an Oscar, Lohan said.
The 13 days she spent in a Los Angeles jail last summer "was an interesting experience and it was definitely a wake-up call," Lohan said.
Lohan said she was "kind of numb" when Sautner sentenced her to 120 days in jail and 480 hours of community service.
She blamed her youth on her bad choices.
"Hopefully, sitting here after winning an Oscar," Lohan said.
