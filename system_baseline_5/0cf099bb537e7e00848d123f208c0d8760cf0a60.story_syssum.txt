By 2050, 54 percent of the population will be minorities.
"Part of it is a higher fertility rate for some of the minority groups, Hispanics in particular," said Dave Waddington, chief of the Census Bureau's population projection branch, which issued the report.
It is projected to nearly triple, from 46.7 million to 132.8 million, from 2008 through 2050, the bureau said.
The African-American population is projected to increase from 41.1 million to 65.7 million by 2050, going from 14 percent of the U.S. population to 15 percent.
Whites will comprise 46 percent of the U.S. population by 2050, down from the current level of 66 percent, the bureau said, as the group is projected to lose population in the 2030s and 2040s.
Meanwhile, the number of those age 85 and older is expected to more than triple, from 5.4 million in 2008 to 19 million by 2050.
By 2050, the population is expected to be 439 million.
• By 2050, 62 percent of the nation's children will be minorities, up from 44 percent today.
• The percentage of the U.S. population between the ages of 18 and 64 -- the "working age" population -- is projected to decrease to 57 percent in 2050 from 63 percent in 2008.
The nation's undocumented workers -- estimated at 12 million or more -- are included in the projections, Waddington said.
