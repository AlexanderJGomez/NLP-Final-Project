Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad lashed out at President Obama on Thursday.
Unofficial reports suggest the number is much higher.
Obama wrote secretly to Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, before the election, Iranian sources confirmed Wednesday.
Ahmadinejad said Thursday that even 5- and 6-year-olds would not allow insults to the Iranian nation, telling Obama: "We hope that you will avoid interfering in Iran's affairs and somehow express your regret so that the Iranian nation can become aware of your regret.
If there is real change, the Iranian nation will welcome it."
