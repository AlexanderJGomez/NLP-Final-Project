Anthony has pleaded not guilty and denies harming her daughter or having anything to do with her disappearance.

George Anthony testified Thursday that he owns several shovels.
In his earlier testimony, George Anthony denied ever sexually abusing his daughter or that he found Caylee dead in his pool.
