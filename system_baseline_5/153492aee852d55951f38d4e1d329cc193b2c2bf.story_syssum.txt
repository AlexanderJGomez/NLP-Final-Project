In the short term, Vice President Nicolas Maduro will take over as president of Venezuela until an election is held.
Maduro, 50, has long been a high-profile face in Chavez's administration.
Though Chavez has held a tight grip on his presidency for 14 years, there is an opposition movement in Venezuela.
Chavez, for years had a stormy relationship with the U.S., and would stir up nationalistic sentiment and popularity by picking fights with the "imperialist" United States and its allies.
The United States will stay out of the upcoming election, an Obama administration official said.
The U.S. may seek Venezuela's help in imposing sanctions on Iran for its nuclear program, senior American officials said.
Venezuela remains the fourth-biggest oil supplier to the U.S. market.
Chavez will be buried after the ceremony but officials have not said where.
Carlos Quijada said he fled Venezuela 10 years ago as a teen because there was no future there.
And I will not hide the fact that I am happy that he is no longer alive," he said.
