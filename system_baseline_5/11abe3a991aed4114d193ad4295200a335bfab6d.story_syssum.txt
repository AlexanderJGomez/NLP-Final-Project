Laurent Akoun, general secretary of the Front Populaire Ivoirien, Ivory Coast's former ruling party, was arrested on Sunday in Adzope, 100 kilometers east of Abidjan, the nation's economic capital and most populous city, party officials said.
Akoun, the current deputy chief of the party, was heading to a party rally when the nation's gendarmerie -- a paramilitary force -- arrested him and transferred him to Abidjan, said Augustin Guehoun, the head of communication for the party.
Ivory Coast's authorities say Gbagbo's supporters are behind the attacks, intended to destabilize the West African country, which is recovering from a five-month post-election crisis that killed more than 3,000 people last year.
He said the reasons for the recent attacks have to be investigated in light of the failing process of disarmament and reassimilation of former fighters.
Alphonse Douati, a senior member of the party and former Cabinet minister in Gbagbo's administration, was arrested last Tuesday and has been charged with harming state security.
Ivory Coast's government issued international arrest warrants last year against two dozen military and political officials loyal to Gbagbo, including Katinan, who is accused of economic crimes.
