The classic Shakespearean drama "Hamlet" is scheduled for a performance in North Korea in September 2015 by the Globe Theatre as part of a two-year tour to perform in every country.
In every country, we are going for one single and simple purpose: to play Hamlet there," a statement released by the London-based theater said.
The theater group is not the first to get blasted by human rights groups for performing in North Korea.
"Kim Jong Un is no Hamlet.
Sadly he shows no sign of wrestling with his conscience."
