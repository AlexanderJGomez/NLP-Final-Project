At a New York press conference, the company also introduced Nintendo TVii, a free TV and movie service that utilizes the Wii U's handheld controller, with its built-in screen, as a remote control and tablet-of-sorts for additional content.

"Loyal Nintendo fans will snatch this up like crazy," he said.
