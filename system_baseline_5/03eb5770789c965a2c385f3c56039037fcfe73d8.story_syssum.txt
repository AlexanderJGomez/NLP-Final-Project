Tamir, 12, was fatally shot in November by a Cleveland police officer, while police shot and killed John Crawford III, 22, in a Walmart in Beavercreek, Ohio, in August.
"The Cleveland Police protect and serve Browns stadium," he said.
Tamir was pointing a pellet gun at people outside a recreation center before he was shot, police said.
In the eyes of a Cleveland police officer his physical appearance exceeded Andrew Hawkins' profile," Follmer said.
Crawford was shot and killed by police at a Walmart in Beavercreek on August 5 while carrying an air rifle through the store.
The St. Louis Police Officers Association said it was "profoundly disappointed" after five Rams players raised their hands before a November 30 game in solidarity with protesters upset about Brown's death.
