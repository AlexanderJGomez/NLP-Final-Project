Just 12 months ago, Murray stood on Centre Court and cried.
"It feels slightly different to last year," Murray told fans on Centre Court.
That defeat in the final to Roger Federer was a turning point -- not just in Murray's career, but in his relationship with British tennis fans.
A straight sets victory over World No.1 Djokovic is an astonishing achievement -- more so given the level of pressure heaped on Murray around this time of year.
But whereas last year he had yet to win a grand slam tournament before taking on Roger Federer in last year's final, that is no longer the case.
His dramatic five set win over Djokovic at the U.S. Open last September came on the back of his Olympic triumph and gave him the belief he belonged at the very top.
After taking the first set 6-4, Murray was forced to show the kind of resilience which he has become so well known for.
With just one set separating him from sporting immortality, Murray began in fine style, breaking Djokovic to take a 2-0 lead.
But Murray has never been one for making life easy for himself -- nor for his fans who held their collective breath.
Djokovic staved off three Championship points before having the audacity to force Murray to save three break points.
The rocky road to love might have been a long one but this love affair between Murray and the British public could be just beginning.
