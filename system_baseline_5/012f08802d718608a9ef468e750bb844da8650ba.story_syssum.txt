Robin Givens told Joy Behar Tuesday night that details of domestic abuse are often the same.
...
Givens: Yes, it does.
...
Givens:  I've spoken to women every[where].
And a woman came up to me and she said I wanted you to stop talking because I felt like everybody would know that you were talking about me.
Givens: I was hit for the first time before I was married.
Givens: Yes.
...
Givens: Yes.
...
...
Givens: Well, I was so numb.
...
...
Givens: Yes.
Behar: One of the most influential women in the world used her considerable power to speak up about domestic abuse.
...
...
How are you?
And it is.
...
Givens: Um-hmm.
Givens: She's absolutely right.
Givens: I don't know why that is.
Givens: The one thing I'd like to say to Rihanna, actually; as difficult as this all is, she does not have to answer to the media.
Behar: Thank you all very much.
