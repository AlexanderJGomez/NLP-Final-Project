White evangelical Protestants were the religious group most likely to say torture is often or sometimes justified -- more than six in 10 supported it.
The analysis is based on a Pew Research Center survey of 742 American adults conducted April 14-21.
Just over three in 10 of them said torture is never justified.
A quarter of the religiously unaffiliated said the same, compared with two in 10 white non-Hispanic Catholics and one in eight evangelicals.
