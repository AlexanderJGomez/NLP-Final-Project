Organizers said some 60,000 protesters turned out for a Saturday night rally and police tried to block them from joining other protesters that are part of a sit-in outside government headquarters.
Hong Kong authorities said 34 people had been treated in hospital for injuries suffered in the protests.
Amnesty International issued a statement Sunday calling for the release of the activists and condemned violence against protesters Friday night, when police used pepper spray.
"The future of Hong Kong is ours," said 16-year-old student Phoebe Leung.
