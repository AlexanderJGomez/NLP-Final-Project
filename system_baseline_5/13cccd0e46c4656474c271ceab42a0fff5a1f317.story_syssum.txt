(CNN) -- Notes left behind by film director Tony Scott did not provide a motive for why he may have taken a suicidal plunge Sunday, a Los Angeles County coroner's spokesman said Friday.
Scott, 68, wrote two notes before his death, including a message left in his Los Angeles office that was apparently for family members, a coroner official said this week.
"I did talk to the family ... and according to his wife, he did not have brain cancer as reported, and (she) does not know who told ABC that information, which is absolutely false," Winter said.
Tony Scott became a household name in 1986 as director of the mega-hit "Top Gun," starring Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis.
My deepest sorrow and thoughts are with his family at this time," Cruise said.
Murphy described Scott as a "wonderful collaborator" and said he will be missed.
In one post, he said there hasn't been a day since the movie was released in 1993 that someone doesn't tell him how much they loved the film.
They had twin sons.
"Tony Scott as a friend and a mentor was irreplaceable.
RIP," director and producer Joe Carnahan said on Twitter.
"For me, it was the most challenging movie of my life, and the most dangerous because I'm shooting 90 percent of the movie on a train that is running between 50 and 70 mph," Scott said at the time.
"So very, very sorry to hear of the death of Tony Scott," actress Martha Plimpton, who appeared in "The Good Wife," said via Twitter.
