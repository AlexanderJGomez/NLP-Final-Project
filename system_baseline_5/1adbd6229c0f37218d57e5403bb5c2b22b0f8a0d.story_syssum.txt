Thulani Madondo: It means we can continue to grow as an organization, and it has helped us educate people about the life that we live here.
Madondo: KYP people heard me shouting, and they wanted to know what was happening.
They went straight to the computers to double-check.
We believe that is very important, so our team can also grow with the organization.
Madondo: The most important thing that I would like people to know about KYP is that it is an organization that is community-needs driven, and it is led by the youth of Kliptown that want to break the poverty cycle that has existed for many decades.
