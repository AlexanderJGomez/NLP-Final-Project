Bamako, Mali (CNN) -- Islamists in control of northern Mali said they forced a man and a woman into two holes and stoned them to death for committing adultery in the lawless region.
A leader of a radical Islamic group in the region said Sharia law condemns relationships outside marriage.
The two groups now control two-thirds of northern Mali, an area the size of Texas that includes the towns of Gao, Kidal and Timbuktu.
Most residents in the area are Muslims, but have protested against the strict form of Sharia as Islamists remain determined to apply it.
In addition to the killing, Islamist militants have gone on a rampage for months, destroying sacred tombs in the region and vowing to target more.
Sufism is a mystical dimension of Islam considered offbeat and frowned upon by Islamic hardliners.
