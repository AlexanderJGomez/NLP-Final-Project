Brawley is the chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, a world-renowned cancer expert and practicing oncologist.
It's a scenario that may happen more as science reveals cancer's secrets, the biggest one being that what we now call cancer maybe shouldn't be called cancer at all.
To understand fully, you have to look at the history of cancer diagnosis, Brawley says.
The problem, Brawley says, is that they're still comparing the samples to the cancer definition that was created more than 150 years ago.
There is a growing consensus, backed by mounting scientific evidence, that Americans tend to be overtested, overdiagnosed and overtreated across a variety of conditions.
There may also be perverse economic incentives at play -- that is, in a fee-for-service system, doctors are compensated for the quantity of tests and procedures they order.
Energized by public awareness cancer campaigns, many patients have been empowered to find cancer early through screening and to intervene as soon as possible, Welch observes.
It's an issue many people have difficulty wrapping their heads around: Some patients who are diagnosed with cancer do not need to be treated, because that cancer is never going to bother them.
Doctors know that approximately 10% of localized lung cancer tumors and 20% to 30% of localized breast cancer tumors that are found through screening would never cause harm, Brawley says.
The rate is even higher for prostate cancer at 60%.
For example, if a woman is told that her mammogram is abnormal, that diagnosis might be straightened out days or weeks later, and she might find out that she does not have cancer.
"We've been taught that cancer is a terrible thing and the way to deal with it always is to find it early and cut it out," Brawley said.
"We're starting to realize that that is not true in all cases."
