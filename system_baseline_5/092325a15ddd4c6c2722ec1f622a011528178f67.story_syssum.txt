But Butler's daughter is one of thousands on waiting lists for the 49,000 Head Start classrooms around the country - a list that might get shorter after an investigation into allegations of fraud by some applicants and Head Start workers.
A U.S. Government Accountability Office investigation that concluded in May showed that several Head Start workers committed fraud to enroll families whose incomes were above the federally mandated limit.
A 10-year study released in 2010 by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services showed that Head Start kids are better prepared academically and socially to enter kindergarten.
Parenting skills improved, too, among those whose kids were in Head Start, according to the HHS study.
The investigators' documents showed they made too much money to enroll, but at eight of the 15 Head Start centers they approached, staff members pretended they hadn't seen the income levels, or they urged parents to lie.
The problem, Kutz said, is that Head Start workers only have to sign a statement that they've seen proof of parents' incomes.
Not all Head Start programs have been letting the income rules slide.
"We know the majority of Head Start programs across the country are doing the right thing."
"We will make sure that when we go out to see these local programs, that they are indeed doing the right things and that every federal dollar that goes to Head Start is not being misused."
Demand for Head Start remains strong, even in programs where there's no suspicion of fraud.
