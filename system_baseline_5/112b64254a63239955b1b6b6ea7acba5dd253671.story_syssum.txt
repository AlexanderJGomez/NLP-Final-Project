Young Benoit dreamed of wrestling like the Dynamite Kid, whose real name is Tom Billington.
When asked about Benoit's double murder-suicide, Billington told CNN, "It can make you aggressive, the steroids.
And from the steroids, he said.
McMahon, appearing with Linda McMahon, his wife and WWE CEO, told CNN: "Nothing from the WWE, under any set of circumstances had anything to do with Chris Benoit murdering his family.
"Our policy stacks up just as well as anyone else's in sport, although again emphasizing we are entertainment, and no one in entertainment, no one has this kind of wellness policy," McMahon said.
When asked about the high number of former wrestlers who had died before they turned 50 years old, Vince McMahon said each person in the WWE bore responsibility for their own lives -- especially outside the arena.
The McMahons said the WWE is taking steps toward improving its oversight of its athletes.
David Black -- who helped the NFL develop its drug program and now runs tests for the WWE -- says twice that number have tested positive and been given a warning.
The first is a "baseline" test, according to the WWE.
McMahon denies that his wrestlers are pushed to use steroids.
It's your face, it's what you do with it," he said.
