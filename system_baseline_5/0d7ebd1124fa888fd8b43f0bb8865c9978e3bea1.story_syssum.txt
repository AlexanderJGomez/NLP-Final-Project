"So?"
"I'm still not eating it."
It's no wonder each person in the Western world (where we have so much choice about what to eat) probably defines "edible" in a slightly different way.
She can eat omelets and scrambled eggs.
No one starts out life with an aversion to eggs or tongue-- or, for that matter, to liver, okra, lima beans, or any of the dozens of other foods many people come to revile as adults.
That's it.
He admits that we generally grow to dislike foods that remind us of our bodily functions, guts, or mortality -- which might explain why liver (and other mealy, pasty foods) and oysters (and other squishy, slimy foods) put off so many people.
As Capaldi says, "The disgust mechanism is a very, very powerful thing.
Any revulsion you feel toward a food is magnified by the thought that it will become part of you.
History is full of stories of ordinary people who refused to eat unfamiliar food.
Why?
We constantly add new things -- goji berries, lemongrass, Splenda -- and reject others -- chicken nuggets, say, after seeing Food, Inc. "You can think yourself into an aversion," says Capaldi.
"In China, the sensation of a thing in your mouth is part of the pleasure of eating it," says Fuchsia.
Take "thousand-year-old eggs," made by submerging raw duck eggs for three months in a brew of ash, lime, tea, and salt.
I can't say how I'd react if served a thousand-year-old-egg, but, like Fuchsia, I see aversions as obstacles worth fighting to overcome.
Much as I'd like to coerce my husband into eating delicious, slow-cooked beef tongue, I have to accept that only he can decide what to him is delicious, and what remains banished forever to the land of utter yuck.
