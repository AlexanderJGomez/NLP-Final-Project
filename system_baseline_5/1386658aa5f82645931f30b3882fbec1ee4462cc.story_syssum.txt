(CNN) -- If body language is a good gauge of political standing, Li Keqiang is looking very much like China's premier-in-waiting.
As the current executive vice premier, Li already oversees important portfolios, such macro economic planning, health care, energy and housing.
When he visited Hong Kong University last year, he delivered part of his speech in English -- a gesture that prompted debate in the mainland.
The son of a minor county official in Anhui, a poor province where Hu was also born, Li was a teenager when the decade-long Cultural Revolution interrupted his schooling.
"Like everyone in our generation Li Keqiang was keen for new ideas," recalls Yang Baihui, an international politics major.
Li did not stand for elections -- he happened to have an off-campus internship -- but as chairman of the student federation he spent time with politically active students like Wang Juntao, who campaigned but failed to get a seat.
After graduation, Li decided to work for the Communist Youth League (CYL), a training ground for party and government officials.
Li rose through the ranks of CYL while completing a master's degree in law and then an economics doctorate under Li Yining, the guru of market reforms in China.
In 1998, Li at 43 became Henan's provincial governor, the youngest in China.
Like his mentor Hu, Li has risen to his high position more by avoiding big mistakes than through bold ideas and major accomplishments.
Chinese microblogger "Yudafengxue" tweeted: "Li is a better speaker than many Chinese top leaders but still needs to work on his stage presentation and body language.
