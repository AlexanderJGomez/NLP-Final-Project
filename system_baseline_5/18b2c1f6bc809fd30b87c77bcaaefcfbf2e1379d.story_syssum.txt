Somer Thompson, 7, went missing Monday on her way home from school.
You don't take from somebody.
The body of her daughter, 7-year-old Somer Thompson, was found in a south Georgia landfill, Clay County, Florida, Sheriff Rick Beseler said Thursday morning.
Police have no suspects, she said.
The sister said she lost sight of Somer in a group of other kids leaving the school, according to the police report.
The landfill where her body was found is near Folkston, Georgia, 55 miles north of where the girl became separated from her schoolmates on her way home from school in Orange Park on Monday.
Thompson, he said, was devastated.
"There is a child killer on the loose," the sheriff said.
