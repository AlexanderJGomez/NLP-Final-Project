NEW YORK (CNN) -- Richard Serra stands in the Museum of Modern Art's Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden, his hair as white as the marble floor.
So as you walk out of one, you're not thinking about the other."
For a long moment, Serra takes in his own work.
Serra smiles.
Until then, MoMA's new exhibition, "Richard Serra Sculpture: Forty Years," reveals that sense of humor along with the sophisticated spatial concepts the Californian explains as he leads you, glad for your interest, across a terrain all his.
For all the grainy computation of geometric and gravitational considerations required to set hundreds of tons at precise tilts over the heads of the thousands moving through MoMA each day, Serra clearly is still seized by the wonder of his own creations.
This was all done with the express idea of putting capacious new Serra works on view.
Senior Deputy Director of Exhibitions Jennifer Russell says Serra used the size constraints of that breakaway wall in determining the height of the new pieces.
Visitors may understand these three new works as something akin to steel mazes.
Serra says that "Band," more than 71 feet long, is likeliest to spur his next work.

"I think welding is a form of stitching," Serra says.
"There was a need for me to get back to the process in relation to dealing with matter," says Serra, who is very clear on the point that his work is not Minimalist.
In something like the way the stages of Serra's career have evolved, the sixth floor and garden somehow prepare you for the second floor's majestic march of new, eerie, defining works.
"It seems very weightless," Serra says, recalling the three weeks it took just to get the sculptures assembled on this vast plain that gathers in, at last, so many years of search, discovery and risk-taking.
"There's a redundancy in this piece," he says of the new "Band," happily intrigued.
