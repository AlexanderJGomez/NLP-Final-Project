New York (CNN) -- Jorge Munoz is a bus driver in New York City who started feeding the hungry in Queens five years ago, using food that would otherwise have been thrown away.
Jorge Munoz: In the beginning it was to try to avoid wasting food in the garbage.
But it was good food and I asked them about it, if they could give it to me because I knew someone would want it.
So I called my mom and I said I had people to give the food to.
What do you provide for people?
But every day we make 120 to 140 meals.
Munoz: Because I have a family at my house and I have a second family out there.
At least we provide a little something, and the only thing we ask in return is a smile.
Munoz: To become a CNN Hero, being nominated, it's a great honor for me, for my family and for my country [Colombia].
I'm with them and they're helping me out.
Munoz: That was a great honor.
Munoz: If you share, share anything you have you're not using like clothes, toys, share it to make other people happy.
People in this country cook more than they need and two days later it goes from the refrigerator to the garbage.
Imagine if they helped once in a while, you'd see a lot of change.
So share, it's a beautiful thing.
