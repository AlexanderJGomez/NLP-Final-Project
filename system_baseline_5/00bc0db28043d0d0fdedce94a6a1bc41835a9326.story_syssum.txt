(CNN) -- The inaugural addresses of the presidents are, for the most part, a wasteland of howling rhetoric and dried-out inspiration.
After that ...
Writing a great inaugural speech must be very hard, since even many strong and important presidents failed to do it.
They fail, first, because the grandeur of the occasion inspires new presidents and their teams to overblown rhetoric, even as their political advisers steer them away from too specific commitments.
Good writing can never come from bad thinking.
Inaugural addresses can fail even when the ideas are clear, even when the writing is fine, if the addresses make commitments that the ensuing presidency cannot deliver.
"It has surrendered to their own guardianship the manhood of more than 5,000,000 people, and has opened to each one of them a career of freedom and usefulness.
Between Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson, no president expressed a stronger personal commitment to equal rights for black Americans than Garfield in 1881.
Even had Garfield served a full term, his efforts would almost certainly have failed.
An inaugural address is a plan for what is to come.
But even if the ideas are clear and the words crisp, an inaugural address can be deemed "great" only if it is followed by actions that make good on its lofty words.
This is why we still remember the mighty words of Lincoln and FDR and why we forget almost all the others.
