Todd Nicely screamed twice at the top of his lungs.
If you do that you'll make it back to your wife," he said recently by phone.
What Nicely, who had stepped on the pressure plate of a roadside bomb, didn't realize at the time was that he had lost more than his legs.
"When you are out on the battlefield, you don't realize how many amputees there are because you are not there and you don't see them," Nicely said.

"Despite the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs' best efforts, oftentimes the transition feels like you've been thrown off a cliff," said Jonathan Pruden, who as an Army captain lost a leg in Iraq in 2003 and now works for the Wounded Warrior Project.
"We know that we've been at war because of what happened on 9/11, so we knew that we had to take care of our military," Siller said.
The Tunnel to Towers Foundation has agreed to build homes for the other quadruple amputees and -- it hopes -- for triple amputees.
Nicely said his new home, being built in Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri, will lift a big burden.
"There are certain presumptive conditions for veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan that may pop up in one year or five," Jirak said.
Pruden, the former Army captain who is an alumni manager for the Wounded Warrior Project, is concerned that as wars end, Department of Defense funds for the severely wounded will dry up and the VA will struggle to fill the void.
Nicely, who now walks with prosthetic legs, plans to go back to college soon, after he and his wife, Crystal, move into their new home.
"There's life after the hospital bed," he said.
