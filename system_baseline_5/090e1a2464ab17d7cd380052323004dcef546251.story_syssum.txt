French military sources had earlier said that Abdelhamid Abou Zeid, a deputy leader of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, was killed in an airstrike in Mali late last month.
Military sources quoted by French media say that in the past few days, Abou Zeid and a substantial number of his fighters were killed during a French bombardment near Aguelhok in northern Mali.
According to analysts, it is an area that Abou Zeid was intimately familiar with, as for years it was his main base of operations before Islamists took over much of northern Mali.
Abou Zeid had been promoted by the emir of AQIM -- and fellow Algerian -- Abdelmalek Droukdel.
One of the few Westerners to have encountered Abou Zeid was a French citizen, Pierre Camatte, who was abducted from a hotel in northern Mali in November 2009.
Analysts tell CNN that despite their rivarly, the two men found ways to coexist.
Abou Zeid made several trips to Libya in 2011, according to one source familiar with intelligence from the area.
Abou Zeid's death casts further uncertainty over the fate of the French hostages his group is still believed to hold.
If Abou Zeid was indeed killed, the expectation is his group will retaliate.
