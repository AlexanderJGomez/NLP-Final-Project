(CNN) -- Theodore Wafer said he was sorry from the bottom of his heart Wednesday for gunning down an unarmed young woman on the front porch of his Michigan home, but a judge said "mistake" was the wrong word to describe a murder and sentenced him to 15 to 30 years in prison.
Hathaway said it was one of the "saddest cases" she had ever presided over.
Hathaway said she was confident Wafer was remorseful and would likely never commit another crime in his life, but that McBride came to his doorstep seeking help and lost her life.
McBride's sister, Jasmine, said: "Losing my sister was one of the most devastating times of my life.
I didn't want to be a victim in my own house," he said.
After the incident, Wafer told police he was angry and "full of piss and vinegar" when he opened the door that night, according to prosecutors.
