The four underwater signals that search teams detected are still "the most promising lead" investigators have in the search for the Boeing 777, Angus Houston told CNN's Anna Coren on Monday.
Houston told CNN the hunt for the plane is even more difficult than that for Air France Flight 447, which disappeared in the Atlantic Ocean in 2009.
"Without that, we would be essentially searching the whole of the Indian Ocean, and I think the chances of finding the aircraft in those circumstances would have been slim," Houston said.
"I think some of the commentary about what the Malaysians have done, I don't think is as fair and objective as it might have been," Houston said.
Houston said he understands why many families are frustrated by the lack of information.
"I think that's something that we, as a world community, have to correct as soon as possible," Houston said.
"This service is being offered to all 11,000 commercial passenger aircraft, which are already equipped with an Inmarsat satellite connection," the company said in a statement.
