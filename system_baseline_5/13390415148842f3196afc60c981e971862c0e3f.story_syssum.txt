Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The failed computer system that caused flight delays across the country has been restored, the Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday.
"Air traffic controllers are without electronic decision-making tools and cannot keep up with the sheer numbers of flights -- resulting in delays," the controllers' group said in a statement during the outage.
AirTran Airways spokesman Christopher White said the airline had canceled 22 flights around the country as of 8 a.m.
"We will be a mess all day," he said.
The longest delays have been a little more than an hour, but no flights have been canceled, and some might be consolidated, he said.
All passengers are encouraged to contact the airlines regarding the statuses of their flights before they head to the airport," the airport said.
The air traffic controllers said "weather equipment was affected" and information such as winds speeds was not "processing."
