Global media tycoon Rupert Murdoch spent hours Wednesday downplaying his political influence, even as British Prime Minister David Cameron said politicians in his country had been too close to Murdoch over the years.
Meanwhile, Rupert Murdoch was having a bitter falling out with then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown, the elder Murdoch said Wednesday.
On Tuesday, Leveson Inquiry lawyer Robert Jay pressed James Murdoch over the extent of his contact with politicians as the company moved to take full ownership of satellite broadcaster BSkyB.
James Murdoch insisted before the Leveson Inquiry Tuesday that he knew little about the scale of phone hacking by people working for the News of the World, as he continued his fight to limit the damage the scandal does to him and his family's media empire.
James and Rupert Murdoch have been hammered over the past year about what they knew about phone hacking by people working for them.
Former Murdoch employees testified earlier that they told him about the problem.
In addition to the Leveson Inquiry and London's Metropolitan Police, two parliamentary committees also are looking into media conduct.
