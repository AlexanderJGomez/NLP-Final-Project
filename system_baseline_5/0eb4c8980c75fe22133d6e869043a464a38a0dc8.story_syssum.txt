Two recent studies suggest that sexting is more common than many parents might realize or want to admit.
Another study, this one by the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, found that while students who admitted sexting were 32% more likely to report having sex the next year, sexting by teenagers was not linked to risky sexual behavior over time.
"They had no idea what the consequences were," said Graber, co-founder of CyberWise.org, a digital literacy site for parents, educators, and tweens and teens.
She now plans to make it part of her "cybercivics" curriculum, and believes parents and educators need to be talking to kids at even younger ages about sexting.
"If you want to convince somebody that something is a danger, you have to convince them that you know what you're talking about, " said Englander.
It's not that I'm saying we shouldn't teach kids that child pornography is a crime.
Englander said what she is most troubled by is not how widespread sexting might be but how teens feel after they sext, especially if they felt pressured to do it.
"If parents aren't having this conversation, their kids could be going through some tremendous pressure."
Those are the only two choices," said Englander.
What do you think is the best way to talk to teens about sexting?
