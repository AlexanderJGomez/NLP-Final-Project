(CNN) -- Public executions, death by starvation and torture are common in North Korean political prisoner camps, according to testimony given to human rights group Amnesty International.
The report says tens of thousands are believed to be held at one camp simply because one of their relatives has been sent to a camp.
One former inmate told Amnesty how he and his father were forced to witness the public execution of his mother and brother, while a former prison guard detailed how inmates would eat snakes, rats and pig feed.
A young boy ended up in one of these camps because his grandfather had expressed political dissent.
The North Korean government -- which has denied the existence of mass political prison camps -- has not publicly commented on the report's findings.
