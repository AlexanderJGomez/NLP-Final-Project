Westchester County Police said the women wearing the hijab, a traditional Muslim headscarf, became argumentative when park employees enforced the no-headgear policy and men sprang to their defense.
People -- patrons -- are not allowed to wear headgear on rides for safety reasons," Gleason said.
Ramadan said the women felt they had been targeted by park employees because of their religious views.
Ramadan said that's when the crowd got very angry.
He said park officials told the Muslim organizers about the headgear ban but that information wasn't relayed to the group of visitors.
"We repeatedly told him, because we knew this group would have religious headgear," Tartaglia insisted adding that a refund booth was set up in case anyone objected to the policy, which he said is posted prominently in the park.
Rye Playland, also known as Playland Amusement Park, is located about 17 miles northeast of the Bronx in Westchester County.
