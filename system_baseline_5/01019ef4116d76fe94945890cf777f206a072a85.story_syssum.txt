"The evidence demonstrates that Justice Barbaro applied considerable effort in his deliberations and issued a written decision," Simpson said in the decision.
Barbaro, now 86, said in an exclusive interview with CNN this year, "I couldn't get out of my mind the look on the lawyer's face when I said I found him guilty.
Judge Simpson didn't give any credence to the fact that I said I made a mistake, and that's very disappointing.
Kagan's lawyer, Richard Mischel, said he plans to appeal Simpson's decision.
