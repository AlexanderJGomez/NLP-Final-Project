Naturally, California has many such hotels, but movie star hotels are scattered all over the world.
Over its long history, the Victorian hotel, noted for its wraparound porches (highlighted in the film where rows of men wait to watch for Monroe's character, Sugar, to return to the hotel), has been the site of many films, including 1915's "Pearl of the Pacific" and 1924's "My Husband's Wives."
It turns out the hotel is haunted, driving the father (Nicholson's character, Jack Torrance) insane.
The hotel was used in 1994's "Dumb and Dumber" and called Hotel Danbury.
The hotel went through a similar renewal, with a $25 million renovation completed in 2012 that included a new restaurant, bar and guest rooms.
Another Beverly Hills hotel featured in movies is the Beverly Wilshire, just around the corner from Rodeo Drive.
The hotel is so associated with the film that many Los Angelenos simply point it out as the "Pretty Woman" hotel.
The movie uses the hotel's rooms and views beautifully, with vistas of the verdant landscape and beach.
As a British Naval Intelligence officer, young Fleming rubbed elbows with some of those colorful characters at the hotel.
While many remember dramatic Swiss Alps ski scenes with machine guns setting off avalanches, "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" opens on the beaches of Portugal, with James Bond staying at the Hotel Palacio overlooking the Bay of Cascais.
