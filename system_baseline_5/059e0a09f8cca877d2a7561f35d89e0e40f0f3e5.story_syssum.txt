With officials seeking possible motives for the men who stand accused of the Boston marathon bombings, a picture is emerging from those who should have known Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, and his brother, 19-year-old Dzhokar, best -- their family members.
"...
"Someone framed them," Anzor Tsarnaev said while the manhunt was being conducted.
He said he had spoken with his sons on Thursday and they told him, "Everything is good, Daddy.
"My kids never did anything -- that's it," he said.
After the death of Tamerlan and as authorities continued to hunt his younger brother, their uncle Ruslan Tsarni spoke passionately at a news conference Friday outside his Montgomery County, Maryland, home.
"(The acquaintance) said there is someone who brainwashed him, some new convert to Islam,'' Tsarni said.
"If somebody wants to convince me, show me evidence," she said, telling reporters Friday she is studying to become a lawyer.
At times seeming almost combative during a press conference, she said it would take much more than photos to convince her that her nephews had committed such a crime.
In the aftermath of the Patriots' Day horror, we know that we never really knew Tamerlane Tsarnaev.
