The 15-year-old is preparing for her quinceañera, a coming-of-age ritual in Latin culture, marking a young girl's entrance into womanhood.
Jenny and her mother, Marlene Ferro, have worked out every detail of the party well in advance, from the rehearsal to the reception to the flower girl and the music.
It cost about $800.
It doesn't have to be celebrated with a party at all, but it is generally marked by something quite special," Salcedo says.
"It has gone beyond Latinos, so that a lot of Latino girls will have not only family members in court but they will reach out to non-Latino friends," says Salcedo.
Family plays the largest role in the quinceañera, leading up to and during the party.
"Sometimes people go way overboard and [spend] much more on the celebration than they can afford and that's the downside of the quinceañera," says Salcedo.
"Because when it's done right it can be a beautiful family celebration and a celebration of a milestone that a young girl goes through."
"My dress was really easy ...
There's a spiritual element to these celebrations as well, says Salcedo.
I'm throwing this party for my daughter and I'm inviting all of you to partake of my generosity so that you can see exactly how well we've done."
