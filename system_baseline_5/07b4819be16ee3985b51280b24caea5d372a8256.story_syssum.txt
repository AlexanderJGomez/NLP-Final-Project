European Union and Middle East intelligence agencies had identified an "imminent threat" to Belgium, and possibly to the Netherlands, the source told CNN.
• The suspected Islamist terrorists who had a shootout with police on Thursday in Verviers, Belgium, have ties to ISIS-linked cells in other European countries, a senior Belgian counterterrorism source told CNN's Paul Cruickshank.
• There does not appear to be a command-and-control element to last week's Paris attacks at the offices of Charlie Hebdo magazine and two additional locations other than a general "go forward and do something," the Western official with direct knowledge told CNN.
• Two people suspected of involvement with the alleged terror cell in Verviers were detained trying to cross from France into Italy through the Frejus tunnel, a spokesman for Belgium's federal prosecutor's office said.
• The suspected terror cell, which included people returning from Syria, planned to target police officers, Van der Sypt said.
• Two men in their early 40s were arrested in Berlin on suspicion of links to ISIS, police said.
• The current level of security in Belgium will remain for at least one month and will then be evaluated to determine if it needs to be modified, the country's prime minister said late Friday.
But his attorney said the arrest was not connected to the other Belgian raids.
The official, who cited France, the United Kingdom and Belgium as countries facing a particular threat, said counterterrorism agencies in Germany are on high alert.
