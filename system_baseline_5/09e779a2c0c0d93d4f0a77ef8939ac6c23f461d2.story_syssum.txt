The pool where tourists have been able to see majestic reflections of both the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial has been under construction since last November to address problems with leaking and to make the water cleaner with a new circulation system.
"The reflective quality of this pool is of paramount importance to us," he said.
The Reflecting Pool is just one part of the aging National Mall that has problems, according to Caroline Cunningham, president of the Trust for the National Mall.
The Trust for the National Mall is currently running a design contest to come up with a sustainable, creative solution to problems at Union Square.
