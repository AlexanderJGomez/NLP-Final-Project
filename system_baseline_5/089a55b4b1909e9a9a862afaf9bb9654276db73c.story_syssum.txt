(CNN) -- The publication of a report into child abuse in the northern town of Rotherham, England has shocked Britain to the core.
The report concludes that elected council officials were reluctant to talk directly to the Pakistani community about the problem and that some staff were frightened of being labeled "racist" for doing so.
But a focus on political correctness should not distract from the wider, institutional betrayal of children by police, social services and local politicians.
The report explained how the grooming of victims (from all racial backgrounds) occurred: "Schools raised the alert over the years about children as young as 11, 12 and 13 being picked up outside schools by cars and taxis, given presents and mobile phones and taken to meet large numbers of unknown males in Rotherham, other local towns and cities, and further afield."
When crimes were reported, cases were gathered and reports filed to the council's staff and elected officials.
All three were largely ignored by the police and the council.
Thus far, he has refused.
The report does not name names and it's likely that the social workers and council staff who were so obviously negligent have moved on to jobs in other areas, spreading their incompetence across the country.
Professor Jay did indicate that services have improved at the council but added that it remains understaffed and the long-term victim support inadequate.
But it also employs, even provides cover for, individuals who are negligent.
That is the only effective way to expose those responsible, and to shed light on the Dickensian nightmare playing out in modern Britain.
