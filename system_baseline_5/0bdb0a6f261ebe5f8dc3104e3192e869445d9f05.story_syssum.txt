(CNN) -- Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf came to power in a bloodless military coup in 1999 when he was chief of Pakistan's army.
His rise through the military would help cement his political power in Pakistan by gaining the backing of the country's armed forces.
In 2001 Musharraf appointed himself president of Pakistan while remaining the head of the army.
Four months later, Musharraf implemented 29 amendments to the constitution, granting himself the power to dissolve parliament and remove the prime minister.
He brought women into the parliament," said Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, director of the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency.
In October of that year, Musharraf was re-elected president by a parliament critics said was stacked with his supporters.
Bhutto had returned from a self-imposed, eight-year exile to run in the country's general elections two months before her assassination and already had escaped one attempt on her life.
In 2010, further criticism of Musharraf emerged after the United Nations ruled that Bhutto's death could have been prevented had Musharraf's government taken adequate measures to protect her.
Six months later, the coalition moved to impeach Musharraf, who then resigned as president, though he said the allegations of misconduct were false.
In May 2010 Musharraf announced on CNN that he planned to re-enter Pakistan politics and launched a new political party in October of that year.
Chaudhry Zulfiqar Ali, a special public prosecutor in the assassination case, said a Rawalpindi court has already issued an arrest warrant for Musharraf.
Musharraf said that he will return even at the risk of his life.
I need to muster all the support I can," he said.
