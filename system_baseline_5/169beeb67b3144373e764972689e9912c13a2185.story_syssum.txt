That blueprint will focus on manufacturing, energy, education and middle-class values, according to a video released on the Obama's campaign website and Democratic sources who have been briefed on the address.
One Democratic official said the president will offer to work with Congress if Congress agrees to work with him.
The speech will build on a theme the president laid out in Kansas last month -- that in today's economy, the game has been rigged against the nation's middle class.
Democratic sources told CNN on Sunday that the bullet points of Obama's blueprint will focus on American manufacturing, including "insourcing" -- or bringing back jobs from overseas.
Obama will also suggest job training for the long-term unemployed and veterans, the sources said.
The day after the speech, the president will begin a three-day swing to states that are expected to be battlegrounds in the upcoming election.
