Pam Biggers disappeared while on a business trip to the Florida Panhandle in January 2008.
"It's completely baffling," said her husband, Don Biggers.
Her open book and glasses were on the bedside table, and the pillows were propped up against the headboard.
"We think she may have initially wandered off on her own," Don Biggers said.
The hotel did not have surveillance cameras, so it is not known when Biggers left or whether she was alone.
Police and the Biggers family are asking the public for help.
She is a white female who stands 5'8" tall, weighs 135 pounds and has green eyes and gray hair.
