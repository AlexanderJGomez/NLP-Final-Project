(CNN) -- Nearly four decades after hundreds of people were led to their deaths in a mass murder-suicide pact in a South American jungle, the cremated remains of nine of those victims have been found in a shuttered funeral home in Delaware.
Nine of the marked containers held the remains of Jonestown massacre victims, Chandler said.
Authorities will attempt to track down relatives or make arrangements to dispose of the remains, Chandler said.
On November 18, 1978, Jones' idealistic dream of creating a socialist paradise turned deadly when his followers were ordered or forced to drink cyanide-laced punch.
But Jones sent gunmen to a nearby airstrip, where they killed Ryan, an NBC correspondent and his cameraman, a newspaper photographer and one of the departing family members.
Syringes were used to squirt the poison in the mouths of babies.
It is not known who shot him or whether he shot himself.
