Lon Snowden spoke to reporters at Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport as he prepared to return to the United States after a six-day visit, his first reunion with his son since April.
Lon Snowden said his son told him he had had no contact with Russian security or intelligence.
He added that he did not know where his son was living.
Snowden's father: 'I know my son.
"So many people are so determined in the media to continue to refer to him as a leaker," Lon Snowden said.
The reunion came after times when Lon Snowden said he had not expected to see his son ever again.
Though Edward Snowden revealed the surveillance with the assumption that he would accept the consequences, that does not mean he regrets having fled the United States, nor does it mean he plans to return to face charges there, Lon Snowden said.
