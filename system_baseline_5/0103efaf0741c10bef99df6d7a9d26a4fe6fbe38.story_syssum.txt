(CNN) -- After an extensive, month-long buildup, Yahoo has finally unveiled its new logo.
"We knew we wanted a logo that reflected Yahoo - whimsical, yet sophisticated.
In a recent internal poll of Yahoo employees, 87% wanted the logo changed, Mayer said.
When Gap tried changing its logo in 2010, there was an outcry among Gap loyalists and logo enthusiasts.
"The logo is only part of a brand new branding and image campaign.
"A bad logo is all it took for Yahoo!
It'll just need to be freshened up," said Airey.
