In north-central Sri Lanka's Minneriya National Park, hundreds of elephants travel each year to the shores of an ancient reservoir built by a king more than 1,700 years ago.
"Where else you can get so close to so many wild elephants at once?"
If you haven't heard of The Gathering or ever seriously considered visiting Sri Lanka, you're not alone.
In addition, they are habituating elephants to charge vehicles, which they will continue to do once they leave the national park with the beginning of the rains."
Recommendations include implementing stringent policies to govern how visitors and guides behave in the park, as well as providing training for rangers and drivers on how to conduct themselves while in the presence of wild elephants.
As word about Minneriya's main attraction spreads, the hope is that massive herds of elephants will continue migrating to the park each dry season, as they have for hundreds of years.
As long as they do, it's a safe bet that more and more tourists will travel to Sri Lanka to experience what truly is one of the world's greatest wildlife events.
