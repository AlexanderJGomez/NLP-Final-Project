Santa Cruz, California (CNN) -- The arrest of Alix Catherine Tichelman in the death of a Google executive has shed a new light on the so-called sugar daddy websites where women are paid, sometimes thousands of dollars a month, by older suitors for their company.
"The women who are on the site, or as we call them 'sugar babies,' are looking for men who can provide financial assistance for them," said Angela Jacob Bermudo with Seeking Arrangement.
"I'm able to live the lifestyle I want without slaving for it," she said.
Bella, 28, said she's only been intimate with two men.
"Seeking Arrangement is in no way or form a prostitution or escorting service," Bermudo said, instead calling it a dating website.
"Just like traditional relationships you don't sign up and sex isn't part of the arrangement," Bermudo said.
In the case of Tichelman, authorities say she had an "ongoing prostitution relationship" with Hayes.
"Rather than provide first aid or call 911, Ms. Tichelman proceeds to gather her belongings including the heroin and needles," the police statement reads, adding that Tichelman stepped over Hayes' body several times.
Now authorities are taking a new look at that death "to make sure there's nothing (else) to it," he said.
