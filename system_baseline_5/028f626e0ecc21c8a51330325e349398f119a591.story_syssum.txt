(CNN) -- Since China took part in the Olympic Games in 1984 after a three-decade absence, competitive sports have served one purpose -- to build national pride.
As the son of a sports reporter, I was fortunate enough to know her when I was a kid.
In 2008, China won 51 gold medals (100 medals overall) and topped the gold medal tally at the Beijing Olympic Games.
There is nothing wrong with the obsession towards winning, after all, that's what elite competitive sports is all about but there are other emerging trends that might change the face of sports in China.
However, we also see that more kids (and parents) are embracing sport and the values it teaches.
Six years after the Beijing Olympic Games, there is another Olympic Games currently taking place in China this month -- the 2nd Youth Olympic Games in Nanjing.
In today's China, the demand for sports has gone beyond Olympic gold medals and national pride.
