London (CNN) -- Hans Kristian Rausing, the son of one of the world's richest men, appeared in court Wednesday charged with "preventing the lawful and decent burial" of his wife, Eva, UK media said.
"Hans and Marit Rausing and their families are mourning the death of their son's beloved wife, Eva.
Her father, Tom Kemeny, paid tribute Tuesday to his "beloved daughter."
Kemeny said the best way to remember his daughter would be to carry on her efforts to help those battling addiction, especially women.
"Eva would have wanted the memory of her life to be used to benefit others facing similar addiction challenges in their lives," his tribute said.
