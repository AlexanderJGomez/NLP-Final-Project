Now, French football clubs are going on strike to protest the legislation's planned implementation next year, claiming it will make them less competitive against European rivals and cause further financial hardship.
The 75% tax will apply to players who earn more than €1 million ($1.38 million) a year.
The UCPF, which says it pays €130 million ($179.5 million) to amateur sports each year as an act of "solidarity," claims the tax will cost jobs in the French football industry -- which employs 25,000 people.
All of those who will suffer from the consequences of this unfair tax.
