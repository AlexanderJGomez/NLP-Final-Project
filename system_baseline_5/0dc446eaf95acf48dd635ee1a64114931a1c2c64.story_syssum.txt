EW: How much did you know that you were getting evicted?
McGuire: Yeah, I mean it's a small house and word gets around quick, so I mean, I knew at the beginning of the week.
EW: Yeah, it's true.
McGuire: No, actually.
McGuire: Yes.
McGuire: I don't know.
McGuire: Ah no.
McGuire: Yeah, I was warned a little bit about some of the things.
But I know who I am, and I know that no matter what anybody says, it's not going to change my feelings about myself.
EW: Well, I don't know how much some of these words can be twisted or misinterpreted.
EW: When we talked to Nick after he got voted out, he said that on some level when you're playing a game you don't want to rock the boat, but then you don't want to be that person who just stands by idly while someone is making such racial slurs and just saying some really unfathomable things.
You know, I -- like you said, you don't want to rock the boat.
McGuire: [Laughs] I don't know because I don't know what you're talking about.
McGuire: Yeah, I'm going back to the boat.
McGuire: I think me and Kaitlin will.
How so?
McGuire: Yes.
EW: Yeah.
