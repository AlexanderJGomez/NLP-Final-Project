Antwan "Big Boi" Patton will be performing live with the Atlanta Ballet beginning Thursday.
But the curtain will be rising Thursday in Atlanta -- a hip-hop mecca that is home to Jermaine Dupri, Ludacris, Young Jeezy and Lil Jon -- for the first of six performances of a collaboration between Big Boi and the Atlanta Ballet: a work called "big."
"It's definitely one of the funkiest hybrids I've ever seen," Big Boi said.
Big Boi said he had a split-second of uncertainty about a ballet project, but was intrigued by the prospect and quickly immersed himself in the work.
Big Boi and a live band will perform some of his greatest hip-hop collaborations.
"Its very moving, sophisticated, elegant but at the same time it will tear your back off," Big Boi said.
The Joffrey opened the door for the ballet to use new techniques to reach those who may never have attended a ballet otherwise, said Christine Knoblauch-O'Neal, a professor of ballet and musical theater at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.
"You [hope] to open up people's minds to different avenues that they might not think they can or cannot take," Big Boi said.
If "big" is successful, the show could tour, Big Boi said.
"If you come in there with your tie on, you might have your bow tie leaning to one side when you leave," Big Boi said, "because you're definitely going to move."
