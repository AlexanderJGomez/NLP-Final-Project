(CNN) -- Kenny Dalglish last managed a football club more than a decade ago, and he was given a stark reminder of how much the game has changed since then as Manchester United spoiled his return to the hotseat at Liverpool on Sunday.
I have seen the replay and unless they have changed the rules, it is no penalty," he told reporters following his first match as a manager since leaving Scottish club Celtic in 2000.
Dalglish's next task following his appointment to the end of this season as replacement for Roy Hodgson is to prepare Liverpool for Wednesday's Premier League trip to Blackpool, with the club 12th in the table just four points above the bottom three.
At that point, we said no.
Manchester City face an FA Cup replay after the club's former manager Sven Eriksson led second division Leicester to a 2-2 home draw.
Leicester took the lead after just 50 seconds as new defender Sol Bamba scored from close range following a corner, but Premier League high-flyers hit back through James Milner and captain Carlos Tevez to lead at halftime.
