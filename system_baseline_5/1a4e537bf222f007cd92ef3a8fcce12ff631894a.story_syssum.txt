Hong Kong (CNN) -- This is the story of two entrepreneurs with two very different interests.
"I started interviewing for jobs at private equity firms and five weeks into it, I realized I wasn't really in love with the job or the industry anymore," Haskamp says.
He networked with friends, brainstormed and came up with a business idea that embraced his passion: martial arts.
Those all sort of pointed in my mind to a much more favorable environment than ever before to start a sports media-oriented business," Haskamp says.
Maximilian von Poelnitz found a problem and started a business to solve it.
He and two friends came up with the concept for Secret Ingredient, a delivery service of fresh ingredients for ready-to-cook dishes with the cooking instructions included.
After about 250 test meals -- mostly with friends -- Secret Ingredient launched last fall in Hong Kong.
It's the time question for me ... the price point is really reasonable," she says.
What made Haskamp believe investors would buy into the niche idea of setting up mixed martial arts fights and that the public would pay good money to see a fight?
Legend started out in Haskamp's small Hong Kong apartment.
"We don't have very much of an advertising budget," says von Poelnitz.
"Being in the food business, holidays are your big enemy which seems counterintuitive," says von Poelnitz.
I trusted myself and ultimately, I think it's paid off," says Haskamp.
