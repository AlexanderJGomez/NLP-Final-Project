(CNN) -- The medical examiner's office in Concord, New Hampshire, will conduct an autopsy Tuesday on the body of Celina Cass to determine how the 11-year-old girl died.
Celina's body was found around 10:30 a.m. Monday by divers from the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department near a hydroelectric plant outside West Stewartstown, New Hampshire, according to the attorney general's office.
The discovery came a day after Laro -- who was in the hospital when Celina went missing -- said that he was like others "wondering where my daughter is" and hoping she was safe.
"I ... can't believe what's gone on," Laro said on Monday.
Young said on Monday that authorities, including FBI agents, had received nearly 500 tips prior to finding the girl's body.
Celina's father said that he had not spoken with his ex-wife, who lived in the house with the girl's stepfather of about a year, since the girl went missing.
