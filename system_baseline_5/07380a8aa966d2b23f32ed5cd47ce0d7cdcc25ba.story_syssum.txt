The shipping vessel's crew had expected to give depositions on Friday, according to a crew member who asked to remain anonymous because of security concerns.
The crew member who asked to remain anonymous said there were 14 crew members on board, plus the captain.
Every bit of news is speculative at this point," The crew member said in the Saturday night e-mail.
There is an active U.S. embassy in the country, however, and U.S. consular officials did visit the ship's crew members on Thursday night, according to the crew member.
Soldiers boarded the ship Wednesday, herded the crew into the mess and met with Raider before taking him away, the crew member who asked to remain anonymous said by e-mail Thursday evening.
The crew member, in another e-mail to CNN on Friday, said that though his colleagues were upset, no one had been mistreated.
A few hours after the ship arrived, it was boarded by officials from Interpol, Venezuelan police officers and narcotics investigators who said they had received a tip that the vessel was smuggling drugs, the crew member said.
Then the Venezuelan authorities had the crew unload all the ship's cargo so they could search it, and again didn't find any contraband, the crew member said.
The captain hasn't been back to the ship since, the crew member said, but he has talked on the phone to the chief mate.
The sister of another crew member, who has been in regular contact with her brother and asked not to be identified for security reasons, said crew members have heard that the captain was charged with arms trafficking.
The crew member said life aboard the ship is tolerable, within limits.
Maybe we are wearing thin on the edges a little, but nothing bad."
