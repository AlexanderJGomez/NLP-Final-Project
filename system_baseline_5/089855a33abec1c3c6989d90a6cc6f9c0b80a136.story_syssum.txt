NEW YORK (CNN) -- I think I am developing a crush on America's first lady.
Michelle Obama is more compelling than her husband.
Watch her when she visits a local school and you see the warmth and affection she instantly triggers in people.
New to the Washington neighborhood, Michelle Obama has taken it upon herself to go around and introduce herself to the people in the various agencies of government.
When's the last time a first lady did that?
She knows exactly who she is.
And the reviews were rave.
The first lady has bare arms in Congress in February at night!"
