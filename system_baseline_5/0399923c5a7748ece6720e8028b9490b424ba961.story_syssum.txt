(CNN) -- Coming home from Asia, Barack Obama is obviously going through another rough patch in his presidency.
With power seeping away at home, second-termers increasingly turn their attention overseas, where they can still get big things done as commander in chief of the most powerful nation in history.
Talking to players on the world stage -- most of whom still want him to succeed -- one finds them genuinely rattled, worried about a lack of national will and operational competence.
On the tail end of his Asia trip, Obama told the press that in foreign policy, he thinks a president hits mostly singles and doubles and an occasional home run.
The administration would vigorously disagree, but just how much success can it genuinely claim in Syria, Egypt, Libya or even Iraq?
The President's trip to Tokyo revealed that the partnership is in serious trouble, mired down by domestic politics in both the U.S. and Japan.
With nationalism on the rise across Asia and sparks starting to fly, who can be certain that America will be there to put out a fire?
America needs a strong, effective president year in, year out, to help propel us forward.
The world needs strong, effective American leadership as well; for all our mistakes like Iraq, the U.S. is the one nation that still has the power to keep world order.
But mostly, the Obama team probably has to be patient.
It is in not in our national interest to have a lame duck for 33 months.
