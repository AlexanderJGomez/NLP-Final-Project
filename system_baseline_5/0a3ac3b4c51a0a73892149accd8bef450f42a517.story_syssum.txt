Atlanta (CNN) -- The remnants of Tropical Storm Lee settled in over the mid-Atlantic and Northeast on Wednesday, prompting warnings of heavy rain and flash flooding in areas from Washington up to western New England, the National Hurricane Center said.
The forecast was unwelcome news for waterlogged Vermont and northern New York, which could receive another 1 to 3 inches of rain with up to 4 inches possible in some spots by Wednesday night.
"When everybody else is on their way to recovery, we're getting flooded again," Stewart said.
Some eye-popping storm rainfall totals in the Northeast were recorded through 5 p.m. Wednesday in Becket, Massachusetts (8.11 inches); Rockaway, New Jersey (8.43); Phillipsburg, New Jersey (7.9); and Forks, Bethlehem and Dover, Pennsylvania (just over 7 inches).
A flooding death was also reported in rural northeast Mississippi, where one person drowned after floodwater swept away a vehicle in Tishomingo County, emergency officials said.
