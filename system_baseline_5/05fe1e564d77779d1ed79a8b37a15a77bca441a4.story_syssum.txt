(CNN) -- A 56-year-old married woman has won half of the second-largest Mega Millions jackpot in U.S. history and has taken the cash option, which after taxes, will be about $120 million, Georgia Lottery President Debbie Alford said Wednesday.
It will take one to two weeks before Curry will get her check, Alford said.
"(Curry) had the radio on, and the announcer was talking about the Mega ball, which was seven," Alford said.
Twenty ticket holders will win $1 million after matching all the numbers except the Mega ball.
The California winning ticket was sold at Jenny's Gift Shop in a San Jose strip mall, lottery officials said.
The odds of hitting the jackpot, which were 1 in 176 million, are now 1 in 259 million.
It's now 1 to 75.
