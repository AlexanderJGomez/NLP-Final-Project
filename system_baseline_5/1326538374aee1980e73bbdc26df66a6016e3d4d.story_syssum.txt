United Nations (CNN) -- The United Nations formally condemned Friday the sinking of a South Korean warship in March but did not specifically name North Korea, which a multinational probe found culpable in the incident.
"I think it's crystal clear that [the] Security Council made it clear that North Korea [is] to be blamed and to be condemned," said Ambassador Park In-kook.
The statement was read aloud by the Nigerian ambassador, the rotating Security Council president for the month of July, after being voted on Friday by the full 15-member body.
A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of North Korea, officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, called the presidential statement "devoid of any proper judgment," according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency.
The Security Council statement highlighted the importance of maintaining peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.
A senior South Korean official called on North Korea again Friday to apologize for the Cheonan's sinking.
