There's still a Sunshine State for folks like us -- it's "Old Florida."
Sometimes thought of as "Forgotten Florida," I'm talking about the more northerly portions of the state.
And you can enjoy it all without devastating your wallet and facing large or pretentious crowds.
Cedar Key
Art is a big part of the town, with all manner of public displays popping up.
If you seek a traditional, white-sand beach with aqua Gulf of Mexico waters right at your doorstep, you need to go elsewhere.
Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park
This is a wonderful state park dedicated to native flora and fauna (minus one hippo that is a holdover from another incarnation of the park).
At $13 for one adult, the admission is more than is typical for Florida state parks, but it's worth it.
If you get tired of swimming in the brisk, limpid waters, you can explore the lush surrounding forest on a boardwalk and trail.
Way down upon the Suwannee River, far, far away from Florida's more crowded tourist sites, lies a pretty little state park not so far from Georgia and an easy jump off Interstate 75.
The nearby town of White Springs has some pretty old homes, too.
Apalachicola oozes "Old Florida" charm.
I stayed across the bay in nearby Eastpoint, which is even smaller, more blue collar and boutique-free.
The Sportsman's Lodge offers a great price.
St. George Island State Park
St. Joseph Peninsula State Park
There didn't seem to be as much beach and parking for visitors, but the green and blue waters and soft sands were just as inviting.
Wakulla Springs State Park
The park has trails for hiking, but the big attractions are the swimming area and the one-hour riverboat rides, which are well worth the $8 for an adult.
You can't go any higher up and still be in Florida.
The gray water was still plenty warm for swimming in October.
