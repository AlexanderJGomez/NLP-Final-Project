Britain's Prince Charles has called on governments around the world to do more to ensure religious freedom and urged religious leaders to promote tolerance between people of different faiths.
"Yet even in the West this right is often challenged sadly -- and in many other countries, an absence of freedom to determine one's own faith is woven into the laws and customs of the nation," he said.
According to the report, which covers the period from October 2012 to June 2014, 81 of 196 countries in the world, or 41%, are identified as places where religious freedom is impaired or is in decline.
Overall, 20 countries are designated as having a high degree of religious persecution.
