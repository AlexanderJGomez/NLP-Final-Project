Does this statement mean that the Syrian government views the coalition strikes as beneficial to its hold on power?
The Syrian military is still superior when it comes to aerial force and may be best placed to retake ISIS territories.
Coalition strikes have not been targeting the Syrian government's military forces or infrastructure.
More fundamentally, the coalition's anti-ISIS campaign has deflected attention from the Syrian government and armed rebel group's atrocities against civilians.
Syrian civilians might also question why the international community decided to intervene against ISIS after ignoring -- for several years -- the Syrian government's brutality in a conflict that has led to more than 190,000 deaths and more than 3,200,000 refugees.
Coalition training may gradually improve some of the Syrian rebel groups' military capabilities and strategic planning but the current balance of power between the government forces and various rebel and armed groups will likely continue.
