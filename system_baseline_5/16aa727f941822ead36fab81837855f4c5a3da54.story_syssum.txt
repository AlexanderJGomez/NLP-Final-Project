Found guilty of hooliganism, Tolokonnikova, 23, was sentenced to two years in the penal colony.
But on September 23, she declared the conditions at the prison to be intolerable and began a hunger strike.
But Tolokonnikova will resume her protest if conditions at the prison camp don't improve, he said.
Bakhmina said she also went on a hunger strike after authorities said she could no longer phone her children.
She drew attention and won concessions.
