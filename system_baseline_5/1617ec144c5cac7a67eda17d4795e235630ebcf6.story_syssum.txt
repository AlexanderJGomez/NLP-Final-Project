But as bidders make their pitches for his team, Donald Sterling -- Shelly's estranged husband and the team's other owner -- accused the NBA of violating his constitutional rights in trying to end his ownership of the franchise based on what he says was an illegally recorded conversation during a lovers' quarrel, according to a document provided by Donald Sterling's attorney.
A source close to the situation said roughly two weeks ago that Donald Sterling -- who repeatedly denied he's a racist in a CNN interview -- wouldn't pay the fine, would reject the ban and might sue the NBA.
Other NBA figures have made bigoted or racially insensitive remarks and weren't punished as harshly, Sterling argues.
By filing the document, Donald Sterling is protecting his legal options but, at the same time, he realizes selling the team is the most likely outcome.
CNN's source on the potential sale said it was a busy Memorial Day weekend for Shelly Sterling.
Johnson called the whole situation sad in his own interview with CNN, in which he urged Sterling to sell the team.
The same source said Shelly Sterling will accept offers this week for the Clippers.
Shelly Sterling previously had said she wanted to own at least part of the franchise, but doesn't want to be a controlling partner.
