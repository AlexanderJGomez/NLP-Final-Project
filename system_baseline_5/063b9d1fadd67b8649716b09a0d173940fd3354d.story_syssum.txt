In doing so, they found several "gene clusters" that appear to cause eight distinct classes of schizophrenia, according to a statement from the university.
Past studies done on twins and families have shown that about 80% of the risk for schizophrenia is inherited, the study authors say.
In other words, if study participant Bob had Gene Cluster X, he was 70% more likely to have schizophrenia than study participant Fred who didn't have that cluster of genes.
The idea that schizophrenia is not one single disorder is not really new, says Dr. Charles Raison, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Arizona.
"Schizophrenia is probably 80 different diseases," Raison says.
So why are scientists trying to separate out the different schizophrenia disorders?
The same could hold true for schizophrenia and other mental health conditions, Raison says.
