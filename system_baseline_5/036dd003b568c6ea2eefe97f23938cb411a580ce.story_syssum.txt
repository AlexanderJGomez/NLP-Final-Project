Hickox, an epidemiologist who was working to help treat Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, has tested negative twice for Ebola and does not have symptoms, she said.
"She's fine.
Hickox told Crowley that mandatory quarantine is "not a sound public health decision" and that public health officials -- not politicians -- should be making the policies related to Ebola and public safety.
He said the doctors at the hospital say there's no medical reason to hold her.
The policy Christie enacted is unconstitutional and too broad, he said.
People who worked with Ebola patients but don't show symptoms of having the virus can serve their 21-day quarantine at home, the governor's office said.
On Fox News Sunday morning, Christie said he had "no second thoughts" about New Jersey's mandatory quarantine for health care workers.
Hickox said she has nothing to recover from.
Hickox said she's not allowed to see her lawyer or anyone else.
A spokeswoman for the hospital said staff is trying to make Hickox comfortable.
Hickox said she would welcome Christie to visit her in the hospital.
That would be great," she said.
In the email, Donna Leusner, communications director for the New Jersey Department of Health, wrote that Hickox did receive reading materials and got computer access.
