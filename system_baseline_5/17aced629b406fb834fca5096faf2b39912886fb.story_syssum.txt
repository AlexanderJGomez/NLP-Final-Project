He doesn't know the students," said Nikko Calle, 21, a graduate of Central Falls High School in 2006.
A firestorm has erupted in this Democratic stronghold in recent weeks after 93 teachers, support staff and administrators at Central Falls High School were fired for the low performance of the school, which graduated just 48 percent of its seniors last year.
Teachers can re-apply, but no more than 50 percent will get rehired.
"We stand together for our teachers and for our school," said Katherine Lopera, 20, a graduate in 2007.
When I went through high school, I went through a lot of personal problems and my teachers were always there for me."
On the steps outside the school, George McLaughlin shrugged.
The president "hasn't heard our side of the story," said McLaughlin, a member of the teachers' union.
She said the union supports school reform.
School superintendent Fran Gallo said she stands by her decision.
As darkness fell at the school, the graduates who had come back said the problems at the school have been oversimplified and that the rest of the nation can't understand the importance of the teachers in the tough environment they live.
"A lot of these teachers here helped me through hard times," he said.
