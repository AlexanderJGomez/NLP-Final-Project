More than 400 tribal gunmen took over Taiz in southwest Yemen, witnesses there said.
Meanwhile, President Ali Abdullah Saleh was in Saudi Arabia Tuesday, recovering from burns over 40% of his body and a collapsed lung, a U.S. government official briefed on the matter said.
At least 15 people were killed in Abyan Monday night and Tuesday morning in clashes between Islamic militants and security forces, according to a security source in Abyan.
A man trying to cross into Yemen from Saudi Arabia early Tuesday fatally shot two security officers and wounded another, the state-run Saudi Press Agency said Tuesday.
One diplomat said the attack was not a suicide bombing and that the Yemeni investigation was ongoing.
The official, who asked not to be identified, said that Saleh was in the mosque when two "projectiles" were fired during Friday prayers.
A U.S. government official said Monday he could not imagine the Saudis letting Saleh return.
"We rely on the Yemeni government as partners," the official said.
