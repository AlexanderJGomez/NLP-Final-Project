Rabobank will pull its backing for both men's and women's professional cycling teams on December 31, it said in a statement.
But all that has changed since the USADA report alleging doping by Armstrong and the U.S.
In its report, the anti-doping agency made public testimony from Armstrong's teammates and others who said Armstrong was among team members who used banned performance-enhancing substances and tried to hide it from testing officials.
He will remain on the charity's board of directors.
The USADA report is part of its request to international cycling officials to strip Armstrong of his seven Tour de France titles.
