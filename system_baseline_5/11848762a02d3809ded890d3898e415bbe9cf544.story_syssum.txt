Tesla unveils its Model S sedan, with a base price of $57,400.
It is widely believed that the Model S sedan will be built near the Space Exploration Technologies Corporation facility in Hawthorne.
Nonetheless, Tesla predicts it will manufacture 20,000 Model S vehicles a year.
That would make it more of a mass-market vehicle than the Roadster; only 1,200 of which are produced yearly.
