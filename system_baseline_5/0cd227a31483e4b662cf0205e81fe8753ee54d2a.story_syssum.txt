The man he saw in a North Carolina courtroom last week was stooped and shackled, hardly the same smooth and swaggering Jeffrey MacDonald who had told his story so many years ago.
McGinniss said in court that he considers the latest defense maneuver to be "the Holy Grail," MacDonald's last chance at freedom.
The judge could let MacDonald's murder convictions stand, toss them out, or order another trial.
"It was overkill," said McGinniss, who wrote that MacDonald killed his family in an amphetamine-fueled rage.
Prosecutors alleged MacDonald staged the crime scene.
MacDonald has always insisted he is innocent, so the recent developments in the case come as no surprise to McGinniss.
"We've been sold a bill of goods about this case," said Morris.
"MacDonald was convicted by a jury in a court of law.
McGinniss also tried to put the rest the notion that he was a passionate believer in MacDonald when he embarked on "Fatal Vision."
McGinniss said what he heard in court was overwhelmingly convincing.
"It was in 1987 during the trial of the civil suit against me," McGinniss said.
In the civil case, MacDonald accused the author of breaching an agreement to write a book about his innocence.
In court, MacDonald literally seemed to McGinniss to be a ghost from the past.
