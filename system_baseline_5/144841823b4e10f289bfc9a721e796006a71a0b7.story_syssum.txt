It stopped my seizures for two years but not my appetite, it just kept on growing!
One is Dinky and the other is Mindy.
Mindy is my seizure dog.
When I first got Mindy it was pretty hard because she didn't listen to me, but now she does and she knows a lot of commands.
Mindy barks when I have a seizure so my parents will know.
