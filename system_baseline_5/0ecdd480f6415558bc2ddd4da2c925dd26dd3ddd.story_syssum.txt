John Couey had been sentenced to death for killing 9-year-old Jessica Lunsford in Florida in 2005.
He said he was sad when he heard the news of Couey's death.
"To me, death is sad," he said.
"I am not shedding any tears," the girl's grandmother, Ruth Lunsford, said on Wednesday.
"
Citrus County Sheriff Jeff Dawsy, who led the investigation into the girl's death, told reporters he wished Couey could have faced the death sentence handed down by the jury.
In sentencing Couey, Judge Ric Howard noted Couey became fearful of police dogs being used in the area in the search for the girl.
He told Lunsford he was planning to take her home, but did not want her to be seen, and so persuaded her to get into a trash bag.
"He caused a slow, suffering, conscious death," Howard said of Couey.
"
"No, that was a big problem," Couey said.
He called on Couey to drop his appeals.
