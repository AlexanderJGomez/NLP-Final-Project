"The scientific name is Velella velella," said David Bader, director of education at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, California.
It's nothing that could actually get through my skin," Bader said while holding an assortment of the creatures.
The creatures float on top of the ocean with their fins sticking straight up, leaving them at the mercy of the wind and the current.
"And you know the winds change, and all of a sudden they wash up on shore and we get to see what the ocean is really made of."
