Kasab is also accused of shooting down people at Mumbai's Cama hospital.
Police say Kasab is the only suspected gunman caught alive.
Late in the day Kasab's newly appointed defense attorney Abbas Kazmi said Kasab was now retracting his statements, saying he confessed under police pressure.
The trial was supposed to get underway April 15 but in a stunning turn of events the original court appointed defense attorney for Kasab was dismissed from the case that day.
That victim also happens to be a witness against Kasab in this trial.
