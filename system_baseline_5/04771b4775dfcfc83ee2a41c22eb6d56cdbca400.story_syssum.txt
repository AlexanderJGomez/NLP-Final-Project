Rio de Janeiro (CNN) -- Soldiers in full combat gear move silently through a sprawling shantytown in northern Rio de Janeiro, pointing weapons down narrow alleys and poking through sacks of cement in search of drugs.
The troops will remain until at least July 31, after the World Cup ends, Escoto said.
While soldiers have provided support during the initial campaign, they have been replaced by police posts in most operations.
So far, they have registered more than a half dozen gun battles.
The resurgence in violence in some of the favelas already pacified has raised alarms in a city that will host many of the 600,000 international fans attending the World Cup.
In the Complexo da Mare, Escoto said the military will have everything under control.
"Rio de Janeiro will be prepared for the World Cup," he added, before his aides whisked him off, part of their policy never to let their top commander stay in one place for long in hostile territory.
