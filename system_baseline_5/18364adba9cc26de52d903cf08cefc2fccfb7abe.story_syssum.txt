(CNN) -- Former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will begin chemotherapy in the coming days to treat a malignant tumor in his larynx, a hospital official said Saturday.
He noted that former first lady Marisa Leticia has been with Lula ever since he came to the hospital for a check-up on Friday.
"He is a fighter," Mantega told reporters, adding he expected Lula will leave the hospital later Saturday.
"I am sure the same thing will happen to President Lula."
Presidents, however, are barred from running for a third consecutive term.
