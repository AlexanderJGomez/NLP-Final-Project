Al-Jazeera cameraman Sami al-Hajj at a hospital in Khartoum after his release from Guantanamo Bay.
Al-Jazeera aired video showing a bearded al-Hajj being carried from the plane in Khartoum by U.S. military personnel and laid on a stretcher.
"He was brought in here by ambulance and entered to the intensive care unit on a stretcher," said Al-Jazeera Director General Wadah Khanfar from the hospital.
"Al-Hajj is remarkably thin," Katznelson said.
I look forward to the moment," al-Hajj said told Al-Jazeera before being reunited with his family.
"Now I can think differently," Asma Ismailov said.
The network also said the United States placed some conditions on al-Hajj's release, including one that prevents him from any political activity.
