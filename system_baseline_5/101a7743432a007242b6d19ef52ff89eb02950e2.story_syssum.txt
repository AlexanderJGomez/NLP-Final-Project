And Detroit, Michigan, artist Jon Brumit and his wife, Sarah, are living it.
"It's not that we have a little money," Jon Brumit said, laughing.
But no matter.
Here was a chance for Cope and Reichert, who run a popular Detroit art store, to rehabilitate the 1920s brick house into a bastion of energy savings, with solar panels, LED lights, recycled wood and high-end insulated windows.
"It was much easier than we thought it might be," Cope said.
A neighbor said the house had been set on fire -- twice.
There were no back taxes -- no one seemed to be sure who once owned the house, it had been empty for so long, Brumit said.
"I saw it as a project," the artist said.
Michigan housing authorities acknowledge that there's little incentive for people who aren't quite as handy as Brumit.
A report from the nonprofit think tank Brookings Institution said Detroit had the lowest performing economy out of 100 U.S. cities it analyzed -- scoring the worst in unemployment and average wages, the highest foreclosure rates and the lowest market value homes.
The Smiths bought their 660-square-foot home for $549.99 from Cope and Reichert, who originally purchased the foreclosed home for $500.
"You have to get over that fear that the house had that history, that you're going to be a victim of a crime or something," she said.
And Zeb Smith, who works at the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit, brings home wood the museum would otherwise toss when installations close.
