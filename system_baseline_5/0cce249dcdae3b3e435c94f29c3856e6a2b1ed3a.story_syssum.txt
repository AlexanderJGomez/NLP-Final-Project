(RollingStone.com) -- Cee Lo Green, Blake Shelton, Adam Levine and Christina Aguilera -- all four coaches of "The Voice" -- joined producer Mark Burnett, host Carson Daly and the show's social media maven Christina Milian for a press conference Sunday night at Burnett's Malibu home.
As soon as Green carried out the unenviable task of choosing just one, the other coaches hammered on their buttons and made their pitches to bring the loser onto one of their teams, just like they do in the battle rounds.
The new opportunity for poaching has added a lot to the show, the coaches told Rolling Stone.
"There's a chance that person may go on and win this and that's gonna make me look really stupid.
"It's going to be so exciting for people watching at home," Shelton said.
For the four coaches, though, the biggest strength of this season is their bond.
"Over time we see how each of us react as coaches, giving such heartfelt advice and attention to these up-and-coming young fresh talents and it's so nice to see," she said.
But all friends go through that I think and you either go through it and you never speak to each other again or you go through it and your relationship is even stronger.
Although Burnett said the coaches have their "chairs for live," the assembled journalists were keen to speculate on who the replacement coaches might be.
"For me, there's nobody comes to mind that can replace my Blake, my Adam and my Christina," he said.
