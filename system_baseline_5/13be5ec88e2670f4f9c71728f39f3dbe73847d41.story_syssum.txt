(CNN) -- A month into the fall semester, Clemson University has pulled the plug on two dozen fraternities.
"It is especially prudent to suspend fraternity activities given the tragic death of Tucker Hipps," she said.
Tanner Parsons, a freshman at Clemson, says he met Hipps briefly at a fraternity pledge event this year.
Hundreds of students came together Tuesday night to remember Hipps at a candlelight vigil on Bowman Field at Clemson, according to CNN affiliate WLTX.
