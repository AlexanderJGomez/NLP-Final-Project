"We have a good rapport with him," Keenan said of Hood, who was in an apartment.
He and Keenan both said that children are among the hostages.
When Howard stopped that SUV near Sycamore Drive and Atlanta Highway, the man believed to be Hood got out and began shooting, police said.
He has several tattoos, including "Robert/Dad" on his right arm and "Mom/Azale" and a heart on his left arm.
