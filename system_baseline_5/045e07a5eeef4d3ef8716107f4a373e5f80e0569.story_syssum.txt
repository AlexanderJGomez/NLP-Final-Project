London (CNN) -- A British man suffering from "locked-in syndrome" who fought a long legal battle over assisted suicide died Wednesday, his family said.
His wife, sister and daughters were with him when he died, she said.
All I can move is my head, and the stroke took away my power of speech.
The only difference between you and me is my inability to take my own life," he said.
Jane Nicklinson said the family did not intend to go to Switzerland, which has an assisted suicide law, because it was expensive and her husband did not think he should have to go overseas to die.
Speaking to CNN in June, Jane Nicklinson described her husband before the stroke as a man who was the "life and soul of the party," making his current severely restricted existence even harder to bear.
