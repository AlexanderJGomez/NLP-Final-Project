Vitali Klitschko has confirmed that he will defend his world heavyweight boxing title against former champion Shannon Briggs on October 16 in his adopted home city of Hamburg.
"Shannon Briggs is not only big at talking but also big in the ring and a very tough challenger.
I will put a lot of pressure on Klitschko and take the fight to him.
Britain's WBA beltholder David Haye, who both Klitschkos have accused of being scared to fight them, may next fight former Olympic champion Audley Harrison, according to promoter Barry Hearn.
People don't know what to expect from Audley Harrison, he's been talking a great fight for years, never delivered it.
