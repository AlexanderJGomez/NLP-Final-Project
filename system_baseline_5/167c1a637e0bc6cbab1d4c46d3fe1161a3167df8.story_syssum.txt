But for Rudy Fernandez, who leapt to fame with his "hellacious" dunk in an Olympic final against the U.S. Dream Team, playing in "the best league in the world" was not enough.
Fernandez moved to the U.S. after the 2008 Olympic final in Beijing, where Spain lost to the Americans, and spent three years with the Portland Trail Blazers.
Wind the clock back just over four years and Fernandez had arrived in the United States to considerable fanfare after a standout performance for his beloved Spain in China.
The effort was described as "hellacious" by one U.S. sports writer, who had clearly run out of superlatives, while Fernandez singles it out as a career highlight.
Averaging 10.4 points and with a formidable conversion rate for three-point efforts and from the free throw line, Fernandez repaid Portland's faith in his abilities during his first season.
"Pau is probably one of the best players in the world, so he's my reference, and I work every year to be better and better," said Fernandez.
With Portland unable to make it past the first round of the playoffs in his time there, Fernandez went to Denver in a three-way trade.
I remember a long time ago in the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, no team could compete against the U.S. Dream Team, but now there's a little bit of respect paid by them to the other teams," Fernandez said.
While Spain dominates football, being the reigning world and European champions, its basketball team is not far behind.
