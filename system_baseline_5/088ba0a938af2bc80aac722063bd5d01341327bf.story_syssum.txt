There was a fierce court battle as a devastated family fought to keep her on life support and doctors argued she had already died.
Doctors and a judge have declared her brain dead and said there's no chance Jahi will come back to life.
Earlier, the girl's family told reporters it had located a facility in New York willing to take Jahi.
Attorneys for the family are filing a new complaint in federal court requesting a temporary restraining order and an injunction to prevent the hospital from disconnecting Jahi from life support, he said.
Before the surgery, Jahi said she was worried that she would never wake up, according to her uncle.
According to family members, Jahi went into cardiac arrest.
"The medical situation here in this case is that Jahi McMath died several weeks ago."
When asked about the girl's possible movement, the hospital spokesman, citing privacy laws, said he would not comment directly on any claims the family makes.
The case is "giving the impression that dead people can come back to life," Arthur Caplan, director of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center, told CNN last week
CNN has obtained a copy of a medical report, contained in a court filing, that lays out in extensive detail the testing that supports the hospital's conclusion that McMath has no hope of recovery.
Jahi's family has criticized the hospital's handling of the matter, accusing doctors of pressuring them to disconnect life support.
