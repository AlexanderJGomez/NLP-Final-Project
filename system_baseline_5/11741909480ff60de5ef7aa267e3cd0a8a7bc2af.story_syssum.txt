Since the 1960s, organized labor, once the pillar of the Democratic Party, has often been taken for granted or even treated with hostility.
During the battle over public employee unions in Wisconsin, most national Democrats were noticeably absent from the debate.
Democrats won the support of workers as a result of the surge of legislation that helped working- and middle-class Americans find economic security.
"Labor did it!"
Although a Republican was in the White House for most of the 1950s, organized labor helped a growing number of liberal Democrats win office in the House and Senate.
The relationship between labor and Democrats frayed after the 1970s.
Organized labor also suffered as Democrats reached out more aggressively to different constituencies, middle class suburbanites, consumer activists, young Americans and African-Americans, who didn't have as much connection to unions and often saw them as an "entrenched interest" that didn't have the best interest of the party in mind.
But Democrats can't afford to lose the enthusiastic support of organized labor.
