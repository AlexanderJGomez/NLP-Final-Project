To keep them and other companies investing here we need to continue the prime minister's crusade to make the UK the best place in the world for 21st century medicine design.
Having worked for fifteen years in the industry -- not for "Big Pharma," but for insurgent biotech companies and charities, who are increasingly the ones discovering most of the new medicines -- the controversy over the proposed merger was fascinating.
If we do so, we can deliver huge benefits to NHS patients, slow death rates in key diseases like cancer, reduce our drugs bill by making the UK the fastest and best place in the world to develop, test and prove these new medicines -- which would allow us to pay a discounted rate -- AND kickstart a 21st century life sciences cluster.
AstraZeneca last year electrified the sector by wholeheartedly embracing the Life Science Strategy, embedding its staff in the Cambridge biotech and hospital campus.
The truth is that we need to worry less about who owns these companies -- after all the shareholders in both cases are global, as is the management -- and more about their level of commitment to the UK as a place to develop and sell modern medicines.
The truth is that what really matters is that the UK remains a world-class place to discover and develop new 21st-century medicines.
