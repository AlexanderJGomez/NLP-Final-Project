What Awuah wanted to begin was to create a university in his native Ghana, a state-of-the-art education hub that would help educate the country's next generation of leaders.
"Africa needs to have a renaissance," says Awuah, as he explains what drove him to take the risky decision.
When this 20-year-old is now in his or her 50s, that person is going to be a leader.
"I won't lie to you -- it was tough," says Awuah.
For his efforts, he's won many awards.
Awuah says the university brings together a diverse mix of students from different backgrounds, including scholarship-winning undergraduates from humble beginnings who are the first in their families to attend college.
Looking ahead, Awuah says he hopes Africa's universities will cultivate a new generation of bold and innovative leaders, helping the continent to transform itself.
