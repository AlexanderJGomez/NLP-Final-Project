"If, as is stated in the complaint affidavit, Jordan and Cody (Johnson) were arguing intensely on the ledge, it hardly seems plausible that the argument would cease abruptly so Jordan could apply a blindfold," says Donahoe's brief supporting a motion to dismiss the case.
The report, which alleges an FBI interrogator inappropriately touched Graham's knee during the interview, states that almost an hour and a half of Graham's interrogation was not recorded, despite the necessary equipment being on hand.
Graham said in a court filing that during the argument, Johnson grabbed her by the arm and she removed it, pushing Johnson simultaneously and accidentally sending him off the cliff, according to court documents.
Graham did not report the incident.
Five days later, Graham came clean during the FBI interrogation, telling the interrogator that she lied but that Johnson's death was an accident, according to the defense brief.
