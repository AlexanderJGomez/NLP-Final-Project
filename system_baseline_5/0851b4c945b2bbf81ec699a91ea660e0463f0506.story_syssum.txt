Beijing (CNN) -- Han Junqian doesn't go outside very often.
Han is blind, and his life is similar to the roughly 120,000 blind massage therapists in China today, according to a 2012 report by Changchun University.
"It's fairly meaningless," said Hallett.
When they are educated at all, blind people are shoved into segregated schools that are isolated from the rest of society.
Since the career paths of the students are all but predestined, the curriculum at blind schools are often not as rigorous.
China's semi-official organ for dealing with blindness is the China Association of the Blind, and they are forthright about the scale of the problem that blind Chinese face.
"It's not fair that blind people have so few opportunities," said an official from the association who requested anonymity.
Whether it's a success or not, the matter is ultimately moot for many, including Han Junqian.
