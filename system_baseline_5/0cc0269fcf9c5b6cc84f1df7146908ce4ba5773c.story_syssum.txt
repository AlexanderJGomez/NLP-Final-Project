(Oprah.com) -- A businesswoman, a mother of four, an international fashion icon, a woman committed to making the world a better place for women and children -- Queen Rania of Jordan is truly changing the world.
Six months later, Rania and Abdullah had a royal wedding and started a family.
Because I'm Rania, you know?
I'm Rania."
"For me, it's just real life," Rania says.
I worry about what they eat.
Rania says her family tries very hard to remain down to earth.
"The most important thing is to instill them with the right values," Rania says.
Helping others is something Rania says she feels compelled to do.
"You can change the course of a nation through education," she says.
Unlike in America, most children and husbands return home to eat with their families for lunch.
Though Queen Rania says she has never worn a veil, she understands why a woman would want to.
Rania says that when people focus on differences between cultures -- especially stereotypes and things like veils -- they fail to realize just how similar all people are.
In the future, Rania says she hopes for a more open and secure world.
Rania says solving problems that stem from intolerance -- like terrorism -- require cultural dialogue, education and increased opportunities.
