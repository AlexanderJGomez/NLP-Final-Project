MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- Officials in Mexico's Chiapas state postponed classes Friday for more than 1 million students in an effort to avoid a resurgence of H1N1 flu, which has sickened thousands throughout Mexico this year.
The first cases of H1N1, also called swine flu, were confirmed in Mexico in April.
In the United States, federal officials released new guidelines this month for containing the spread of the virus across the nation's school system.
Government officials have warned of a possible resurgence in the H1N1 virus this fall.
The virus has spread around the world with unprecedented speed, according to the WHO.
