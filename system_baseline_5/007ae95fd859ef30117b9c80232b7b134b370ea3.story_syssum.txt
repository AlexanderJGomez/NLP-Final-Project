(CNN) -- On Tuesday, a federal advisory panel, the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity, recommended that university scientists who have submitted articles on how to modify a flu virus to two very prestigious journals delete critical information from them before publishing.
They are also taught the absolute necessity of making their claims public in reputable journals so that other scientists can subject them to the critical skepticism from which the truth ultimately emerges.
If that is done, then the truth will still be known about whether those making claims of being able to engineer the virus can actually do so.
Freedom from terror is also key to good science.
Journals and those who write for them ought to do all they can to try and ensure that most important freedom.
