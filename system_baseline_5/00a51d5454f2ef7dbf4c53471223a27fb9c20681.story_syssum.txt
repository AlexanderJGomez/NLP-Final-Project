Yet Rubio has been his own worst enemy on what could have been his two signature issues: immigration reform and Cuba relations.
His retreat on immigration means that Rubio has missed an opportunity to set himself apart from most of the presumptive Republican presidential candidates.
Instead, Rubio has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration.
But when it comes to Cuba policy, Rubio himself seems firmly stuck in the past.
By clinging to the notion that isolating Cuba is better than engaging with the communist country, Rubio has marginalized himself on an issue where he could have provided insight and leadership.
Sure, Rubio is young and charismatic.
But his work on the failed immigration bill notwithstanding, Rubio has a significant lack of accomplishments to show for his five years in the senate.
Unfortunately, a fresh face on stale ideas is not a winning combination -- not for Rubio, and not for Latino voters.
