According to the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities, it's here, at a spot known as Abusir, that the tomb of Marc Antony and Cleopatra might be located.
"They were speaking very badly about her and about her image," she recalled.
In short, Martinez believes, Cleopatra was a woman way ahead of her times.
The tale of Antony and Cleopatra has fueled the popular imagination for centuries.
Marc Antony was a no less fascinating character than Cleopatra.
Shortly afterward, Antony and Cleopatra committed suicide, he by his own sword, she by a poisonous asp.
The sudden focus on Antony and Cleopatra has also reignited an old debate over the latter's looks.
At Abusir, he showed me one of the coins with Cleopatra's likeness.
Plutarch wrote in his "Life of Antony" that "for her beauty was in itself not altogether incomparable, nor such as to strike those who saw her."
In any event, it's just one of many mysteries in Egypt.
Why were they built?
There has been plenty of excitement in the past few days over reports that Martinez and her team are about to find the long-lost tomb of Antony and Cleopatra.
I guess we can wait a few more months.
