Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Amid the overwhelming flood disaster in Pakistan, the world has "no choice but to be optimistic and to have hope" that things can improve there, actress and humanitarian Angelina Jolie told CNN Wednesday.
"It doesn't have the dignity that they deserve to live in -- anybody deserves to live in," Jolie said.
The death toll in the country has climbed to 1,738, the Pakistan Disaster Authority said over the weekend.
One reason relatively few people have paid attention to the suffering in Pakistan, Jolie said, may be disaster fatigue.
Jolie said she would want people to remember this: "They are people.
The Pakistani people are resilient and will move on, Jolie said, but she urged international support to help them do that.
