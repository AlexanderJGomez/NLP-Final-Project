"It is very disappointing that we have lost our first home match," Van Gaal told BT Sport in his post game interview.
The feelgood factor had seemed to have returned to United since Van Gaal's appointment earlier in the summer.
In the second half we never played as a team, therefore I'm responsible," Van Gaal continued.
United began with a 3-5-2 system similar to that employed by Van Gaal's Dutch side at the World Cup earlier this summer before switching to a 4-4-1-1 as the game progressed.
"We have been working hard in pre-season on defensive shape and we can get even better at that but there were pleasing signs in the way we stuck together and the goals we scored against a side of Manchester United's resources," said Swansea manager Gary Monk.
