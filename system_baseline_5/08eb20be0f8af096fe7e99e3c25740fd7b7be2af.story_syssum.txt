HAVANA, Cuba (CNN)  -- New Orleans, Louisiana, Mayor Ray Nagin arrived in Cuba late Friday on a mission to learn about how to deal with storms, a spokeswoman said.
Since Katrina, New Orleans has adjusted its disaster response with new evacuation plans.
Three powerful hurricanes hit Cuba last year, damaging half a million homes and causing $10 billion in losses, according to the Cuban government.
Nagin is the first New Orleans mayor to make an official visit to Cuba in 50 years.
