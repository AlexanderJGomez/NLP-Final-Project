(CNN) -- Two international journalists, along with their Somali colleague and a driver, were kidnapped Saturday, a journalists' organization in Somalia said.
"As well, there have been no demands."
On Friday, fighters from the Islamic group Al Shabab took control of the southern port town of Kismayo after three days of clashes.
The conflict displaced hundreds of thousands of Somalis, further worsening a humanitarian crisis that dates back to the collapse of the country's last government in 1991.
