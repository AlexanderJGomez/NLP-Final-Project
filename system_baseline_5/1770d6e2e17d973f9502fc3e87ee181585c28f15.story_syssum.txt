Chiranuch Premchaiporn was found guilty for allowing content prohibited under Thailand's controversial "lese-majeste" law to stay on Prachatai, an independent online news site, for 20 days before it was deleted.
Meanwhile, a petition signed by 27,000 people proposing a reform of the strict lese-majeste law was this week handed to the Thai parliament.
Earlier this month, a 61-year-old man serving a 20-year sentence for lese-majeste and computer offenses died in a prison hospital in Bangkok.
Various banners condemning lese-majeste, or Section 112 of the Criminal Code, were also flown.
