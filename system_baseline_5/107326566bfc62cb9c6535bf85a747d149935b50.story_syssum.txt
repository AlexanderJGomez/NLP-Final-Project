It's not about Morsy only, but it also applies to (former Egyptian President Hosni) Mubarak and others.
At various points in the trial, Morsy said that he was still the President of Egypt and refused to recognize the court as legal.
Attorney Mohamed Selim El-Awa cited constitutional articles to the court that stipulated the steps for removing a president and putting him on trial -- something that required the approval of two-thirds of the parliament and a special court made of the country's top judges.
Early in the trial, Morsy and his co-defendants were held in a metal cage in court.
This is the first trial Morsy was referred to after his removal from power.
In May, Morsy is scheduled to start a fifth trial -- this one on charges of insulting the judiciary.
