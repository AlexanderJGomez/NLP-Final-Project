"In this case, my office examined newly discovered scientific evidence that was not available at the time of the trial," Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth P. Thompson said in statement to CNN.
Yarbough and Wilson were already incarcerated when the 1999 rape and murder occurred, according to Adam Perlmutter, Wilson's attorney.
Yarbough was just 18, and Wilson only 15, when they were accused of murder.
Yarbough's attorney and the district attorney's office began revisiting the case in 2010.
"I'm feeling really blessed right," Yarbough said.
When asked about his relationship with Wilson, Yarbough said he has no animosity.
"It was hard to keep my hopes up, but God is good now, I'm out now, I'm free, thank God," Yarbough said.
