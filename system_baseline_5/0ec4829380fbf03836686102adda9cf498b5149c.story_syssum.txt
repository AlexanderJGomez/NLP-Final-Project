Now, Iqbal is considering suing the U.S. government for unlawful detention.
His attorney in Washington, Richard Cys, said he is considering a lawsuit against the U.S. government, on behalf of Iqbal, but the details of the suit have not been worked out.
"I never [made] that statement," Iqbal said.
Iqbal says while in U.S. custody, he was taken to Egypt, then to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan.
Six months after he was admitted to Guantanamo, Iqbal said he tried to kill himself.
Former President Bush and other senior officials have repeatedly denied that the U.S. government used torture to extract intelligence from terror suspects.
Iqbal was among nearly 800 inmates who came through Guantanamo Bay, classified by Washington as suspected terrorists.
