Arne Duncan, the U.S. secretary of education, set off a firestorm last week when he suggested that most of the opposition to the Common Core State Standards for education was coming from "white suburban moms" who have suddenly discovered from standardized test results that their children aren't as "brilliant as they thought they were and their school isn't quite as good" as they thought it was.
The truth is that the backlash against the Common Core has grown strongest in areas where state tests results showed many previously "proficient" students failing to meet expectations.
We've seen this most clearly in New York, where anti-Common Core sentiment reached a peak after the release of results from the latest state reading and math tests, which showed less than one-third of students across the state met grade-level expectations.
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, between 28% and 40% of four-year college students have to enroll in at least one remedial course to learn content and skills they should have learned before earning their high school diplomas.
Worse, according to a U.S. Department of Education study, only 27% of students who needed a remedial math course completed college.
