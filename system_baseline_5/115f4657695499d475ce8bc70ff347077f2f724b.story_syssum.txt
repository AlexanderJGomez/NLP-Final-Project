"Frequency modulation," exclaims South African radio shock jock Gareth Cliff in an online video posted earlier this year.
Sure, there may now be digital radio and more interaction between programs and their listeners today, Cliff explains.
"Mobile is definitely where the action is," Cliff says.
Like most modern media outlets, Cliff Central has embraced the likes of Facebook and Twitter (a task made easier by the fact Cliff has close to a million Twitter followers), integrating them into its service early on.
The most intriguing development, however, is what Cliff Central is doing on the hugely popular mobile communication app, WeChat.
It's this engagement that Cliff explains is proving attractive to advertisers.
The corporation also adapted the Mxit app to distribute content during South Africa's parliamentary elections in May.
Closer to Cliff Central in South Africa, other web-only stations have popped-up in recent years.
He is clear that he doesn't want to replace radio in South Africa, rather offer something different.
The people who really know about these things (media, digital advertising and branded content) are as excited about this as we are," he adds.
