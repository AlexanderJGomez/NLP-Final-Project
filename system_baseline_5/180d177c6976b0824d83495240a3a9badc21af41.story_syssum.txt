"We have a lot of support from sponsors, from different international and multinational companies that see it as an opportunity to offer their brands and their experiences as well and it makes it way more profitable," said owner of The Garden, Ismael Kassem.
The Garden is booked out every night and Kassem and his partners are bullish about the future.
The election of an Islamist President, Mohamed Morsi, in 2012 had the industry fearful for its survival.
"A lot of investors are looking at what is running and surviving the revolution, and economic prices and that is mainly food outlets, coffee shops and I would say eventually nightlife," Rizk said.
"Of course we are bullish but we aren't foolish," Kassem said.
Both Kassem and Rizk hope it will pay out in dividends.
