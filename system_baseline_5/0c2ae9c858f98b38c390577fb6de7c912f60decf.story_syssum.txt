But in his online journal, McFaul said Tuesday that he would miss the job, stressing he was leaving for family considerations.
"I will leave Russia reluctantly," he said.
After advising then-Sen. Barack Obama on Russia during the 2008 presidential campaign, McFaul took a leave from Stanford to become senior director for Russia and Eurasian affairs at the National Security Council.
An analyst on a government network said McFaul was a "specialist purely in the promotion of democracy" and suggested his agenda was dedicated to supporting opposition leaders in the country.
CNN first learned of McFaul's planned departure on Twitter.
