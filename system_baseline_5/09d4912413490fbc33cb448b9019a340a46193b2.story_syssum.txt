(CNN) -- By distance, the running of the bulls course in Pamplona is pretty short: just 850 meters, or half a mile.
The bulls are faster, and the runners -- now more than a thousand most days, and even more on weekends -- are densely packed.
But for novices and others who don't know enough, there's fresh help.
Contributors include John Hemingway, grandson of the novelist and himself an author; Jim Hollander, a Israel-based photographer for the European Pressphoto Agency who's captured images of the running for years; and Alexander Fiske-Harrison, a Briton who's fought bulls.
On the first three days of running this year, 13 people have been taken to hospital, three for goring-related injuries and the rest having being hurt in falls or collisions.
This year, animal rights groups again plan demonstrations decrying the bull running and subsequent bullfights where the animals are killed, in the afternoon.
Yet those eight days included just 17,813 bull runners, some of them repeat participants over several days.
But they've picked up the gist: Pamplona, they will tell me, is a must see: this wild fiesta and this dangerous bull running.
