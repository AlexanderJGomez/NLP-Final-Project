"I saw their faces, and they were terrified," she said.
"I wasn't the victim that night, I was the collateral damage," said Fitzpatrick, now 50.
More than two decades later, Fitzpatrick was living in New Orleans when she once again had a brush with street violence.
"It was just too much," she said.
"We offer a space out of the path of the bullet, where a young man can put 6 inches of cinder block between him and violence outside," Fitzpatrick said.
"We're empowering our young men and women to ... find out what they might want to do," Fitzpatrick said.

Whatever the method, Fitzpatrick knows that every situation that's negotiated peacefully gives young people tools they can use in the future.
"When I ask them why they hang out with (me) every Friday night, they say, 'Because you're the first person who ever let us in the door.'
and I'm honest with them," she said.
Michael Lewis, a 20-something young man at APEX, said he felt an "instant connection" with Fitzpatrick after hearing her past.
"I've kind of gone through a similar situation," he said.
Today, Santacruze helps others at APEX, where he sees young people facing the same struggles that he once did.
This peer-to-peer mentoring, and the fact that the majority of the young people that come to APEX are referred by their friends, confirms to Fitzpatrick that she's on the right track.
But Fitzpatrick said she wouldn't have it any other way.
"At the end of the day, my house and my cars, that was sticks and bricks, steels and wheels," she said.
