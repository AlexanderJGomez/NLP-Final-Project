But no shots were fired when Mexican federal police captured alleged Juarez Cartel boss Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, authorities said Thursday.
Carrillo Fuentes, known as "El Viceroy," was one of Mexico's most wanted alleged criminals.
But at one time, the Juarez Cartel was one of the most powerful in Mexico.
Authorities said last week that they arrested Hector Beltran Leyva, leader of the Beltran Leyva Cartel, while he was dining in a seafood restaurant in San Miguel de Allende.
Hours later at another press conference, Murillo trumpeted news of Carrillo Fuentes' capture as the "result of enormous effort by the federal government," noting that it shows how much authorities have strengthened their abilities in investigation and intelligence.
