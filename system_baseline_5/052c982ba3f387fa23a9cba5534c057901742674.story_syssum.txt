But for the parents of the hundreds of thousands of children who go missing each year, that pain is much deeper; for some, there is never relief.
Last week, however, I had the heart-wrenching experience of finding out what happens in between the media updates -- what it feels like when this is real life.
The boy said he never went to their rendezvous point, a park, and as of Thursday, the young girl still had not come home.
It was frustrating because the family did not think she intended to be gone long.
When word got out, the community rallied around the missing teen and her family.
People who had never met the family joined the search.
Three days after the girl went missing, I was helping plan a prayer vigil.
About an hour before it was to begin, the young girl was located.
For the media, that's where the story ends.
After this experience, I'll never look at news of a missing child the same.
