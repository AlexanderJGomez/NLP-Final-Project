Brian K. Vaughan says he's "depressed" about the end of "Y: The Last Man," but he's got other projects to work on.
"I guess I've moved into acceptance but that doesn't mean that I'm not still depressed about it," says Vaughan, 31, a soft-spoken Cleveland, Ohio, native who now makes his home in Los Angeles.

When Vaughan first pitched his concept for "Y: The Last Man" to Vertigo, an imprint of DC Comics, he was focused on a specific ending, without knowing whether the series would last long enough to reach it.
Now, as their stories come to a close, Vaughan likens it to ending a relationship.
"It's hard to not think about working with Pia, just because I think she is the best 'actor' in comics," he says.
Remaining true to the mysteries of the island, Vaughan says he can share "just about nothing" from the upcoming fourth season of the series, which has been cut from 16 episodes to eight as a casualty of the continuing writer's strike.
As production remains shut down both on "Lost" and the film adaptation of "Y: The Last Man," Vaughan considers himself fortunate.
