Part one looked at the violent rules gangs live by.
"Lupito," as friends and family knew him, went down in a hail of bullets before he reached 22.
Authorities said he died alongside three others in a gunfight with a rival drug gang high in the Sierra Madre mountain  range that is the backbone of Mexico's Pacific coast state of Sinaloa.
"I can't.
You must understand how things are around here these days.
Three young men show up.
This is the first time we've come to pay our respects," one of them explained.
Drug rivalries have been known to spill over at funerals so many mourners opt to stay away leaving only the closest relatives to bury their dead quietly and without public complaints.
I look around.
"The easy money lasts for just a few days because it's all about time before they kill you too.
Most days, you can hear a brass band or a cowboy trio thumping out tunes in a small building on a Culiacan side street.
The day I dropped in, one man was paying around $600 for a band to play for three hours.
I told another man, who gave his name as "Rosario," that he looked like a stereotypical narco.
"It sounds bad to say it but Culiacan is a city with a big drug mafia.
If they don't find any support for their killings or their drug trafficking from the Catholic Church then they look for other options," Father Esteban Robles, spokesman for the Culiacan diocese told me.
Tomorrow, Penhaul examines how the gangs dispose of their victims and what officials are doing to stem the violence.
