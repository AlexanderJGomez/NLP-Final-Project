The trafficking ring was based in -- and directed from -- China, but its two suspected leaders in Europe were arrested in the operation, in Barcelona, Spanish national police said in a statement.
The suspects include those who allegedly formed part of the smuggling ring and also those who paid for the forged documents, the spokesman said.
Investigators said the trafficking ring was intricately structured, divided into independent and virtually isolated cells to avoid detection, police said.
Once a delivery of smuggled Chinese citizens had been completed, the travel enforcers would return to their bases in China and Malaysia to await further instructions, and to avoid detection by Western police forces, police said.
