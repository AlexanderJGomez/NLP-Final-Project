(CNN) -- Authorities in Portage, Wisconsin, worked Sunday to evacuate residents as a levee along the Wisconsin River approached imminent failure after heavy rainfall soaked the Midwest last week.
The levee system, built in the 1890s, was constructed from locally available materials -- mostly sand -- "without any engineering design or adherence to any standards," DNR said in a statement Friday.
The river is expected to begin gradually falling Sunday evening before dropping below flood stage by Wednesday, the weather service said.
"I have never seen the water rage down like it is," CNN iReporter Jason Asselin said.
CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said Sunday that there's no immediate end in sight to the flooding.
