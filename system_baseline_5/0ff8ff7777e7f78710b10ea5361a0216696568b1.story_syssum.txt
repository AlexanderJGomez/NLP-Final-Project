(CNN)Every time a snowstorm bears down on Danbury, Connecticut -- which has happened a lot this winter -- students and parents turn to Twitter to find out whether schools will be closed.

One twist of the whole thing is that Boughton doesn't even make the call about closing Danbury schools.
"That's who I am.
"Because as a parent I don't have time for Twitter."
