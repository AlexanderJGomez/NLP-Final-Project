Cesar Gaviria highlighted the problems Mexico is facing handling its drug problem.
Gaviria said it's time the United States changed its approach.
"The U.S. has to look at its policy, to start to use more of that $4 billion a year that they use, to use more of the resources in the health system, in treatment and taking some people out of jail."
"But the flow of drugs will keep growing."
