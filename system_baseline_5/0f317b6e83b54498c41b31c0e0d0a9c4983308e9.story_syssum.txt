(CNN) -- A flood of details has emerged in the past 24 hours about the case of Ariel Castro and the three women police say he held for close to a decade inside his modest Cleveland home.
And if not, how could that be?
Ishmael Figueroa once shared a home with his daughter, Grimilda Figueroa, and Castro.
And when Castro and Grimilda Figueroa moved to the house on Seymour Avenue -- where the women were later discovered -- Castro wouldn't even let family members through the front door.
Castro would starve and punch her in the stomach to induce miscarriage, Knight said, according to the document.
Authorities haven't concluded who, if anyone, should get the money, but are discussing it, Tomba said.
