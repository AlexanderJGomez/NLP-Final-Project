No one has found the 276 girls abducted from their school last month by the terror group Boko Haram.
"When I went into the school compound, nobody will ever stand it," said the father, who is not being identified for fear of reprisals from attackers or the government.
Armed members of Boko Haram attacked the school on April 14, overpowering the guards and herding the girls onto waiting trucks, according to accounts of that night.
In the days after the attack, the military said all the girls had been released or rescued.
This much the father knows for sure: His two daughters are among those still in captivity after almost a month.
They know his family, the father says.
They know about his daughters.
"We sleep in the bush with all of our little ones," he said.
I will sell them in the market, by Allah," said a man claiming to be Abubakar Shekau.
I will sell women.
They adopted one of their two daughters after her parents were killed by the terrorist group.
"They don't know, probably one of them are born a president or doctor or pastor or a lawyer who will be helpful to the country," she said.
