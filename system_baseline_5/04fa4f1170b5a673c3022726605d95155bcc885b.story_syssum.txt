But the splash is bigger when such projects fail or when people starting mumbling about Chinese influence.
What China does in Europe matters greatly, though rarely do I hear or read a positive story about China's influence.
But any attempt it makes to expand in Europe, United States or Africa is met with fears of technology transfer to a firm linked to the Chinese military through its founder.
A change of leadership in Beijing will not have much impact in Europe.
It also helps to expand China's middle class which appears to love European and American products.
But it did.
That goes to show Europe has to get comfortable with the growing influence of China on its shores.
China needs to understand that it will take time for Europe to get comfortable with China's investments.
