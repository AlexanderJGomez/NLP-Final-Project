Forecasters had warned of an additional 1 to 3 inches of snow accumulation in the South on Sunday night into Monday morning.
But "the accumulating snow that was in last night's forecast isn't going to happen," CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said Monday.
Snow flurries are forecast later Monday as an Arctic front moves through, Morris said, but no accumulation was expected outside mountainous areas.
The National Weather Service was forecasting a slight chance of snow before noon, then a mix of rain and snow, with an above-freezing high of 36 degrees.
The extent of injuries was not immediately known.
During that period, 8.8 inches of snow fell on Harkers Island, North Carolina, according to weather service data.
As of Friday, according to the National Weather Service, 68.1 percent of the United States was covered with snow, compared with 51.2 percent in January.
