(CNN) -- Roger Ebert got a final "thumbs up" as family, friends and filmmakers eulogized the movie critic at his funeral in Chicago on Monday.
"He really was a soldier for social justice, and it didn't matter to him your race, creed, color, level of ability, sexual orientation -- he had a heart big enough to love and accept all," she said.
Roger spent a lot of his time sitting through bad movies so that we didn't have to.
"Roger did not chose cancer.
"His time with us was too short, but what he shared with us endures," Emanuel said.
"We love you Roger, we always will.
Jackson also read a message from Spike Lee: "Roger Ebert was a champion of my work and other black filmmakers at a critical time in American cinema history, Roger was one of the lone defenders of 'Do the Right Thing' when everybody else and their mothers were saying that black folks would run amok and riot during the summer of 1989.
"Roger was pretty much the first with a computer," Barron said.
He taught us a lot and we at the Sun Times were always proud to say we worked where Roger Ebert worked.
"I'm the happiest when I think of how he and my mother found each other," she said.
