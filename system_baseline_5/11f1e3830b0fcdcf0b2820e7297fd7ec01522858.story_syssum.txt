The National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, Kentucky, also said Saturday it and Chevrolet will restore three of the eight vehicles that the 45-foot-wide hole swallowed in February, but will leave the remains of the five others -- too wrecked to fix -- on display.
Frassinelli said the museum isn't revealing how much the renovation will cost.
The privately funded, not-for-profit attraction has gone from shock to proudly displaying its own spectacular damage in months.
By late April, visitors could walk into the Skydome and stand just feet from the hole's edge.
But their remains will continued to be displayed -- eventually back in the Skydome, where an exhibit will be dedicated to the sinkhole, the museum said.
Reports estimated the total value of the cars at more than $1 million.
