Car manufacturers from across the world, along with India's homegrown car companies, have descended on New Delhi for the 12th edition of the biannual Auto Expo show.
High-end marques like Jaguar will also be displaying new cars, like its F-Type Coupe.
Hyundai, currently the country's second-largest car manufacturer, will cut export figures to focus more on the domestic market and maintain market share.
"Based on market requirement, we will recalibrate our production between domestic and export market," Rakesh Srivastava, Hyundai Motor India's vice-president of marketing and sales, said in an interview with the country's Economic Times.
And while the automobile market might be in danger of stalling, India's sheer numbers mean that there are still thousands of new cars being introduced to India's already-congested roads every day.
The line, which opened at the beginning of February, traverses the western Indian city and will offer respite to some commuters  but much of the remainder of the country's public transportation network is antiquated and overburdened, meaning that cars are increasingly the choice of the growing middle class.
