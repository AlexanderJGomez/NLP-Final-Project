(CNN) -- "No one's ever asked to see my birth certificate.
But what, exactly, did Romney reveal with this pre-meditated "offhand" remark?
We already know that because he appears on media friendly to the right but limits the number and kind of questions reporters can ask him, and then responds with dodging answers.
It's just one more insinuation designed to distract us from the most disconcerting weaknesses of Romney's candidacy -- that he fails to offer details about his policy proposals and stubbornly refuses to disclose more than two years of tax returns.
His birth certificate dog-whistles are not just desperate, they are deliberate.
How we respond to Romney's remark will reveal a lot about us, as well.
The media, too, will reveal a lot about itself by its response.
Trying to pretend that somehow Obama is not an American-born leader, or questioning his patrioism, or his values by using the Big Lie often speaks in code.
Romney's birther remark was less a surprise than a confirmation that his moral compass is off center.
