(CNN) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who is being treated in Saudi Arabia after an attack on his compound, will return to Yemen on Friday, senior adviser Ahmed Al-Soufi told CNN.
Saleh will return strong and the will of the people will stand against any other will," he said.
Saleh will rule until the end of his term in 2013, Al-Soufi added.
In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said at the briefing Tuesday that she was not aware of reports that Saleh planned to return to Yemen Friday.
