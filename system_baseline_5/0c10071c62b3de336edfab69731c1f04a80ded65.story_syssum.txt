While the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were discovered in the mid-1990s, genetic testing for the genes is increasingly available.
Individuals with mutations in either of these genes have increased cancer risks, most notably for breast and ovarian cancer.
BRCA testing is a genetic test that looks at the sequence or code of the BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 genes.
For example, BRCA2 mutations are also associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer and male breast cancer.
If not, who should be?
Individuals with a personal or family history of breast cancer appearing before age 50, ovarian cancer at any age, breast cancer in both breasts, male breast cancer, multiple cases of breast cancer within a family, and breast cancer in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry should get genetic counseling to determine whether they should be tested.
Since BRCA mutations are not associated with pediatric cancer risks, testing for children is not recommended.
Considering the risk of breast or ovarian cancer based on age can be helpful in timing these interventions.
