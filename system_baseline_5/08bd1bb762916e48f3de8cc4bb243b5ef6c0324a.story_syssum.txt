(CNN) -- It's not easy taking over from one of the greatest managers in football history, but David Moyes has been assured that one trophy in his debut season at Manchester United will be considered a success.
The most important person in the club is the manager and that must always be sacrosanct.
The 18-year-old, who underlined his status before the international break as one of the game's hottest young prospects with two goals in his first EPL start, was again to the fore as United dominated the first half.
However, United's defensive frailties were once again exposed as Adam Lallana diverted in a scrambled shot from Dejan Lovren in the 89th minute to deny Moyes successive wins for the first time since joining from Everton.
However, the Cameroon striker's cheeky dispossession of David Marshall when the visiting keeper bounced the ball -- which allowed Eden Hazard to equalize with the first of his two goals -- left Cardiff boss Malky Mackay fuming.
He saw Samuel Eto'o standing next to him and he bounced the ball."
In the late match, Manchester City won away for the first time this season, beating West Ham 3-1 thanks to a double from Sergio Aguero to move above Southampton into fourth place.
