CHINHOYI, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe was celebrating his 85th birthday with a lavish all-day party Saturday despite the fact that the country is gripped by an economic and health crisis.
The program is designed to have white-owned farms given to blacks, and there have been violent seizures of such farms since the program began in 2000.
Mugabe's birthday falls on February 21 but his party loyalists postponed the celebrations as they were raising money for the event.
Mugabe invited Tsvangirai, his new partner in a power-sharing government, but a Tsvangirai spokesman said the opposition party leader turned it down.
Tsvangirai last year said Mugabe's birthday party was "a gathering of the satisfied few."
As Saturday's celebrations began in a carnival atmosphere, just less than a kilometer (0.62 miles) away stood a deserted Chinhoyi government hospital -- a reflection of the country's dire health situation.
On Friday Tsvangirai visited Harare Hospital, one of the country's biggest, and said its intensive care unit will need $30,000 in order to start operating again after a funding shortage.
