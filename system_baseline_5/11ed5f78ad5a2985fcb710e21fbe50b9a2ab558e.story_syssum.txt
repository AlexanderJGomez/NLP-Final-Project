Washington (CNN) -- A bomb threat made at an airport ticket counter in Dayton, Ohio, prompted a search of a US Airways flight that landed safely at Washington's Reagan airport Sunday, authorities said.
The plane was preparing to land when the airport was told to hold the flight, said Courtney Mickalonis, a spokeswoman for Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.
All passengers safely were taken off, and the bomb squad swept the plane, she said in an e-mailed statement.
The plane's passengers, meanwhile, were being questioned by FBI investigators, Mickalonis said.
