(CNN) -- The federal prosecution of former U.S. Rep. Rick Renzi of Arizona will continue, a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled Thursday.
He is also accused of misappropriating money from his family insurance business to fund his campaigns and for personal benefit.
Renzi could now appeal his case to the Supreme Court.
The case is U.S. v. Renzi (10-10088).
