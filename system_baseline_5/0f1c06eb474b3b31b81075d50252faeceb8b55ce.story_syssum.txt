Billionaire Petro Poroshenko declared victory Sunday in Ukraine's presidential election, following preliminary exit polls that suggested he got 56% of the vote.
Local officials said there was 11.8% turnout at these polling stations.
In the city of Donetsk, the regional capital where pro-Russia militias are concentrated, there were no open polling stations, local officials said earlier.
"Despite provocations and violence, millions of Ukrainians went to the polls throughout the country, and even in parts of eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatist groups sought to disenfranchise entire regions, some courageous Ukrainians still were able to cast their ballots," he said in a written statement.
Russia denies having direct influence over the militants, and Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he will respect the Ukrainians' choice.
The men, who as Chechens are Russian citizens, said they were there as "volunteers."
Also in Mariupol, people talked on social media about being asked by local Russia supporters to boycott the election.
The man, named as Andrea Rocchelli, was killed along with a Russian citizen, the ministry said.
