Loganville, Georgia (CNN) -- This is not a movie.
With two telephones to his ear, he listened to his wife, Melinda, as she fled into an attic of their Loganville home.
Relax," Herman said, trying to calm his wife.
Melinda Herman fired a six-shot revolver at the intruder, hitting him five times, in his torso and in his face.
They remind people that Melinda Herman had only a six-shot revolver.
"She shot him five times and he still didn't drop.
Donnie and Melinda Herman own two guns for protection at home, but until two weeks ago, she had never fired a gun.
On the phone, Donnie Herman calmly instructed his wife about the use of the weapon she had practiced on.
She's shooting him.

He learned later that his wife fired all six shots, and hit the intruder with all but one bullet.
Walton County Sheriff Joe Chapman -- whose office responded to the shooting at the Hermans' home -- said he believes the mother and her two children were in a life-and-death situation and she had no choice but to exercise her constitutional right to self-defense.
But Donnie Herman has told people he's not interested in being a poster boy for anyone.
She did what she was supposed to do as a responsible parent and gun owner," Herman told CNN affiliate WSB.
Experts also say that simply having a gun for self-protection does not guarantee safety.
Don't waste your time," he told CNN.
