She's just arrived at a party, organized by the small Ethiopian community on Malta.
But no one we know of has suffered quite like Shweyga.
Lying alone on a mattress on the floor, she told me how Aline Gadhafi and one of her staff poured boiling water over her head and body, simply because she'd been unable to stop one of the Gadhafi children from crying.
She yearns to see her family, but red-tape has slowed down efforts to bring her relatives to Malta.
Nurse Mary Rose Bonnici has been treating her since she arrived.
It's encouraging that her hair is growing back in places on her head.
I ask Shweyga about Aline Gadhafi and she speaks rapidly and with conviction.
Victims like Shweyga are still waiting for justice.
