It supplies Europe with about 30% of its natural gas, or 8% of its energy overall.
Longer term, Russia has much more to lose.
If Europe finds substitutes for its oil and gas, Russia simply would not be able to pay for the Western products it has become accustomed to buying.
Unless the West can impose significant costs on Russia for its aggressive policies, reduce Europe's vulnerability to a natural gas embargo and curtail Moscow's financial resources, it can count on Russia asserting military power when its leaders perceive threats to Russian interests in neighboring states.
Europeans should move quickly and decisively to develop their own natural gas and other alternatives.
The United States should not quickly volunteer to send Europe liquefied natural gas.
The high cost of liquefying and shipping U.S. gas to Europe requires that Europe also develop its own resources to fully unyoke itself from dependence on Russia and limit their strategic vulnerability.
