Coots was a third-generation "serpent handler" and aspired to one day pass the practice and his church, Full Gospel Tabernacle in Jesus Name, on to his adult son, Little Cody.
The National Geographic show featured Coots and cast handling all kinds of poisonous snakes -- copperheads, rattlers, cottonmouths.
In February 2013, Coots was given one year of probation for crossing into Tennessee with venomous snakes.
"He'll give up, just sooner or later," one of the members says.
"Catching two snakes the first day, 'course we'd hoped for more," Coots says in the video.
