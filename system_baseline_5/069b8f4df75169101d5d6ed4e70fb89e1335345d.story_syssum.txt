(CNN) -- Peru's president arrived Tuesday night at a mine in southern Peru, where he was expected to lead an operation to reach nine trapped miners.
They haven't said how many," the president said.
"It's very complicated work.
We won't abandon them," Merino said.
The ordeal stirred memories of a 2010 Chilean mine collapse in which 33 men were trapped underground for 69 days.
