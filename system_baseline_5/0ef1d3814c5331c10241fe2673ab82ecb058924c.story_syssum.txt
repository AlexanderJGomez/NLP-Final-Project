(CNN) -- One of the most enduring mysteries of the 20th century has been put to rest: DNA analysis of bone fragments has proven that two of Czar Nicholas' children believed to have escaped were killed with their royal family during the Russian Revolution.
The Romanov family, the last Russian monarchy, was executed in 1918 by Bolsheviks in the basement of a home in Yekaterinburg, about 900 miles (1,448 kilometers) east of Moscow.
But clues left by one of the family's assassins led investigators to the grave where the remains of Alexei and Maria were unearthed in 2007.
DNA tests showed she was not related to the Romanov family.
