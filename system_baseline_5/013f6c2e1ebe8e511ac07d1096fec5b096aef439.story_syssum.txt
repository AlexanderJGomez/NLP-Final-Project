But while our president has the benefit of Air Force One, millions of us with a "funny name" (Muslim and otherwise) do not.
One time, the woman in front of me had a hairdo that could pose more of a security threat than any head scarf could.
The TSA uses the hijab to profile Muslim women, and passengers can now expect a full-body pat-down, an appallingly invasive "enhanced pat-down search  that could include the chest and groin, or a planned "mind-scan"  that would track people's reaction to terrorist symbols.
It's hard for me too.
For people who aren't affected by racial profiling at airports, imagine this: The TSA implements a new rule to counter drunken driving, which kills over 13,000 Americans every year.
You also run into problems when you justify profiling nearly one in every four people in the world.
There are some people who don't know Muslims and are numb to realizing the effects of profiling.
According to the Pew Research Center, people who know Muslims are less likely to have negative views of them.
Religious profiling boxes Muslims into a category separate from Americans.
We can't accept that distinction.
