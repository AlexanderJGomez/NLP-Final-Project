"There were so many people out," Jones says.
The stress of waiting in gridlock can get intense if you're in a hurry, leaving you feeling frustrated and anxious about the traffic.
LeeAnne Minnick was sitting in gridlocked traffic, waiting to get on an on-ramp, in a line of cars that had pulled over to let an ambulance pass.
She doesn't act aggressively toward other drivers, but she does get bothered by disrespectful behavior on the road.
This venting may feel good in the moment, but it reinforces the emotions for the next driving trip, he says.
You may realize that your negative thoughts may not be proportional to the offenses you perceive from other drivers.
The "aggressive, combative, competitive frame for driving" may be linked to our evolutionary past, but it could have implications for cardiovascular disease, says David Strayer, a psychology professor at the University of Utah.
"In the simulator studies we've done, they'll actually start driving by cars and flipping them off and honking at them," Strayer says.
Long-term stress increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, he says.
People get bored while driving for a long time.
Strayer and colleagues used a driving simulator to look at just how distracting technology can be in the car.
About one in three fatalities on the road can be linked to some kind of distraction; some estimates put this figure even higher, Strayer says.
But even hands-free, voice-activated interaction with phones can be distracting, Strayer says.
After several years, the daily drive to and from work in high-traffic areas can really get under some people's skin.
Puett now lives in a more urban neighborhood of Denver, where he can walk and bike around.
(He'll accept longer commutes if they're short-term commitments.)
And Minnick says she loves her job enough to make the trek from Athens three times a week.
I'm really good at knowing what's going to make me happy for two hours."
