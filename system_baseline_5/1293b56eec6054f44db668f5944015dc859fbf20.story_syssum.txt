(CNN) -- At least 25 people have died after Typhoon Usagi slammed into the coast of southern China, state media reported Monday.
It left at least two people dead and three others missing in the Philippines and at least nine people injured in Taiwan.
Major Chinese airlines, including China Southern Air, canceled flights into the provinces of Guangdong and Fujian, Xinhua reported.
In neighboring Fujian Province, more than 80,000 people were evacuated and 50,000 disaster-relief personnel were deployed, Xinhua reported.
At its peak, Usagi eclipsed Super Typhoon Utor, which hit the Philippines and South China last month, as the strongest storm of the year so far.
