During 15 years of talking to high school students about sex and bullying, Laurie Halse Anderson has continued to get the same questions from boys: Why was the main character in her book, "Speak," so upset about what happened to her?
And yet, many parents still struggle to find the words or the courage to talk to teens about sex and intimacy, Anderson said.
Anderson said she wrote "Speak" based on her own experience of being raped as a teen.
Today, if you're a victim of any crime, including sexual violence, you can go online and "find someone who's walked in your shoes who can help you make sense of what happened," she said.
That feeling is understandable, but it's why we still need to do more to reduce the stigma around rape," she said.
"It used to be that we teach girls not to be raped, but we need to start teaching boys not to be rapists, and that's a really hard thing for parents of boys to process," she said.
I think we're all trying to find the right language surrounding sexual assault.
"Speak" is about teen rape, the pressures of high school and the insularity of small-town life, but most importantly, it's about overcoming stigma, Anderson said.
