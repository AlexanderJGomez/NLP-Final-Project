Cicciaro died that night, and White was arrested.
Riverhead police say this all started with an Internet prank sent from the MySpace page of White's son, 20-year-old Aaron.
The night Cicciaro was killed, he was at a party with the girl when they spotted Aaron White.
Then, police say, John White shot Cicciaro at point-blank range.
But the rape threat that sparked the confrontation between Daniel Cicciaro and Aaron White was not real.
White's attorneys say that racism lies at the heart of the confrontation and that John White feared Cicciaro and his friends were going to kill his son.
With tears in their eyes, Daniel and Joanne Cicciaro say their last image of their son was in the hospital, drenched in blood and being given CPR.
"I saw his blank eyes open, staring at the ceiling."
