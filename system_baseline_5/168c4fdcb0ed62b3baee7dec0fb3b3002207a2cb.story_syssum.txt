Maybe not.
Why aren't air traffic controllers using it to constantly track all commercial airliners?
• Two transponders that could send identification and altitude data to air traffic control radar screens.
Throughout most of the world, air traffic controllers still track airplanes with radar -- which uses technology dating back to the 1940s.
In these cases, air traffic controllers see only a blip on radar screens.
• Later, the plane sends a final radio call as it transitions between Malaysia air traffic controllers to controllers in Vietnam.
• Later, an orbiting satellite checks in with the plane's satellite transceiver, kind of like a cell tower pinging a mobile phone.
In the wake of the tragedy, some called for airlines to modify their transponders to prevent anyone from being able to shut them off in flight.
We might know more about what happened to MH370 if air traffic controllers used orbiting satellites to track airliners, instead of radar.
Another emerging technology that might have helped us know more about what happened is called AFIRS, the Automated Flight Information Reporting System, developed by a Canadian company called FLYHT.
If all airliners were equipped this way, we could know a flight was in trouble even if the crew could not communicate by other means.
Possibly.
Although technology continues to shrink the planet in terms of communication, the tragedy offers a bitter reminder of how easy it still is to lose an entire airliner full of people.
