(EW.com) -- In the "Incredible Burt Wonderstone," Steve Carell and Steve Buscemi play world-famous Las Vegas magicians.
One night, the two are working with a brand-new assistant, Jane (Olivia Wilde), performing a classic trick that requires Burt and Jane to huddle inside a box, which Anton jabs with swords.
"Burt Wonderstone" seems to be reaching for the tone of early Farrelly brothers movies like Kingpin, and also for the madcap hostility of Zoolander.
He beats Burt and Anton at their own game, and their act starts to fall apart.
Yet the movie itself is too cautious and unimaginative to bring off what a great magic trick â€” or comedy â€” should do: make us laugh out loud with surprise.
