Nway prepares for her new job, selling vegetables from her aunt's garden.
A year later, an aid worker returned to the village to see how Nway was doing.
Pam Sitko, the aid worker, said Nway -- like thousands of people in Myanmar -- is slowly recovering one year after Nargis demolished their country.
The brunt of the storm hit Myanmar's delta region, the country's bread basket.
"Most of the people are going back to their livelihoods," Marina said.
That hope appears to have spread to Nway.
Nway survived because she was staying with her aunt.
Nway wouldn't talk about the cyclone after aid workers found her a month later.
Nway prefers to talk about other subjects.
Nway told Sitko that she's made "four new best friends."
Nway doesn't know, though, where she would attend school as she gets older, Sitko said.
The shocked girl who aid workers met a year ago has changed, Sitko said.
I think she's been really transformed by our experience."
