(EW.com) -- ABC entertainment president Paul Lee says he's going to take a look at the long-gestating Star Wars live-action TV series now that the Disney deal to acquire Lucasfilm is complete.
Even many working in Hollywood don't realize a live-action Star Wars TV series has been sitting on the shelf the past few years.
The scripts gathered dust, the scope of the production and the extent of the show's necessary visual effects deemed too expensive for a broadcast or cable network.
The Star Wars show was budgeted at more than $5 million per episode and Lucasfilm wanted to retain ownership.
Cautious brand managers are sometimes reluctant to have a live-action TV show on the air when producing live-action films â€” such as Warner Bros. putting the kibosh on any Batman TV projects while making Christopher Nolan's trilogy.
So maybe something oblique is the way to [approach the Star Wars universe] rather than going straight head-on at it."
Set between the original Star Wars film trilogy and the prequels, the time period allows for all sorts of potential appearances from classic figures from the Star Wars universe.
