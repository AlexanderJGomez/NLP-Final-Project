For the past six seasons of "Lost," every single episode has brought us at least one new oddity to ponder.
So, guys, here are 10 questions we need the answers to on Sunday.
What the heck is the island?
Is the island hell and everyone on it is dead, as Isabella told Ricardo?
Jacob has been tasked with guarding the white light for forever, and in this week's episode, Jack volunteered to take over the job -- which makes sense, as Jacob tells him that the light is near the bamboo field where he awoke in the show's first seconds.
Why?
Last episode, we found out that Desmond is a "fail safe."
Because of the explosion, or has the island always been his destiny too?
Why can't women have babies on the island?
When Jack took over for Jacob, Jacob said Jack must "do what he couldn't -- kill him."
In last year's season finale, the Man in Black convinced Ben to kill Jacob.
I'm worried that in the final showdown between Jack and the Man in Black, Jack might not come out alive.
Why?
How?
