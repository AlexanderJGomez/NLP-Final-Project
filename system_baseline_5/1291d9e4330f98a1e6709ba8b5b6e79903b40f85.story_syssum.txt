The manhunt for Eric Matthew Frein, accused of killing a Pennsylvania state trooper, is over.
"We just thought it was fitting," State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said.
The squad of 13 U.S. marshals -- armed like a military special operations squad -- found Frein at an abandoned airport near Tannersville, authorities said.
And he wasn't armed at the time of his capture, according to police, much to the relief of authorities who feared a violent showdown.
"He's been stashing food, he's been staying out in the woods," Noonan said.
And also, he had been preparing himself by participating in these re-enactments, especially in the Vietnam era, where he specifically trained himself and trained with other people to hide in the woods and avoid detection."
Tom Corbett said he expects authorities to make sure Frein stays safe.
After his arrest, Frein made statements implicating himself in the shootings, according to a law enforcement official who was briefed on the capture.
"Eric Frein had a mission that was to attack law enforcement," Noonan said.
There was no indication that anyone was helping Frein, who was "quite well-prepared," Noonan said.
We didn't go out of school for weeks for recess," resident Shannon Juirad told WNEP.
But with Frein in custody, the trick-or-treating will go on as normal, said Barrett Township Board Chairman Ralph Megliola.
We are so proud of our Pennsylvania State Police, their hard work," another said.
