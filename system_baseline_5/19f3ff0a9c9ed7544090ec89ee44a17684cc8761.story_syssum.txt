The Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant -- the subject of a battle between state authorities and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission over its continued operation -- uses one of 23 U.S. reactors built with a General Electric-designed containment housing known as the Mark I.
No nuclear plant could have avoided a meltdown after being swamped by a tsunami and losing power to cooling systems for an extended period of time, the company says -- and at least one expert CNN spoke to agrees.
Three Mile Island used an entirely different design, but the NRC began an extensive safety review after the accident that resulted in several changes to the Mark I.
Arnie Gundersen, a former nuclear engineer and a leading critic of the Vermont Yankee plant, says the Japanese accident shows the Mark I containment system can't prevent a release of radioactivity in a meltdown.
The NRC has rejected a petition by anti-nuclear groups to immediately shut down all reactors using the GE Mark I containment.
As for GE, he said, "They got the rule book from the federal government, and they said 'This is all you have to design it for.'
Tetuan said the nuclear industry is still studying what happened in Japan, "and there will undoubtedly be lessons learned that will need to be implemented across the industry and across all types of nuclear plants, including the Mark I."
But he added, "The GE Mark I containment structure design is a proven, reliable technology.
"It took three years at Three Mile Island to be able to open up the pressure vessel," Lee said.
The U.S. nuclear industry hasn't built a new reactor since Three Mile Island.
