ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- You are about to meet Mr. Brown.
The show focuses on Mr. Brown and his daughter Cora, played by Mann's real-life wife, Tamela Mann, as Mr. Brown tries to turn his house into a home for the elderly.
"If it hadn't been for Cora, Mr. Brown and Madea probably would have killed each other by now," Mann said.

Mr. Brown never seems too far from Mr. Mann.
Yeap, Mr. Brown is always 'round somewhere.
No, I'm Mr. Brown," he said.
