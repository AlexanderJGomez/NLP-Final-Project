"I feel safer on an airplane than I do in my clinic," Carhart said, sitting at his desk in his windowless office in Bellevue, Nebraska.
Anti-abortion groups, led by Operation Rescue, plan to launch protests outside Carhart's clinic this weekend in Bellevue, just south of Omaha.
"Operation Rescue has said Dr. Carhart is the next target ...," said Katherine Spillar, executive vice president with the Feminist Majority Foundation.
Abortion rights supporters were predominant in the 50 to 75 people gathered outside the clinic Friday morning.
He said he abhorred the killing of Tiller.
He said he was confident his organization would have shut down Tiller this summer through a legal battle.
Carhart has vowed to open an office in Kansas and said he'll keep doing abortions as long as he's healthy.
Carhart was performing an abortion in his clinic when Tiller was killed that Sunday morning.
The outside of his office has the name of his clinic in bold letters: Abortion & Contraception Clinic of Nebraska.
On Friday, Carhart teared up when talking about the abortion rights supporters outside his clinic.
Carhart remains unmoved.
"When they're ready to accept our position, then we'll sit down.
