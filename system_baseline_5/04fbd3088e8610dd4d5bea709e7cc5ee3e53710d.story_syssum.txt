CNN's Senior Vatican Analyst John L. Allen Jr. is following the pope during his U.S. trip.
Here's a typical example from early April: "The pope is not coming to get mixed up in the local political process," said Italian Archbishop Pietro Sambi, the pope's ambassador to America, in an interview with the National Catholic Reporter.
So far, the more Catholic a state, the better Clinton has done.
With her back to the wall not long ago in Ohio and Texas, Clinton decisively outpolled Sen. Barack Obama among Catholic Democrats.
Clinton does better than Obama among Latinos, who are disproportionately Catholic.
Either Clinton or Obama could make a strong appeal to Catholics on peace-and-justice issues, yet both are out of sync with Catholic teaching on issues such as abortion, stem-cell research and gay rights.
Clinton likewise has top-drawer Catholic advisers.
In a tight race, movement of even a few percentage points among Catholics could be decisive.
