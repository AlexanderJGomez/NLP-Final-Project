Julie Chaffetz and her husband, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, pose in front of a view of Washington.
No one makes you read the bills, but to do the job right, you must.
Through trial and error, Julie and I have learned some important strategies for making our family time count.
We married in February 1991.
Since Jason was elected to Congress, I have learned to adapt to many new challenges.
Although I'm not a perfect mother, I've got great kids who reward me with hugs, smiles, occasional pouts and late-night chats.
She recommended that when Jason is in Washington, I spend time doing the things I need to do on my own, such as errands, volunteering, time with friends, helping with homework, and home projects like learning how to repair a toilet -- and yes, I mastered this skill!
Family and friends are a big part of my support.
And we still manage to read good books, too.
Although I was tempted to be bugged, I chose to be flexible.
