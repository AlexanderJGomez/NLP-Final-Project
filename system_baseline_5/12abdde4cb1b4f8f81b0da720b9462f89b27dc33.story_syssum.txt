LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- California's director of adult prisons is recommending against "compassionate release" for a terminally ill former Manson family member, a spokeswoman said.
Atkins had been held for years at the Corona prison, which earlier determined that she met the criteria for compassionate release under the law, and sent her request to the corrections department.
The court, based in Los Angeles, can either grant or deny Atkins' request.
Atkins, known within the Manson family as "Sadie Mae Glutz," has been in prison since 1971 and has been denied parole 11 times.
According to historical accounts of the murders, Atkins stabbed Tate, who was 8Â½ months pregnant, and wrote the word "pig" in blood on the door of the home the actress shared with her husband, director Roman Polanski.
Atkins, like family leader Charles Manson, received a death sentence.
Atkins is a born-again Christian, according to a Web site maintained by her husband.
