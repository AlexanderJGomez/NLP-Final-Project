In South Korea, suicide is a real threat.
Officials have made mental health workers available to the families, but despite the enormity of the tragedy, they find themselves not busy.
Police said he used a belt to apparently hang himself from a tree near a gymnasium in Jindo, where the distraught relatives of missing passengers have been camping out.
His suicide is hardly the first, nor the most high-profile, in recent memory in South Korea.
And desperation abounds.
