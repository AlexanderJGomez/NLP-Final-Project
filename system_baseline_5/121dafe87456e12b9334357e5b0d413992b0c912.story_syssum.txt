Bogota, Colombia (CNN) -- Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos officially announced he will seek re-election, a decision that could affect the ongoing peace talks between the government and the FARC.
Santos says he wants to be re-elected to finish the peace process he started.
Seeking a second term was his only option given that the peace process is still underway, he said.
CNN's Mariano Castillo reported and wrote the story in Atlanta.
