Phil Spector's first murder trial in 2007 ended in a mistrial as jurors said they couldn't reach a verdict.
"The evidence did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty for the simple reason [that] he did not kill Lana Clarkson," Weinberg said.
"I'm going to stand by him and get him out of that awful place so he can come home where he belongs."
Spector's first murder trial in 2007 ended in a mistrial as jurors said they couldn't reach a verdict after 15 days of deliberations.
He said the possibility that Clarkson committed suicide could not be ruled out.
Do pointed out to jurors, however, that Clarkson had bought new shoes on the day of her death -- something he said a suicidal woman would not have done.
In the 2007 trial, Spector's attorneys argued that Clarkson was depressed over a recent breakup and grabbed a .38-caliber pistol to kill herself while at Spector's home.
That was one of two Grammy Awards won by Spector, who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989.
He stayed out of the public eye for two decades before his 2003 arrest in Clarkson's death.
