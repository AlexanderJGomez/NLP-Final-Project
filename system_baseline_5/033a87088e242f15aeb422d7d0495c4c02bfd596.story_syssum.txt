Hours after the wedding, groom William Riley Knight, 49, of Crown Point, Indiana, was struck and killed.
"He said, 'We've got to stop, it's late and they need help,' " Nikki, a registered nurse, told the Chicago newspaper.
According to CNN affiliate WBBM, which spoke to Knight's ex-wife, he had four children, including two stepchildren.
"He was very outgoing, always wanting to help somebody," said friend Rob Biella, CNN affiliate WLS reported.
"He was just trying to do a good thing for somebody in need," the spokeswoman said.
