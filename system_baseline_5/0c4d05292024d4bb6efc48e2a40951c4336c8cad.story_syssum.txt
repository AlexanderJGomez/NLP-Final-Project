A seizure disorder caused the death of Jett Travolta, the 16-year-old son of actors John Travolta and Kelly Preston, a source at a Bahamas funeral home told CNN.
And the risk of seizures is higher for children with disabilities such as autism and cerebral palsy, Shinnar said.
Jett Travolta had a developmental disability that his parents have linked to Kawasaki disease, an inflammatory disorder of the artery walls that most commonly occurs in young children.
The reports that a seizure disorder caused Jett's death were preliminary, Gupta said.
"Kawasaki disease is due to an abnormal immunnologic response, probably to an infectious agent or infection we don't yet understand," Patterson said.
Someone with Kawasaki could have seizures for one of two reasons, but they would be rare, he said.
A very small study released in 1991 found an association between cases of Kawasaki disease in homes where carpet had been cleaned in the past 30 days.
