A member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Graham said he intends to propose a measure that would mandate more sanctions, aimed at forcing Iran to dismantle its nuclear program, a move that runs counter to interim steps sought by multinational negotiators earlier this month in Geneva, Switzerland.
Those three days of intense discussions involving top diplomats concluded early Sunday without an agreement, though numerous key players indicated things were moving forward.
Sanctions have long  been a tool for the United States, in coordination with other nations, to clamp down on Iran and compel it not to move toward developing nuclear weapons.
Sen. Tim Johnson, a South Dakota Democrat and chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, won't decide whether he'll go forward with a proposal for more sanctions until after Wednesday's briefing and talks with his colleagues, a committee aide said.
"I think today is the day in which I witnessed a future of nuclear war in the Middle East in the future (that) someday will be part of our children's heritage," Kirk said.
"Punishing" sanctions "forced Iran to the negotiating table," he said.
"And those who take that position ought to be clear that they, in essence, are suggesting that war is the only alternative."
