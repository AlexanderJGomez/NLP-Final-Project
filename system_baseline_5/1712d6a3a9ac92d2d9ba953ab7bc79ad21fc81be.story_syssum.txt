Madeline Loftus, 24, was killed aboard Flight 3407.
Breaking down in tears, she said the game was filled with sadness because "Maddy wasn't here."
Her teammates said they decided to play the game out, because Loftus would've wanted them to play on.
Loftus, 24, of Parsippany, New Jersey, played two seasons at Buffalo State from 2002 to 2004 before transferring to St. Mary's University in Minnesota after her sophomore year.
She will always hold a special place in my heart," said Terry Mannor, St. Mary's women's hockey coach.
About 1,000 people gathered at a church in western New York Monday to remember the crash victims.
All 49 passengers and crew members aboard the 74-seat turboprop were killed when the plane crashed into a home in Clarence Center, New York, on Thursday night.
â€¢ Co-pilot Rebecca Shaw's father said she loved to fly and "couldn't believe she'd get paid" when she took the job.
On the ice rink in Buffalo Saturday, Loftus' friends played with a heavy heart.
Everybody loved being around her," said rink manager Jim Fowler.
"Maddy was enthusiastic about life and especially about women's hockey."
