After a smaller landslide struck the same area in 2006, officials invested millions of dollars to reduce the hazards, and residents felt safe, Snohomish County Emergency Management Director John Pennington contended this week.
Officials and many residents have long known they live in landslide country, Pennington said.
"This is a valley lined with landslides, going back 14,000 years when the glaciers left," Haugerud said.
Experts and residents now wonder whether more aggressive government action is needed for communities near sliding terrain.
The 56-page study identified "a very large volume of material that could potentially become unstable," he said this week.
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers spokeswoman Patricia Graesser said the study spoke to how people were living in the landslide area but the report wasn't a risk assessment of landslide hazards.
"I currently have no basis for estimating the probable rate or timing of future landslide activity," Miller's study states.
Local officials apprised residents of the perils as public improvements were made after the 2006 landslide, Pennington said.
While authorities might have done more -- like making sure that all landowners knew about the risk -- that doesn't absolve residents who built houses there, Miller said.
"Ultimately, there was no way to know when a landslide would occur," Miller said.
"Fishing is a big deal here in Washington," Haugerud said.
"This is a corner of the world where the majority of the people are very happy not to have much government regulations," Haugerud said.
Speaking as a Washington state resident -- and not as government geologist -- Haugerud said reforms may be needed to ensure local officials impose stricter regulations in landslide zones.
