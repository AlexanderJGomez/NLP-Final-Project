(Financial Times) -- "It's very important that Apple not become the developer for the world," Tim Cook, Apple chief executive, told analysts last month.
"I don't know if the parties will settle; this case is just one part of a very complex ecosystem, and putting CEOs in the room together is always a roll of the dice," says Mark Lemley, a professor at Stanford Law School.
The urgency for Apple and its lawyers is that Samsung has overtaken it in smartphone sales on the back of Apple's leadership in innovation.
The battle with Samsung began in Northern California in April 2011, with Apple filing a 373-page complaint of patent and trademark infringement.
Samsung hit back with its own list of alleged patent infringements by Apple -- backed by its 6,000-strong US telecoms patent portfolio and its claim to have first introduced a smartphone as far back as 1999.
David Martin, chairman of M-Cam, a US patent analysis company, says there is so much "prior art" -- earlier innovations covering similar ground -- that Apple and Samsung are inviting subsequent third-party litigation by airing the strengths and weaknesses of their patents in public.
Apple did not respond to a request for comment on its litigation.
