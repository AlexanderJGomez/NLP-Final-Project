New York (CNN) -- Judson Box has never known exactly how his son, Gary, died on September 11, 2001.
She mentioned her brother Gary, and the employee showed her to a picture of a firefighter in the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel that had a caption bearing Gary's name.
"I was out of out control, emotionally," Box said.
Several months later, the museum gave him the e-mail address of Erik Troelson, a Danish businessman who was stranded in the tunnel on his way to a meeting when he snapped the picture of Gary.
"Gary Box was one of the guys."
"I think I said about 300 times thank you and God bless you, that's all I could say," Box said.
Nine years after September 11, Box said he still feels the pain of that day.
