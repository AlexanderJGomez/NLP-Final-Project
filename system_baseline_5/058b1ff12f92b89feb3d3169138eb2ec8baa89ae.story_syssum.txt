In a written response sent to CNN by Snapchat, Spiegel, now 23, apologized for the e-mails.
A Snapchat spokeswoman told CNN that Spiegel had no further comment.
Spiegel created Snapchat along with fraternity brother Bobby Murphy while attending Stanford.
Snapchat claims its users send more than 700 million photos and videos a day.
Snapchat reportedly turned down a $3 billion acquisition offer from Facebook last fall.
