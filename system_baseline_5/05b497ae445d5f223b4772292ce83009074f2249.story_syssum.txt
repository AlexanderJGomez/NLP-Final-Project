ROME, Italy (CNN) -- Officials monitoring the River Tiber in Rome fear it could break its banks as early as Friday evening after a spate of bad weather in Italy -- but do not expect major flooding.
"I just recommend people to stay at home and not to rush to the river banks to watch the river swelling," Alemanno said.
Hundreds of volunteers and civil protection officials have been deployed around Rome to monitor the situation, the Civil Protection Department said.
One woman died near Rome early Thursday when her car was submerged by a wave of water and mud in an underpass.
