Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- More than 30 people have been shot dead in Nigeria, the head of Amnesty International said Friday, only a day after the rights group accused Nigerian security forces of committing serious abuses in their efforts to crack down on the militant Islamist group Boko Haram in the region.
Shetty appealed for the government to ensure the rule of law was followed by its own forces in tackling the militant groups.
In its report Thursday, Amnesty International condemned the increasingly brutal attacks carried out by Boko Haram since 2009, but said Nigeria's security forces "have perpetrated serious human rights violations" in their response.
A spokesman for the Nigerian military, Col. Mohammed Yerima, rejected the allegations made in Thursday's report.
If they are found not to be members of Boko Haram, we release them immediately, take them back to where we picked them up and we apologize," he said.
Amnesty International said it had shared its findings with the Nigerian authorities before it published the report, as well as requesting further information on certain cases, but that it had received no response.
Boko Haram and other Muslim groups claim the north has been starved of resources and marginalized by the government of President Goodluck Jonathan, a Christian.
