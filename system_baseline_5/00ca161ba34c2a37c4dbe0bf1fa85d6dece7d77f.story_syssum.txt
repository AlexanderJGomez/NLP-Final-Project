Today, the services built on top of that network have done a great job in enabling communications, perhaps none more dramatically than Twitter.
Not at all.
There's no reason that organizations or individuals who want to use the Web to relay critical information have to rely on Twitter or Facebook or Google or any other giant of the technology industry in the first place.
The company has even shown a reassuring sensitivity to the civic and social obligations that come from running such a popular communication service.
But the Web is bigger than any one site or any one social network.
Smart inventors have already made cutting-edge technologies that let any site deliver messages with the same immediacy as Twitter or Facebook.
Now the challenge is reminding all of the social institutions, media organizations and government agencies that they need to use their own communications infrastructure just as much as they participate in services such as Twitter and Facebook.
We can run our own Web sites, at our own Web addresses and keep control over how we communicate.
This is, after all, how the Web was designed to work.
Because we'll have a web of independent but connected communications systems, just as the Internet was always designed to be.
