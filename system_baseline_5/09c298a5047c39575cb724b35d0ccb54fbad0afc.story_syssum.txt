The discovery of antibiotics revolutionized medicine some 75 years ago.
Some infections didn't respond to antibiotics, because the bacteria that caused them were "resistant" -- that is, they could disable an antibiotic, or pump it out as fast as it got into a bacterial cell.
For over 60 years, poultry and livestock have been fed antibiotics for their "growth-promoting" and "disease-preventing" effects.
These antibiotics act on the bacteria that live on and in all animals, suppressing the growth of bacteria that are sensitive to the antibiotic and favoring the growth of bacteria that are resistant.
Because of this, the European Union banned the use of antibiotics in animals as growth promoters in 2006.
In the intervening 40 years, the evidence linking antibiotic use in food animals and antibiotic-resistant infections in humans has continued to grow.
The FDA has done little more than to urge drug companies to "voluntarily" stop marketing antibiotics for growth promotion -- but antibiotic use for disease "prevention" is not discouraged, and proposed rules even weaken veterinary oversight of this practice.
Clearly, however, many entities involved in the sale and use of growth-promoting and preventive antibiotics in food animals profit from this practice and have effectively fought to delay its regulation and restriction.
Encouragingly, the resulting decreases in antibiotic use in the community can be linked to decreases in antibiotic-resistant infections.
