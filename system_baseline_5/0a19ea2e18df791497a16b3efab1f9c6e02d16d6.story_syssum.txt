(CNN) -- Egypt's revolution has made life tougher still for Cairo's 80,000 taxi drivers, struggling to make a living on the city's chaotic, congested and potholed streets, says the author who has written a best-selling book about them.
"My taxi drivers are among the 55% of the population living under the poverty line of $2 a day," said AlKhamissi.
AlKhamissi, whose second novel "Noah's Ark" -- also a bestseller -- was published in 2009, said he stopped writing his third novel at the start of the uprising on January 25 this year and has been unable to concentrate on writing since.
He said: "Some journalists have said that about my book, but it's nonsense to say that one book or 10 books can change reading habits.
AlKhamissi said he dreams of an Egypt where taxi drivers could have the time and education to read his -- or any other -- book.
"Twenty years ago there was nothing for 16, 17, 18-year-olds to read," said Towfik.
Towfik said that despite Egypt's revolution, he still fears the scenes in his book, first published in Arabic in 2009, could come true.
"The first uprising came from the middle class, but I think another bloodier one could come from the lower classes, like described in my book 'Utopia'.
