(CNN) -- I was born in Tallahassee, Florida, in 1954, the year of the landmark school desegregation case, Brown v. Board of Education.
Forty-four years later, in 2002, my husband and I left Massachusetts and returned to the South -- initiating our family's reverse migration.
As school districts move back to "neighborhood school" policies, white students will likely have less school contact with people of color than their parents had.
At most highly segregated white schools, middle-class students are in the majority.
Conversely, academic performance is likely to improve if the student attends a middle-class school, even if his or her own family is poor.
Children of color in under-resourced, racially isolated schools also need these same tools.
Providing these resources equitably is a daunting task, one that has never been accomplished in the history of education in the United States.
