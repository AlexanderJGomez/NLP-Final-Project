(CNN) -- Two Alaskan volcanoes that began minor eruptions weeks ago are showing their strongest seismic activity yet, emitting small amounts of lava and ash along with smoke plumes, the Alaska Volcano Observatory said Tuesday.
Veniaminof, about 60 miles from Pavlof, started showing activity in early June and began erupting June 13, Schneider said.
It has also produced a lava flow and an ash plume, though not as high as Pavlof -- only about 8,200 feet.
"Our best estimate of what is going to happen is similar to what's happened in the past -- this level of activity and some level of ash."
