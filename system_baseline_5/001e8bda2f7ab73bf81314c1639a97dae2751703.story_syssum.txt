New York (CNN) -- Northeast Florida State Attorney Angela Corey has made it clear that she alone will decide whether George Zimmerman will be charged in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.
They said they had lost contact with their client over the previous two days and revealed Zimmerman's unusual behavior -- including phone calls to Fox News host Sean Hannity and the special prosecutor, Corey.
Not surprisingly, within hours of the now-infamous withdrawal, Corey issued a statement saying she would be holding her own news conference within 72 hours "to release new information regarding the Trayvon Martin shooting death investigation."
Many suspect that the announcement that Zimmerman had gone rogue forced the special prosecutor's hand.
In discussing the investigation into the shooting death of Martin she said, "What we are asking people to do is take a step back.
And I look forward to meeting with them to try to help them on this journey.
If she files charges against Zimmerman, it would be wise not to "overcharge" the case.
So even if Zimmerman killed Martin, he was justified in doing so if he believed he was in danger of being killed himself or of suffering great bodily harm.
Former Florida State Rep. Dennis Baxley, the co-sponsor of the law, told me by phone that the law doesn't apply to Zimmerman if he pursued Martin and was the initial aggressor.
Martin was 17 years old, Zimmerman, 28.
Zimmerman tells the dispatcher he is following Martin.
Martin asks Zimmerman why he is following him.
Three witnesses saw Zimmerman straddling Martin in the grass.
A tenet of our legal system is that when there is conflicting evidence, let a jury decide.
