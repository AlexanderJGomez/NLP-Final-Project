Can we please stop saying, "Happy New Year?"
Seamon-Primas told me: "In my opinion, after the first week, I stop wishing others a Happy New Year, the new year is well on its way."
The biggest reason we need to stop New Year's wishes weeks into the year is that it sounds so insincere.
And when is the last time you heard a "Happy St. Patrick's Day" on March 19?

One such superstition tells us that eating poultry on New Year's Day means you will financially struggle for the coming year, which I really wish I had known before I ate chicken with mixed vegetables on January 1.
If even one custom instructed us that extended New Year's wishes would increase the chances the year would indeed be a good one, I'd be saying Happy New Year's every day until April.
However, even if you are reading this after January 7, I still sincerely wish you, and your family, a very happy and healthy New Year.
