(CNN) -- Ian Livingstone may not be the father of Lara Croft, but maybe at 63 he can be labeled the grandfather of Lara, the Tomb Raider.
And there she was, Lara Croft.
And we had to have her.
Livingstone and his school friend Steve Jackson enjoyed playing board games, especially role-playing games.
"We had to live in a van for three months as we tried to get people to understand this strange role-playing game," Livingstone told me.
Now, with a CBE in the pocket and the honor title of Life President for Eidos -- a brand name now owned by Square Enix -- Livingstone is more of a advocate for the British video games and film graphics business.
As Livingstone likes to point out, the UK games and graphics business is bigger than the film industry.
As for the new Tomb Raider, the reset is a chance to introduce Lara Croft to a new audience and make her a more realistic role model.
Here was this character that you played as Lara, who could sustain damage."
With the reboot now out, it can't be long before we read of a new Lara Croft film with a new, younger, actress to set the mark for a new franchise.
Lara lives on.
