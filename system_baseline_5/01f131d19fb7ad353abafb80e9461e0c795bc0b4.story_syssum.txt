"Selma" is a good film that told a great story, at least according to Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences voters.
But did those demographics play a role in how "Selma" was received?
And "Dallas Buyer's Club" was also a 2014 Oscar darling that sprinkled creative liberties all over a true story.
But all?
my favorite film of 2014 was "The Drop" and I don't think that was nominated for anything by anyone.
But I do not need her to win an Oscar to tell me how I should feel about "Selma."
Only that the true story of Selma is much more than calling out racism.
