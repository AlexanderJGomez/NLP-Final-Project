In the city of Tuscaloosa alone, at least 36 people lost their lives.
Employees huddled in a windowless break room at a CVS drug store in Tuscaloosa as a tornado approached and a deafening roar filled the air, store manager Michael Zutell said.
No one inside the store was injured, Zutell said.
"The last thing she said on the phone, she was taking shelter in a closet," he said.
"I'm screaming for her, 'Answer me, Mom -- please, Mom, answer me.'
I told her, 'Mom, the house is gone, you can put the broom down,'" Self said.
Christopher England, who recorded the video, said the tornado looked like a movie scene.
The lifelong resident of Tuscaloosa said the damage was unlike anything he had seen before.
