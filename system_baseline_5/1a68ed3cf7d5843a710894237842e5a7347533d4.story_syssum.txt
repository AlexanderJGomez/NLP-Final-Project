It's called kinesio tape.
With its Olympic popularity, athletic trainers say you can bet you will see a lot more of the tape at your local gym or on the playing field this year.
Because the tape is thin and pliable, it's different from athletic tape used on ankles or wrists, he says.
He thought the standard taping methods of the time were too restrictive and may even extend injuries, because they inhibited the flow of inflammatory fluids beneath the skin.
The company has trained more than 100,000 practitioners around the world on how to use the tape, Halpern says.
"A lot of athletes like it because there are no chemicals and it is a natural healing mechanism that tells different receptors to deactivate a little bit if the muscle gets too tight," Halpern says.
Robin Rogers, an Atlanta runner who is also a massage therapist for athletes, says he's a fan of the tape.
Rogers says he hasn't used the tape in any races yet.
Running coach and marathoner Tina Klein says she tried the tape, but it didn't work for her.
It's pretty-colored cotton tape."
