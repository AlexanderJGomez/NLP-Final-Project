CIA Director Michael Hayden said hunting down bin Laden remains his agency's priority.
Hayden said al Qaeda has been hurt by a sustained fight with the United States and its allies, but remains a threat.
Regardless of whether bin Laden is actively helping lead the terrorist organization, the CIA believes capturing or killing him would be a huge blow to al Qaeda, according to Hayden.
But I'm willing to bet that whatever happens, it would work in our favor," Hayden said.
