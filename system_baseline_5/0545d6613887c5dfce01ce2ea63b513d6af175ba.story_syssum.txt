It's not like Aasif didn't know anything about being a Muslim before he was hired by "The Daily Show" in 2006.
Jon Stewart made Aasif more Muslim-ish.
It's not like Jon Stewart intentionally wanted us to become more Muslim.
In Aasif's case, covering Muslim topics for "The Daily Show" was the cause.
These Daily Show experiences "radicalized" Aasif, turning him into, as he calls himself in the book, "the jihadist of irony."
Stewart being in this film was a big deal.
Stewart called Aasif on the phone -- which was the first time Jon ever had called him -- and asked, "How would you feel about talking about the issue on the show as Muslim?
Would you be okay with that?"
That is what Stewart did to us.
