With violence raging throughout the country as French and Malian forces fought to take back control of areas seized by Islamist rebels earlier this month, we had no time to waste.
On January 28, local authorities granted our team access to the town of Konna to conduct the first humanitarian assessment there.
Beginning with airstrikes on January 11, French and Malian military forces fought intensely against the Islamist rebels in Konna for more than a week, forcing many of the town's residents to flee their homes.
Similar threats of unexploded ordinances and remnants of Islamist rebels will persist throughout Mali, even as military operations begin to wind down.
The town's school remains closed, but health and nutrition services have started reopening with the support of local NGOs.
As soon as we gain access to Timbuktu, we'll conduct rapid assessments of its health facilities to determine the most pressing needs before initiating emergency response activities to provide staff, equipment and medication.
To help us help the estimated 4.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in Mali, donate to our emergency response fund.
