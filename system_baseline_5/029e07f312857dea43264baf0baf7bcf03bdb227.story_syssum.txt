(CNN) -- The president of Guinea-Bissau was assassinated Monday morning, a day after an explosion killed the head of the West African country's military, the prime minister said.
Gen. Tagme Na Waie, chief of Guinea-Bissau's military, was killed in a bomb explosion in his office Sunday, according to local news reports.
"The secretary-general strongly condemns these violent acts, which have occurred soon after successful legislative elections which paved the way for enhanced U.N. support to the country's peace-building efforts," the statement said.
Monday's development is the latest violence over four months as the army and Guinea-Bissau's president have clashed.
In 1980, Vieira became president after a military coup.
He held the post for five years, until a military mutiny ousted him, and the country plunged into civil war.
