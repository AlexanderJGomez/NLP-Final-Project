The demonstrators were supporters of deposed Egyptian President Mohammed Morsy, a former Muslim Brotherhood leader, Ahram Online said.
Definitive information on who shot her wasn't immediately available.
El-Sisi deposed Morsy last year following mass protests against Morsy's rule.
On Wednesday, police clashed with protesters at Cairo University who were demonstrating against a court's decision to sentence 529 supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood to death.
