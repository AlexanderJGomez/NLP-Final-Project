(CNN) -- Authorities have obtained an arrest warrant for Jesse Matthew, charging him with abduction with the intent to defile, in the case of missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo told reporters Tuesday.
Matthew willingly went to a police station over the weekend, along with several family members, walking through the front door and asking for a lawyer, Longo said.
On the evening of September 12, she was seen at a party before friends saw her at an apartment complex a couple of blocks away.
She was at a restaurant, witnesses said.
She and a man were seen having drinks at a bar between 1:30 and 2 a.m., WVIR said.
"Hannah is beyond precious to us," her parents said in a statement released shortly after her disappearance.
