As Clinton closed her campaign Saturday, she urged the cheering crowd of thousands to support Obama in his run for the White House, saying she and supporters should "take our energy, our passion and our strength and do all we can to help elect Barack Obama ...
In a CNN poll released Friday, 60 percent of Clinton supporters said they would vote for Obama, but 17 percent said they would vote for McCain and 22 percent, said they would not vote at all if Clinton were not the nominee.
Some of Clinton's top supporters say the best way to get the New York senator's 18 million voters behind Obama is by putting Clinton on the ticket.
No one brings to a ticket what Hillary brings," Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Sunday on ABC's "This Week."
But not everyone is behind the idea of a joint ticket.
Feinstein said she chatted with Clinton before Obama arrived.
"She really has to tell women why Barack Obama is the best candidate for president," Borger said.
CNN senior political producer Sasha Johnson said Clinton's speech was a "first step" in making inroads to persuade her supporters to back Obama, but she said it's too early to tell what the effect will be.
She shattered barriers on behalf of my daughters and women everywhere, who now know that there are no limits to their dreams.
