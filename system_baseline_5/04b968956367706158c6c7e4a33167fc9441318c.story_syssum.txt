The sheriff's report says Maldonado, 53, then drove about 460 miles north to Tallahassee in an attempt to kill his older son, JosÃ© Maldonado, who attends Florida State University.
The Broward Sheriff's report says Pedro Maldonado called a friend in Miami and admitted to killing his wife and son.
Later in the day, authorities learned that Maldonado might be in the Lake City area, about 100 miles east of Tallahassee.
They were good neighbors.
