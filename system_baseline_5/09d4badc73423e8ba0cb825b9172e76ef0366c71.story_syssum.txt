President-elect Barack Obama greets Sen. John McCain on stage after praising him at a bipartisan dinner.
"I am very grateful to the president-elect and to all of you for this very considerate gesture, and for allowing me to play a small role in the inauguration of the 44th president of the United States, even if it isn't the one I had in mind a few months ago," McCain said.
"We will not always agree on everything in the months to come, and we will have our share of arguments and debates," Obama said.
"I'm here tonight to say a few words about an American hero I have come to know very well and admire very much -- Sen. John McCain," Obama said as he opened his speech.
Wigal said Obama's inauguration has given residents hope that change actually will happen.
"It's all because of Obama -- we dare to feel positive that we may have actually elected a leader, not just a politician," she said.
Obama visited a National Day of Service project, stopping by the Sasha Bruce House, an emergency shelter for homeless teenagers in the Washington area.
Wigal said Obama's actions and words make her believe the president-elect has the skills needed to help the country move forward.
"Those of us who live and work here, who try to create, shape, influence and move policy forward, are feeling as if we can finally do something that'll result in forward motion," Wigal said.
"I am making a commitment to you, as your next president, that we are going to make government work," Obama said.
Incoming first lady Michelle Obama, joined by Jill Biden, the wife of the vice president-elect, spent the morning at a separate volunteer service event at RFK Stadium, where people were assembling care packages for soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.
