When police found the unconscious man in a Southern California Motel 6, the IDs on him said he was Michael Thomas Boatwright from Florida.
And he said it in Swedish.
Today, the 61-year-old man says he has come to terms with the name "Michael Boatwright," but only because doctors told him he should.
He'd served from 1971 to 1973 in the Navy as an aviation mechanic.
Turns out Boatwright taught English there for four years, until May.
Photos found with Boatwright in the motel room showed a young man living in what looked like a European city, not Asia.
The school in China told her he was divorced.
But when she contacted the Japanese and Chinese consulates, neither had next-of-kin information for him, according to the Desert Sun.
Everything Boatwright knows about his life before February 28 he knows because his social worker told him or because he read it on websites.
Boatwright told CNN he'd been a good tennis player, and the Tennis Channel had interviewed him years ago.
Fugue states, such as dissociative fugue, are often triggered by trauma, such as the death of a loved one or a serious accident, according to Dr. Aaron Anderson, a neurologist at Emory University School of Medicine.
He still feels isolated in the hospital, so Hunt-Vasquez encouraged him to reach out to members of the local Swedish-American community.
The hospital would like to discharge Boatwright, but they have no place to send him, said Richard Ramhoff, a spokesman for Desert Regional Medical Center.
