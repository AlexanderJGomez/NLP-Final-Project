Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- In 1998, Kevin Warwick became what some people call "the world's first cyborg."
To be exact, Warwick, a professor of cybernetics at Reading University, had a radio frequency ID chip implanted in his arm.
Warwick doesn't want to turn into a robot: He wants to be a better human.
Technologists, meanwhile, see "augmented reality" applications for smartphones as doing something similar for our brains, fortifying them for life in a world overflowing with data.
"Technology, directly integrated with the brain, can help overcome some problems people have," says Warwick.
