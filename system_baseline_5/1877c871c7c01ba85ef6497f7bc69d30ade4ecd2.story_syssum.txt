(Rolling Stone) -- On July 25th, 1965, Bob Dylan walked onstage at the Newport Folk Festival, plugged in his 1964 sunburst Fender Stratocaster and tore through a scorching three-song set.
In fact, Dylan says that's not what happened.
But experts make a strong case that the guitar in question is the same one Dylan played at the festival in 1965.
'A vast percentage of the stuff I get shown isn't real,' he says.
'By nature, I'm a defeatist.
"In one of these manuscripts, Dylan had written 'six flying horses,' and then above 'flying' he'd written 'white' and 'the.'
In 2005, Peterson wrote to Bob Dylan's management and requested that he waive any claim to the guitar.
Dylan's team declined, and said that the guitar should be returned.
