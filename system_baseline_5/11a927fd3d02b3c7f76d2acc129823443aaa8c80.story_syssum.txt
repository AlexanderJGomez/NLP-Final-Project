A 17-year-old male was charged Saturday as an adult with aggravated assault and other charges over a shooting the previous day at a Philadelphia high school, police said.
Detective Don Suchinsky said Saturday that a second male held for questioning was released to his mother.
The shooter was in the school gym with about seven other students, city police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said.
The school went into lockdown as law enforcement officers searched students and let them out of the school, said Stanford.
On Saturday, police said school security officials provided inaccurate information about the teen who was cleared and released.
"People send their kids to school; they shouldn't have to pick them up at the hospital," he said.
