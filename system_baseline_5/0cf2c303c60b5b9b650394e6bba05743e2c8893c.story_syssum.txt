An injured Morgan McCracken has benefited from awareness after Natasha Richardson's death.
"For the next two days, she was perfectly fine," Donald McCracken says.
And by the time I got off the phone with him, Morgan was sobbing, her head hurt so much," McCracken says.
"My heart sank," he says.
"Dr. Cohen told us that if we hadn't brought her in Thursday night, she never would have woken up," McCracken says.
In most cases, it's pretty clear when someone needs medical attention after a head injury, says Greg Ayotte, a spokesperson for the Brain Injury Association of America and a cognitive rehabilitation therapist.
In the case of epidural hematomas, the injury Richardson and Morgan had, blood pools in the area between the lining of the brain and the skull.
Here, from Ayotte and other experts, is a list of what to do after someone has suffered a head injury.
If the injured person has these signs, take him or her to an emergency room, says Dr. Jam Ghajar, clinical professor of neurological surgery at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, and president of the Brain Trauma Foundation.
Look for changes in symptoms and behavior
He also warns people to be extra vigilant when an elderly person hits his or her head.

The McCrackens say they look back and still can't believe Morgan suffered such a severe injury and didn't show any signs for 48 hours.
