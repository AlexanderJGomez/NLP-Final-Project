The explosion has shut off the flow of gas to Israel and Jordan, said Ayman Jahin, a general manager at the gas company.
Delivery of Egyptian gas to Israel came to a halt after an April attack on a pipeline in the Sinai Peninsula.
In February, a gas pipeline in El Arish that sent natural gas to Jordan was set on fire, shutting off the flow of gas to not only Israel but but Syria, Jordan and Lebanon as well.
