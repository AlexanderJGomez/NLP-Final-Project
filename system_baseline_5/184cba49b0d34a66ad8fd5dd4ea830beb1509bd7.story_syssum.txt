"It's very, very important to keep that place open, giving good services" to the people of Juarez, De La Vega says.
Nearly 2,000 people have been killed so far this year, including 34 members of the municipal police.
Despite the violence, De La Vega's hospital and its staff -- which treats about 900 patients daily, regardless of their ability to pay -- have remained unharmed.
Why would they be against that?
De La Vega says she has lost friends and neighbors in the conflict, but she insists she's not afraid -- and she's determined to help the people of Juarez continue receiving the medical care they need.
De La Vega went to visit the woman in jail and asked her why she did not practice family planning.
One of De La Vega's first clinics was built in the early '70s where the Hospital de la Familia sits today.
And De La Vega is always looking for ways to provide more services to the community.
The Hospital de la Familia is just one of the organization's many health care facilities.
Because it's my life, it's my passion.
