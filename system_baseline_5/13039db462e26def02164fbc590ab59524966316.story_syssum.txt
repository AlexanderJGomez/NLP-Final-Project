Or to be more precise, I don't like speaking to an audience sitting in front of me that I can see in real life.
After all, I have been doing this sort of stuff for quite some time.
Most broadcasters speak and breathe from the throat.
RADA was going to put that right.
From deep down below, right to the bottom of the belly, to allow the air to carry the sound out of my mouth.
I have been told I sound like gargling with broken glass, although I can't hear that.
I needed to be more aware in my style, less thrusting into the audience's face.
I was so busy trying to remember what I was supposed to be doing, I would forget what I was supposed to be saying and what came next.
Fifteen minutes of movement and breathing before I do a presentation works wonders.
Are you afraid of public speaking?
