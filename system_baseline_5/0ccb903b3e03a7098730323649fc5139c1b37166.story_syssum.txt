Rodriguez, who had to leave the game, was awarded first base after being hit, but there were no other penalties to Hernandez, who, on a night when his control was off, hit two other Yankees (three of the last five batters he faced) before giving way to a relief pitcher in a game that ended with a 4-2 Seattle victory.
There is no meaningful penalty in baseball for a pitcher hitting a batter with the ball.
In 2000, New York Mets catcher Mike Piazza was forced to miss the All-Star game as a result of the concussion and headaches that followed a beaning by the New York Yankees Roger Clemens, a notorious brushback pitcher, whom Piazza had tagged for a grand-slam home run a month earlier.
Major League Baseball's substitute for rules that penalize a pitcher for hitting batters has been equipment, namely the plastic helmet.
What is needed to make pitchers avoid brushback pitches along with the beanings that come with them are a series of rules with penalties that send a clear message: Major League Baseball is serious about protecting its players.
Rule 3: Make a team, not just an individual pitcher, accountable for hit batters.
Any time a second batter was hit, the pitcher who threw the ball would be treated as if he had already struck a batter.
A few batters might take advantage of them and try to get hit, but given the dangers that come from a pitch traveling upward of 90 mph, most batters are not likely to risk their careers just to get on base.
