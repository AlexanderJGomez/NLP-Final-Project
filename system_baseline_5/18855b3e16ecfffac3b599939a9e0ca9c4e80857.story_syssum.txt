(CNN) -- Hillary Clinton is front-page news again.
Whatever happened to having to generate a little news, or even pseudo-news, to warrant some coverage?
-- The media love Hillary and are not-so-subtly rooting for her to run.
Now there's no denying the obvious: Clinton would be a prohibitive front-runner.
-- Clinton hasn't made up her mind.
(See?!)
Hillary Clinton is incredibly popular right now in part because she's had diplomatic immunity for the past four years.
The moment she lets it be known that she's running, if she does, the Republican attack machine and conservative media complex will begin beating her up.
I wouldn't bet a ton of money against Clinton being the next Democratic nominee, but the 33 months between now and the Iowa caucuses is a political lifetime.
The political press will plow this ground again and again until the former first lady makes up her mind.
