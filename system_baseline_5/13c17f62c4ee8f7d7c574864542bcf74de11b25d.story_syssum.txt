It is.
Over the next four years, they will continue to lower the unemployment rate, if not to 6%, at least near that territory.
So can Romney, or anyone, get us back to a higher growth rate?
• Cancel all the tax increases scheduled to take effect at the end of 2012 and provide tax stability going forward.
• Lower the corporate income tax rate.
• Slow the growth of entitlements.
• Scale back military involvements around the world.
• Respect capitalism.
If the United States adopts these policies, it will not only attain Romney's 6% unemployment goal, it will once again be the economic beacon of the world.
