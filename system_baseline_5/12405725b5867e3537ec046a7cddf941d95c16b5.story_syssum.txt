The 80 Raiders, flying 16 bombers under the command of Jimmy Doolittle, showed the world that America would never give up.
"All 80 of us knew each other, from all our training missions," Cole said.
Cole was Doolittle's co-pilot in the first of the 16 planes to take off from the deck of the USS Hornet in the Pacific.
And then came the Doolittle Raiders, 80 volunteers with guts enough to thrill their countrymen.
But when there were reports on the day of the raid that Japan had learned of the mission, a decision was made: The planes had to take off from much farther out in the Pacific than had been anticipated.
"I was scared, frightened -- just about any word you can think of that describes being apprehensive," Cole said.

Friends and admirers of the Raiders have been trying to persuade Congress, in recognition of the Raiders' contribution to this country, to award the entire 80-man squad not the Medal of Honor, but the Congressional Gold Medal, one of our nation's highest tributes.
You'd think the Doolittle Raiders would rate one.
As Brian Anderson -- a friend and longtime admirer of the Raiders who has worked to get the medal authorized and has tried to get the attention of members of Congress -- said: "Time is not on the Raiders' side."
The Doolittle Raiders have earned that medal.
