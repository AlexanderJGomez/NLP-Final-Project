(CNN) -- Scientists at the Large Hadron Collider managed to make two proton beams collide at high energy Tuesday, marking a "new territory" in physics, according to CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research.
The collider may help scientists discover new properties of nature.
Had the machine been going, there would have been no damage, but beams would have been stopped until the machine could be cooled back down to operating temperatures, she said.
"It will be the beginning of a long period of running the accelerator with beams at this energy," Sutton said.
"It's going into a new energy region," she said.
