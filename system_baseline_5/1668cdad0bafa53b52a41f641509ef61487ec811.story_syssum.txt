(CNN) -- Pakistan wrapped up a first series whitewash over top-ranked England on Monday by winning the third and final Test in Dubai by 71 runs, making history in the process.
England captain Andrew Strauss said the defeat should serve as a warning ahead of a two-match series with Sri Lanka, which starts at the end of March.
"We're a lot better at the end of the third Test, than at the start of the first.
I've got to try be ready for the Sri Lanka series."
Ajmal, who was the series' top wicket-taker with 24, denied Cook a half century before Gul tore into England's middle order.
A miserable series for England concluded when Rehman dismissed last man Monty Panesar for eight.
