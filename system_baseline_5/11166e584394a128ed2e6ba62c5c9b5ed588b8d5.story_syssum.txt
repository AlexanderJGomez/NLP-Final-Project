A new report claiming to be the most comprehensive look at global slavery says 30 million people are living as slaves around the world.
It ranks 162 countries according to the number of people living in slavery, the risk of enslavement and the robustness of government responses to the problem.
Dafalia said this was a result of the Global Slavery Index using a broader definition of slavery, which included human trafficking, forced labor, as well as practices such as forced marriage, debt bondage and the exploitation of children.
"Our definition of modern slavery includes, for example, forced and servile marriage, a concept not included in the ILO estimate, given the focus on 'forced labor,'" she said.
In other examples, including Nepal, Gabon and Moldova, it was migrants who were most vulnerable to exploitation.
In contrast, said Bales, countries like Brazil led the world in anti-slavery efforts.
"I spend a lot of time talking to people who have been or are in slavery, and when you talk to them about it, they know what the situation is," he said.
We're talking about real life slavery -- you can't walk away, you're controlled through violence, you're treated like property."
