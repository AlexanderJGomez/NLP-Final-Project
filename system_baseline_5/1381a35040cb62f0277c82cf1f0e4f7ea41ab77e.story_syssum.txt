(CNN) -- This week's New York premiere of Led Zeppelin's forthcoming concert film, "Celebration Day," may have brought out both fans and rock stars, including Mick Jones, Stevie Nicks and Paul Stanley of Kiss, but beyond the 2007 reunion depicted on-screen, don't expect to see the legendary band in concert anytime soon.
It was the first time the original members had played with each other since the mid-1980s.
"It was clicking again," Jones said.
This week's premiere marks the first time Led Zeppelin has been in North America since a tour in 1977.
The band members will also appear Friday in London.
