According to the IATA (International Air Transport Association)  2013 is expected to be another profitless year for the European airline industry.
Tyler argues this disparity is in part down to sluggish economic growth in Europe; crucially, however, it can also be impacted by what he calls "onerous" EU regulation and legislation.
In an opinion piece in Spain's El Pais, Tony Tyler argues that European airlines face "significant hurdles to sustained profitability, starting with the cost of airport and airways infrastructure."
Despite cutting legacy costs through mergers, consolidation and restructuring, European carriers are still facing the heavy hand of regulation and government, adds Tyler.
But in a time of great economic crisis in Europe, where each country is facing their own internal struggle, backing off may just be too painful for government.
