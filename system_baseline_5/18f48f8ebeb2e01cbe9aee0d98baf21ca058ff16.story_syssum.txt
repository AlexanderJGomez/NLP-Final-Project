(CNN) -- It was like a scene from a big-budget Hollywood disaster movie -- a Godzilla of a fire roaring down the mountain, straight toward Brandon Hanson's Colorado Springs neighborhood.
Paperwork, passports, pictures.
The Hansons scoured through photos posted on online news sites trying see their house.
The fire has forced about 36,000 people to evacuate their homes.
One of them, Mindy Levinson, was forced to leave her apartment Tuesday, accompanied by her young son.
"This flag is my son's.
"That's just one more thing I am having to deal with in the middle of all this," he said.

"I keep telling myself it's going to be OK," she said.
"With much sadness we have to report that the Flying W Ranch as well as several homes in the Mountain Shadows area has in fact been burned to the ground," the website said.
"It was like nothing we have ever seen before in our life," she told CNN.

"It was stunning to look at," he said.
The flames were among the people, in their city.
