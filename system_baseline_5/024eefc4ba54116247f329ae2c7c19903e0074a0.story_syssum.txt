It's a great experience for me," Shevchenko told the European Tour website.
"I am not a big fan of football so I didn't really know much about Andriy but it was great to play with him.
He entered this tournament as one of several amateurs in the 130-strong field, having initially taken up golf to help ease the pressure of playing elite football.
"To play with Victor and see him shoot a course record and play fantastic golf, I learned so much about the game from the two guys," he said.
"It's the first event for me and also in Ukraine so it's big for golf here," he said.
