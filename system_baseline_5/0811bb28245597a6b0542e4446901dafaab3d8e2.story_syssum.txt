BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Their faces and darker skins make them look different.
"We told our people, Inshalla, God willing, Obama is going to win, and if he wins, it will be a victory for all black people in the world," he recalls.
When news broke that Obama had won the election, it was early in the morning of November 5 in Basra -- but Thijeel excitedly called a fellow member of his political party.
Many Iraqis still call blacks "abed," an Arabic word that means "slave."
Many white Iraqis claim the word isn't meant to offend, but Thijeel says they have no idea how hurtful it is.
The Movement of Free Iraqis was founded two years ago and on January 31 it will run the first slate of black candidates in Iraq's modern history.
The party also wants an apology for slavery, although it is not asking for financial reparations.
But Thijeel, quoting Barack Obama, says it's time for change.
