JACKSON, Missouri (CNN) -- Debbie Shank breaks down in tears every time she's told that her 18-year-old son, Jeremy, was killed in Iraq.
Eight years ago, Shank was stocking shelves for the retail giant and signed up for Wal-Mart's health and benefits plan.
The family's attorney, Maurice Graham, said he informed Wal-Mart about the settlement and believed the Shanks would be allowed to keep the money.
"We assumed after three years, they [Wal-Mart] had made a decision to let Debbie Shank use this money for what it was intended to," Graham said.
But I just wonder if they need it that bad," Jim Shank said.
Jim Shank said he believes Wal-Mart should make an exception.
"The recovery that Debbie Shank made was recovery for future lost earnings, for her pain and suffering," Graham said.
Graham said he believes Wal-Mart should be entitled to only about $100,000.
But just last week, the high court said it would not hear the case.
