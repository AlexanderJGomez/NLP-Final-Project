Simply put, green roofs are gardens on your roof.
But green roofs are not just aesthetic.
Even by the end of the 1990s, 50 million square meters of German roofs, the equivalent of 10 percent of flat roofs, were recorded to be green.
Green Roofs for Healthy Cities, a Canadian non-profit industry association, conducted a survey in 2005 which indicated that only 233,000 square meters of green roofs existed in North America.
Storm water is a growing problem in cities.
Dusty Gedge, co-founder of Livingroof.org, a UK Web site promoting the green roof industry, believes it is the government's responsibility to help the industry grow.
Despite this lack of support, the green roof industry is growing.
"In Switzerland, green roofs are federal law, but again this is interpreted at a cantonal and city level," he told CNN.
So the green roof industry continues to grow -- but there's a feeling that government support could be better.
