The legendary Formula One team has re-signed Finn Kimi Raikkonen to partner Fernando Alonso in 2014.
Ferrari will be the only team to race two world champions next season, making it the most potent, but potentially risky, pairing on the grid.
Raikkonen said at the time he was "very sad" to leave Ferrari and he immediately quit F1 to pursue rallying.
Di Montezemolo gave Raikkonen the green light ahead of Massa and Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg, who had also been linked with a move to Ferrari next season.
Raikkonen, who has won two races since returning to F1 with Lotus in 2011, will be determined to fight for victories -- something Massa has struggled to do alongside Alonso.
Ferrari will hope their "fire and ice" combination will bring out the best in each other as it seeks to win its first team title since 2008.
Ferrari chose Raikkonen as Schumacher's replacement in 2007, hiring him for a reported $41 million.
Ferrari has now returned to Raikkonen for a quick fix as the Scuderia desperately seeks to rein in the all-conquering Red Bull team.
