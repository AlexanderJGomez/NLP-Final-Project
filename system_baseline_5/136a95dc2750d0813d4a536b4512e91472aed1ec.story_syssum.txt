The Malaysian-registered tanker Zafirah was exactly the kind of ship pirates love.
While piracy in Somalia in the waters off the Horn of Africa may have grabbed the headlines over the past few years, shipping industry experts say piracy is moving back to its former heartland in South East Asia.
According to the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP) -- an information sharing center set up under a regional Asian agreement to combat piracy -- the high price of oil has been behind at least four pirate attacks in 2011 and 2012 where diesel or MGO fuel was siphoned.
"There are many new companies making good money providing 'hardening' equipment for ships," the Hong Kong-based source said.
Some ships operating in Somali waters have even resorted to 'citadels'; safe rooms where the crew can barricade themselves into a ship that has already been boarded by pirates.
"Sometimes it's suspected that these small robberies are even carried out by the crew who sell the supplies to boost their low salaries and later put the blame on pirates," the Hong Kong-based shipper said.
