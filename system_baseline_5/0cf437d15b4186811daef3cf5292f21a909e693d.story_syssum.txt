Corruption accounts for a loss of about 2% of Morocco's GDP, officials have said.
"We call to demonstrate peacefully in all the towns to put an end to corruption, to injustice and for a real democracy in our country," explained one youth on a video posted on the movement's Facebook page.
"The main areas of concern when we talk about corruption in Morocco are the judiciary, police and hospitals," Transparency International's local chief Rachid Filali Meknassi said.
"To give you an idea how bad it is in the judiciary," Filali Meknassi said, "we conducted a survey in 2005 and found that the majority of judges and lawyers in Morocco have no faith in the system being free of corruption.
But the group doesn't specifically want to target corruption in government ministries.
"We want a new constitution, which will define exactly what the new rules and regulations are in place to stop corruption," explained Said Benjebli, one of the movement's architects who edits the main Facebook page.
