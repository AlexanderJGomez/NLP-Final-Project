1 Rory McIlroy reiterated his support for 2012 vice captain Paul McGinley on the day he announced a new multi-year sponsorship deal with Nike.
"He's been vice captain a few times, he's holed the winning putt in the Ryder Cup.
Donald delivered two vital points -- one in Saturday's fourballs and again in the crucial opening singles match against 2012 Masters champion Bubba Watson.
It would be fantastic to have Paul McGinley as the 2014 captain."
The announcement will be made after a 15-man committee that includes Montgomerie, Clarke and McGinley meets to decide.
