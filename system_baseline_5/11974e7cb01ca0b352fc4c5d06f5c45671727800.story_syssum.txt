The migrants left Libya on Saturday in rubber boats, the International Organization for Migration said.
"They confirmed to UNHCR that they had left on Saturday from Libya on rubber dinghies and had been at sea for days, without food and water," Mahecic said.
Worldwide, more than 40,000 migrants have died in their journeys since 2000, the International Organization for Migration said in September.
Syrians accounted for 22% of the migrants arriving in Italy in January, Edwards said.
