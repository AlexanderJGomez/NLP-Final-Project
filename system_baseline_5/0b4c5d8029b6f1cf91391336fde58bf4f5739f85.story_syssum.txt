"We must send them our love, forgiveness and compassion," Kia Scherr told reporters Tuesday of the Mumbai attackers, nine of whom were killed by Indian forces.
Authorities said the father and daughter were found fatally shot in a restaurant in Mumbai's Oberoi Hotel, where the group was staying.
Scherr and his daughter were in the restaurant with other Synchronicity travelers when gunmen burst into the hotel and started shooting, Cannon said.
Cannon told CNN's "Larry King Live" on Tuesday that he and two others were in his hotel room when the attacks began.
"Slowly, we were able to account for everyone but [Alan and Naomi Scherr]," Cannon said.
Cannon said he stepped over bodies and walked through pools of blood in the restaurant to get to the table where Alan and Naomi had been sitting.
"He told me by phone one day: 'I love these people.
