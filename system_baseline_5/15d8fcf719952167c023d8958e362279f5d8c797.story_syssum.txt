Johannesburg (CNN) -- A stampede on a university campus in Johannesburg Tuesday left one woman dead and several people injured, according to eyewitness reports.
Another witness recounted how a gate was opened "and then people started fighting and running towards the gate, and then there was a stampede.
Sitting among the debris of shoes, ID cards and blankets -- all discarded during the stampede -- June Moloro told CNN how she was accompanying her grandson to the university when they also got caught up in the chaos.
In a statement, the ANC Youth League called on the government "to urgently put in place measures that will remedy the situation of many prospective students and fewer admission spaces in institutions of higher learning not only in U.J.
The situation is reaching crisis level, with the number of places available for higher education students now far less than the number of people qualified to take them, the statement said.
The country also suffers from high levels of unemployment, particularly among young people.
