Although Rizana said the baby died in a choking accident, Saudi courts convicted her of murder and sentenced her to death.
Her sentence violated international law, which prohibits the death penalty for crimes committed before age 18.
But it should also spotlight the precarious existence of other domestic workers.
Conditions for migrant domestic workers in Saudi Arabia are among some of the worst, but domestic workers in other countries rarely enjoy the same rights as other workers.
Thailand, and Singapore approved measures to give domestic workers a weekly day off, while Venezuela and the Philippines adopted broad laws for domestic workers ensuring a minimum wage, paid holidays, and limits to their working hours.
The Convention also has specific protections for domestic workers under the age of 18 and provisions for regulating and monitoring recruitment agencies.
The obvious one is for Saudi Arabia to stop its use of the death penalty and end its outlier status as one of only three countries worldwide to execute people for crimes committed while a child.
And they can protect millions of other domestic workers who labor with precariously few guarantees for their safety and rights.
