One attendee suggests that, in sending a personal message to a ceremony commemorating Japan's war criminals, Abe has yet again handed a strategic gift to China and South Korea, while making Japan look churlish about its war responsibility.
Defenders of Japan's wartime conduct commonly use the phrase "Showa era martyrs" -- which refers to the period of Japanese history corresponding to the 1926-89 reign of Emperor Hirohito -- to refer to the war criminals.
It is not the first time Abe has sent a message for the Koya-san ceremony.
Although most Japanese don't share Abe's enthusiasm for Japan in jackboots, Brand Japan suffers from Abe's revisionist views because he is the nation's leader 24/7 and the world scrutinizes all of his words and gestures.
Like most Japanese they wonder why Abe can't just stick to Abenomics and leave history to the historians.
Abe is waging a culture war to redefine Japanese national identity, one that he thinks is way too masochistic.
Moreover, a month after signaling he would not repudiate the Kono Statement, Abe sent his message praising the war criminals.
And his supporters in the Diet proceeded with an investigation of the comfort women system aimed at discrediting the Kono Statement, a damaging hit-and-run attack aimed at sowing doubts among Japanese who are showing signs of perpetrator's fatigue and the burdens of war responsibility.
