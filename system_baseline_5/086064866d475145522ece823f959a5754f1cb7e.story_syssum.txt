"I believe the Lord chose me to lead that group," said Terry, who lives in Hurst, Texas.
Here's where the story takes an ironic twist: Gary Terry collapsed just 18 feet from an automated external defibrillator AED that he and his group -- the American Heart Association -- helped to install just eight months earlier.
But the circumstances of Terry's experience are unique, because there was a defibrillator nearby, and somebody knew how to use it.
Next, begin doing CPR, employ the use of a defibrillator and get the victim into the hands of capable medical professionals like the paramedics.
Complex algorithms inside the unit's computer determine whether a shock from the machine will help restart a victim's heart.
And Terry says he won't stop until the defibrillator is as ubiquitous in public places as a sprinkler system.
