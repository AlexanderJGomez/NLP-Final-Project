Gwenyth Jackaway started to wonder if Donor-X passed on a genetic component to her son, Dylan, who is autistic.
Jackaway decided on "Donor X" because he appeared philosophical and intelligent on paper.
What she couldn't know then is that her son would have autism.
"We wouldn't be able to screen a donor for autism because we don't yet know the specific genes that are contributing to autism," Dawson said.
"When you're handed a diagnosis of some sort of developmental disorder, you have to let go of the child you thought you were going to have," Jackaway said.
Jackaway says she had to accept that "I don't have that child I thought I was going to have.
There seemed to be eye contact issues," recalled Jackaway, who immediately suggested screening Joseph for autism.
She says Jackaway reassured her that wouldn't be the case.
In six families Jackaway contacted that had used Donor X, three of the children are autistic, and one is showing signs of autism.
Our children don't have autism; they are autistic.
California Cryobank (CCB) employs one of the most thorough and rigorous donor screening processes in the industry, with less than 1% of all applicants actually becoming donors.
In fact, Theresa Pergola says she's still uncertain about an autism screening process, if and when it ever becomes available.
