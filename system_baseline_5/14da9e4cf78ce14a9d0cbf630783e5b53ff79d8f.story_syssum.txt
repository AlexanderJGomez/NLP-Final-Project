Apatow's latest comedy "Funny People" pairs Adam Sandler (left) with Seth Rogen (right).
A former stand-up comic and writer for television sitcoms like "The Larry Sandler Show," Apatow has taken to heart that old maxim that the best comedy is born out of tragedy.
"I see all the movies as dealing with my personal problems, whether it's about virginity, bad sex, marital issues, unplanned pregnancy or, in the case of this one, death," Apatow told CNN.
Surprisingly, considering their longtime association, "Funny People" is the first time Apatow has helmed a feature with Sandler in it.
So we always reminisce about that time because we had nothing going on other than our comedy sets at night."
