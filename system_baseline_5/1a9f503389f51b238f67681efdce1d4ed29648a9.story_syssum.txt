"It's good enough, I really appreciate it," Gamboa said about the reward.
Before the gambler forgot his paper bag of cash in the cab's backseat, the poker player tipped the cabbie $5 on a $9.90 fare, Gamboa said.
He doesn't want any publicity," Gamboa said.
"They are so proud of me, and I am so proud of what I have done," Gamboa said.
Those who make their living in the cab business are enjoying the moment: Cabbies are no longer maligned -- whether it's for running up the fare or refusing to stop when hailed on the street -- and are generating international good will, Gamboa's boss said.
On New Year's Eve -- one of the busiest days in the cabbie business -- Gamboa will be back at work on the Las Vegas Strip.
