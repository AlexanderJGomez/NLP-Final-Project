Who will take the best actor SAG trophy -- "Lincoln" star Daniel Day-Lewis or Hugh Jackman for "Les Miserables"?
"Les Miserables," a big-screen adaptation of the smash Broadway musical, was given the Golden Globe for best comedy or musical movie, although "Lincoln" lost to "Argo" in the Globe's best drama film competition.
"Lincoln" and "Les Miserables" also hold center stage in the race for best lead actor after the Globes.
Naomi Watts, who played a mother who survived the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami in "The Impossible," is also in the running for the SAG and Oscar best actress honors.
Anne Hathaway, honored with the Globe for best supporting actress for her performance in "Les Miserables," faces tough competition for the SAG and Oscar awards from Sally Field, who portrayed first lady Mary Todd Lincoln in "Lincoln."
