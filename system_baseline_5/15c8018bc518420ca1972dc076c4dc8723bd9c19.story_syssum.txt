On Tuesday, police still had no answers as to what happened at Alvarado Park -- or even who the boy was.
Before the composite image was created, police weren't able to release a photo of the boy because his body was so disfigured by the sand's heat.
Walsh said there were no obvious signs of bruising on the boy.
Though police have received numerous tips from the public, Walsh said nothing has come from them.
Resident Rachel Lesperance told CNN affiliate KOAT-TV she spent her weekend collecting $3,600 for the boy.
