Alexandria, Egypt (CNN) -- Emotional congregants returned to their church Sunday in Alexandria, Egypt, mourning the loss of fellow worshippers in a bombing a day earlier.
Another worshipper at the church said she lost three family members in the attack.
"What did we do to them?
A small group of Coptic men held a demonstration against the attack about a block away from the church Sunday.
"In the beginning, we thought the attack was sectarian, to be honest," he said Sunday.
A nearby mosque was also damaged in the blast and eight Muslims were among the wounded, the interior ministry said.
Authorities believe the bomber was killed in the blast, Egypt's Interior Ministry said in a statement Saturday.
