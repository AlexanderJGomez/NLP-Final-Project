(CNN) -- Tension brewed Wednesday between the United Nations and Syrian rebels after about 30 rebels detained 21 U.N. peacekeepers and refused to let them go.
The other video shows rebels walking near several U.N. trucks.
The 21 peacekeepers are Filipino, the Philippine government said Thursday.
"The blood of the people of Syria will be a curse on the whole world if there" is "no effective action," it said.
There has been "hardly a Syrian village spared from the regime bombing" the letter said.
It's the first time I witnessed such ugly images," said Ahmed Tayar, a writer and resident of Raqqa who saw the aftermath of the mysterious blast.
Smoke billowed in the distance from a burning car.
"I thinks it's the regime who killed those people, and that is because the regime wants to take revenge against Raqqa because that it's the first province that was fully liberated," Tayar told CNN.
