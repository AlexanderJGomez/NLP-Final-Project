Construction on the city state's new structure for Changi Airport, the Jewel Changi, is underway.
More than simply a new terminal, Jewel Changi Airport will be constructed on the site of the old parking lot fronting the existing Changi Airport's Terminal 1, and will be "seamlessly connected" to the existing terminals, according to the airport.
At night, the Rain Vortex will transform into a light and sound show.
Travelers will be able to stay at Jewel's own hotel -- approximately 130 rooms operated by international hotel brand YOTEL.
"In order for Changi Airport to stay ahead amidst intensifying competition from other airports, it's important for continuous innovation to be introduced," says Goh.
