London (CNN) -- Brazil stands at a crossroads in its efforts to preserve the Amazon rainforest, as the government considers controversial legislation governing land use.
But environmentalists worry that these results -- brought about by efficient use of technology allied with a political will to slow clearing -- could now be put at risk by an overhaul of Brazil's Forest Code.
"The changes in the new Forest Code will reduce this protection.
The power of the rural lobby is acknowledged by those close to the Brazilian government but the environmental fears are also rejected.
"But I think this is the best proposal that can come out for both sides.
Carvalho said farmers must keep 80% of their forested land -- they will only be able to clear 20% -- and may have to use some of their land for reforestation.
Spring 2012 also marks a significant junction half a world away in Indonesia which has significant forest areas.
The agreement was designed to help Indonesia with its commitment to the U.N.'s global REDD+ program (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation).
"In short, in our opinion and analysis, the moratorium has not been working well in halting deforestation in Indonesia," said Yuyun Indradi, Greenpeace forest campaigner in Indonesia.
The Indonesia government insists it is committed to REDD+ and introducing a host of measures to slow deforestation and reduce emissions.
A spokesman for the Indonesian government adds that they are working on the maps and new concessions permits, and to determine the extent of forest damage and how to control it.
Greenpeace's Indradi says Brazil's strong point has been to implement better forest governance, backed up with good monitoring and serious law enforcement.
