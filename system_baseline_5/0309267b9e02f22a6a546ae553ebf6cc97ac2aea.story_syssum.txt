Rudy Ruiz says taxing fattening foods is a good way to combat the epidemic of obesity in America.

Our bulging waistline correlates to our ballooning health care budget, accounting for $147 billion a year in medical bills, according to a study funded by the CDC Foundation and published this summer in the health policy journal Health Affairs.

But if socioeconomic incentives to consume harmful food persist, unhealthy patient behavior will prevail at monstrous cost to all of us.
Cheap, abundant corn enables mass production of economical, aggressively marketed beef and pork.
â€¢ Tax fast food, soft drinks, and packaged foods high in processed fats and sugars to decrease demand for unhealthy food.
Plus, tax proceeds would help underwrite health reforms and preventive education.
