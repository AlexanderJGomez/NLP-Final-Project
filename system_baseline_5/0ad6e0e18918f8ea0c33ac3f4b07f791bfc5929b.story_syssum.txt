Santana recalled the moments when he recorded a roughly three-minute video of North Charleston Police officer Michael Slager shooting Walter Scott as Scott was running away Saturday.
Santana said when he first came on the scene while walking to his job he saw Slager on top of Scott, who was on the ground.
Police said Slager used a Taser against Scott, but Slager would also later tell a dispatcher that Scott at some point had grabbed the Taser.
The video shows Slager shooting at Scott eight times before Scott falls down.
"He was there.
Judy Scott said she couldn't watch the whole recording.
But ... if I wouldn't show my face, everybody over there knows, including the police, who I am," Santana said.
Santana said after he stopped recording, he watched for a few more minutes but never saw anyone perform CPR.
