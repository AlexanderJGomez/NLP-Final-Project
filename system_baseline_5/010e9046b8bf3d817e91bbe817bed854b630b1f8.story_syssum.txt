Much of the discontent is directed toward the Pakistani Taliban, the extremist group that has claimed responsibility for the shooting and said it will seek to kill Malala if she recovers from her injuries.
Khan said he was "crying and weeping" after hearing of the attack on Malala, who had defied extremists in the northwestern Swat Valley by insisting on the right of girls to go to school.
Another said, "Malala -- (an) attack on you is an attack on education and progress."
Social activist Saman Jafery said: "If Taliban is a mindset, then Malala is a mindset, too.
The video provoked appalled reactions in Pakistan at the time, but "the scale of protests for Malala are bigger," said the Jinnah Institute's Rumi.
She said she was so scared after the attack on the bus in which they traveled that she couldn't sleep for two days.
Authorities have forensic evidence, Malik said.
"We have sufficient evidence to find the culprits," the chief said.
The cricket star-turned-politician Imran Khan, who visited Malala in a hospital in Peshawar last week, has drawn criticism for not condemning the Taliban outright for the attack.
As the controversy about the attack rages in Pakistan, the doctors treating Malala thousands of miles away said they are "very pleased" with her progress and optimistic that she will make a good recovery.
