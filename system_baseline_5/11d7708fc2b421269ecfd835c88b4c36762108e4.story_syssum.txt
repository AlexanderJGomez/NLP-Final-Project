Who doesn't want to know how to make Skittles-infused vodka ("Vomit the rainbow") or create an anytime jersey dress out of an oversized T-shirt?
From the time-lapse pregnancy photo montage to gender-reveal cupcakes to lunchbox hand-pies shaped like baby octopi, Pinterest left no familial event untouched.
Pinterest didn't infect me during any of the traditional gateway holidays like Christmas or Halloween (did you know both of these holidays now require wreaths?).
It got me with the Tooth Fairy.
By the time my oldest daughter's first tooth was threatening to wriggle free, I'd hyped up the Tooth Fairy significantly.
"Me too?"
Unfortunately, as the day went on, the business of life combined with my chronic tendency to procrastinate proved more powerful than the Pinterest-derived Tooth Fairy extravaganza I'd planned.
Perhaps the gas station around the corner had candy ... wait no, the Tooth Fairy wouldn't give candy; that'd be like a doctor handing out Big Macs.
I found a few mini candy canes, but no, the tooth fairy would clearly be non-denominational.
Combined with a few chocolate chips ... that's something the Tooth Fairy would whip together in her Middle-Earth kitchen, right?
The bags looked like something you'd sneak into a movie theater to save $5.
I closed the bags with craft twine and finished the whole debacle with wrapping paper.
"Oh I was just seeing the Tooth Fairy out ..."), I still felt uneasy.
By now, I was so tired that I was having a semi-out-of-body experience and felt like I really was the Tooth Fairy.
About 3 a.m., I remembered seeing a website where you can superimpose pictures of a fairy on a photo of your sleeping child.
As I lay in bed, I created an elaborate backstory of how I'd managed to take the photo with my iPhone right before she spit in my face for scaring her.
I'm still trying to decide what the Tooth Fairy will bring the next time she pays a visit.
