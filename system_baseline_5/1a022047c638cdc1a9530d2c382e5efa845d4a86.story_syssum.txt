ET) Friday, CERN said, a critical step towards getting results from the accelerator.
"It's great to see beam circulating in the LHC again," said CERN Director General Rolf Heuer.
Had the machine been going, there would have been no damage, but beams would have been stopped until the machine could be cooled back down to operating temperatures, she said.
But just nine days later, the operation was set back when one of the 25,000 joints that connect magnets in the LHC came loose and the resulting current melted or burned some important components of the machine, Myers said.
The LHC will probably be in operation more than 20 years, Myers said.
The as-yet theoretical Higgs boson, also called "the God particle" in popular parlance, could emerge within two or three years, Myers said.
At that time, there was a "hot soup" of particles called quarks and gluons at a temperature of around 2 trillion degrees above absolute zero, he said.
