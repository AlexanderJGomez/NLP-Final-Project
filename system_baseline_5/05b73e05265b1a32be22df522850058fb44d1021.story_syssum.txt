An estimated 6.8 million people are in desperate need inside Syria.
I see firsthand the tremendous burden the Syrian refugees are already placing on countries like Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon, and most recently Iraq.
But in the past two years, his business has suffered.
Despite these challenges, host countries and the international aid community are building transit reception areas to accommodate incoming refugees who may have to wait for immigration processing and registration in the case of a massive influx of new arrivals.
It will accommodate 30,000 refugees upon opening, and can expand to accommodate up to 130,000 refugees.
I've spoken with hundreds of refugees over the past year and most of them are realizing it will be a long haul.
From a private donor standpoint, Mercy Corps has raised just over $1 million for our Syria refugee work, mostly from a handful of major donors, but that is over two years.
It is also critical that neighboring countries keep their borders open to Syrians who need to flee the conflict, despite the challenges that these massive, mobile populations can bring with them.
