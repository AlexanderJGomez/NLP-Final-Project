(CNN) -- Debbie Benzine lost her first husband to heart disease when he was 44.
He was.
"One day ... you find out that you're 56 years old and if you want to see 66 you better do something about it," he says.
Benzine decided to do the gastric bypass surgery.
Dale also didn't want to have the option of reversing the surgery.
The psychiatrist told Benzine he rejected upward of half his patients because they weren't prepared to make the necessary life changes after the surgery.
The day of his surgery, his wife recalls she was an emotional wreck.
The surgery was a success, but he was far from the ideal patient.
"Imagine after you eat your big Thanksgiving dinner -- times 10," he says of overeating with his smaller stomach.
It was like being a baby and learning to eat all over again, Benzine says.
He developed 10 rules for himself, and other bariatric patients, and the weight began to fall off.
He had to learn to reward himself with activities instead of food.
"I'm 57 going on 37," Benzine says with a laugh.
More importantly, "I will have my husband and best friend around for a long time," his wife says.
3) Find a high-protein breakfast and lunch that you can live with each day.
4) Concentrate on changing your daily eating habits from three large meals per day, plus snacks, to five to six small meals.
You will be amazed how fast the weight will start dropping once you get into this routine, plus your dog will love it even more than you!
Replacing your "going out to eat" time with activities will arguably be the best move you will make during this whole journey.
You will be amazed how full you will be after eating the smaller servings and your pocketbook will also thank you.
