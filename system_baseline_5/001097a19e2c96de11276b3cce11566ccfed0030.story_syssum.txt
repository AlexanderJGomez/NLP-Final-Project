Electronics makers use CES as a platform to show the types of products they plan to release in the coming year.
But with some of the largest players in today's consumer electronics industry shunning CES, the trade show's impact may be waning.
The big product categories that will dominate the CES show floor next week, according to manufacturers and analysts, are not revolutionary.
At CES, tech companies will showcase plenty of phones with that software, but the touchscreen tablets with Android 4 will be prevalent.
Analysts expect to see a bevy of Windows 8 tablets at CES.
Microsoft will enable this anti-disc computer with the application store in Windows 8.
TVs have long been the centerpiece of CES and of the consumer electronics industry as a whole.
Meanwhile, Internet services are also working their way onto television sets.
Don't expect Apple to show up at CES with a big screen though.
And since last CES, Pandora has more than doubled the number of cars that tap into its streaming radio service, Pandora founder Tim Westergren said in a phone interview.
Many electronics makers have apparently decided that each new phone, tablet, car or refrigerator should allow owners to update their Facebook statuses.
"It's no longer an optional part of the business."
"It's the only trade show I attend all year," she said.
