At the hearing, lawyers for the Patriots said the team would not pay Hernandez the $3.25 million that the NFL Players Association has said the player is owed.
Hernandez, 24, has pleaded not guilty to a charge of first-degree murder in the June shooting of his friend Lloyd, 27, a Boston-area semipro football player who was dating the sister of Hernandez's girlfriend.
Police have said that the homicide may be linked to Hernandez, according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation.
Attorneys for the Patriots and the Lloyd family did not return CNN's calls.
