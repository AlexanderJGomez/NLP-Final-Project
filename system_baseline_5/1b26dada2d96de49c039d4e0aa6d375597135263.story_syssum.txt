The match was overshadowed by the 18th minute dismissal of Wales captain Sam Warburton for a dangerous tackle.
Wales spent the remainder of the match with the bulk of possession but were unable to work an opening to leave the French to contemplate a final against either hosts New Zealand or Australia who play the second semifinal Sunday on the same ground.
"It killed the game," he added.
French coach Marc Lievremont praised the "amazingly brave" Wales, but believed Rolland, the 2007 World Cup final referee, had little choice but to dismiss Warburton.
All Blacks coach Graham Henry believes the match his side's "biggest in 10 years" as they bid to win the World Cup for only the second time after a series of near misses.
