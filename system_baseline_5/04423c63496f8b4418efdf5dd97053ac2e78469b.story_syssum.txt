GALVESTON, Texas (CNN)  -- Rescuers in Galveston, Texas, were going door-to-door Saturday to check on the estimated 20,000 people who failed to flee Hurricane Ike, which has slowed to tropical storm status.
LeBlanc said 17 buildings on the island had been destroyed by fires, potent winds and a strong storm surge.
Ike was downgraded Saturday to a tropical storm 11 hours after it crashed ashore as a Texas-sized hurricane that walloped southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana.
"The windows looked like they would explode," said Knight, a mother of two.
"I didn't think it would be as bad as it was," she said.
However, flooding and debris have impeded rescue efforts in some areas, adding to the uncertainty about how many Texans actually survived the storm.
A foot of water flooded the city's main courthouse, where many people rode out the storm, she said.
"I have never in my life seen water like this," the 30-year Galveston resident said.
Houston Mayor Bill White said his city appears to have avoided loss of life, but streets blocked by floodwaters, downed trees and power lines hampered efforts to determine the full extent of the damage.
Nearly 2.6 million customers in Texas and Louisiana lack power because of Ike, the U.S. Energy Department said on Saturday.
iReporter Jackie Hensler of Houston said her apartment building's power was restored quickly on Saturday morning after a stormy night.
