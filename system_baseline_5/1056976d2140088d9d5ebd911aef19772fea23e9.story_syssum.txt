Washington (CNN) -- A killer who sent a prosecutor a taunting letter about  killing a 16-year-old girl died in Virginia's electric chair Thursday night, the Richmond Times Dispatch reported.
Powell was convicted in the 1999 murder of Stacie Reed and the rape of her 14-year-old sister in their Manassas, Virginia, family home.
Stacie Reed knew Powell, then 20 and an admitted racist.
"Since I have already been indicted on first degree murder and the Va. Supreme Court said that I can't be charged with capital murder again, I figured I would tell you the rest of what happened on Jan. 29, 1999, to show you how stupid all of y'all ... are," wrote Powell, who is white.
He then stomped on her throat.
With this firsthand account from Powell, he was indicted again and charged with murder and attempted rape of Stacie -- a capital-eligible crime.
The Supreme Court appeal is Powell v. Kelly (09-21).
