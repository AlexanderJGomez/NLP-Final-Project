(CNN) -- American skating star Apolo Anton Ohno snatched a record-breaking silver medal at the Winter Olympics in Vancouver after a final-lap crash by his South Korean rivals in the 1,500 meters race, while skier Hannah Kearney gave the United States a first gold medal in Saturday's final event.
Kearney, by comparison to Ohno, won her first Olympic medal as she edged out defending champion Jennifer Heil of Canada to win gold in the final run of the ladies' freestyle moguls event, with American Shannon Bahrke taking the bronze.
He finished with a total of 276.5 points to push Poland's Adam Malysz into the silver medal position.
The 23-year-old world champion went one better than his silver medal at Turin 2006 as he finished 2.35 seconds ahead of South Korea's Lee Seung-Hoon.
The first women's gold medal of the Games was claimed by Slovakia's Anastazia Kuzmina, who triumphed in the biathlon 7.5 kilometer sprint event.
Marie Dorin of France won bronze in the event, which combines cross-country skiing and rifle shooting, with a time of 20:06.5.
American Bode Miller, the 2005 world champion, will be seeking to win his first Olympic gold, having claimed two silvers on home soil at Salt Lake City in 2002.
