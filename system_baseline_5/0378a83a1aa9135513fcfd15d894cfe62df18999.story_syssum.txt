(CNN) -- A U.S. airstrike in Syria appears to have killed a key French jihadist who is part of the militant Khorasan Group, a U.S. defense official said Thursday morning.
The strikes happened in the area of Sarmada, Syria, the military said.
Those attacks came amid intelligence that suggested the group was plotting against a target in the U.S. homeland as well as other Western targets, a senior U.S. official told CNN at the time.
Drugeon was born in 1989 in a blue-collar and immigrant neighborhood dotted with social housing on the outskirts of Vannes on the Atlantic coast of Brittany, according to Eric Pelletier, a reporter with L'Express who has extensively reported on Drugeon and shared his findings with CNN.
Drugeon began acting out, and his grades at school nosedived.
By 2010, Drugeon was on the radar screen of French security services and had made several trips to Egypt to learn Arabic and more about Islam.
According to Pelletier, French intelligence established that Drugeon joined a small al Qaeda subgroup known as Jund-al-Khilafah, based in the Miran Shah area.
Drugeon is believed to have left Pakistan sometime in 2013 or very early 2014, and to have traveled to Syria to join up with the Khorasan group.
