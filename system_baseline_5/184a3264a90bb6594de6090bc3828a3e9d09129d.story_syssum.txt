"It's possible she could be booked in and booked out" the same day, Los Angeles County Sheriff spokesman Steve Whitmore said Wednesday afternoon.
The actress, who admitted violating her probation during a hearing Wednesday, must report to the Los Angeles County jail by November 9, the judge said.
Prosecutors said Lohan missed 12 of 20 scheduled workdays at a downtown Los Angeles women's center, part of the court-ordered community service imposed in May when she pleaded guilty to stealing a necklace from a Venice, California, jewelry store.
While the original sentence included 360 hours of community service at a downtown Los Angeles women's center, the judge said she did not want to put the Skid Row charity through the pain of Lohan again.
But Lohan seemed to find a good fit with her work at the Los Angeles County morgue, where Deputy Chief Coroner Ed Winter said she worked four days in the past two weeks cleaning up.
It has been extended several times because of violations, including the failed alcohol and drug tests.
