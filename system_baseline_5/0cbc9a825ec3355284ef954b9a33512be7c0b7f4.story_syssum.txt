Now, however, comes the time to be explicit: to speak out loud his affiliation, his fraternal pride and concern.
African-American men certainly could use an intervention from the most successful African-American man in history.
In urban areas, fewer than half graduate from high school.
Nobody understands, like this audience will, the contortions a successful African-American man has to make to fit in but stand out, to be strong but not intimidate or frighten, to be black enough but not too black.
The president isn't the only black man who needs to step up support of his brothers.
President Obama provides, for Morehouse men and everyone else, a 21st century model of African-American masculinity.
President Obama cannot, on his own, reverse this course, but he can do much more than he has to disrupt the flow of the one in three young black men who are headed to prison.
African-American men feel a special kinship with this president.
What a difference it might make for the millions of black boys who now are headed to destinies very different from graduating from Morehouse College or becoming president of the United States.
