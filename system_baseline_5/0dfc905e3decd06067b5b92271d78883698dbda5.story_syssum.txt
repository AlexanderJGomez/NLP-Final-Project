Maria Alyokhina and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova were released about two months before their prison sentences were due to end.
But Tolokonnikova, released from a Siberian facility on Monday, told CNN she felt that the amnesty was a publicity stunt to bolster the government's image before it hosts the Winter Olympics in February.
Tolokonnikova went on a hunger strike during her prison term to protest what she said were poor conditions at a Mordovian prison.
Prison authorities told state news agency RIA Novosti then that Tolokonnikova was blackmailing them for denying her request for special treatment.
Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova have young children and therefore qualified for the amnesty, Russian media reported.
