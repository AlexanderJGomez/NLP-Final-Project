"I need support, I need help because I'm representing Afghanistan -- especially disabled people," says Malek, who more than anything, wants to swim for his country at the 2012 Paralympic Games in London.
It was while he was in the hospital that an American visitor noticed Malek and paid for him to go the United States and get prosthetic limbs made.
"I don't have any coach or any trainer to teach me how to swim, how to prepare for the games, so I'm doing by myself, because I love swimming," says Malek.
Nikpai, who was swimming in the same pool as Malek when we visited, is keenly aware how difficult it is to excel in athletics in Afghanistan.
"They want to bring medals back home.
Nikpai is very happy to see Malek make progress.
As Malek waits to find out if he's earned a spot at the games, he remains optimistic.
Malek knows that whatever happens, in a sense, he's already won.
