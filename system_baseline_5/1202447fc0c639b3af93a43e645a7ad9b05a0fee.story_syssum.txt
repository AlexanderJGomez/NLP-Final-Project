Much like the Obameter from PolitiFact.com, which tracks U.S. President Barack Obama's promises, the Morsi Meter lists numerous promises Morsi allegedly made while campaigning for the presidency, including offering incentives and promotions for police who restore security in their areas, new penalties for smuggling fuel, and changes on the streets to improve traffic.
"We decided to follow U.S.-like initiatives of monitoring the promises of politicians after the naming of the president," and one member of Zabatak began to write down Morsi's campaign vows, Sobhy said.
Sobhy said that while it's unclear how much power the president will have, he hopes Morsi fulfills promises through selecting "a good government" and gaining public support.
Zabatak hopes to change the "mindset" in Egypt and get more people to be "more positive and involved," he said.
Sobhy says the group will soon launch an official English version.
It's a new form of journalism that holds public officials accountable for their campaign promises.
