Both he and NASA initially insisted that he said "one small step for a man," and now a new and novel study on the much-analyzed quote backs him up.
In 2006, Peter Shann Ford said he had found the "a" in a study of the audio waveform, NASA explains.
Their results suggest that it is entirely possible that Armstrong said what he claimed, though evidence indicates that people are statistically more likely to hear 'for man' instead of 'for a man' on the recording," Michigan State University said in a news release.
"But we'll most likely never know for sure exactly what he said."
