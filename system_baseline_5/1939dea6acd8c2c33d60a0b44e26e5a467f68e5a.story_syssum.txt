Lapid segued his journalism into politics and emerged as an archetype -- a voice of the middle-class Israeli striving for success, but anxious about the high cost of living, a voice representing Israelis who've had it with the exemptions from mandatory military service for the ultra-Orthodox, a voice of everyday optimism.
Members of Yesh Atid range across the spectrum, Lapid said after the election in Tel Aviv.
Shas, a religious party, gained 11 seats.
But in interviews, Lapid has proposed Israel should give up much of the West Bank -- while retaining control of Jersualem.
Yair Lapid is the son of the late politician Tommy Lapid, whose one-time anti-religious party Shinui battled the power and influence of the ultra-Orthodox.
One of the leaders is Rabbi Dov Lipman, a confidant of Lapid and an American immigrant to Israel.
With leadership there are two steps, the first is to give people the belief that something can happen, and then to execute it," Lipman said.
"I think Part 1 he's really done.
The piece is entitled "Why I voted for Yair Lapid."
He opposes the wholesale draft exemption of ultra-Orthodox young men, but he advocates a gradualist approach and has an ultra-Orthodox rabbi on his Knesset list.
Yair conveys the impression of a man comfortable in all parts of Israel," Halevi wrote.
