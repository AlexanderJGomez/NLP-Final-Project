Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- Twelve members of former Ivorian president Laurent Gbagbo's inner circle have been indicted for crimes relating to the post-electoral crisis that left over 3,000 dead.
Noël Dje, a representative of the Office of the Public Prosecutor, told CNN those indicted remain under arrest.
"According to our information, everything happened out of the blue yesterday, with no warning.
Around 70 Gbagbo loyalists have been charged by military or civilian courts, while an international arrest warrant has been issued for Charles Blé Goudé, the leader of the pro-Gbagbo Young Patriots militia.
Ouattara Sunday said he was extending an "olive branch" to former members of Gbagbo's party.
