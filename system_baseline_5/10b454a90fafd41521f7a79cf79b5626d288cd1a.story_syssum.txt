(CNN) -- It was a day of firsts at the World Cup as France got a boost from technology and Bosnia and Herzegovina scored a groundbreaking goal.
It turns out the deciding goal was Argentina's second tally, by none other than Lionel Messi, arguably the world's greatest (and most scrutinized) player, who has a history of underperforming in the World Cup.
But entering this year's World Cup, much of the focus lay on Messi's lack of goal scoring in the 2010 tournament, which ended with a 4-0 Argentine loss to Germany in the quarterfinals.
Seferovic's 93rd minute goal was the latest anyone has ever scored in World Cup group play, according to ESPN.
A player barely gets a toe on a ball to poke it away from an attacker.
While the fans at the stadium watched replays and booed the referee's call, new goal line technology showed it was indeed a goal.
It was the first goal confirmed by goal line technology -- introduced at this World Cup by FIFA.
Only?
Ok, we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves; there are 52 matches left.
