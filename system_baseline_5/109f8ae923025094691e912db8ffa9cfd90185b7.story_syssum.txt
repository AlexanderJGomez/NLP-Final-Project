Lewis, 26, allegedly committed at least six sexual assaults in various states since fleeing Massachusetts in September, according to the Massachusetts State Police.
Lewis committed his alleged crimes on his trip west and then circled back east, police said.
Lewis was arrested on August 5 and charged with raping a 14-year-old girl in Southbridge, Massachusetts, police said.
Two days after the North Carolina assault, police said, Lewis returned to his family's home in Massachusetts, where he allegedly beat and robbed his stepfather.
Carlos Dingui said Lewis handcuffed his stepfather to prevent him from calling police.
The firearm that police recovered from Lewis after his arrest Tuesday night matches the description of the one taken from his relative's house.
