(CNN) -- So it looks like President Obama got the message.
But by the end of the debate, he had checked off pretty much every item on his list of "Things I Should Have Done in Denver."
Both substantively and stylistically, Romney operated in Obama's shadow in this match, second banana to the president's leading man.
The town hall debate was a particularly inappropriate setting for Romney to display this side of himself.
When moderator Candy Crowley backed up Obama's version of events over Romney's, the president got off one of the few funny lines of the night: "Could you say that a little louder?"
After the president brought up his rival's overseas investments, Romney cited Obama's own holdings: "Have you looked at your pension?"
Before this debate, I wondered whether Obama would acknowledge the elephant in the room: his shoddy performance in Round 1.
Turns out he didn't need to.
