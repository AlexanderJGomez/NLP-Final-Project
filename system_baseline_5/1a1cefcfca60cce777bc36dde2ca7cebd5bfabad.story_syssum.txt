"It was one of the most difficult conditions I've played in my life," Djokovic told the ATP website.
The world number two missed last week's Madrid Open because of his the trouble in his right wrist and there had been some expectations that Federer would be a headline absentee in the Italian capital.
"It's hard to leave all the family, but I'll see them soon."
I'm there every day, always with the kids, and I see them so often.
Federer will meet France's Jeremy Chardy as he returns to the court just eight days after the expansion of his family.
