Rather than having dinner with her husband, Walter E. "Eugene" Crum, she spent Thursday night mourning his violent death and taking over the job he held as sheriff of Mingo County, West Virginia.
It took two shots to kill Eugene Crum around noon Wednesday, as he sat in a parking lot near the Mingo County courthouse.
The suspect -- Tennis Melvin Maynard, 37 -- was in critical but stable condition Thursday at Cabell Huntington Hospital, said Rockel.
He "said some things to us" on his way to the hospital, West Virginia State Police First Sgt.
"We are unsure at this point," Rockel said, why the sheriff was killed.
"He went crazy," Olgie Maynard told CNN, explaining her son hadn't been the same since he was involved in a workplace explosion five or six years ago in Alabama.

"Those charges are pending on him getting out of the hospital," Rockel said.
"The flame that Sheriff Crum sparked cannot be extinguished," Mingo County Prosecuting Attorney C. Michael Sparks said in a statement read at Thursday's press conference in Williamson.
"It's quite obvious that the last 26 hours have been a difficult time," said Hubbard, president of the Mingo County commission.
