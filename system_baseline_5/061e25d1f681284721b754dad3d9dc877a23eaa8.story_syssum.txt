More than just a daily habit, Facebook has become the place where I get important, often surprising glimpses into the lives of the 1,365 people with whom I've chosen to connect.
They threaten to shut down their accounts, write furious blog posts and organize ridiculous movements such as Quit Facebook Day, which got less than 40,000 people to commit to deleting themselves -- a tiny fraction of the network even back in 2010.
Facebook just is.
Facebook is on track to hit a billion users sometime this year.
Facebook has won the social-media wars because it's where all the people are.
That's what Facebook wants, of course.
When Facebook recently bought photo-sharing app Instagram for $1 billion, Instagram users vowed to quit, complaining that their precious little network had sold out to a monolithic company.
Once Facebook has shareholders to answer to, things may change.
Perhaps a mobile app that accesses the social network's huge population, something Facebook-adjacent that takes what people like about Facebook and turns it into something more nimble and attractive than Facebook itself.
Maybe then I'll think about pulling up stakes.
