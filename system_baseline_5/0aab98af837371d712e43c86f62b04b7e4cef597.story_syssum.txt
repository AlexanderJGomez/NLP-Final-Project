President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi's resignation Thursday came after Houthi rebels kidnapped his chief of staff, seized control of key government buildings in the capital, Sanaa, and failed to abide by provisions of a tentative peace deal hammered out Wednesday.
Who is in charge right now really depends on where in Yemen you are, she said.
"This really creates a situation where even if the Houthis keep control over Sanaa, they have little chance of taking control of the whole country," said Al Rowas.
Despite their takeover of Sanaa, it's unclear whether the Houthis really want to take charge of the country.
Under Wednesday's failed peace deal, the Hadi government had agreed to rewrite parts of the country's constitution to give the Houthis more political power in return for them withdrawing their militias from key government institutions and freeing the President's kidnapped aide.
And in September, Houthi fighters suddenly descended on Sanaa, where they took over government buildings, the main airport and a share of power.
The Houthis have more recently forged an alliance with supporters of former President Saleh, said Al Rowas.
The Muslim Brotherhood is also a powerful group in Yemen -- in the shape of the Al Islah Party -- and is well represented in the transitional government.
The Houthis have publicly said they oppose U.S. drone strikes and U.S. involvement in Yemen.
"The safety and security of U.S. personnel is our top priority in Yemen," U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.
Al-Hamdani, the Yemen analyst, said she didn't see an immediate need to pull U.S. personnel out of Yemen.
Since Hadi's resignation, there has been a lot of anger against the Houthis in parts of the country, said Al Rowas, the IHS Country Risk analyst.
