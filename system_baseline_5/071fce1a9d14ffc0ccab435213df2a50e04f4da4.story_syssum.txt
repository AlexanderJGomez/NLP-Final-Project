While Bush campaigned for 2014 candidates last year, he didn't hit the early primary states like Iowa and New Hampshire, which hold the first two nominating contests and where other potential presidential contenders have already made frequent visits.
His leadership PAC, Right to Rise, held its first fundraiser Wednesday night in Greenwich, Connecticut, which was attended by former high profile figures in the administration of his brother, George W. Bush.
The former governor, however, already has an advantage over the other candidates thanks to name recognition and ties to the Bush family donor network.
Campbell told the Wall Street Journal that Bush "will travel to states around the country in the coming months to support conservative candidates and causes."
