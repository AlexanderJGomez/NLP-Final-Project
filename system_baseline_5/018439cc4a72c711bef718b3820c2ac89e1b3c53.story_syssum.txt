Authorities say Rodger, 22, fatally stabbed three men in his home before killing two women outside a sorority house and then shooting a man at a deli in Isla Vista, California.
"Males who can easily find female mates garner more respect from their fellow men, even children," Rodger wrote.
"Life will become a bitter and unfair struggle for self-worth, all because girls will choose some boys over others.
Rodger wrote about the website PuaHate.com as a "forum full of men who are starved of sex, just like me.

"Every day that I spent at my college, the more inferior and invisible I felt," he wrote.
"I felt like such an inferior mouse whenever I saw guys walking with beautiful girls."
The day before before the rampage, a video posted on YouTube featured Rodger ranting for nearly seven minutes against women who he said rejected him and popular kids who ignored him.
The day in which I will have my revenge against humanity, against all of you."
