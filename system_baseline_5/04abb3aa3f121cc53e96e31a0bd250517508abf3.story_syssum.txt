It's just a fundamental rule in life and in any fight; you don't kick people when they're down.

And the people who work for a living in this country are down.
(These are the latest available figures).
Probably everyone reading this knows someone who is striving mightily, working two jobs and cutting expenses to the bone while barely making ends meet.
For the unemployed and the millions who have been looking for work for six months or more, the struggle is many times harder and uglier.
Let me tell you something I can pretty much bet my house on -- that woman is not using her food stamp card to buy lobsters and caviar.
But today, the food stamp program has an error rate of only 3% -- and those errors were mostly committed by the government in underpayments as well as overpayments and payments to ineligible families.
Fraud is a piece of grain compared with the millions of families who manage to put food on the table because of this program.
If this Congress wants to make cuts, why not look at the Pentagon, notorious for waste?
The average amount a family member gets on food stamps is less than $4 a day.
I urge the Senate to restore every single dime to the food stamp program.
We're lacing up our shoes, too, but we're going to fight these merciless cuts with the golden rule.
It's time and our might will make this right.
