(CNN) -- Residents of a North Dakota town got the all-clear to return home after a fiery crash this week involving a derailed train and a second one carrying crude oil.
When the oil train arrived, the other train transporting grain and soy bean had already derailed, and one of its cars was lying in the oil train's path, he said.
"We are not optimistic that we will be able to retrieve data from those two recorders," Sumwalt said.
Early Tuesday, crews had tested the air for toxic fumes emitted when flames and pillars of smoke towered into the sky near the town.
