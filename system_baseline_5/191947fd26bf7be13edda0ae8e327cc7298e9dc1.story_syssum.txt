Rep. Peter King, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, has said Thursday's hearing is necessary to explore the extent to which al Qaeda is trying to influence and indoctrinate U.S. Muslims, among other things.
He said King is engaged in "fear-mongering," and called the New York Republican "unfit" to head the Homeland Security Committee.
"Leaders of the Muslim community and the Muslim community itself have contributed significantly to the resolution of many of the things that we have resolved over the course of the last 12 to 18 months," Holder said.
And he said top Obama administration officials also say al Qaeda is attempting to radicalize American Muslims, so "Where else would we look?"
"Our concern is that the King hearings are going to sow fear and mistrust of the Muslim community at a time when the nation needs to be coming together," said Farhana Khera, executive director of the group that launched WhatUnites.Us.
"I want to encourage people in the Muslim community ... to be more aggressive in choosing their leaders," he said.
Some critics of the hearings have called King's efforts against Islamic-American terrorism hypocritical.
In the eight years following the September 11, 2001, attacks, 139 Muslim-Americans engaged in terrorism-related violence or were prosecuted for terrorism-related offenses with violent elements, the researchers concluded.
Critics such as King, however, point to a number of recent examples of alleged homegrown terrorism as evidence of a dangerous trend, including the case of Army Maj. Nidal Hassan, a psychiatrist charged with killing 13 people at Fort Hood in 2009.
More than 20 percent of post-9/11 Islamist terror cases in the United States began with tips from Muslim community members or involved cooperation from the family members of alleged plotters, he said.
"But to look for a single profile, unfortunately that doesn't exist right now."
