Haylee Donathan, her mother Candace Watson and Robbie Potter were discovered hiding for the past week at The Morning Star Ranch, a retreat in Valley Center, near San Diego, said Peter Elliott, United States Marshal for the Northern District of Ohio.
Late Tuesday Haylee was in the custody of a children's protective services agency in the San Diego County area, Elliott said.
When asked their reaction, Elliott said, "I believe a little shocked that we were able to find them."
Potter and Watson were still using the same vehicle, a 1980s blue Chevrolet pickup truck they drove from Ohio, Elliott said.
When she is returned to Ohio, Haylee will be placed in the custody of her grandmother, Elliott said.
While on the run, Potter and Watson were reportedly seen on surveillance video on May 31 at a Wal-Mart Store in Marion, Ohio, 40 miles from Mansfield.
Adding to concerns, Watson's roommate, Samantha Covert, said last week in an interview on Nancy Grace that she saw the little girl in bed with her mother and Potter the morning they disappeared.
Elliot said he believed it is a rehab facility and also called it a Christian retreat.
