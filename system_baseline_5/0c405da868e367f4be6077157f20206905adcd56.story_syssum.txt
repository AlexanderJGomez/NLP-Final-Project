Before I became a father, I struggled to find advice that really spoke to me, and I hope that the following bits of wisdom speak to other American dads, men who really want to be the best they can be.
My son, still inside her, was slipping away from us.
But like countless others, we had to make a difficult call that day.
After they clipped the cord and I said the call to prayer in his ear, we brought him around the curtain to his mother.
Are they sure they know what they are doing?"
But how do we do this?
First, my faith tells me that my son is without sin.
Constantly strengthening our own sense of faith as he watches is step three.
Second, my son is good.
Third, my son was born intelligent, as a whole human being, with the ability to express and understand human emotion.
Fourth, my son has rights and responsibilities.
Right now, my son is sleeping.
And we will do the best we know how, praying all along that it is enough.
