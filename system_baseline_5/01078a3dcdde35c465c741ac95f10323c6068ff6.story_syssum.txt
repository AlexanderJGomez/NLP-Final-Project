Richter, testifying via video link from South Korea, said all the shooting ceased when Maj. Nidal Hasan was brought down by police fire.
Still convinced there were other shooters, Richter said that after Hasan was felled by the police fire, he grabbed Hasan's handgun off the ground and prepared to fire it himself at any additional attackers.
And Army investigators said Wednesday that the gunman still had 177 rounds on him when he was shot by police.
One of them, Maj. Mark Todd, testified that he found extra magazines and a second handgun, a revolver, after Hasan was shot four times.
No," Munley said.
Munley said she exchanged fire with the gunman and was injured herself.
In the final moments, "I realized he was closing in," Munley said.
He did not shoot her again and Munley said he appeared to be having problems with his own weapon.
During the period of the final shots, Todd made repeated calls for Hasan to drop his gun.
Army Criminal Investigation Division officer Duane Mitchell said 177 unexpended rounds were recovered from Hasan in both 30- and 20-round magazines.
The prosecution said it planned to complete presenting its case on Thursday.
An Article 32 hearing determines if there is enough evidence to proceed to a court-martial.
