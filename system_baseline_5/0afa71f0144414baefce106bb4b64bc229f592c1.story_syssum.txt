(CNN) -- At least two confirmed tornadoes descended upon towns in western Massachusetts on Wednesday, leaving at least four dead and smashing homes and buildings across a 40-mile stretch, state officials and witnesses reported.
As many as 19 communities reported tornado damage Wednesday evening, Patrick said.
"It's been particularly devastating in downtown Springfield," Patrick said.
"Luckily, two people from inside the building were able to pull her in, and she seemed like she was OK," Makarowski said.
The Massachusetts State Police said it had activated dog teams to look for people in damaged buildings and described many streets in Springfield as "impassable" due to fallen power lines and trees.
