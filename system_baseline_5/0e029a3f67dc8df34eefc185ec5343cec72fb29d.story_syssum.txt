One day after Guardiola had talked openly of his desire to manage in the English Premier League, Bayern announced the 41-year-old Catalan had agreed to coach the German club for three seasons from the start of the 2013/2014 campaign.
"FC Bayern today announces that head coach Jupp Heynckes has decided to retire when his current contract expires on 30 June 2013," read a statement on the German league leader's website.
"As a player, I couldn't realize my dream to play there but I hope in the future, I have a challenge to be a coach or a manager there and feel the experience of all the coaches and players that have been there.
I want to feel the supporters, the environment, the media and the style of the players and everything.
