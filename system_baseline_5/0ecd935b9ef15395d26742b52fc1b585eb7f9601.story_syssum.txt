ET shooting, Ohio State University Police Chief Paul Denton said.
Police believe Brown -- a probational employee since October who had received a poor performance review -- entered the building dressed in dark clothing carrying two handguns and began firing into an office suite, Denton said.
"The university continues normal operations," the school said.
E-mail alerts were sent to students warning them about the shooting, the university said.
