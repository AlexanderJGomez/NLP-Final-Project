(CNN) -- With a slew of domestic violence cases permeating the NFL, some football fans are benching America's favorite fall pastime.
But the recent cases of four players -- Ray Rice, Greg Hardy, Adrian Peterson and Ray McDonald -- have hurled the topic into the spotlight.
McDonald was arrested on August 31 on suspicion of felony domestic violence after he allegedly got involved in an altercation with his fiancee, who was 10 weeks pregnant, a police source told The Sacramento Bee.
Last week, San Francisco 49ers CEO Jed York said the team was awaiting the outcome of the criminal case against McDonald before determining whether to punish him.
But the NFL Players Association said Sunday that it could not confirm whether an appeal decision has been made.
After public outcry over a two-game suspension for Rice, the NFL established a six-game unpaid ban for personnel who violate the league's policy on domestic violence, Goodell said Thursday.
But his attorney said Peterson is "a loving father" who was disciplining his son.
Hardy said he is innocent and has appealed a guilty verdict.
"On Monday morning, I was genuinely excited to come to work and break down what I thought was a fascinating first weekend in the NFL," Storm told viewers.
Storm said she has some lingering questions of her own.
