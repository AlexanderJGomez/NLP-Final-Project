(CNN) -- Shailene Woodley isn't just the lead actress in "The Fault In Our Stars."
If the movie version of "The Fault In Our Stars" is anything like the book, Woodley will soon be proven right.
"In 'Fault,' I am trying to rewrite what a female lead can look like," Woodley said.
I didn't technically know who Shailene Woodley was," he said.
Woodley, who's gone from ABC Family's "The Secret Life of the American Teenager" to high-profile projects like "The Descendants" and "Divergent" in the blink of an eye, was game for the role, chopping off her long hair to accommodate the part.
In the process, she gained something as well: "a deeper sense of gratitude" for life.
