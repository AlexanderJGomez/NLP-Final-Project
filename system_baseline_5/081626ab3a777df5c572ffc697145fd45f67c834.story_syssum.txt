(CNN)At the edge of the Syrian war, photographer Furkan Temir found despair packed in tent camps and an outpouring of humanity from a tight-knit Turkish border community.
"I could not just come during the day and sleep in a hotel at night because I wanted to feel what they feel and truly understand the situation," Temir says, "I found myself sleeping, eating, sharing cigarettes and daily life with the refugees.
"There was constant distraction and demolishment.
Even the best things that happened destroyed homes and people."
First I need to satisfy my own sense of being as human and my connectedness to all humanity," Temir says, "Second I want to provoke a sense of curiosity in people, so they may act on it."
