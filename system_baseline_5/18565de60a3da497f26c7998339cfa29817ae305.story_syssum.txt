The structure, a 94-by-94-foot building, was the location where Tesla hoped to develop wireless communications and clean, free energy for everyone in the early 1900s.
Matthew Inman, the creator of Web cartoon "The Oatmeal," is joining forces with a nonprofit group, The Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe, to help preserve the facility as a science center and museum honoring "the father of the electric age."
"I made a comic about Tesla on my site.
The goal was to raise enough money to buy the property and begin efforts to restore the facility.
Inman said he was shocked by how much, and how quickly, people have donated to save Tesla's lab.
"Tesla, for the past year or two on the Internet, has risen as a cult hero to geek people," Inman said.
Jane Alcorn, president of the Tesla Science Center, said he moved into offices in New York City later, but Wardenclyffe was his final experimental location.
"Tesla foresaw the wireless transmissions we do with our cell phones and our laptops," Alcorn said.
Eventually, the property was lost in 1915 -- to pay off a debt to George Boldt of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel -- before Tesla could realize his dream of free electricity for everyone.
She said her group made a plea on the Internet to the people involved, which attracted the attention of Inman.
Alcorn said the money raised by the IndieGoGo campaign would just purchase the property and facility, not finance the cleanup or restoration of the building into a museum.
