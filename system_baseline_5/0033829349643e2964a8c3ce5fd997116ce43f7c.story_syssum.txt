HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwean lawmakers on Monday narrowly voted for Lovemore Moyo as speaker of the parliament -- making him the first opposition lawmaker to hold the position in the country's history.
Themba-Nyathi represented the splinter MDC faction led by Arthur Mutambara, but he had support of President Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF party.
Attendance at the session of parliament is important since the membership is closely divided between the MDC and the Mugabe's ZANU-PF.
Final results gave 100 seats to an MDC faction led by Morgan Tsvangirai, the party's presidential candidate.
