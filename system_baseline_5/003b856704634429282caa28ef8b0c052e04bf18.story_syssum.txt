(CNN) -- Timothy Bradley says he needs to beat Manny Pacquiao for a second time in Las Vegas on Saturday to move on from the controversial conclusion of their first fight two years ago.
All I did was do my job.
Pacquiao has won world titles at seven weight divisions in a career stretching 18 years but has lost two of his last three fights.
At 35, it would be difficult for Pacquiao to resurrect his career at the very highest level if defeated by Bradley for a second time but he refuses to entertain this notion ahead of the contest.
