The embassy will continue to operate from the current building until the new one is completed in 2016 or 2017, the embassy said.
It was a year ago that the embassy announced it was looking for a new site that is more modern, open, and secure than the current building in London's West End.
The embassy moved to its current site, occupying the entire west side of the square, when the building was completed in 1960.
Since the September 11 attacks in 2001, the embassy has caused controversy locally by installing blast walls in a wide perimeter around the building.
