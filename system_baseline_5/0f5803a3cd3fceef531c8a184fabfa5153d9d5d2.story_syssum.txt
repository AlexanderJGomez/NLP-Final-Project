(Rolling Stone) -- Jack White left his Radio City Music Hall audience confused and angry on Saturday night when he abruptly left the stage and ended the show after only playing for about 55 minutes.
(Later, he asked the crowd to quiet down, "because I can't hear myself think."
The waiting crowd broke into a "Seven Nation Army" singalong, but once the curtain went down, the song quickly devolved into booing and some shouting of "F--- Jack White."
The paper also noted that White had several "angry exchanges" with a shirtless fan in the front row who was removed by security.
