(CNN) -- Kenyans gathered in the nation's capital Saturday for a state funeral honoring Nobel laureate Wangari Maathai, marking a final journey for the first African woman to win the peace prize.
Military forces stood guard next to a mounted picture of the activist, which had a small green shrub pinned on it.
For decades, Maathai has been at the forefront of a tree-planting campaign to stop deforestation and give locals, especially women, access to resources such as firewood for cooking and clean water.
She was honored by Time magazine in 2005 as one of 100 most influential people in the world.
The first African woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize died weeks before another milestone in the continent she fought for.
