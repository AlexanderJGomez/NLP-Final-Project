Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- A battle raged in a strategically located Libyan city Saturday as state television showed a fist-pumping Moammar Gadhafi visiting a school, his first public appearance in days.
Opposition spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah told CNN that rebels flew two attack helicopters from Tobruk to join the fighting in Ajdabiya.
The South African government also said NATO has granted the committee permission to meet with Gadhafi in the Libyan capital, Tripoli.
The United Nations said Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will travel to Cairo Thursday to head meetings on Libya at the Arab League headquarters.
State TV also aired images Gadhafi visiting on Saturday what appeared to be a primary school in Tripoli.
Weldon visited Libya in 2004 when he was a Republican congressman from Pennsylvania and said he was invited this time by Gadhafi.
At the height of their march toward Tripoli, rebels came within 40 kilometers (25 miles) of Sirte -- Gadhafi's hometown in western Libya.
"The troops of Gadhafi have good weapons and have training and have leadership and have experience," one rebel fighter said.
