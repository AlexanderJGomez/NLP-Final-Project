In one report dated August 23, 2011, a Secret Service employee said that during a work trip another employee pushed her onto a bed, got on top of her and tried to engage in sex.
Another allegation made October 23, 2003, said that an agent forced a female acquaintance to have non-consensual sex with him at a hotel in Killeen, Texas.
According to the log note, the agent said he got a phone number "from a woman handing out fliers on the street and called it out of curiosity."
A redacted October 7, 2010, entry with no specifics says there was a report a Secret Service employee might have been involved in the leak of national security information.
He said all the hotline reports were noted and passed on to the Secret Service.
"While some of the allegations proved to be unfounded or frivolous, others appear to be legitimate, and that adds to my concern about apparent misconduct by some of the personnel of this vital law enforcement agency," said Collins, whose committee is investigating the Colombia incident.
Collins added that in her committee's hearing last month, it was revealed there have been 64 allegations of sexual misconduct by Secret Service employees over the past five years.
A dozen members of the military were also involved.
