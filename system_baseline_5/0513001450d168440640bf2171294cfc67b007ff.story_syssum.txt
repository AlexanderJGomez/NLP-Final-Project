Beijing (CNN) -- Demonstrators braved a heavy police presence and the threat of arrest by massing Thursday in the streets of Kunming, China, to protest the planned construction of a chemical plant, they said.
"Every Kunming person cares about this issue," said another Kunming native, a 50-year-old man who said rows of police thwarted his efforts to reach the heart of the protest.
The oil refinery and chemical plant would be built in Anning city, about 50 kilometers (31 miles) west of Kunming, according to Xinhua, China's state news agency.
The provincial general manager of China National Petroleum Corp. has said the refinery will not use the chemical.
As part of the interrogation, she said, police took her to the print shop where she had made copies of her fliers.
"Kunming is a beautiful city, where we have cleaner air than any other cities in this country," Young said.

The emphasis on environmental and health issues comes as China's leaders confront growing anger about choking pollution, contaminated food, and water that is unsafe to drink.
Pollution and dust generated in China have been found as far away as California.
