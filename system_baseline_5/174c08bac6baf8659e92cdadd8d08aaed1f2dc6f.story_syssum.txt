But his luck was about to run out in the chaos of Mogadishu, where the frontlines in the battle between the weak transitional government and al Qaeda affiliate al-Shabaab shift almost weekly.
Mohammed was killed, but to begin with the Somali security forces had no idea who he was.
The other man in the vehicle may also have been a senior al-Shabaab figure by the name of Musa Dheere, according to Kenyan officials.
The forged passport found in the vehicle had a recent exit stamp from South Africa, according to Somali officials.
Al-Shabaab attacked Uganda because it had troops in Mogadishu as part of the African force (AMISOM) protecting the transitional government.
And a recent offensive by Somali troops backed by AMISOM firepower has pushed al-Shabaab out of several districts of the capital -- for now.
The United States has had some success in tracking down al Qaeda militants in Somalia -- with special forces killing Saleh Ali Nabhan two years ago.
And the transitional government is invariably preoccupied with clan-driven power struggles rather than taking on al-Shabaab.
And al-Shabaab does not seem to have been knocked off its stride by Mohammed's death.
