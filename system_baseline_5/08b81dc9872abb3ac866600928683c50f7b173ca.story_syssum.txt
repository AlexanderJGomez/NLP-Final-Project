That's a problem for a president, who has tried to distinguish his administration from that of President George W. Bush on the idea that he is bringing the United States back into compliance with international law.
To help bolster the president's legal case, the Obama administration over the weekend asked Congress to authorize the use of military force.
A senior administration official acknowledged the international legal constraints but said the president is authorized to take action with or without Congress, in part for U.S. national security reasons.
A second senior administration official said the United States is acting on humanitarian as well as security grounds.
The administration official said the military authorization was written narrowly to address Syria but asserted it also has to take contingencies into account.
John Bellinger, former legal adviser to the State Department and the National Security Council under President George W. Bush, said Obama's international law problem is of his own making.
The United States and other nations have been reluctant to accept such a broad change, Bellinger said.
Obama has long grappled with the issue of how to deal with civil war atrocities when international law doesn't offer a way to stop them.
Obama added: "I believe that force can be justified on humanitarian grounds, as it was in the Balkans, or in other places that have been scarred by war.
