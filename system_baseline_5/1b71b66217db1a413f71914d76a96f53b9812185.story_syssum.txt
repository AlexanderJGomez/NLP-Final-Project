Sajida al-Rishawi was sentenced to death for that attempt, and Jordan executed her early Wednesday.
Al-Rishawi was referred to as an "imprisoned sister" of the terrorist group in a message purportedly posted online by a known ISIS supporter.
"They are just demanding the release of their imprisoned sister Sajida al-Rishawi," the voice said.
"My husband detonated his bomb, and I tried to detonate mine but failed," al-Rishawi said on Jordanian television, showing no emotion.
Jordanian authorities said al-Rishawi, now in her 40s, joined her husband, Hussein Ali al-Shamari, to carry out the suicide bombings at the Radisson hotel.
Jordanian authorities at the time said the attacks were orchestrated by the terrorist group al Qaeda in Iraq, which was led by Jordanian-born Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.
"This is just another way to help them (ISIS) bring these people back and help with their propaganda."
After the Jordan attacks, Muasher told CNN that al-Rishawi was not wearing an explosives belt when she was apprehended, but two belts were found with her.
"There were women, men and children."
