(CNN) -- President Obama is facing great challenges as he takes office and may have made a hasty decision to close Guantanamo Bay without addressing all of the repercussions, Sen. John McCain told CNN's Larry King Thursday night.
"I think that it's a wise move," McCain said about closing Guantanamo Bay.
"So, the easy part, in all due respect, is to say we're going to close Guantanamo," McCain said.
"I hope we can work together to, frankly, be a real stimulus package and not just a spending package that has every cat and dog and pet project that people have," he said.
Despite some of their differing viewpoints on how to tackle the biggest problems the president will handle, McCain said he does plan to work with President Obama in any way he can.
The American people are demanding it and they deserve it and they haven't been getting it."
