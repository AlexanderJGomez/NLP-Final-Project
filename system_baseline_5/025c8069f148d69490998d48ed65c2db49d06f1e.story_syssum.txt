(CNN) -- Explorer Dennis Schmitt found an island nearly two years ago near Greenland.
"One [was] that this was going to be significant because it was going to be an example of climate change."
Many climatologists and scientists say arctic ice melt and other changes in the Earth's climate are the result of an increase in the world's temperature, a trend widely called global warming.
Most of the scientific community believes that some warming is occurring across the globe and through some layers of the atmosphere.
There are several possible reasons for the warming, scientists say.
"For the last 30 years, there's no way there's anything natural that can explain it," Stephen Schneider, a professor of environmental studies at Stanford University in California, said.
But there are those who do not share his view, and among the skeptics is Richard Lindzen, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Since then, there's been a few tenths of global warming, so we're proclaiming global warming."
Asked about glacial melt, which many observers point to as evidence of global warming, Lindzen said the way glaciers change and move are phenomena largely unexplained.
The models don't predict it," he said.
"Exactly how much it's going to warm up, we don't know," Schneider said.
