(CNN) -- A heavy police presence in Bahrain on Sunday limited marches by protesters organized to coincide with the controversial Formula One race in the kingdom, won by world champion Sebastian Vettel.
Police raids were reported in some areas overnight, apparently as part of a crackdown by authorities to ensure calm ahead of the Grand Prix.
Maj. Gen. Tariq Hassan Al-Hassan, Bahrain's public security chief, said meticulous planning had gone into the event, the official Bahrain News Agency reported Saturday.
The 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix was canceled after drivers, including former Formula One star Damon Hill, raised concerns after the death of at least 35 demonstrators in a clampdown on unrest.
"The Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and Formula One Management (FOM) wish to jointly confirm their belief that the Bahrain GP should go ahead this weekend," the two bodies said in a statement.
The protests in Bahrain started in February 2011, spurred by uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt.
Canceling the race in 2011 cost Bahrain from $480 million to $800 million in potential investments, according to estimates.
