So he ordered the creation of some 8,000 terra-cotta soldiers, along with hundreds of terra-cotta horses and chariots, to be buried with him in his tomb.
The difference is these female terra-cotta warriors are not out to protect any emperor, but were created to bring attention to the plight of girls in China.
And, in a striking parallel to the terra-cotta soldiers, the terra-cotta girls will also become an archaeological project.
Perhaps for those reasons, Nourry didn't encounter difficulties with the Chinese government in pursuing this project in China.
She created the first eight statues modeled after eight girls whom she met through an orphan charity in China.
When Nourry asked them to give their artistic interpretation in sculpting the female statues, they were initially tentative.
Her favorite moment was when the eight girls saw the terra-cotta statues of themselves and were delighted.
One looks at these amazing terra-cotta statues and feel compelled to ask -- why aren't there more of them?
