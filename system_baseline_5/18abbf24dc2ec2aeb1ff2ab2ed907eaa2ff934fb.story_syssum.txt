(CNN) -- Italy's MotoGP star Marco Simoncelli was killed in a crash on the second lap of the Malaysian MotoGP Sunday.
"Marco Simoncelli succumbed to injuries sustained in the Malaysian MotoGP," read a short statement on the official MotoGP website to confirm the fatality.
Rossi, a seven-time world champion in motorcycling's elite category, left the track devastated by the accident involving his fellow Italian and "good friend" Simoncelli.
The Italian sports community was left stunned by Simoncelli's death and a minute's silence was held at all major events, including Serie A football games.
