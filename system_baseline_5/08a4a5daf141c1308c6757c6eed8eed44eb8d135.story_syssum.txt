Jansen, the first black dean of education at the University of the Free State, is one of South Africa's leading academics and intellectuals.
Throughout his long and esteemed educational career, which has taken him from teaching biology in high school classrooms to leading one of South Africa's premier learning institutions, Jansen has been doing everything he can to keep education uppermost in the minds of his students.
Passionate about the transformative power of knowledge, Jansen holds strong opinions about the state of education in South Africa.
Citing reconciliation "on a deeply divided campus," Jansen decided to invite the students to return to the university and resume their studies, regardless of their legal consequences.
"If in the process of forgiving and reconciling, we enable other transformations to take place, which is exactly what happened, then that is a better way to go than the thirst -- the understandable thirst let me say -- for vengeance," he says.
