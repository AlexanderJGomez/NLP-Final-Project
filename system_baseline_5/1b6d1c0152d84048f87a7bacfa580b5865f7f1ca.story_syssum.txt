The clinic is consistently among the country's best in quality ratings, and its costs are among the lowest -- which is why President Obama often cites the Cleveland Clinic as an example of how health care in America should be, and why Nissen and other leading doctors here are frequently consulted by lawmakers and administration officials pushing major reforms this year.

One of the ways you facilitate collaboration is you take the issue of personal income out of the equation."
At the Cleveland Clinic, Nissen and other doctors are paid a fixed salary.
"Seventy percent of the cost in health care is from chronic disease," Cosgrove told us in an interview at his Cleveland Clinic office.
Cosgrove, like Nissen, is an enthusiastic proponent of major national health care reforms that bring coverage to the estimated 45 to 50 million Americans who lack health insurance and that put an emphasis on primary and preventive care.
Cosgrove said there is without a doubt ample waste in those programs.
"If you begin to take money away, my concern is that you begin to drive quality down," he said.
Again, Cosgrove is emphatic that there are substantial cost savings in federal health programs that can be achieved over time.
In another cautionary note, Cosgrove, however, said over time he believes widespread electronic record keeping -- and sharing -- will lead to fewer duplicative tests and other cost savings, but that the jury is still out on that question.
"What we've seen is our quality's gone up -- substantially," Cosgrove said.
