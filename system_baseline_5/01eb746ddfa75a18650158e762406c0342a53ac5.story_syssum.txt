Dolphins coach Joe Philbin suspended Incognito on Sunday night.
Incognito said he didn't want to comment on media reports that he sent line-mate Jonathan Martin voice mails containing racial slurs and threats of physical violence.
I'll (expletive) in your (expletive) mouth.
I'll kill you."
Philbin said Martin left the team after an incident at the team's cafeteria.
The Dolphins spent Sunday gathering information, after which he suspended Incognito, Philbin said.
Several media outlets said Martin had left the Dolphins because of bullying, something Incognito denied on Twitter.
The Miami Herald reported that a Dolphins source said Incognito is "done" with the team.
The Sporting News takes a yearly poll of NFL players, and in 2009 they dubbed Incognito the dirtiest player in the league.
The NFL will review the case, league spokesman Greg Aiello said Monday.
Dolphins rookie Will Davis said he hasn't experienced any acts of bullying or hazing.
He said everyone on the team loves Incognito.
He said when Incognito joined the team, he would test people to see where he stood with them.
In a segment shown on an HBO series that follows one NFL team during each preseason, Incognito figured out a teammate's iPad password.
Still, former Dolphins running back Ricky Williams said it occurs less frequently in the NFL than most people think.
