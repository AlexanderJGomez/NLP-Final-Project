Sheridan, 48, returns to the stand Friday after testifying all day Thursday in her legal battle with Cherry and ABC over the TV killing of a character she played on the hit comedy series for five seasons.
The hit was just "a light tap on the head" intended to demonstrate "a piece of physical humor" Cherry wanted Sheridan to perform, the defense said in opening statements Wednesday.
Then he hit her his open right hand, she said.
Cherry apologized to her soon after the hitting incident, telling her "I am on bended knee begging for your forgiveness," Sheridan testified.
"He felt the incident had been resolved," Sheridan said he told her.
Britt is "a very colorful character, sassy, overt, audacious," Sheridan said.
The demise of Sheridan's character was first considered at the end of the third season, which ended with Britt's head in a hangman's noose, but a senior executive decided it was too soon for her to go, Levin said.
The character was not initially intended to be on the show beyond the pilot episode, but Cherry decided to make her the "blond bombshell who would sleep with the husbands of all of the wives," he said.
The human resources investigator never interviewed Cherry or Sheridan about the incident, only three people who worked for Cherry, Baute said.
Contracts introduced during Sheridan's testimony revealed that she is still getting royalties from the show, even for the last three seasons after her termination.
