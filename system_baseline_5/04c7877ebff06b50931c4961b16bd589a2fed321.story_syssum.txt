The disturbance began Saturday at the Reeves County Detention Center near Pecos in west Texas, and hundreds of inmates continued rioting overnight in the second such incident at the facility in less than two months.
With one of three buildings at the detention center damaged extensively in the rioting, "the warden is trying to figure out where [the prison] can house the inmates," Orsoco said.
As many as 2,000 inmates from two of the center's three buildings began fighting in the prison yard about 4:30 p.m. Saturday, according to the sheriff's office.
