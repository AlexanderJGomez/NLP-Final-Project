A portrait of Eluana Englaro taken in July 2008 in Italy.
It is on that basis that Englaro argued his daughter should be allowed to die, because she had expressed the wish not to be kept alive while in a coma -- indirectly refusing treatment, he said.
But although Englaro had cleared the last legal hurdle, the court's decision sparked a new fight to find a hospital or clinic that would take out Eluana's feeding tube.
The Udine clinic says the removal of Eluana's tube will begin in about three days, and the process of allowing her to die will take about 20 days.
The outline adheres to the Cassation Court's ruling, which required certain steps and conditions once Eluana's feeding tube is removed.
