Staff at the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program in Charleston, South Carolina, allegedly shared information about the test on reactor operations among themselves, officials said of their findings so far.
Navy officials said staff must qualify to operate and instruct students on a training reactor.
Navy officials stressed that the nuclear propulsion systems are not related to nuclear weapons.
But Richardson saw no parallels with the Air Force on that issue.
