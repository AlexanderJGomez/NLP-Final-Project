Sidney Frank, shown accepting an honorary degree in 2005, gave $100 million to Brown University.
Frank -- who left Brown after one year in the late 1930s because he couldn't afford to stay -- gave the school a $100 million endowment in 2004.
The gift was the largest single one ever given to Brown and one of the largest ever given for undergraduate scholarships in the United States, according to the school.
"I sat in this guy's office ... and he said, '$37,000 for tuition,' " Reil recalled.
"
Brown no longer does that, and Frank's gift was "integral" in bringing the change, said Jim Miller, Brown's dean of admissions.
Most recipients are the first in their families to go to college, Miller said.
Frank, though he went to Brown only one year, landed an engineering job at Pratt & Whitney in part because someone there had gone to the school, said his daughter, Cathy Halstead.
When Brown gave him an honorary degree in 2005, not long after his gift and months before his January 2006 death, people gave him a hero's welcome, she said.

Reil and Reyes Castro said they couldn't thank Frank enough if he were alive.
