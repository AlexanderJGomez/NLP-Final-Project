This seems to be a global truth that is perhaps best evidenced by the array of unusual food festivals the world over.
"Hawaii is one of the biggest consumers of Spam in the world," explains Karen Winpenny, an organizer of the annual Waikiki Spam Jam, which last year had 25,000 visitors.
In the past, we've had Spam ravioli, Spam kotsu, Spam poki, Spam French fries -- pretty much everything can be made with Spam," says Winpenny.
On August 23, Barnesville, Minnesota, will celebrate Potato Days, an annual two-day festival dedicated to the humble tuber.
No matter how many activities the organizers introduce, however, the most popular remains the mashed potato wrestling competition.
In Bessieres, France, the townspeople make a giant omelet every Easter to feed the poor, a tradition that supposedly started when Napoleon and his army stopped in the town for the night.
"It's grown to seven cities throughout the world, and we each add a local ingredient," says Arlene White, the third Grand Maitre of Abbeville's Giant Omelette Celebration.
"We're a small village, so you can imagine how crowded it gets," says Michèle Fasler, a spokeswoman for Räbechilbi.
Just don't eat the turnips, she warns.
