"This is the first time we had to close off air filtered by the facility to the outside," Energy Department spokesman Gregory Sahd told CNN.
Officials believe there is no danger to the community because it was quickly contained.
Sahd said there have been no injuries reported, and the area officials believe was affected has been closed off.
Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich said in a statement Saturday that they remain in contact with Energy Department officials.
