Peter Bergen says deals with the Taliban could further destabilize the situation in Afghanistan.
It's not only going to be more complex, but doing deals with the Taliban today could further destabilize Afghanistan.
First, the Afghan government is a sovereign entity and any agreements with the Taliban must be made by it.
Second, while Obama didn't talk about dealing with Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, it is worth pointing out the Taliban leadership, including Mullah Omar, has in the past several months taken every opportunity to say that it has no interest in a deal with the Afghan government.
And he did.
Seventh, "reconcilable" Afghan Taliban leaders have already reconciled to the government.
Eighth, while the Taliban was never a monolithic movement, it is much closer to al Qaeda today than it was before 9/11.
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a commander allied to the Taliban, has been close to bin Laden since at least 1989, according to militants who know both men.
The use of suicide attacks, improvised explosive devices and the beheadings of hostages -- all techniques that al Qaeda perfected in Iraq -- are methods that the Taliban have increasingly adopted in Afghanistan and have grown exponentially there since 2005. iReport.com: Should there be a deal with the Taliban?
But "jaw-jaw" with the Taliban won't work if they think they are winning as they do right now.
Those deployments strongly suggest that for all the public discussion of negotiations with the Taliban the decision already has been made that any such negotiations should precede from a position of strength rather than weakness.
