This year's broadcast, which aired Tuesday night, paid tribute to R&B great Al Green, the multitalented Sting, Oscar-winning actor Tom Hanks, dancer Patricia McBride and comedian Lily Tomlin.
The band was followed by such performers as Jennifer Hudson ("Simply Beautiful"), Usher ("Let's Stay Together") and Mavis Staples and Sam Moore ("Take Me to the River").
Gaga sang to him, giving "Faith in You" a little Green-esque soul.
An appreciative Hanks had an amusing way of sizing up the show.
