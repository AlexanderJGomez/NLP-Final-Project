In the first days of the newly minted 112th Congress, after the 2010 midterms gave Republicans control of the House of Representatives, the American people were clamoring for action on jobs and the economy.
Maybe for conservative Republicans but certainly not for most Americans, especially when unemployment was 9% and the economy was still reeling from the Great Recession.
Meanwhile, Republicans have touted a list of "more than 30 jobs bills" they have passed in the House but have failed in the Democratic Senate.
The American people have entrusted Republicans with control of Congress.
For six years, Republicans have condemned President Barack Obama and the Democratic agenda.
Going into this election, while only 23% of Americans have a "very positive" view of Obama and just 12% view the Democratic Party very positively, the favorability percentage for the Republican Party is even lower -- just 7%, according to one survey.
That would be stupid.
Now that they have full power in Congress either to compromise or not with the White House, Republicans have no more excuses.
And if Republicans don't start learning how to lead in a responsible, bipartisan fashion, the American people will have no more patience.
