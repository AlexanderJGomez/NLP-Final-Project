New York (CNN) -- Like so many other people of my generation, John Lennon and the Beatles made an indelible stamp on my life.
Just a couple of weeks earlier, we had reported on Lennon's comeback with the album "Double Fantasy," which marked his re-emergence after five years out of the music business as a self-proclaimed "househusband."
Are the reports mistaken?
We gathered that night in our offices to sift through the material that we had: old Beatles footage, a Lennon documentary that my producer shot years earlier, and the famous D.A.
Canada had a rich history with Lennon: It was there that he made his post-Beatles debut with the Plastic Ono Band in 1969 and staged his famous North American bed-in in Montreal.
He will stay there for at least another two years as he was just denied parole for the sixth time.
Lennon's profound influence on music and musicians continues to this day.
Marc Roberge, the lead singer of alt-rockers O.A.R., was not even 2 years old when Lennon was killed.
Like Roberge, I've often wondered what would have happened had Lennon not been murdered.
