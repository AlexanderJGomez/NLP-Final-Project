In a pandemic, millions of people worldwide could be killed.
H7N9 influenza, also known as bird flu, is spreading in China, though fortunately it has not mutated to become an infectious disease outbreak that could threaten the health of people around the world.
The World Health Organization estimates multidrug-resistant tuberculosis already has infected a half a. million people across the globe.
For example, Chagas disease is a chronic infection generally acquired by people in rural areas of Latin America, but about 300,000 people now living in the United States have this disease.
Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease common in the tropics that infects more than 60 million people in the United States.
That's why CDC partners with nations all over the world to detect and respond to disease outbreaks.
CDC is helping countries around the world strengthen their ability to prevent avoidable catastrophes and epidemics, detect threats early, and respond rapidly and effectively.
That's why we announced Thursday that the United States, through the work of the CDC and the departments of Agriculture, State, and Defense, has committed to cooperate with at least 30 partner countries to better prevent, detect, and effectively respond to infectious disease threats, better protecting at least 4 billion people around the world -- including the United States -- from threats.
Helping other countries makes those countries, and the United States, safer.
