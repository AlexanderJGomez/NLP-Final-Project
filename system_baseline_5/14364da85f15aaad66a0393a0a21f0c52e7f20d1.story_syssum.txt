When the second tower collapsed, there was no place for me to hide.
They weren't.
One of the lucky ones.
The National September 11 Memorial and Museum now has the rights to the book to support its programming and exhibitions in perpetuity.
The president called the museum a "sacred place of healing and of hope."
We were covered in the same ash and were choking on the same smoke.
Museum officials tell me it's one of several survivor artifacts and is displayed alongside a written portion of my story.
My hope is that by supporting the Memorial and Museum, I am, in some small way, honoring those who died and recognizing fully that I am still one of the lucky ones.
