While the French team was trying to rescue that person, their excavation machine, which resembles a bulldozer, tipped into a hole and caused a further collapse, said Lt. Col. Christophe Renou of French Civil Protection.
But at 11 p.m. Tuesday, the teams determined there was no one else alive under the rubble, and they called off the rescue mission, Renou told CNN Wednesday.
At one point, he said, a female Mexican rescue worker was trapped under the rubble and teams had to work to save her life.
Doctors found him suffering from extreme dehydration and malnutrition, but without significant crushing injuries.
