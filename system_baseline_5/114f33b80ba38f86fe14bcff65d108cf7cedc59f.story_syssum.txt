Romero, who described her recovery as a "miracle" from God, said she was ready to do whatever she could to help others infected with Ebola.
Romero spent 30 days at the Carlos III Hospital in Madrid, the same hospital where she contracted the illness while helping to care for an infected missionary who had been brought back from West Africa.
"When I saw myself dying, I had memories of my family, of my husband," she said.
As a childless couple, the dog "was the son we never had," Limon said.
Romero is now clear of the virus but still recovering her strength, Dr. Jose Ramon Arribas told a news conference earlier Wednesday, flanked by other hospital personnel.
Ramon said that through Romero's case, the hospital had learned many lessons about the treatment of patients with Ebola and how to protect the staff caring for them.
