Jean Lindsay records a video telling people to get out of their nightgowns and look for work.
"I know I can count on you to send me great letters of support and cheer," Lindsay told viewers on CNN's iReport.com.
At a time when the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says that 1.07 million people 55 and older are unemployed and looking for work, the Internet is an increasingly useful tool for older people looking for jobs and a sense of community, said Deborah Russell the AARP's director of workforce issues.
"It's a great way of being able to network with people who are either in a similar situation or who may have some resources to help you," she said.
But Lindsay didn't stop there.
"I was in my nightgown at noon, and I wasn't getting at the job search very fast, and I thought, 'this is instructive,' " she said, laughing.
This economy can push people into depression and mental illness, she said, and she wants people to know they're not alone.
Like a good book, Lindsay says the Internet also opens new worlds for her.
Dan Beach, Lindsay's second cousin, who lives in Florida, said Skype, social media sites and online video have been "a salvation" for Lindsay.
"She's gotten so much response to it, and I'm wondering whether she might try to make something out of that," he said.
Lindsay, who said she needs a job because she has home-improvement debt and can't sell her house in this slumped market, said she is able to keep hunting for jobs partly because of her creative outlet online.
"I love hardware stores, so Lowe's would have been perfect.
We're probably fooling ourselves that we can go on and do anything," she said, "but we can't live that way."
