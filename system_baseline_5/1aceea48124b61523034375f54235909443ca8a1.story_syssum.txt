Lakey didn't know who Schaffner was at first, but said he felt something wasn't right after seeing Schaffner and his car, partly because Schaffner didn't make eye contact with him.
Lakey, who was staying at the motel, said he remembered seeing news reports about a man sought in a string of bank robberies, so he looked on the Web site of the television show "America's Most Wanted" to check a vehicle description in the case.
Schaffner faces charges including bank robbery in Tennessee; burglary in Indiana; armed robbery in Illinois; and receiving stolen property in Ohio, Price said.
No bond has been set, she said.
"This guy has made no effort to hide the gun," said FBI agent Kevin Keithley last month.
When Schaffner was identified, the FBI said he was released from an Indiana prison last year following an armed robbery conviction.
The man said he'd known Schaffner for about two months, according to a federal criminal complaint.
He had threatened to kill the children if she told agents he was there, the woman said.
