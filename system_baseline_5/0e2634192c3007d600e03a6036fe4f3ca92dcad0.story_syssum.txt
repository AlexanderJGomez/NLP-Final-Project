Mumbai, India (CNN) -- I normally don't dwell on what I am going to wear before I go on a shoot.
I was not.
Ganesh Shinde, 42, has been doing this job since 2007.
Shinde sweeps, his partner scoops.
I saw child after child carrying a mug of water come to the road where we waited with Shinde.
"Now I am used to it," Shinde says, admitting he found it hard when he first started the job.
Shinde has no gloves.
Often, scavengers have to enter manholes too to clear blockages and it's not uncommon for them to drink a quick swig of alcohol before starting their job.
"They have to numb their senses," Shinde explains.
Most manual scavengers are Dalits -- people belonging to the lowest strata of India's caste system.
Shinde says it's hard to get a cup of tea.
"It's just easier if I walk home," Shinde says.
I asked Shinde what hopes he has for his child.
India's current prime minister, Narendra Modi, hopes to change the future not just for Shinde's daughter but for millions of Indians who are forced to live with unsanitary and unhygienic conditions every day.
Lets hope he delivers on this promise.
