Gard is one of the organizers of "Occupy Melbourne," a group that started on Facebook that now has more than 2,000 members with plans to protest on October 15 in City Square.
Gard and the planned Australian spin-offs of "Occupy Wall Street" are not alone.
"Occupy Wall Street" began on September 17 and is now spreading to cities across the U.S.
Bankers have got off scot-free whilst the people of this country are being punished for a crisis they did not create," said the group's Facebook invite page.
While the Australian economy -- driven by strong commodity sales of iron ore and coal --escaped the brunt of the 2008 financial crisis, Gard said many Australians don't feel they're sharing in the wealth.
