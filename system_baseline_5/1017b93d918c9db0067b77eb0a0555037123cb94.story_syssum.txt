Dickinson is the latest of a handful of women who have accused Cosby of sexual assault -- allegations the comedian has repeatedly said are untrue.
Cosby attorney Martin Singer called Dickinson's story "a lie" and said it contradicts her own autobiography and a 2002 interview she did with the New York Observer.
In its wake, one of his accusers, Barbara Bowman, turned to the public once more with an article in The Washington Post and interviews with CNN.
Bowman claims she was drugged, then raped, though she said she never saw drugs.
