Critics of using stimulus money for the bridge say it would give the software giant a break on a pet project.
Microsoft is hardly getting the bridge for free.
"Our traffic studies show that Microsoft traffic would be about 42 percent of the bridge, yet Microsoft is paying for about 50 percent of the bridge, so we think we are getting fair value.
"This is $11 million where we are substituting public money for private money, and that means there's some other project that would have a greater benefit than a bridge to Microsoft that's not being built," says Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense.
Microsoft is one of the most lucrative companies in the country," Ellis says.
Microsoft did not respond to CNN requests for an interview on the bridge project.
Michael Ennis of the Washington Policy Center, a Seattle-based not-for-profit group that advises policy makers, said there are many reasons the bridge project is a good one.
But Ennis also says the bridge does not fit with the kind of projects the stimulus plan is meant to bankroll.
