(CNN) -- The first patient to be diagnosed with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, in the United States is recovering well and should be able to go home from the hospital soon, doctors said Monday.
He told his doctors that the hospital had MERS patients, although he does not remember working with any of those infected.
No patients at the Indiana hospital had close contact with the MERS patient, who was in a private triage unit and admitted to a private bed on a general medical floor within three hours of showing up at the facility.
Both the family and health care workers have all tested negative for the virus and all are on home isolation, officials said.
Out of an abundance of caution, Indiana health officials and the CDC have acquired the passenger lists from the planes the patient took from Saudi Arabia -- he changed planes in London and landed in Chicago -- and the bus he took to Indiana.
The patient was not symptomatic at the time of travel, according to the doctors.
While the patient in Indiana was the first MERS case on U.S. soil, the CDC has been preparing for such a scenario and had been conducting an awareness campaign with hospitals and doctors since MERS emerged.
"MERS picked the wrong hospital, the wrong state, the wrong country to try to get a foothold," said Dr. William VanNess, Indiana state health commissioner.
