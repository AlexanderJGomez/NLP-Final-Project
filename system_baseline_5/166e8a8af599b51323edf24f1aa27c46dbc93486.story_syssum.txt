New York (CNN) -- Jazz master Wynton Marsalis says the blues is the true American music -- the heartbeat and unifying principle of jazz, country, R&B, gospel and other styles -- but it's been relegated to the back of the bus by greed and the legacy of racism.
In an interview Tuesday, Marsalis talked to CNN.com about the primary position of the blues in American music.
CNN: You have a DVD out called "Willie Nelson and Wynton Marsalis Play the Music of Ray Charles."
It's in New Orleans music, it's in jazz, it's in country music, it's in gospel.
He and Willie Nelson came 'round in young manhood at a time in the late '40s early 1950s when all of the American music, root music, was all combined.
It's like in cuisine, that would be like fried chicken and red beans and rice, it would be like potato salad and barbecued ribs.
MARSALIS: It came from who we didn't like.
MARSALIS: They didn't appreciate it.
That's a long time.
MARSALIS: No question.
...
MARSALIS: The blues was like a solution to that, an antidote to it.
MARSALIS: It is America.
That's how the blues is, that's why it fits with everything, country-western, bluegrass -- everybody's playing the same music.
And that's the main thing our music, and the history of our music, can teach us as a nation.
It sounds like you got a lot of your ideas about integrity from him.
From him.
We were playing a dance at a high school, he didn't know any of the music, but he played all of the music we had.
MARSALIS: No, no, never, I never suffered from that misconception, because he was so much hipper than the people I was around.
MARSALIS: The main three components are the blues, improvisation -- which is some kind of element that people are trying to make it up -- and swing, which means even though they're making up music, they're trying to make it up together.
