Of course that was long before the, "there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded," interviews and tell-all books alleging suicide attempts and acts of betrayal, but back then I was unaware of her more scandalous infamy.
As the world awaits the impending birth of William and Kate's second baby, potential names have become the topic of rampant speculation and heated debate.
That said, in the event the couple do welcome a baby girl, I would hope that they do not opt to name her Diana.
Diana's name conjures up both positive and negative responses the world over, and whichever side of the fence you're on, the moniker seems to me an almighty burden for a newborn baby to carry.
Since Diana's death almost 18 years ago, William has honored his mother's memory in a private and personal fashion.
I still miss Diana.
Diana's tragic, untimely death and iconic status will ensure her memory is kept alive for generations to come.
