President Obama said during the 2008 campaign that we should be able to disagree without being disagreeable.
That said, I respectfully disagree with West and Smiley's characterization of President Obama's first term in office.
They ignore the positive moves Obama has made to benefit -- in real ways -- the black community, the poor, the disadvantaged, and the country as a whole.
Let's take Obama and health care reform.
President Obama signed The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which invests $5 billion in early childhood programs like Head Start.
President Obama also expanded Pell Grants, which help low income students pay for college.
There's more.
To review, then: Putting money into community colleges, job readiness programs, putting actual checks into actual hands -- these things don't sound like the actions of someone who doesn't care about the poor and impoverished.
If West and Smiley would like Obama to do more, that's valid.
I'm not saying that President Obama should be exempt from criticism, nor do I believe it is some act of racial treason for a black person to hold our president accountable for his actions.
We must not forget the mess that President Obama walked into.
...The road ahead will be long.
