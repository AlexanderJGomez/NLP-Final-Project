Despite the controversial shootings, American and Honduran officials say they both are happy with their collaboration and consider Operation Anvil -- launched in April -- a success.
"The amount of drugs seized and the disruption of narcotrafficking routes speak for themselves," said Jorge Ramon Hernandez Alcerro, the Honduran ambassador to the United States.
The pair of shootings by DEA agents follow an episode in May in which villagers in the country's Mosquitia coastal region say Honduran forces aboard American helicopters mistakenly fired on a civilian riverboat, killing four, including two pregnant women.
A U.S. official with knowledge of the incident said that the preliminary Honduran investigation, as well as a video of the incident, raises doubts about claims by those on the riverboat that they were innocent victims.
Officials say they have seen a decreased role in Operation Anvil as the DEA team has stepped up, but a limited number of U.S. troops remain at the forward operating locations.
What's not new is the teamwork between the DEA and vetted Honduran police who participate in the operations, Posivak said.
The DEA "is in Honduras at the request of our government in a support and training capacity," Hernandez said.
"It's not a problem that can be solved by law enforcement alone," he said.
DEA agents were present, but did not fire their weapons, officials say.
For us who gain no benefit, these costs are unacceptable," Pastor said.
Hernandez, the Honduran ambassador, counters that Operation Anvil and other programs are not military operations, but law enforcement ones.
Drug cartels exert such influence in the region that both law enforcement and civilian government agencies have been corrupted, he said.
Posivak, the U.S. embassy spokesman, said Operation Anvil has already proven successful at disrupting criminal organizations.
