NEW YORK (CNN) -- Lawyers for former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn urged a judge on Wednesday to dismiss a civil suit brought against him by the New York hotel housekeeper who accused him of assaulting her last year.
But, the criminal case against Strauss-Kahn was later dropped by New York prosecutors, because of credibility issues they cited in Diallo's account.
Lawyer Douglas Wigdor told the court Wednesday that Strauss-Kahn "brutally sexually assaulted" Diallo, arguing that Strauss-Kahn does not enjoy blanket diplomatic immunity from civil action.
But, Mehta countered that Strauss-Kahn was eager to assert his innocence in the criminal proceedings, and so he didn't invoke whatever immunity he enjoyed as IMF chief.
