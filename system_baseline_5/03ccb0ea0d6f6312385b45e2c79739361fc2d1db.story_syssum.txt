He said Colombian officials will do whatever they can to guarantee journalist Romeo Langlois' release by the rebel group, commonly known as the FARC.
Langlois, who works for the France 24 television network and is a war reporter with more than 10 years experience in the country, was reporting alongside soldiers when the rebel group attacked on April 28, the Colombian government has said.
The Colombian government and military officials have said that Langlois was not wearing a full military uniform, but was wearing a helmet and a protective vest.
The leftist guerrillas have been at war with the Colombian government since the 1960s, and are known for holding prisoners and hostages in remote jungle camps.
Kidnapping government forces and civilians has been a key strategy of the rebel group.
Last month, the FARC released a group of 10 members of the military and police that it said were its last government hostages.
