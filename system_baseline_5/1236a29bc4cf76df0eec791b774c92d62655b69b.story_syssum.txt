"I do not want him with Nicolas Cage," Fulton said.
Weston Cage, in a statement delivered through his father's lawyer Friday afternoon, said that he did not want his mother to be involved in his care.
"My son is under a spell, he's under a trance," Fulton said.
He had a system that was fantastic.
She said she fired Villegas three years ago, but Nicolas Cage rehired him.
Fulton, who separated from Cage after their son was born, said the father was rarely around for her son growing up, while she dealt with his medical and psychological issues.
"My son right now has been under the care of Nicolas," she said.
"Ms. Fulton comments about Mr. Cage are absurd and it's very unfortunate that she would lash out like this because her son does not want to have anything to do with her," Singer said.
"I'd like my son to be with his mom, where it worked," Fulton said.
Why would you interfere with that?
