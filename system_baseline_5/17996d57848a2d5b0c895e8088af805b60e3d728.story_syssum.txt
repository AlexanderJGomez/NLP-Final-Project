(CNN)  -- Caroline Wozniacki moved a win nearer to reclaiming the world number one spot from Kim Clijsters but her passage to the last 16 in Dubai only came after her Russian opponent, Anna Chakvetadze, fainted on court.
Wozniacki, who needs to reach the semifinals in Dubai to dislodge Australian Open champion Clijsters, next plays Ayumi Morita as the Japanese qualifier continued her superb run.
Kuznetsova lost to the French Open winner in the longest women's match in grand slam history in last month's Australian Open, four hours 44 minutes.
"Andy would like to apologize to both the tournament and its fans," he told his official website.
