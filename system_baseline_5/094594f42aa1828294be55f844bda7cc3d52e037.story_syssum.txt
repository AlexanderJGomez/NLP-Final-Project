Former flight engineer George Hopkins says he remembers vividly being hijacked to Cuba in 1968.
"I can still remember very vividly," said Hopkins, 71.
Hopkins said he felt a burning sensation where the gun was pointed on his face.
But the armed man was extremely nervous and shaking, Hopkins said.
"He said don't worry about it, we've done this before," Hopkins said.
They received 15-year and 12-year sentences, respectively.
Hopkins wonders now whether he would even recognize Pena Soltren.
Your mind is able to flush things once in awhile, until something happens and then you recall it."
