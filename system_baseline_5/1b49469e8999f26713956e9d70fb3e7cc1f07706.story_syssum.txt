The 66th Primetime Emmy Awards will be handed out Monday night, and what was expected to be a coronation honoring the final season of AMC's "Breaking Bad" has emerged as something a little more competitive, thanks to HBO's "True Detective," the moody crime series starring Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson.
Certainly that will be enough to earn it best drama, right?
Even if "Breaking Bad" wins best drama, "Detective" might take other major categories.
The comedy categories are incredibly competitive this year.
But what will take its place?
Will best comedy actor go to "Big Bang's" Jim Parsons again -- he's won three of the last five -- or Louis C.K.?
The famed comedian and actor, who died August 11, will be remembered during the "In Memoriam" section in a tribute presented by Billy Crystal.
The popular series -- part travelogue, part game, all fun -- won nine out of 10 years from 2003 to 2012, except for 2010, when "Top Chef" took the title.
This is the first time the "Late Night" host and former "SNL" newsman is hosting the Emmys, and no doubt some critics will have their knives out.
"I can't!
The Emmys will air Monday on NBC.
ET and airs from Los Angeles' Nokia Theatre.
