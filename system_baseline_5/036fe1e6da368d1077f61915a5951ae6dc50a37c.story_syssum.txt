(CNN)Peter Schipper presses a key on the enormous Wurlitzer organ console in front of him and a police siren wails across the cinema stage.
A Jewish immigrant originally from Poland, Tuschinski was killed along with his family in a Nazi concentration camp during the Second World War and his cinema renamed the Tivoli.
"When we first took her apart, she was in a very bad condition," said Dick Cuiper, a 55-year-old computer programmer who worked on a project to restore the organ with Schipper, a 67-year-old piano tuner, bookkeeper Pieter Kroon, 76, and other volunteers and technicians.
The organ is in immaculate order but, says Kroon, some of the machinery has been cobbled together from odds and ends.
The volunteers still spend hours every week maintaining the organ, but time is limited because the cinema hosts a full program of movie screenings.
Although the enthusiasm of Kroon and Schipper is as strong as ever, their advancing age means they need to find and train a new generation volunteers to keep the organ sounding its best.
It's a great privilege for all of us to play," says Kroon.
