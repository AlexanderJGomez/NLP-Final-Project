He's the author of "The Osama bin Laden I Know: An Oral History of al Qaeda's Leader."
What, then, of al Qaeda's enigmatic leader, Osama bin Laden, who has vanished like a wisp of smoke?
Does it even matter whether bin Laden is found?
Second, every day that bin Laden remains at liberty is a propaganda victory for al Qaeda.
Some reading this may think: But what's the proof that the al Qaeda leader is still alive?
Not one of the dozens of tapes released by bin Laden after 9/11 has been a fake.
The situation is further complicated by the fact that bin Laden and al-Zawahiri are almost certainly hiding out in the tribal areas of Pakistan, on the Afghan border.
However, it is clear from the videos of bin Laden and al-Zawahiri that aired in the years since the attacks that they are not living in caves.
But in the face of the intense Pakistani opposition to American boots on the ground, the Bush administration chose to rely instead on drones to target suspected al Qaeda and Taliban leaders.
The increased pace of the American drone attacks in Pakistani's tribal areas was motivated in part by the hope that it would increase panicked communications among the militants, which might help pinpoint the locations of the top leaders in al Qaeda or the Taliban, but that approach has not paid off when it comes to bin Laden.

Indeed, even among his fellow Egyptian militants, al-Zawahiri is seen as a divisive force, and so he is unlikely to be able to step into the role of leader of al Qaeda and of the world jihadist movement that is occupied by bin Laden.
