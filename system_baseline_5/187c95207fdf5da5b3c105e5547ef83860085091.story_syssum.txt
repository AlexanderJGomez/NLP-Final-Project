Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- Hundreds of people fled a pro-Alassane Ouattara neighborhood in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, where forces loyal to incumbent President Laurent Gbabgbo have been fighting an armed Ouattara supporters for the past week.
Ouattara is holed up in the Golf hotel in Abidjan under the protection of U.N. peacekeepers.
Earlier Friday, during a rally in Abidjan, Gbagbo's minister of youth, Ble Goude, called on young supporters of the incumbent "to organize committees to impede by any means the movements of U.N. forces around the country."
Army spokesman Col. Babri Gohourou said on national television that the police officer went to the U.N. camp to negotiate the release of three Gbagbo supporters who were arrested during a demonstration.
The political standoff in the country has raised fears of a renewal of the bloodshed suffered after a civil war broke out in 2002.
