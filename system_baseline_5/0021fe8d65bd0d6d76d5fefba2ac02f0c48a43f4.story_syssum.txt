Appearing Saturday morning on CNN's "New Day," Randy Zelin defended his client, Dr. Anthony Moschetto, who faces criminal solicitation, conspiracy, burglary, arson, criminal prescription sale and weapons charges in connection to what prosecutors called a plot to take out a rival doctor on Long Island.
And amazingly, his patients were flooding the office with calls, making sure that he was OK," Zelin said.
They pleaded not guilty in Nassau County District Court, according to authorities.
During the course of the undercover operation, however, Moschetto also sold the officers two semiautomatic assault weapons as well as ammunition, prosecutors said.
Kalamaras and Chmela are believed to have taken part in the arson, according to prosecutors.
