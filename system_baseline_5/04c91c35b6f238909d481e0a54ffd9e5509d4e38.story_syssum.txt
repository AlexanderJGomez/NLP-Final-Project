(CNN) -- Some years ago, I interviewed a pair of farmers selling pastured, hormone- and antibiotic-free turkeys for $4.75 a pound.
They were neither cuddly nor well-behaved.
I thought of those birds recently when College Board President and CEO David Coleman explained sweeping changes planned for the SAT exam.
And, the SAT word will be no more, Coleman said.
Coleman said he's done indulging tricks and flash cards that promise to beat his test, especially at the expense of deep, analytical reading and understanding.
But I wondered, if the SAT abandons these words, what will become of "treacly" and "mendacious"?
The SAT wasn't keeping them alive, he said, and flash cards weren't doing justice to many words, anyway.
"Under the guise of providing more user-friendly, fair tests, they're merely substituting one set of SAT words for another," Nunberg said.
Regardless, the test will never get much credit; if you memorize a word and use it often enough, he said, you're unlikely to be able to pinpoint that you learned it for the SAT.
"Everything is an SAT word to somebody," he said.
The SAT word is dead, long live the SAT word.
What do you think of the changes to the SAT?
