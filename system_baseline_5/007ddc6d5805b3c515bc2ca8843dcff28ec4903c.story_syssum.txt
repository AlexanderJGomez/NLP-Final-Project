The U.S. goal, she said, is "a deliberate, well thought-out campaign in Syria" to disrupt ISIS command and control, destroy the group's infrastructure and attack sources of fuel and financing for ISIS.
Five airstrikes targeting groups of ISIS fighters struck near Kobani overnight, U.S. Central Command said.
Airstrikes against the radical Islamist group in Kobani can be challenging because many targets are too close to the Turkish border or Kurdish forces to strike, a senior U.S. military official said.
Three people were killed and at least 36 injured in demonstrations throughout Turkey, police said, according to Anadolu.
CNN affiliate RTL Belgium said about 50 protesters stormed into the building.

If left unchecked this terrorist organization will grow and grow quickly."
