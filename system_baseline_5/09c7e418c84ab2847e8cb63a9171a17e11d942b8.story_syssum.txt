The health care law expands who is eligible for Medicaid and makes insurance available to people who wouldn't have qualified before because of pre-existing conditions.
Health centers will use these new federal grants to create bilingual education materials about changes in the law.
Federally qualified health centers "are the trusted resources not only of good care but of information in some of the neighborhoods that stand to benefit the most from the expansion of our health coverage," Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said.
"There is a lot of work to be done to let people know that they will qualify and to even help them understand at a basic level what health insurance is," Curran said.
Curran said her center will use the grant to train staff how to help people sign up for insurance.
It will also help the center hire an additional staffer who will do a kind of Obamacare education blitz.
"I know many men will forgo their own good health if it means they can have more money to feed their families," Lane said.
