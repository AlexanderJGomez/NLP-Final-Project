Shaheen woke Elle up and gave her orange juice to keep her from slipping into unconsciousness.
Elle was selected to try out an experimental device called an artificial or "bionic" pancreas.
Shaheen didn't have to set her alarm to wake up every three hours at night because the device was designed to catch a dangerously high or low blood sugar and treat it.
It was Elle who urged her mother to enroll her in an artificial pancreas study.
The Shaheens first heard about the artificial pancreas shortly after Elle was diagnosed with diabetes at age 8, but she had to be 12 years old to enroll.
I don't know what's wrong,'" Shaheen says.
For three days, the device did the work Elle's pancreas can no longer do.
Russell's research partner, Edward Diamano, an associate professor of biomedical engineering at Boston University, says the device learned Elle's blood sugar patterns and made changes accordingly.
"We're extraordinarily impatient for access to the device," Shaheen says.
"That was really hard," Elle says.
But "if not properly designed, use of an artificial pancreas device in an outpatient setting can place patients at significant risk."
"We're extraordinarily impatient for access to the device," she says.
