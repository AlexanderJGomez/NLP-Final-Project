Xiang first garnered attention for her sculptures of women.
The effect of Xiang's work is often disquieting, even though her figures are recognizable.
Xiang says her work is always a kind of ongoing philosophical inquiry.
More than gender politics, she is interested in human relationships.
One of the first artists to make an impression on her was Tian Shixin, a sculptor from Guizhou whose work Xiang first saw when she was at high school.
"I don't think art is like design, when one can have an inspiration here or an inspiration there."
Although her sculptures are strikingly lifelike, Xiang says she isn't aiming for realism.
"I want my art to awaken the sensibility of each onlooker, to awaken his body, so that his body can experience the sculpture.
And contemporary Chinese art has been born and developed within these last 30 years."
The ways for us to get to know the world have become more and more diverse.
However, I think there should be another part that should look inward ... into an inner world ... a world that exists within us.
