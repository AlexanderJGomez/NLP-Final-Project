(CNN) -- Prince Albert of Monaco will tie the knot to former South African Olympic swimmer Charlene Wittstock next July, the palace announced Thursday.
"There have been some relationships where, had they gone on a little bit more, they would have headed that way," Albert said.
Albert was formally invested as Monaco's ruler following the death of his father in 2005.
It sits on the French Riviera and is bordered on three sides by France.
