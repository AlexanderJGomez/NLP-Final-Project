Turkey has temporarily closed crossings to and from Syria along its border due to fighting between opposition groups inside Syria, the Turkish Commerce and Customs Ministry said Wednesday.
U.S. officials said he had left Syria.
The officials said U.S. authorities were considering expanding their contacts with moderate Islamists who are not affiliated with al Qaeda.
The U.S. government suspended its aid Wednesday amid the instability near the Turkish border, State Department officials said.
In the Bekaa in eastern Lebanon, where thousands of Syrian refugees were living in tents, emergency crews were distributing aid, it said in a statement.
The United Nations estimates that more than 100,000 people have died in the conflict.
