Crawford was shopping at Walmart and picked up a BB gun that wasn't packaged and had been sitting on the store shelf for two days, the Crawford family's lawyers said Monday.
Attorney Michael Wright said his legal team filed a federal civil lawsuit against two police officers; Beavercreek's police chief; the city of Beavercreek and its Police Department; and Walmart.
David M. Darkow and Officer Sean C. Williams, who is also "involved in the only other fatal police shooting in the history of the Beavercreek Police Department," according to the lawsuit.
In September, an Ohio grand jury decided not to indict the police officers.
The Justice Department is investigating the police shooting.
When the two officers located Crawford, "he was talking on a cell phone held in his right hand, with no other customers in his vicinity, and with his left side and back visible to the two police officers.
The family alleges, among other things, that the police officers did not use due diligence to determine that Wright wasn't a threat; that the officers didn't give him enough time to put down the weapon; and that Walmart was negligent because the air rifle had been resting on a shelf, unpackaged and unsecured, for at least two days, the family's lawyers said Tuesday.
Crawford was the father of a baby son, Jayden, born last March, the suit said.
