An early goal from Robinho had put Brazil in command, but in the second half the Dutch drew level when Wesley Sneijder's cross was deflected into his own net by Felipe Melo.
Melo found Robinho with a precise pass through a static Dutch defense and he made no mistake as he swept his shot past Maarten Stekelenburg in the 10th minute.
More poor defending allowed Sneijder to give the Dutch the lead and when Melo was deservedly shown red it was the end of the line for the South American champions.
Only a strong run and shot by Kaka which was deflected away offered them much hope and they might have fallen further behind to Dutch counter attacks.
