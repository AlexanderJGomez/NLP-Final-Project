Thomas Perez has climbed America's "ladder of opportunity" and now can help others do the same, President Barack Obama said on Monday in nominating the assistant U.S. attorney general as labor secretary.
The Labor Department, among other things, oversees analysis and reporting of unemployment statistics as well as occupational safety and other wage and employment issues.
In nominating Perez, Obama called on him to continue efforts by Solis and her team on helping returning war veterans get jobs, improving worker safety in coal mines and other steps to strengthen workers' rights.
"Mr. Perez has also had a controversial tenure at the Department of Justice where he has demonstrated a fundamentally political approach to the law."
Perez also became involved in a controversial 2008 voting rights case after it drew attention from Republican legislators and became the target of a Justice Department inspector general's report.
Though Perez had not yet been confirmed to oversee the civil rights division when the decision was made, he said in testimony to Inspector General Michael Horowitz in May 2010 that politics played no part in the decision.
Before rising to the Justice Department position, Perez led Maryland's Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation.
Perez also worked for the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, and spent the final two years of the Clinton administration as head of the Health and Human Services Department's civil rights office.
