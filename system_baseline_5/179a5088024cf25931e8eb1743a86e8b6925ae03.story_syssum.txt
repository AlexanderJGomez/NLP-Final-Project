Scandinavian Airlines grounded its fleet of Dash 8 Q400 planes after three crash landings in 2007.
Stressing that the cause of Thursday's crash in near Buffalo was still unclear and could be caused by mechanical failure for example, he said the potential for ice was there because it was short and the plane would have been flying at a relatively low level.
"All aircraft have de-icing system: a big jet like a 747 can cope with ice almost indefinitely, but smaller planes, especially propeller planes can experience problems," he said.
About two minutes later, the air traffic controller came back, with stress in his voice.

Air expert Daly said though that in Thursday's crash the landing gear of the Continental plane was unlikely to be down because it was far from the airport.
