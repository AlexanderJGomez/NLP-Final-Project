Barbie caused a stir when Mattel and Sports Illustrated revealed last week that she would appear in the 50th anniversary edition of its annual swimsuit edition, which hit stands Tuesday.
A post on "Mommyish" blog, "The Sport's Illustrated Swimsuit Issue Will Feature Barbie, So Your Daughter Can Feel Bad Too," underscored criticism of the partnership for using a children's toy to promote sexualized images intended for adults.
The 2014 swimsuit issues celebrates "legends," and Mattel said Barbie is a fitting example.
"When you look at the history of Barbie and how she's 'grown' in career choices I believe she's a positive example ... and quite frankly, a more positive image than the SI models," Utah grandmother Holly Albrecht said on Twitter.
"Children KNOW Barbie is a toy but the 'skinny' models tell society ... that a woman must be skinny to be accepted as beautiful; a far more negative example than Barbie," she said.
Barbie and the Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition have both been accused of promoting idealized beauty in their own ways.
"Barbie is the perfect model for the SI swimsuit issue.
Barbie is not a woman, she's an inanimate object.
After all, CEO Barbie and Dr. Barbie weren't the dolls appearing in SI.
