"It wasn't mom," Kondvar said.
Other than a pacemaker and a right hip replacement, Kondvar said, her mother was in good health and very active.
Kondvar said her family was told their mother's body had been taken to Emerald Funeral Home in St. Maarten, where the funeral director denied their request to see their mother and demanded a $7,000 wire-transfer-only fee to send the body back to the United States.
The body that arrived in a casket at the New Jersey funeral home on December 6 was not her mother, Kondvar said.
Now, Kondvar and her family want answers, and they want their mother back, she said.
Kondvar said she hasn't heard from the hospital or the funeral home since leaving St. Maarten.
Unruh said Reed has expedited a DNA test to determine whether the body that was sent to Canada is in fact Kondvar's mother.
"It's a nightmare," Unruh said.
As Porkka's family awaits the test results, Kondvar said she has a terrible, gut feeling the body in Canada is not her mother's.
Kondvar told CNN the St. Maarten government is performing an internal investigation into what went wrong.
Kondvar, a resident of Warwick, said she's not sure whether she will ever return to St. Maarten, although she has fond memories of the island and the residents from her family vacations.
