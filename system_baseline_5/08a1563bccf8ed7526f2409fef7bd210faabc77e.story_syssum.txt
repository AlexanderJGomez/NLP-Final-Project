(CNN)Private spaceflight company SpaceX scrubbed a scheduled rocket launch Tuesday, in which it planned to attempt the pioneering step of landing the rocket's first stage on a floating platform.
The second stage of the rocket delivers the payload -- in this case, supplies for the International Space Station -- to the desired orbit.
"A fully and rapidly reusable rocket -- which has never been done before -- is the pivotal breakthrough needed to substantially reduce the cost of space access," SpaceX said in a statement.
Landing on the platform "is significantly more challenging" than the water landings, the company said.
As for the target, "X" marks the spot: The company will try to land the rocket stage on the SpaceX logo painted on the center of the floating platform.
The timing of the next launch attempt will depend on how serious the problem is, he said.
