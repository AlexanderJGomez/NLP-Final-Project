Why?
(First, uterine cancer, and then kidney cancer.)
Stand Up to Cancer is a movement designed to get top researchers from the best medical centers focused on highly specialized projects aimed at bringing new treatments to people faster and making everyone diagnosed with cancer a survivor.
It's why for years now, I've "spontaneously" showed up at baseball games and other events to support cancer research and on the Friday after Labor Day, I put on one of those fancy T-shirts and stand up to cancer with my friends from film, TV, music and sports.
For all the issues and problems facing us all right now, this is one of the most pressing.
During Friday's broadcast, you will hear first-hand from patients bravely participating in clinical trials and scientists on the front lines of the war against the disease, and your favorite movie stars will share stories of real people, just like my mom, who went through hell and back because of cancer.
From the hopeless: "Cancer will never be cured.
To these people, I say, "Stand Up.
To those who think cancer is solely a byproduct of unhealthy living, I say healthy people get cancer, too.
So now is our time.
So that one day your grandkids or your great-grandkids will ask you, "What is cancer?"
