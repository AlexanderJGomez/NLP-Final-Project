However, mandating that home care workers be eligible for overtime pay will have the opposite effect.
Why?
When a caregiver has put in 40 hours during the week, employers usually switch to other workers who have not yet reached that limit, even if the first worker is available and wants to earn more money.
Let's say you need more than 40 hours of custodial home care every week.
Any increase in home care wage for caregivers means more money flowing out of the Social Security check or retirement savings of seniors.
For a professional caregiver who wants to work more than 40 hours a week at the regular rate (and many do), that option evaporates when overtime pay is required.
Paying home care workers more money would have clear social benefits, but if it comes at the cost of pricing vulnerable seniors out of the home care market or reducing the earning potential of caregivers, then we need to rethink our laws.
