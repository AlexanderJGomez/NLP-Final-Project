New York (CNN) -- The parents of a murder victim are suing Facebook after a paramedic pleaded guilty to photographing their daughter's corpse and posting the image to the social networking site, according to court documents.
The parents are also suing their daughter's convicted murderer, Calvin Lawson, paramedic Musarella, the city of New York and Greenleaf Arms Incorporated -- the company that owns the apartment building where Wimmer's body was found.
The image was discovered by an acquaintance of Musarella, who alerted Richmond University Medical Center, according to Batra.
The law would raise the offense to a Class E felony.
