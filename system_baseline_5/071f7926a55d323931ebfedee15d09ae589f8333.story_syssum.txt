(CNN) -- Things are looking horrible for President Barack Obama.
What will happen next: Will our hero prevail like John McClane in "Die Hard," or will he fail like William Wallace in "Braveheart"?
Simply put: Obama is not the protagonist driving his own story.
Perhaps the worst thing about the problems with the Obamacare website is that they occurred at a time when things were finally looking politically brighter for Obama.
Is this Obama's metaphoric fate?
First, Obama should announce that retaking control of the House in 2014 is a top priority.
Unseating some tea party House members has become newly possible after the shutdown mess.
Sure, the Republicans will push back -- they will say Obama is behaving like a "king" or "tyrant" and complain about him nightly on Fox News.
Obama is the star of this movie.
The only question is: How is it going to end?
