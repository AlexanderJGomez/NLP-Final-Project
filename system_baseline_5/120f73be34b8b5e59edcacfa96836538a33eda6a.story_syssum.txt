BAE said Thursday it is working with American Airlines to put laser systems on the planes, which will be flying between New York and California.
DHS, American Airlines and BAE Systems were all careful to assure there will be no test firing -- through simulators or otherwise.
Taliban forces, however, successfully used MANPADS against Soviet helicopters in Afghanistan.
The airline believes protection is best accomplished by preventing terrorists from getting shoulder-fired missiles, or by using ground-based systems, spokesman John Hotard said.
Last year, American and BAE installed and test flew BAE's hardware on a Boeing 767 that was not in commercial service, Hotard said.
