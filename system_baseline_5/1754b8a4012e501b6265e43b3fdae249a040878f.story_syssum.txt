LONDON, England (CNN) -- British union leaders will recommend Thursday ending an unofficial strike that has dragged on more than a week at the country's third-largest oil refinery, the arbitrator in the dispute announced Wednesday.
"If you can't be happy with that, you can't be happy with anything," a local union official said at a demonstration televised by Britain's Sky News.
Union leaders accuse Total of discriminating against British workers by subcontracting with IREM, which has hired workers from Italy and Portugal.
Overall, the construction project has employed, directly or indirectly, 600 to 1,000 workers for about 18 months, Total said.
Hundreds of workers at British power plants and refineries have been walking off the job in unofficial "wildcat" strikes since the Lindsey workers put down their tools last Wednesday.
Union leaders say the strike there is only a reflection of problems with the way Britain implements European Union employment directives.
The problem is that employers are excluding UK workers from even applying for work on these contracts," Unite General Secretary Derek Simpson said Tuesday.
Brown retorted in the House of Commons.
