Global climate change treaty, scheduled for completion in December, is designed to protect tropical forests.
Known as Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation in developing countries, or REDD, the provision is based on the knowledge that destroying tropical forests contributes to global warming.
Polluters in the developing world would be able to offset their emissions by buying credits for stored forest carbon dioxide.
For the first time, tropical forests would be worth money for simply existing.
The system would let nations and industries that are the biggest greenhouse-gas emitters buy carbon credits in tropical forests in South and Central America, Africa, Southeast Asia and other equatorial regions.
However, both funds are not fully capitalized, pending the successful conclusion of negotiations on the new global climate change treaty.
Now, they say, conserving forests also can contribute to sustainable development, benefiting both nature and people.
The Kyoto treaty created a global carbon market -- but only the carbon storage of newly planted or replanted forests is eligible for credits.
In response, conservationists and developing nations warn against leaving out nations and regions -- including Jagdeo's Guyana, parts of Indonesia and Brazil, Democratic Republic of Congo and others -- that still have much of their tropical forest intact.
Jagdeo, the president of Guyana, has said such critics should recognize the opportunity that a new climate change treaty could present.
The deforestation provision of a climate change treaty could help stem deforestation while providing "badly needed capital flows to some of the poorest countries in the world," he said.
"They will see that this is now real and it's the time to react."
