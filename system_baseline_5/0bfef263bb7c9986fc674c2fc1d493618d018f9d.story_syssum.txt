Will it be the oddly named Wii U, Nintendo's attempt to update its aging Wii console for a new wave of gamers?
"I think we may be seeing the last generation of dedicated handheld gaming systems with the PS Vita and Nintendo 3DS," said Blair Herter, co-host G4TV's "X-Play."
Most companies at E3 will be showing off what their existing hardware can do or emphasizing new video game titles.
Nintendo is the only one of the Big Three console makers -- a trio that includes Microsoft and Sony -- that will be demonstrating a new gaming system this year -- the Wii U.
At last year's E3, Nintendo showed a Wii U video demo featuring gameplay from Xbox 360 and PlayStation games.
At E3, both Sony and Microsoft will be focusing on new software for their current systems.
Microsoft will concentrate its E3 efforts on development for the popular Kinect motion controller and additional games for the venerable Xbox 360.
Microsoft also may announce new partnerships with TV broadcasters and programs in an effort to further transform the gaming console into a home entertainment center.
While "Halo 4" is one of the biggest titles at E3, it is far from the only hotly anticipated game.
But the game's release was pushed back to February 2013, and creative director Ken Levine said the next time people will see the game is when it's ready to go in the box for delivery.
Despite persistent rumors, Valve Software has said it doesn't expect to reveal any new hardware -- or popular games such as "Half-Life 3" or "Portal 3" -- next week.
Gamers, what are you hoping to see at E3?
