In an eerily similar incident in May 2004, former Springbok rugby player Rudi Visagie was awoken by his wife, who heard a car in their driveway in Nelspruit, South Africa.
"I heard Rudi growling," his wife, Frieda Visagie, said.
"It happened that one shot out of a million ... went right through the door and penetrated my daughter through the neck," Visagie said.
Visagie was a household name and had represented South Africa in a series of international rugby games.
The track star has said he thought an intruder was hiding in a toilet room inside the bathroom of his Pretoria home.
You can't take it back ... you can't take that bullet back."
The former rugby player said he sympathizes with the sprinter.
And should he need to talk, Visagie said, he is ready to help.
