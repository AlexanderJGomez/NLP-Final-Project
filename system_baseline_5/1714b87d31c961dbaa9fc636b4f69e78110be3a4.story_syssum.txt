Ekwa said Obama was lifting 25-pound free weights.
He said when he first saw the roughly 10 agents at the gym, he didn't think he would be allowed in.
But said he was glad Obama decided to hit the gym while abroad.
The candid video might have caught Obama off guard, but likely not unaware, former White House videographer Arun Chaudhary said.
"I think it's unusual for us to see the President working out in a gym, but as a security level it's not different than him getting pancakes at a diner in Iowa," he said.
"This is not him strangling a tiger on top of a horse while he's shirtless," Chaudhary said of Obama.
