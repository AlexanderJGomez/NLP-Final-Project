Did you benefit from a crime?
Former congressman Barney Frank writes that he wishes that Muslims would "speak out more strongly."
Moreover, it is Muslims themselves who stand to lose the most when crimes are committed by these vigilantes.
If the goal of our detractors were really to get Muslims to do more "speaking out," then what Muslims have already done would have been enough years ago.
In the case of the Charlie Hebdo massacre, Muslims were asked not only to condemn murder (which they did) but also to champion a "free speech" that took the form of denigrating their sacred beliefs (which they deplored).
It is worth remembering that the perpetrators of crimes such as the Charlie Hebdo massacre are always screaming "Revenge!"
Perhaps it is more comfortable to keep the conversation focused on Muslims and their religion than it is to investigate whether one's own country or one's own group has anything it might have to "condemn."
