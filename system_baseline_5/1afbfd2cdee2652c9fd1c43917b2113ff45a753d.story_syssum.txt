Republicans and Democrats have urgently pressed President Barack Obama to do something to stem the flow of child immigrants crossing the southern border -- and fast.
With the door closed to any action on immigration reform this year with midterm campaigning in full swing, Congress and Obama now face a crisis around that issue, which Republicans do not want to touch as it's politically charged and complex.
Obama on Wednesday called the flow of "unaccompanied children" an "incredibly dangerous" situation, and said his proposal offers Congress "the capacity to vote immediately" on a solution if it wants to address the problem swiftly.
"What disappoints me so much is he's asking for a blank check," Texas Sen. John Cornyn said.
While Democrats indicate they support Obama's request, they want more details before signing off.
Democrats want to maintain the status of current law giving youth the right to make their case in an immigration proceeding.
While the White House says it will ask Congress to give the Homeland Security Department more discretion to send such immigrants home, it's unclear if Obama will request changes to the anti-trafficking law.
I trust this president but I want to verify," Durbin said.
