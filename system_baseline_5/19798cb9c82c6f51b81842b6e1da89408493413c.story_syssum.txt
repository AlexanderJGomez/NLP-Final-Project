(CNN)  -- Former U.S. President Bill Clinton landed in North Korea early Tuesday on a mission to negotiate the release of two American journalists imprisoned there since March, according to the country's state news agency and a CNN source.
This change in language is an important distinction that could move North Korea to release the women without feeling that its legal system has been slighted, according to analyst Mike Chinoy.
Will Clinton be carrying a letter from Barack Obama for the North Korean leader Kim Jong Il?
Clinton had considered visiting North Korea in 2000 near the end of his second term as president.
