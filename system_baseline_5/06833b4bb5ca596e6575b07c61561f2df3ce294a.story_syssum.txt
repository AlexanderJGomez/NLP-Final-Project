And that deadline is suddenly very relevant because of the availability of lethal 3-D printable guns that contain virtually no metal, law enforcement authorities say.
One gun made using a plastic called ABS-M30, commonly used in toys and luggage, fired a .380-caliber round without failing all eight times it was tested at an ATF lab in Martinsburg, West Virginia, ATF officials said.
Another pistol made from a plastic called Visijet didn't perform as well in ATF tests.
Many popular models made with plastic parts still must use a certain amount of metal to abide by the detectability law.
This is an extremely serious threat to law enforcement, to people who fly every day," Holder said in remarks in St. Louis on Thursday.
He said it's unfathomable that there's not enough support to extend the law.
