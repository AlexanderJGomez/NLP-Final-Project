The visitors had threatened to become the first team to win at the Santiago Bernabeu this season, leading 2-1 after 18 minutes, but Ronaldo completed his treble to put Real ahead and then set up a clinching goal by substitute Kaka to keep his side two points behind leaders Barcelona.
I felt such raw emotion from the crowd."
Ronaldo has now scored 22 goals in 18 La Liga games this season, and 31 overall.
But Real struggled to find a winner until Kaka came on for his first home appearance this season with 20 minutes to play, having returned as a substitute in the meaningless midweek Spanish Cup second-leg defeat at Levante.
There was no doubt about the fourth goal on 82 minutes, as Ronaldo slipped a clever pass into the box and Kaka poked the ball past Lopez.
Espanyol are a point back in fifth after thrashing bottom club Real Zaragoza 4-0 at home, while Mallorca joined sixth-placed Atletico and Getafe on 27 points with a 4-1 win over relegation-threatened Almeria.
