"Eduardo Ravelo rose to power within the Barrio Aztecas criminal enterprise because of his connections with the Juarez cartel and also [because] he's a ruthless killer and will basically carry out what the Juarez cartel wants him to do," Mikeska said.
U.S. authorities say the commanders of the Juarez cartel often call on Ravelo to execute their enemies.
FBI investigators say they believe that in March 2008, Ravelo carried out a hit on a captain in his own gang.
While he may be staying out of sight, he's keeping up his violent work, Mikeska says, and he has the resources to do so.
