Tommy Cavazos, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, said that 18 people were injured in the Americanos tour bus crash on Interstate 37, about 50 miles south of San Antonio in southern Texas.
Although it was not immediately clear whether others were taken elsewhere, Wiley said that University Health System and Brooke Army Medical Center are the two trauma centers in San Antonio and would receive patients in situations such as Tuesday's crash.
Maureen Richmond, a spokeswoman for Greyhound, said that 40 people were on board the bus, which left San Antonio shortly before 9 a.m. for Matamoros, Mexico.
