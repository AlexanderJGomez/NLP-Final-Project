New Delhi (CNN) -- India is in the fast lane.
"The world's perception of India is going to change after the Grand Prix and people will forget what happened because of the Commonwealth Games," said Jaiprakash Gaur, founding chairman of Jaypee Group that built the Buddh International Circuit.
However, not everyone is as excited about the event when so many Indians live in abject poverty.
"The contrast between the rich and the poor is very large in India," said Arun Kumar, a professor at the Center of Economic Studies and Planning at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.
With organizers struggling to sell out the event, ticket prices for Sunday's race have already been slashed.
In cricket-crazy India, some also accept that motorsport, though exciting, is too new to them.
I'm talking of the masses, not just the elite."
