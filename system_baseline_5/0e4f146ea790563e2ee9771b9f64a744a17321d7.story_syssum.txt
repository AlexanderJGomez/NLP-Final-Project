Tom Waits in Paris on the European leg of his tour.
Waits' position on the periphery of pop music (he admits that the 60s scene largely passed him by), may be because he belongs to a bigger historical tradition -- that of the singer-storyteller that has its origin in folk music.
Waits' place in the folk tradition is something he has acknowledged, consciously or otherwise, in his music.
The results of this labor are songs like "Frank's Wild Years," a hilarious and sinister tale of a man -- Frank -- trapped in suburbia with a wife and pet dog that has a skin disease.
"Bukowski had a story that essentially was saying that it's the little things that drive men mad," Waits said.
Waits took to the stage dressed in a Chaplinesque suit, delivering his set from a slightly raised platform that gave up a cloud of dust each time he bashed his feet into it.
Lopsided or not, it's an authentic voice we could surely do with hearing more from.
