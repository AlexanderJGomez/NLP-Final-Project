(CNN)Britain's Prince Harry is preparing for a new chapter in his life.
"Captain Harry Wales," as he is known, from his official title and name of His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales, began his formal military duties in 2005 at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.
Work with wounded soldiers will prepare the prince for the position he will take up in August.
Prince Harry will still have royal duties to attend to while he is finishing his military service.
And he will undertake an official Royal tour of New Zealand in May, after his service with the Australian Defence Force is complete.
The next steps would be staff college and desk jobs and that's not for him.
