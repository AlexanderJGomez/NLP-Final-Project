Last college football season, everybody was talking about Johnny Manziel.
But now, after another scandal in an offseason that has been too eventful,  Manziel and fans alike may have been better off with the Private Johnny Football.
June 29, 2012: Manziel is arrested in College Station, Texas, after a bar fight.
November 11, 2012: Manziel leads Texas A&M to the biggest upset of the college football season, beating Alabama 29-24.
January 4: Johnny Football ends his season with a 41-13 pounding of Oklahoma in the Cotton Bowl.
January 16: Oklahoma head coach Bob Stoops says of Manziel, "If they can keep him out of jail or keep him eligible, he's gonna be pretty good."
March 7: Manziel tweets, "Spring Break!
June 16: He tweets "Bulls--- like tonight is a reason why I can't wait to leave college station...whenever it may be."
The quarterback was then sent home, reportedly by Archie Manning, igniting new questions about his maturity and ability to handle the spotlight.
July 15: Two days later, Manziel pleads guilty to possessing a fake driver's license and was fined $2,000 in that 2012 bar fight case.
