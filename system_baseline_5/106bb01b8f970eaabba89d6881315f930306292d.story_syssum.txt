"Everybody in life has something that they get knocked down on," Barry told CNN.
Last year alone in Washington, House members Chris Lee, David Wu and Anthony Weiner all left office amid scandal.
Barry added that scandal can make a politician resilient and better suited for the rough and tumble of public life.
But to most Washington political experts, Barry has added to that distrust.
Plotkin has known Barry for decades and said his best asset is his ability to calculate who votes and how to play to that group.
Earlier this year, a public relations consultant pleaded guilty to helping orchestrate a secret campaign on Gray's behalf, prompting three of Gray's former colleagues on the Washington council to call for his resignation.
To this day -- after the 1990 drug conviction, a six-month jail sentence, and a 2005 guilty plea to misdemeanor tax charges -- Barry denies that he ever had a political scandal.
"Million of Americans don't file their taxes," Barry said.
