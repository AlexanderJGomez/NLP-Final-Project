The House of Lords, Britain's highest court, ruled in her favor on Thursday, ordering the country's director of public prosecutions to spell out the criteria under which it will seek to prosecute someone who helps another person commit suicide.
Purdy had been suing to force the British authorities to specify exactly when someone would be prosecuted for helping another person commit suicide.
When is assisted suicide acceptable?
Purdy had spent more than two years fighting the case through Britain's courts, arguing that the lack of clarity in the law violated her human rights.
Purdy has said she wants to die next to her husband.
British and European courts refused to guarantee that the husband of Diane Pretty would not be prosecuted for helping her to travel abroad to end her life.
