Jeanne, Amy, Desiree and Nikki were all born into the Tony Alamo Christian Ministry, which, some say, is a cult.

Alamo reportedly put his wife's dead body in his dining room, and former church members say he made men, women and children pray over her corpse for almost two years.
Over time, Alamo began to exert more control over members of the Tony Alamo Christian Ministry.

Nikki says Alamo decided everything, from who could get a driver's license to whom a member could marry.

Finally, she spotted a house across a field and hurried to the front door.
But Alamo's church, which is still in business, sent a message.
"Tony Alamo has no secret world or child brides.
