(CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is not in a coma and is continuing to make strides in his recovery, his brother said.
Last week, a government spokesman said Chavez was battling a severe lung infection that has caused respiratory failure.
Before he left for Cuba for surgery, Chavez said he wanted Maduro to assume the presidency if he becomes incapacitated and called on voters to support him at the polls.
