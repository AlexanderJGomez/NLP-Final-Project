The U.N. Security Council votes for a resolution imposing sanctions against North Korea on Friday.
The Security Council's five permanent members had already passed a draft resolution Wednesday that condemned North Korea's nuclear test "in the strongest terms."
That resolution provided a "strong, very credible, very appropriate response to the provocative nuclear test that North Korea launched and its subsequent activities," Susan E. Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told reporters at the time.
If a ship refuses, it is to proceed to the closest port for a mandatory inspection.
The Taepodong-2 is a long-range missile North Korea tested in April.
Washington officials have said the United States' goal is for North Korea to return to nuclear negotiations with the United States, China, South Korea, Japan and Russia, known as the six-party talks.
