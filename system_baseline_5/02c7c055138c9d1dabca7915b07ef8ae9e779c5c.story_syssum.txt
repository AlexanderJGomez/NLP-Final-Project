Isa Saharkhiz and his son Mehdi haven't seen each other in nearly a decade.
Since 2009, the younger Saharkhiz has led a one-man digital campaign from his home in New Jersey aimed at liberating his father.
Iranian security forces first arrested Isa Saharkhiz, 59, during the summer of 2009.
Iranian authorities justified the 2009 crackdown by frequently accusing opposition leaders of being part of a foreign conspiracy aimed at overthrowing the government.
"In January, in the winter, they sent me on the roof of the jail for two hours when the weather was very cold," Saharkhiz said.
Like others in the reformist movement that emerged from within the ranks of the government of the Islamic Republic, Saharkhiz angered many, including the Supreme Leader," said Behzad Yaghmaian, an Iranian-American academic and author of "Social Change in Iran."
As the elder Saharkhiz languished in prison in 2009, his son Mehdi became an opposition activist from the relative safety of exile in New Jersey.
Four years after his arrest, the elder Saharkhiz said there was no formal reason given for his release.
It was the first direct contact between American and Iranian presidents in more than 30 years.
Removal of American embargoes would also help ordinary Iranians who could no longer afford life-saving foreign phamaceuticals, he said.
"Maybe in a few years I will be able to go back, but it's a really big risk," he said.
"I will support freedom in Iran, and maybe criticize the leadership in Iran," he said.
"It will be a very emotional time," Isa Saharkhiz said.
