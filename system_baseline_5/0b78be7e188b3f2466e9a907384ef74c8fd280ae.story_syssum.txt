Convicted Singaporean match-fixer Wilson Raj Perumal is categorically denying a story published by German weekly Der Spiegel alleging that the Cameroon team was involved in fixing a World Cup game in Brazil.
"We firmly stand by our assertion that Mr. Perumal wrote in a Facebook chat with Der Spiegel some hours before the World Cup match Croatia vs. Cameroon, that the result of the match will be a 4-0 victory for Croatia and that a player of Cameroon will get a red card in the first half," Buschmann said.
Now living in Hungary, Perumal recently published a book -- "Kelong Kings" -- about his involvement in illegal match fixing, which was written in conjunction with investigative journalists Alessandro Righi and Emanuele Piano.
"I am now back in Hungary where I have testified against my former associates in a local match-fixing trial," said Perumal.
