"My teeth grate, my hackles rise, and even my dog is getting annoyed at this senseless overuse.
So please, assign 'man cave' to the lexicographic scrap heap where it so rightly belongs."

Lake Superior State University's annual "word banishment" list was first created at a New Year's Eve party in 1975.
