It is.
Why is that?"
Since Zappos' announced this move, people have wondered whether holacracy is just another fad or something to be taken seriously.
The title you have probably doesn't reflect what you do, unless you own the company.
If any of these problems sound familiar, then you and Hsieh (and many of us in the leadership world) are on the same page, so far at least.
Holacracy was pioneered by Brian Robertson and outlined in his upcoming book, "Holacracy: Evolution for Organizations."
To date, Zappos is by far the largest adopter of holacracy.
So, will it work at Zappos?
If this description isn't your company, then holacracy will not be a great fit.
The real story here is that there are many new organizational forms out there, holacracy being one.
Holacracy may just surprise us.
