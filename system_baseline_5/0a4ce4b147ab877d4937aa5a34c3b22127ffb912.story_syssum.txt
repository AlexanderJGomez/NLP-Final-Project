The first claim of responsibility for the bombing in the Afghan capital has come from a militant Sunni group in Pakistan with a history of sectarian attacks against Shia.
A man identifying himself as a spokesman for Lashkar-e-Janghvi al Almi, a group with links to al Qaeda and the Pakistan Taliban, claimed responsibility for the attack in a call to Radio Mashaal, a Pashto-language station in Pakistan sponsored by the United States government.
The Hazara are numerous in both Pakistan and Afghanistan, and make up much of Afghanistan's Shia minority.
In October, Sunni militants killed dozens more Hazara.
But other Sunni militants -- especially factions among the Pakistani Taliban -- have established a presence in some Afghan border provinces.
The Taliban are not a monolith, as one Afghan observer puts it, and it is possible that at local level there may have been collaboration between a Taliban operative and LeJ.
And after capturing Mazar e Sharif in 1998, Taliban fighters killed hundreds of Hazara in retaliation for the mass execution of its own soldiers the previous year.
Kate Clark of the Afghan Analysts Network believes that in Afghanistan restraint will prevail.
