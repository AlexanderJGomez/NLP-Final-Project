(CNN)A St. Louis man has filed a lawsuit alleging excessive force in a case that involves an officer turning off a dashcam that was recording the man's arrest.

The video then shows officers kicking Bufford while he is on the ground.
An attorney representing the city and the police department defended the officers' actions in the arrest, while condemning the officer who turned off the dashcam, which is against department policy.

"I don't think an officer on the scene should have the capability to stop the camera from rolling.
