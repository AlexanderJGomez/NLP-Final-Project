Clearwater, Florida (CNN) -- After another marathon session of questioning about everything from their news-watching habits to criminal records, the Florida jury that could decide Casey Anthony's fate started rounding into shape Friday.
Jury selection was moved from Orlando to Clearwater amid concerns that the intense media attention surrounding the case could make it difficult to select an impartial jury in Orange County.
Once there are 12 jurors, Perry will ask the defense and prosecution teams if they want to use their preemptory challenges -- allowing them, at the judge's discretion, to disqualify certain men or women from the jury pool.
Casey Anthony made allegations of sex abuse against her father and brother in a letter from jail last year.
Friday's questioning also delved into the prospective jurors' knowledge of the Anthony case, including what and from where they had heard about it.
Casey Anthony has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
