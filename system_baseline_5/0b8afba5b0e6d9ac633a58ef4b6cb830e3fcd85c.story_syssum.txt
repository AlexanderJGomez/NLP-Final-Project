Global capitalism is a juggernaut, with the world economy now doubling in size every generation.
Unleash greed, the theory goes, and type-A personalities around the world will spend inordinate energy to organize businesses, invent new products, and thereby raise well-being.
And greed rules the moral order at the top of raw capitalism.
Sustainable development is a doctrine that says: Let us once again place the economy on a true moral foundation and we'll keep greed within bounds, ensuring the economic growth is combined with social fairness and environmental sustainability.
Thus, sustainable development calls for a holistic approach that combines economic, social, and environmental objectives.
Just look at the recent news.
In my new book, The Age of Sustainable Development, IÂ¹ve not only analyzed the trends of growing inequality and rising environmental destruction, but have also shown how the concepts of sustainable development can be used to chart a way out of our growing crisis.
If the world takes the time to do its homework and plan for the future, the world can bring the climate crisis under control and still enjoy a growing supply of quality energy services.
That is why governments around the world will adopt Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) this year, on the 70th anniversary of the United Nations.
