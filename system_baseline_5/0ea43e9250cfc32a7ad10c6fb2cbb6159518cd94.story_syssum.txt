(CNN) -- Five more states reported widespread flu activity during the second week of January, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, bringing the total to 40 states.
The CDC does not have data on the number of adult flu deaths.
"As typical of a flu season, some areas are being harder hit than other areas," said CDC spokesman Tom Skinner.
He said that a year ago, only five deaths had been reported at this time; there were only 106 flu deaths during the entire 2012-2013 flu season.
Adult flu deaths are not required to be reported to the CDC, but the government agency must be notified of any flu deaths in children.
"People who are young and healthy should be aware that they may get the flu and it could be serious," Rehm said.
In addition to getting the vaccine, which can prevent flu -- or at least lessen symptoms, washing your hands frequently and staying home when you're sick can help you get through the flu season.
