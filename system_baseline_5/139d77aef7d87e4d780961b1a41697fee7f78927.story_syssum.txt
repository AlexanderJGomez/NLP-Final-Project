In response to a report that his health was failing and that he had been rushed to the hospital, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said Thursday that he had the best proof that his recovery from chemotherapy is advancing fine.
The report said doctors were considering moving the president to a private hospital where he could be better attended.
"I'm going to start practicing baseball or softball, both things," he said.
"I am my own answer," he said.
"It's normal now, but it could be lower," he said.
"The body was protecting itself," he said.
I used to box."
Morbid.
Chavez said he considers Penn a friend, and after the two spoke about the hikers, he agreed to add his voice directly with the Iranian president.
Last week, a representative for Penn confirmed a report that Penn had flown to Venezuela months ago to speak about the hikers' plight with Chavez.
