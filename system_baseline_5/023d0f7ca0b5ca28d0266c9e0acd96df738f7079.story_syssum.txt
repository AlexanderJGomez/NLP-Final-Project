Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia are at the center of an Ebola outbreak that has already killed more than 800 people.
The 40-year-old man has symptoms of a viral hemorrhagic fever, the Saudi Health Ministry said Tuesday.
A Nigerian doctor has been diagnosed with Ebola nearly three weeks after a Liberian-American man with Ebola died after traveling to Lagos, Nigerian officials said Monday.
Meanwhile, the World Health Organization reports an outbreak of the virus in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria is believed to have infected 1,603 people and killed more than 887 this year, as of Friday.
It helped create an isolation unit at Emory University Hospital, which is being used to treat American doctor Kent Brantly, who contracted Ebola in Liberia and was evacuated to the facility in Atlanta over the weekend.
Ebola spreads through contact with organs and bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, urine and other secretions of infected people.
It has no cure.
On Tuesday, Liberia responded to British Airways' decision to suspend service to Monrovia because of the outbreak.
