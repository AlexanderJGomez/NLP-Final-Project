Most of our creditors get little or nothing back.
Countries get new tax payers every day.
But let's be clear, the U.S. was not going to default.
So, the USA cannot really default, thanks in part to a strong Federal Reserve and international creditors still wanting to buy its bonds, no matter how low the interest rate falls.
In Russia's case, it was able to pay back creditors within a few years, thanks to the rise of energy prices.
They want their money back.
After all, it means a country can get a handle on its obligations.
New creditors stepped in, instead of walking away.
Look at Cyprus.
If not, that would be a default.
