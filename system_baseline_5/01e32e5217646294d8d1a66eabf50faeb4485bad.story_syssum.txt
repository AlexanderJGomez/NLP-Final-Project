"This is the only intact eye (of a colossal squid) that's ever been found.
It's spectacular," squid specialist Kat Bolstad of the Auckland University of Technology told The Associated Press on Wednesday.
He led a team that examined the corps of the colossal squid on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in a lab at Wellington's Te Papa.
The larger colossal squid that scientists examined this week weighed 1,091 pounds (495 kilograms) and measured about 32 feet (10 meters), the museum said.
When they measured the colossal squid's beak, O'Shea said, they were stunned to discover that it was shorter than colossal-squid beaks recovered from the stomachs of sperm whales, which prey on squid.
