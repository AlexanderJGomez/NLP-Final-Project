As families prepare for air travel this coming Memorial Day weekend, United Airlines won't be offering early boarding to families in coach with small children.
"There are very few things a parent can count on when it comes to air travel these days, but one of those things was always the ability to board first to get your children settled in and all of their needs met before the throngs of people board the plane," said Hanni in an e-mail to CNN.
"We transitioned to a common boarding process across all aircraft," Hobart said.
As a policy, American Airlines also does not specifically allow families with children to get on aircraft before general boarding.
"We're always looking for ways to make the boarding process a little more efficient and quicker for our passengers," said spokeswoman Liz Landau.
