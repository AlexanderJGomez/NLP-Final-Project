At the same time, contradictory statements made in Tehran make it clear that the Iranian authorities are divided about the implications of the American military's return to Iraq.
At first, there was nothing but silence in Tehran as U.S. F-18s on Friday began to target ISIS militants.
This was the first time since the U.S .airstrikes began that a senior Iranian official has spoken in such terms.
And given his stature inside the Iranian system his words must be seen as a peek into the internal policy debate in Tehran about the situation in Iraq and Iran's options.
They are also in agreement that Iraq above all needs a new political leadership and that Prime Minister Maliki has to go.
Tehran desperately wants to keep Iraq intact as a nation state.
If true, this goes to show the depth of Iranian anxieties about the "Islamic State's" rise in Iraq.
The moderates like to focus on the practical challenge at hand in Iraq and ways that Tehran and Washington can collaborate.
But all the recent trends suggest that the moderate viewpoint in Tehran has the upper hand on the policy question of Iraq and how Iran can best serve its interests.
