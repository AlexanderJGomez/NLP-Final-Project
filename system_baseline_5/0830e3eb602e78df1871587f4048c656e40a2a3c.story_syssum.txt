When buying beef, we tend to stick to what we know, which may be why almost 60 percent of our beef dollars go for ground beef.
Columbus first brought cattle to the New World, and by 1690, descendants of Columbus' cattle ranging in Mexico were driven north and became known as Texas Longhorns.
More than 90 percent of the beef we buy originates in America, while most of the rest is Canadian bred.
• Grain-finished: Nearly 75 percent of U.S. beef comes from cattle fattened on grain (usually corn) for three to six months in feedlots.
Grass-fed beef has a distinct flavor, often described as bold, complex, and gamy.
About 90 percent of American beef is sold as large vacuum-packed cuts.
• Processing and packaging: Until the 1960s butcher shops bought beef as half- or quarter-carcasses.
• Fat content: The USDA defines "lean beef" as having less than 10 grams (g) of total fat, 4.5g or less of saturated fat, and less than 95 milligrams of cholesterol per 3½-ounce serving (100g) of cooked beef.
Because lean beef contains less fat, it's best cooked to medium-rare (145°F) or medium (160°F) to optimize tenderness.
• Inspection and grading: USDA inspectors examine all live animals and beef shipped out of state, which encompasses most of today's supermarket beef.
Three grades of beef are sold to consumers.
• Natural and Organic: Beef labeled "natural" must not contain any artificial ingredients and cannot be more than minimally processed, such as ground beef.
• Buy lean cuts.
And when the fat cooks away, lean cuts provide more meat for your dollar.
