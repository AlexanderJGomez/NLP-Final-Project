But the cartoon plumber character, who turns 25 this year, isn't the only one who will be honored by residents of Arcosur, which is still under construction.
Video games won out over more traditional options in an online poll that residents used to pick their street names, said Antonio Almudi Miranda, president of the Arcosur neighborhood association.
Super Mario's street is nearly a kilometer long and will have hundreds of homes on it, Almudi said -- and his will be one of them.
Residents are proud to have Super Mario represented in the neighborhood, he said, and grateful that their street signs will not feature names of war heroes or violent characters.
Once it's constructed, more than 60,000 people are expected to live in the neighborhood, Almudi said.
