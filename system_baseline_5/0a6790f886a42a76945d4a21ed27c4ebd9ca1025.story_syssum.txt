(CNN) -- When it comes to deciding where the money goes, the Lotus Formula One team says its main priority is the car -- not the star driver who sits in the cockpit.
And Genii had the plan to do the same this year.
"It is part of the strategy that partners join the team and Genii will get back their investment.
He says the team plans to emulate the business strategy of some of rivals, including Red Bull and McLaren, by looking for a title sponsor.
"It is no secret that for quite a while Genii have been looking for partners to make sure that we can bring more money to the team and have access to a bigger sponsor portfolio," the Frenchman added.
