NASCAR driver Carl Edwards grew up in Columbia, Missouri.
"So I moved back, and now I live here and I'm really proud to live here."
"This park is one of Columbia's best secrets.
The park boasts 15 miles of trails and endless possibilities for adventure, from hiking and biking to canoeing and even cave exploration.
Edwards says it's one of the oldest in the state and thinks that it is one of the coolest spots along the trail.
We'd shoot pool, eat booch burgers and just have a good time," he said.
These are just some of the hidden gems of Carl Edwards' Columbia, but this town has much more to offer.
It's a perfect weekend getaway from its larger surrounding cities.
