Until recently Woodside and about 100 hundred other divers searched Puget Sound for sea cucumbers and urchins to sell to buyers in Asia, where the items are considered delicacies.
But thanks to a small piece of the federal stimulus recovery plan, Monk, Woodside and about 40 other fishermen will get back to work hauling in a very different catch: lost fishing nets.
The only reason the nets have remained underwater for so long, said Ginny Broadhurst, director of the Northwest Marine Conservation Initiative, is because the damage they are doing to the environment is invisible from the surface.
But pulling those nets is no easy task.
The nets are then pulled to the boat waiting on the surface.
In just a few hours on the water, the divers can pull free about 1,000 pounds of nets.
But biologist June said the group is working on a plan that would have the nets burned, creating energy from lost fishing nets.
But, the boat captain said, recovering the fishing nets has greater meaning than just riding out a rough economy.
