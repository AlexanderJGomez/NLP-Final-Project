Displayed are 112,225 gifts for Kim Il Sung, his son Kim Jong Il and current leader Kim Jong Un from 184 different countries.
I am told the Eternal President still receives many posthumous gifts.
Former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright gave Kim Jong Il a silver dish when she visited in October 2000.
I then noticed the car Stalin gave to Kim Il Sung during the Korean War in the early 1950s.
The tour guide insists most of the ivory in the world is housed in this exhibition, a claim that sounds a little far-fetched but given everything else that I have seen, somehow wholly appropriate.
