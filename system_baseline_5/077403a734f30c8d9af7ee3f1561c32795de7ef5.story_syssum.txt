"We're going to require as a condition for raising the debt ceiling something really important about the debt," Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, told reporters.
"From my point of view, taxes are not on the table because we don't have a revenue problem, we have a spending problem," McConnell said.
"The only thing Republicans fought to protect were the richest of the rich," Reid said of last week's budget negotiations on a spending plan for the rest of the current fiscal year.
As Washington battles over spending cuts, the Treasury Department reported Tuesday that the deficit for the first six months of the 2011 fiscal year has reached $829.4 billion.
That's slightly better than the $222.5 billion deficit in February, probably because the looming tax filing deadline increased receipts.
