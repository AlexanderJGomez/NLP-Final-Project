Thomas Murray says doctors have responsibility for welfare of children conceived through IVF procedure.
What this case really does is split wide open a fault line running through infertility treatment in American medicine.
Whether that relationship is forged through infertility medicine, adoption or the old-fashioned way matters not at all: What counts is that adults who want to love and raise a child are matched with a child who needs just that love and care.
The point of infertility treatment, after all, is to create a child.
What happens if a woman in her early 30s with six children wants eight embryos implanted all at once?
Carrying more than a couple of fetuses is dangerous to the pregnant woman and to the health and survival of the fetuses in her womb.
But the ideology of American infertility medicine allows physicians to escape from making any judgments about the suitability of prospective parents.
The American Society for Reproductive Medicine acknowledged in a 2004 report that fertility programs may withhold services when they can provide "well-substantiated judgments" that the child will not receive adequate care.
