(CNN) -- Ayman al-Zawahiri, the longtime deputy to Osama bin Laden, will take over leadership of al Qaeda, according to a statement posted on several jihadist websites Thursday.
It was surprising it took a couple of days for al Qaeda to acknowledge bin Laden's death and this long to say Zawahiri is the new leader."
There will probably not be changes in U.S. counterterrorism strategy now that al-Zawahiri is leading al Qaeda, the U.S. counterterrorism official said.
"He has no sense among the work force in al Qaeda, the kind of prestige that bin Laden had."
The U.S. counterterrorism official said the United States does not know whether al Qaeda members have pledged their loyalty to al-Zawahiri.
