A Washoe County, Nevada, jury convicted James Michael Biela, 28, of first-degree murder and sexual assault in the death of Brianna Denison.
A pair of panties that did not belong to Denison were found near the body, in what police said was a "calling card" that helped them connect Biela not only to Denison, but also to the other assaults.
She said her assailant threatened her with a gun, raped her and took her panties as a souvenir.
Police released a photo of the panties near Denison's body and a description of the pickup truck.
A friend of Biela's girlfriend saw the photo of the panties, and thought she recognized the truck police described.
Biela's defense attorneys challenged the DNA testing method, claiming it was not accurate.
