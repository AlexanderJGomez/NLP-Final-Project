Ihsanullah Ihsan, the spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, said the militant group would conduct various attacks in India in response to the execution.
The Taliban spokesman said they are demanding that Kasab's body be returned to Pakistan for an Islamic burial.
Indian authorities said Wednesday that Kasab had been buried in the "surrounding area" of the jail where he was hanged.
Indian authorities said Kasab was trained by the organization, which was banned in Pakistan in 2002 after an attack on the Indian parliament.
It was the first visit to India by a Pakistani head of state in seven years.
In August, New Delhi alleged that "elements" in Pakistan were using social-networking sites to stir religious unrest in India amid ethnic clashes between Muslim migrants and native tribal groups in the northeastern state of Assam.
"The hanging of Ajmal Kasab marks a distressing end to India's moratorium on executions and is a step backwards for India's justice system," said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch, an advocacy group.
