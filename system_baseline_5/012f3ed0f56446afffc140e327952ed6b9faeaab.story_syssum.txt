(CNN)  -- A New Zealand teenager has been questioned in connection with a scheme by hackers to remotely take over more than 1 million computers worldwide and use them for criminal activity, New Zealand police and the FBI said Thursday.
"They seek to conceal their criminal activities by using third-party computers as vehicles for their crimes."
Between January and June, Symantec Corp., a leading computer security company, detected more than 5 million bot-infested personal computers carrying out at least one attack a day, according to the company's September report.
However, 43 percent of the servers used by hackers to operate the hijacked computers were located in the United States, Symantec said.
