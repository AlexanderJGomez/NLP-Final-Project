"Portlandia isn't as much about a place as it is about a state of mind," says Brownstein.
Brownstein filled the place with sentimental, one-of-a-kind finds: A taxidermied weasel once owned by Amy Sedaris sits on the mantel; '50s-era coastal landscapes by various local artists fill the walls; and a record collectionâ€”which, in Brownstein's case, is several thousand vinyls strong and meticulously alphabetized by artistâ€”testifies that yes, this is a hipster home.
"Now I go into stores and see things I want to buy with birds on it, and I can't, because I'm too self-conscious," Brownstein says.
"The other day, I was in a store and saw a cute dress with birds on it and I was like, 'No, I just can't.'"
