Anthony Marshall was convicted of bilking millions of dollars from the estate of his mother, Brooke Astor.
Marshall's former lawyer, Francis Morrissey, was convicted of all five counts against him, including forgery and scheming to defraud Astor.
Marshall, who is free on $100,000 bail, faces a maximum 25 years in prison when he is sentenced on December 8.
The case kicked off a tabloid feeding frenzy that fostered headlines such as "Bad heir day," "Mrs. Astor's disaster" and "DA's kick in the Astor."
"Mrs. Astor stood in New York as a symbol of generosity.
"It's a sad day, but at the same time, one good thing that will come out of this -- that Mrs. Astor would approve of -- is that the elderly cannot be abused."
