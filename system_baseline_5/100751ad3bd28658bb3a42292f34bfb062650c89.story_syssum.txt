I became hysterical," said Donnelly, 50.
Jen Leary, a former firefighter who founded the group, met with building residents and, once the fire was out, retrieved the animals.
"When (someone) loses everything in a fire, they shouldn't then be forced to lose their pets -- their family members -- as well," Leary said.
Several years ago, Leary began working as a firefighter and American Red Cross volunteer.
said Leary, 36.
Now, whenever the Red Cross responds to a disaster and discovers that an animal is involved, they call Leary.
Rescuing animals is only part of what Red Paw does.
Leary's home is the first stop for most animals that don't need immediate medical care.
"Food, cat litter, bowls, medicine, whatever they need," said Leary.
Red Paw cared for the Donnelly's cat for more than three weeks.
For Leary, helping families and their pets is what her work is all about.
