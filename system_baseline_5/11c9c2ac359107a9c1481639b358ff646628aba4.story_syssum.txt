(CNN) -- Spain striker Fernando Torres may not be fit for the start of the World Cup, according to his English club Liverpool.
Meanwhile, Germany coach Joachim Loew has been dealt a double blow ahead of the World Cup after goalkeeper Rene Adler and midfielder Simon Rolfes were ruled out of the tournament through injury.
Rolfes, who also plays for Leverkusen, has been out of action since an operation on a knee injury back in January and will not be adding to his 21 caps at the finals in South Africa.
Meanwhile, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy has been left out of Holland's provisional World Cup squad, but coach Bert Van Marwijk says it doesn't necessarily spell the end of his World Cup dream.
"I'm leaving him until that date to convince me that he is sufficiently in shape to take part in the World Cup."
