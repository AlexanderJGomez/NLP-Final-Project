(CNN) -- A spike in napa cabbage prices has South Koreans sweating over their national side dish, kimchi.
One hundred and fifty tons of the fresh vegetables are being imported from China as well.
Some Koreans are looking for the government to do more, such as subsidize cabbage sales, said Eun Jeong Lee, a researcher at Seoul-based ZenKimchi.com.
"Do not laugh: this is serious stuff for Koreans and kimchi lovers everywhere!"
