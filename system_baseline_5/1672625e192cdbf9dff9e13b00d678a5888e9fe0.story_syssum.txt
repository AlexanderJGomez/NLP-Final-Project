Washington (CNN) -- Inside a tall, red-brick building in Alexandria, Virginia, there is a federal courtroom just waiting for admitted intelligence leaker Edward Snowden to show up.
In a major victory, Snowden won temporary political asylum in Russia.
The down side for Snowden is that his asylum is limited.
Edward Snowden's father, Lon Snowden, hoped at first that there might be a way to arrange for his son to return to the United States.
Option 3: Extradition.
Why?
This could be a problem for Snowden.
And Snowden is traveling with a representative of WikiLeaks.
