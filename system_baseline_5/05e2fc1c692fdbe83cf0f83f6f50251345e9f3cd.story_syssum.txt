The man on the phone was offering us young children with the casualness of a market trader.
When our colleague want to see them, he was shown a group of children and asked which one he wanted to take.
I told him we wanted to know what we'd need to do, if we decided we did want to "foster" the children.
He told me, "Sister, Jesus will reward me," so the "fostering" was free, he said.
At the camp where we finally met the man face to face, there was no attempt at subterfuge.
Did I want to consider an older girl?
Our last phone conversation revolved around what an appropriate "donation" would be in exchange for the children.
I put the phone down and we traveled back to the capital that day to show Naptip what we'd found.
