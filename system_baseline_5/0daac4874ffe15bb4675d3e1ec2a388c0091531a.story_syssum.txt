She adds that she feels for the parents of 21-year-old Brianna Benlolo and 25-year-old Tyler Johnson, who were shot dead with a shotgun on Saturday morning at the busy Columbia mall.
According to police, Aguilar took a taxi to The Mall in Columbia on Saturday morning and then fired as many as nine shots from a Mossberg 500 shotgun into a skateboard apparel shop, killing Benlolo and Johnson before fatally shooting himself.
Aguilar was an avid skateboarder, Cropper said.
Several hours later, she went to check on him, and the store manager said Aguilar had never showed up, according to Cropper.
According to Cropper, police -- who were aware of the mall shooting -- then asked if Aguilar kept a journal.
She loved being a mother," McDonald said.
Police said the woman wasn't in Zumiez; rather, she was on the first floor when she was hit.
Cory Brown, the co-owner, said Aguilar walked in with a friend and after spending about 30 minutes in the store, he was approved to purchase the Mossberg 500.
He asked a lot of good questions," Brown said.
Brown said Aguilar came back just before Christmas with the same friend and purchased another box of shotgun shells.
Police said Cody Cousins, 23, an engineering student, killed Andrew Boldt, 21, of West Bend, Wisconsin.
Police were looking for a suspect.
