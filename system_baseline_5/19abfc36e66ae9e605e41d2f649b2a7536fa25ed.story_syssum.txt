"For 20 years, I've been looking through a microscope, and every time I see things I haven't seen before," said van Egmond, who has had 19 images recognized as finalists in the competition over the past decade.
The view through the microscope was like "exploring a different world, or exploring space, with these strange unknown organisms," he said.
The winning entry was created using software to combine various images focusing on different areas of the plankton.
By combining images where some areas were in focus and others were blurred, he could create a 3-dimensional effect, he said.
