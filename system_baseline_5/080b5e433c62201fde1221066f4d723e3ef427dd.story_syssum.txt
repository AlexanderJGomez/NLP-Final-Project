CNN recently spoke to writer Rick Remender on what to expect with this big change.
But Sam is somebody who isn't reflecting on things as a soldier.
Remender: Steve Rogers -- who has aged now; time has caught up to him -- will still be a tactician, providing his military experience.
Since he is incapable of serving as Captain America, he will be at the Avengers mansion at the command station.
One of the things we got were photos of kids holding the shield.
Remender: I wanted to put Sam into something that felt like a traditional "Captain America" comic book but wanted him to come up against an insurmountable wall unlike anything Steve has even faced.
Hydra has already won before Sam realizes that they're up to something.
