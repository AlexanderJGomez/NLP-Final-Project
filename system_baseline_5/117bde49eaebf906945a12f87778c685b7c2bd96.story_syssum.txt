Sarah Palin's hometown required women to pay for their own rape examinations while she was mayor, a practice her police chief fought to keep as late as 2000.
He said the only ongoing resistance he met was from Wasilla, where Palin was mayor from 1996 to 2002.
For years, Alaska has had the worst record of any state in rape and in murder of women by men.
During the time Palin was mayor of Wasilla, her city was not the only one in Alaska charging rape victims.
Tara Henry, a forensic nurse who has been treating rape victims across Alaska for the last 12 years, told CNN that opposition to Croft's bill from Wasilla Police Chief Charlie Fannon was memorable.
"What I recall is that the chief of police in the Wasilla police department seemed to be the most vocal about how it was going to affect their budget."
He does not recall discussing the issue with then-Mayor Palin.
The bill passed unanimously with the support of the Alaska Department of Public Safety, the Alaska Peace Officers Association and more than two dozen co-sponsors.
"I just don't want to see any more burden on the taxpayer."
Patrick was also a member of Wasilla City Council, and she doesn't recall the issue coming before council members, nor does she remember discussing the issue with Palin.
Before Palin came to City Hall, the Wasilla Police Department paid for rape kits out of a fund for miscellaneous costs, according to the police chief who preceded Fannon and was fired by Palin.
Palin is committed to supporting victims and bringing violent criminals to justice," Hazelbaker said.
Victims' advocates say that services are lacking and that Palin cut funding for a number of programs that treat female victims of violence.
The McCain-Palin campaign insists that fighting domestic violence and sexual assault are priorities for Palin.
And she reauthorized a Council on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault.
