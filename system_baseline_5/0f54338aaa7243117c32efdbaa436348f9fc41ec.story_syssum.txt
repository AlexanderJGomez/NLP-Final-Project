(CNN) -- Are you still shopping for holiday gifts?
But sometimes you truly have to wonder: What the hell was the person thinking when they bought the gift?
Earlier this week, I posted a simple question on Twitter and Facebook: Have you ever received a bad holiday gift?
-- it didn't matter, you pick the holiday and I can list you a bunch of bad gifts.
The most astounding gift was a voucher for a Botox treatment given to Hanadi Kalla -- she was 26 years old at the time.
These gifts are fine if a person asks for it.
But there's a right way and a dreadfully wrong way to do this.
A person received a sweater that was not only clearly used, but it smelled like cigarette smoke.
Gifts that have no connection to the person
So if the person has posted on Facebook "I hate the outdoors," don't buy them camping equipment.
Yes, gift cards are fine
After all, if you are going to expend the effort to get someone a holiday gift, then why not give a gift they will truly enjoy and appreciate?
