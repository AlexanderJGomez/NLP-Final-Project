Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- Geeta was 9 when she began wearing makeup, staying up until 2 a.m. and having sex with as many as 60 men a day.
"Families are tricked all the time," said Koirala.
By raiding brothels, patrolling the India-Nepal border and providing safe shelter and support services, Koirala and Maiti Nepal have helped rescue and rehabilitate more than 12,000 Nepali women and girls since 1993.
But when her relationship took a violent turn, her life's "purpose and responsibility completely changed," she said.
Maiti Nepal was her brainchild for giving voice, legal defense and rehabilitation to victims of sex trafficking.
The group has facilities throughout Nepal and India, but most of the rehabilitation work takes place at its main campus in Kathmandu, Nepal.
"Everybody comes to Maiti Nepal."
For these girls, Maiti Nepal becomes their new, and possibly last, home.
"The hardest part for me is to see a girl dying or coming back with different diseases at an [age] when she should be out frolicking," Koirala said.
They easily recognize a girl that is being trafficked or will be trafficked," Koirala said.
But Koirala says that among those rescued by Maiti Nepal, there isn't a single case when a girl has returned back to the streets.
She credits Koirala and Maiti Nepal for the strength to keep living and the confidence to join the fight against sex trafficking.
