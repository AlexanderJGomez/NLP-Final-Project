Retired Col. John Leech narrowly escaped death at the Pentagon on September 11, 2001.
...
It makes you weak in the knees to see these pictures," Leech said.
As he walked the now-renovated halls where he spent the morning of September 11, he recalled the horror of the day.
It rattled you right down to the bone," Leech said.
...
It was not scorched; it didn't have smut on it," Leech remembered.
Seven years after that horrible day, Leech visited the chapel at the new Pentagon Memorial, a two-acre park, which opens to the public Thursday.
He wrote, "Thanks Jack for serving and dying for our nation -- John Leech."
A lot of very good people."
