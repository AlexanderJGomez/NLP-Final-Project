Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)Government forces and rebels in Yemen agreed to a ceasefire Monday after heavy fighting in the capital, Sanaa, Yemen's interior minister and a rebel official said.
Government officials characterize it as a power grab by the Houthis.
So this hasn't finished playing out," the diplomat said.
The presidential palace is controlled by the government and mountaintops surrounding the palace are held by rebels known as Houthis, a senior interior ministry official told CNN late Monday.
Prime Minister Khaled Bahah was fired upon when he left a meeting with President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi and the Houthi political group Ansarallah, Al-Sakkaf said.
The gunfire came from a Houthi checkpoint near the meeting place, and the attempt to kill the prime minister was a breach on an earlier ceasefire, Al-Sakkaf said.
Adding to the disputes, the information minister said Yemeni state TV and the state-run Saba news agency are now under the control of the Houthi political movement.
Al-Sakkaf said gunmen linked to the Houthi political movement attacked the presidential palace in a bid to take control of the symbol of power.
But a top Houthi official said Houthis tried to mediate with the army and asked for roads to be opened for citizens, which led to their people getting attacked.
Osama Sari, senior media adviser to the Houthi movement in Yemen, said the Houthis had detained bin Mubarak as a message to the President.
In September, Houthis signed a ceasefire deal with the government.
