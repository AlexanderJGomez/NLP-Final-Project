One of the many disturbing aspects of the NSA spying revelations is how much joy they have brought to the world's chronic violators of human rights and political freedoms.
Navalny was particularly worrisome to the Russian president.
They claim it is Washington that leads the world in violating human rights, even as dozens of people who dared protest against Putin's rule face trial or languish in jail, in a country where a number of journalists who criticized the president have turned up dead under mysterious circumstances.
Death didn't save Magnitsky from Russia's courts, which found him guilty of tax fraud just last week.
For Putin, having Snowden in Russia creates many complications, but he has hardly managed to conceal his glee at having America's top critic under his protection.

But Russian democrats and human rights activists have a weaker supporter in America now.
Even if you agree with Snowden that the NSA spying is going too far, as I do, it's hard to argue with the negative impact Snowden's revelations have had on human rights activists in other countries.
There are, however, many meaningful differences between America's surveillance excesses and those of Russia, China and their ilk.
But advocates of Internet privacy, free expression and human rights should not allow abusive authoritarian regimes to use American actions as a cover for their egregious misdeeds.
