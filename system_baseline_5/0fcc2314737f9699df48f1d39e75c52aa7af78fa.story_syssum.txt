BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Liu Yan, regarded as China's top classical dancer, was to give the performance of a lifetime: She was to dance a solo at the opening ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
I was dancing on a thin layer of electrical mat, I was standing on that, and there was a platform powered by a vehicle moving underneath," Liu said from the Beijing 306 Military Hospital.
But then, I could see the fireworks from the rehearsal," Liu said through tears.
"I was afraid to watch it," she said.
I love dancing very much.
But I believe I will keep dancing or at least doing work related to that, because that is what I love."
But I think of it as a process," she said.
"I think you should not blame one person, or one particular moment," she said.
She also said she did not know about reports her family and witnesses to the accident were told not to talk about what happened afterward.
As for the future, Liu said she might go back to school, to learn more about dance, and get a master's or a doctorate degree.
