Like a football or basketball game, a host can't "win" "SNL" with a great opening monologue, but he or she sure can screw it up.
For the second straight year, EW.com readers have voted to determine who was "SNL's" best host.
Throughout the show's season, the most recent host was pitted against the four most popular previous hosts in a vote, and the one with the least number of voters was eliminated while the four survivors advanced to the next week.
Live comedy is a gauntlet that can expose and undermine the proudest of entertainers.
It helps, of course, if you think CK is a comic genius, but even if you're not tuned in to his brand of comedy, his first time hosting had a refreshingly off-beat vibe.
CK lasted a few weeks in our voting contest before being eliminated by Jeremy Renner, but if he hosts again next year he's a total must-watch, especially with one show under his belt.
Less than a month after hosting the season premiere, the Academy Awards announced that the creative force behind "Family Guy" and "Ted" would host Hollywood's biggest night.
With those out of the way, he should be even freer and more unpredictable the next time he visits.
Was it half-scripted?
But if you were obsessed with the show, like the nearly 6 million people who watched the season two finale, Hathaway's impression of jazz-freakout Carrie was one of the most perceptive caricatures "SNL" has ever showcased.
Can we hope "Homeland" is in the middle of a season again the next time Hathaway gets the call?
(You know the saying, always a "Bridesmaid ...") But she's certainly now on the short list of essential hosts, along with Timberlake, Fallon, Wiig, Zach Galifianakis and Jon Hamm (who by the way, despite popping up for frequent cameos lately, hasn't hosted since 2010).
Thanks again for voting throughout the year, and congratulations to Justin Timberlake, Mr. Saturday Night 2013.
