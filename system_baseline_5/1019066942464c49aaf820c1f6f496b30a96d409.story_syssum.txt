Dr. Ira Longini studies simulations of hypothetical influenzas and how they would spread.
For the moment, he said, there is not enough information about the swine flu that has sickened hundreds in Mexico and about 50 people in the United States to accurately forecast how the disease will travel.
In the simulations, Longini said, these forms of containment reduce the sickness by nearly two-thirds.
So far, Longini said, it appears that everyone sickened by swine flu in the United States contracted the disease while traveling in Mexico, the apparent epicenter of the outbreak.
Longini said health officials are doing everything they can to mitigate how widely the swine flu spreads in the United States.
"Through simulations and mathematical work we've shown that travel restrictions -- although potentially useful in slowing spread [of swine flu] -- they are not going to stop it," Longini said.
Even outbreaks such as swine flu tend to follow standard flu season patterns, he said.
"Timing is terrible for people in the Southern Hemisphere -- places like New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, parts of South America, "Longini said.
