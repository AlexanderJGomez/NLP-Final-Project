And we definitely learned some lessons from the Florida special election.
Public polling in the run-up to Election Day showed that the electorate was going to skew toward Republicans by around 10%.
We saw a Republican win in a district that is traditionally held by Republicans -- by a significantly lower margin than in the past 60 years.
Yes, Republicans pumped money into this race.
What, then, was it about?
Republicans accused Democrats of $716 billion in Medicare cuts.
But the "be afraid" message works well for Republicans, in part because the Democrats don't counter it.
Let's face it, more Republican voters filed and submitted absentee ballots than Democrats, and more turned out on Election Day.
Democrats believe that when more people vote, it's not just good for our party, it's good for democracy.
After all, the Republican in charge of electing Republicans to Congress said before the election, "special elections aren't too predictive for either side going forward."
That was true before Election Day, and it's true today.
