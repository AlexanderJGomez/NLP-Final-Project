A man who captured video of the fatal confrontation between New York police and Eric Garner was arrested Saturday night on gun possession charges at a Staten Island hotel, according to a law enforcement official.
Police stopped them both and recovered a gun from the girlfriend's waistband, the source said.
Officer Daniel Pantaleo, who is seen on the video choking Garner, was put on modified assignment and stripped of his badge and gun amid the investigation, the New York Police Department said.
The Staten Island district attorney's office said Orta's arraignment will happen Monday.
