Chris Christie in New Jersey, and Garden State voters don't think America wants a "Jersey Guy" president, according to a new poll released Thursday.
The last Jersey guy who got elected president did not carry the state in his 1916 reelection," Maurice Carroll, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, said in a news release.
For the poll, Quinnipiac surveyed 1,340 registered voters in New Jersey over the phone from Dec. 3-8.
The sampling error is plus or minus 2.7 percentage points.
