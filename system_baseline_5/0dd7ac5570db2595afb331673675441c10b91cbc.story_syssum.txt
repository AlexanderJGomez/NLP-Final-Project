Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- Anders Behring Breivik's defense counsel had warned that the self-confessed killer would show no remorse.
There were smiles and handshakes with the psychiatrists and prosecution at the start.
And that is what they are doing -- taking pride in the fact they are a society who will respect Breivik's human rights, even when he showed no respect for the lives of others.
There is a sense the people of Norway want to see due process done and then move on.
They are a people who believe their system works, which is why no matter how unspeakable his crimes and how hard these months are and will continue to be, Breivik has not been able to break them.
