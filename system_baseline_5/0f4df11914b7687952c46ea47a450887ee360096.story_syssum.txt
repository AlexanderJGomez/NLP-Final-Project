(CNN) -- Nearly one in four people worldwide is Muslim -- and they are not necessarily where you might think, according to an extensive new study that aims to map the global Muslim population.
There are about 1.57 billion Muslims in the world, according to the report, "Mapping the Global Muslim Population," by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life.
Brian Grim, the senior researcher on the Pew Forum project, was slightly surprised at the number of Muslims in the world, he told CNN.
"If the goal is to create better understanding between the United States and the Muslim world, our focus should be on south and southeast Asia, not the Middle East," he said.
One in five of the world's Muslims lives in a country where Muslims are a minority.
It has only about 240 million Muslims -- about 15 percent of all the world's Muslims.
"Only one or two censuses in the world ... have ever asked the sectarian question," said Grim.
"We don't care only about Muslims," Grim said.
"This is no way reflects the religiosity of people, only their self-identification," Grim said.
