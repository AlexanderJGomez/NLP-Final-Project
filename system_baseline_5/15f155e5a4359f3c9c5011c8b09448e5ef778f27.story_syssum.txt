The shooting began after the student walked into Arapahoe High School in Centennial with the intention of confronting a specific faculty member, Robinson said.
But Robinson told reporters that the condition of a  a 15-year-old girl who was shot was in critical condition after surgery.
Pierson walked into Arapahoe High School carrying a shotgun and made no attempt to hide it, Robinson said.
I said, 'They are shooting in the school.'"
In addition to the shotgun, authorities found two Molotov cocktails inside the school, Robinson said.
The other was "rendered safe," Robinson said.
The first sheriff's deputies and police officers arrived at Arapahoe and entered almost immediately after the shooting was reported, Robinson said.
Leytoldt said she was in yoga class and that her teacher told all the students to get into a closet to protect them.
They soon heard people yelling, and walkie-talkies crackling, and then they heard police asking someone to drop the gun, put the gun down, and hold his arms up, she said.
Within about 14 minutes of the initial report, "we had information on the radio that my deputies believed they had the shooter down inside the school," Robinson said.
Students were then taken by bus to a nearby church where they were reunited with their families, Robinson said.
John Hickenlooper called the shooting an "all-too-familiar sequence, where you have gunshots and parents racing to the school and unspeakable horror in a place of learning."
