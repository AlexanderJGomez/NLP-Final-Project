Anneke van Woudenberg, senior researcher with Human Rights Watch, told Christiane Amanpour that 200,000 women and girls have been raped in Eastern Congo since 1998, and the condition of women has become more dire as the Congolese army has pressed a military campaign against armed groups in the countryside.
While the war formally ended six years ago, fighting persists in eastern Congo, and women are paying a high price.
It's protecting them from rape," van Woudenberg said.
"No general has yet been held to account in Congo for rape, and it's high time that that changes."
Congo has taken some measures to try to curb the sexual violence.
"If one applied the counterinsurgency ratios that the U.S. Army thinks of -- say, 20 per 1,000 -- that would mean 200,000 troops in Congo -- 200,000 accountable troops."
"What needs to be done is to have a state in Congo that can control its territory and that has the confidence of the people," Guehenno said.
My hope is that the women and girls of -- of eastern Congo in particular -- will continue to speak out.
