Our culture is biased against quiet and reserved people, but introverts are responsible for some of humanity's greatest achievements -- from Steve Wozniak's invention of the Apple computer to J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter.
That's one out of every two or three people you know.
But nowadays many students sit in "pods" of desks with four or five students facing each other, and they work on countless group projects -- even in subjects like math and creative writing.
Kids who prefer to work by themselves don't fit, and research by educational psychology professor Charles Meisgeier found that the majority of teachers believe the ideal student is an extrovert -- even though introverts tend to get higher grades, according to psychologist Adrian Furnham.
And culturally we need a better balance of yin and yang between the two types.
The need for balance is especially important when it comes to creativity and productivity.
Steve Wozniak invented the first Apple computer alone in his cubicle at Hewlett Packard.
Our major religions all tell the story of seekers -- Moses, Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha -- who go off alone, to the wilderness, and bring profound revelations back to the community.
So it's much better to send people off to generate ideas by themselves, freed from the distortion of group dynamics, and only then come together as a team.
But I am saying that we all need alone time.
