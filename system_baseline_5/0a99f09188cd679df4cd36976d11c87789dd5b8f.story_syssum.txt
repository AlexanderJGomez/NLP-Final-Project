Russell is familiar with how women are portrayed in the media.
Cameron Russell: I had been thinking about an online participatory magazine for a while.
Critical voices from women and people of color are missing from many important conversations.
We knew it's crazy to start another media platform, but we came across many authentic voices online and offline that we felt we can bring together and showcase.
But it's not just girls.
These girls liked their bodies because they functioned well!
But when we posted her advice to our Tumblr site it became one of the most popular stories.
Russell: Actually, I think working on the offline Genius Lab.
We wanted to build a space where people felt comfortable and genius in their identity.
Russell: The first several hundred submissions came from people who found out about the project online, mostly through Twitter.
We want to build something that disrupts the way we think media can be made.
Russell: Every time someone who isn't a "media maker" creates something that goes viral, every time someone whose perspective is left out of mainstream media proves to make an impact, every time a contributor collaborates with someone new to make better work, we improve the media landscape a little bit.
Russell: I'm inspired by the people I work with.
And then there's the graffiti artist and muralist known as miss163.
