Mraz shared tales of his avocado farm, as well as what it's like to get the cold shoulder from Simon Cowell, when he sat down with CNN recently.
Yes, the trees give me avocado and fruit that we sell and we eat tons of, but I feel like I have a role to play back to that, too.
Mraz: I do, thank you.
Mraz: I do.
Mraz: Well, I bring tons of backup supplies with me.
Mraz: I loved it.
I was like, "What does he think?"
Mraz: It is really tough.
Mraz: Very surprised.
Where were you?
Mraz: I was at home.
Mraz: This year we're going to explore South America, which I've visited as a tourist, but I've never taken my music down there.
Mraz: No, but I have the Rosetta Stone.
