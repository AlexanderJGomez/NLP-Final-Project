CNN projects incumbent Sen. Pat Roberts has fended off conservative challenger Milton Wolf in the state's GOP Senate primary.
Wolf's campaign for months tried to portray Roberts as more in tune with Washington than Kansas, pointing to reports from earlier this year that the senator listed his voting address at the home of two longtime political supporters who rent a room to him.
Our republic needs us to stand up and fight and it is the greatest honor of my life to stand shoulder to shoulder with you," he said.
The Wolf campaign ran numerous ads attacking Roberts over his residency.
"You told Kansans you would give them your word and you would give them a debate," Wolf said to Roberts.
You tell us that you are tough and you're tested and trusted.
"This is not the time.
Let's just debate," Wolf continued as Roberts walked off.
Also in Kansas, Rep. Mike Pompeo beat former congressman Todd Tiahrt in the Republican primary for the state's 4th Congressional District, CNN projects.

She announced plans earlier this year to run for the seat being vacated by her husband, Rep. John Dingell, the longest serving member of Congress in history.
