At the border, before going back to China, a group of security guards confiscated my camera and erased all images they thought were inappropriate, or did not portray the country in a favorable light.
Officially, I only had two restrictions to obey during my trip: No photos of the military or military facilities and all shots of portraits of Kim Il Sung and his son Kim Jong-Il had to show their entire figures.
Many times I asked Ho if it was okay to take photos of police, guards, power stations, refineries, train tracks and other objects I suspected would be considered sensitive by the secretive regime.
"No problem," said my guide.
And in the evening I sat down with a couple of young women from the local tourist office and had a conversation -- in Mandarin through an interpreter -- about relationships and everyday life in North Korea.
The real setback happened just minutes before I was to cross the Tumen River and go back to China.
My guide said they were erasing "inappropriate" pictures, with no further explanation.
Back in Hong Kong I got in contact with a small IT company that specializes in data recovery.
Looking at the censored photos, I was surprised about the selection.
Why these images are not in line with North Korean image guidelines is for me a mystery.
