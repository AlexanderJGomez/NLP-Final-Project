"It's horrible, because Lindsay Lohan or any defendant should be able to feel that their privacy is being protected," Heller told CNN on Wednesday after TMZ reported Lohan would check into the Seafield Center in Westhampton Beach, New York, for her court-mandated 90 days of substance abuse rehabilitation next month.
"Since I'm the only one who communicated that, it more or less would have to be that one of the two prosecutors would be their source," he said.
"Lindsay Lohan is the victim," he said.
"I can sum it up in one word: ridiculous," Heller said when asked for a comment last month.
"I think this is an opportunity for me to focus on what I love in life," she said.
