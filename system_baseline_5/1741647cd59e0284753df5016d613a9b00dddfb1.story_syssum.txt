As with any top 10 list, many good games did not make the cut.
I tried to include games that I never really wanted to put down until the very last scene.
Not only does the story take a look back and reveal how Drake got started on his quests, but it also tied up many loose plot lines very well.
"LA Noire" puts the story to the forefront in a daring attempt to be different.

"Little Big Planet 2" has a single-player story that has a good plot and supporting characters.
"Deus Ex: Human Revolution" allows players to experiment with different augmentations to enhance their human character.
(PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Windows PC)
(PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PlayStation PSP, Windows PC, Nintendo DS, Nintendo Wii)
"Saints Row the Third" uses them as the canvas of a hilariously funny and sexually charged romp that also offers excellent game mechanics.
(PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Windows PC)
An independent title that shows what the "little guy" could do, "Bastion" is a surprisingly stunning game with original weaponry, an environment that players put together as the game progresses and narration that literally tells the story of what you are doing at that time.
It's a game that's fun to play but never takes itself too seriously.
"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim" is an open-world, role-playing game that literally has more than 100 quests to complete.
(PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Windows PC)
This "Batman" game was difficult to put down, even after the main story line (which was highly dramatic) was finished.
(PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Windows PC)
Great dialogue?
If that isn't enough, a new co-op mode allows players to play as test robots that act like Abbott and Costello.
