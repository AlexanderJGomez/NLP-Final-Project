LONDON, England (CNN) -- When Danish auteur Lars von Trier presented his gothic thriller, "Antichrist" at Cannes Film Festival last month, it was greeted with cat-calls, jeers and, at times, disbelieving laughter.
Do you think that Lars von Trier is a woman-hater?
Indeed, a few years ago, it was questionable whether von Trier, who is famously multi-phobic, would be able to make another film.
"I think that if you are, shall we say, sensitive, then there is a good side and a bad side about it," said von Trier.
Von Trier claimed each morning she would say "Mr von Trier, I despise you," and spit at him.
Brought up in Copenhagen by bohemian parents who were committed nudists, he suffers from crippling bouts of agoraphobia; and, most famously, a fear of flying.
But, von Trier says, he has always taken a deeply personal approach to the experimental, often dark and challenging works that he creates.
