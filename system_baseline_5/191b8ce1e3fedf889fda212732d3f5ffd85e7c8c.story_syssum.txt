Much of her time in Za'atari has been spent going from tent to tent, from mosque to mosque, talking to children and parents about why getting back in the classroom is important.
For her effort, she has been called the "Malala of Za'atari," in reference to Pakistani education activist Malala Yousafzai.
In fact, Malala and Mizune are friends, having spent many hours together in the Za'atari camp when Malala visted there in February..
"Children are the most important people in society," she said.
The government responded with military action.
Za'atari has become the second largest refugee camp in the world.
Days go by, and an end to the Syrian crisis does not seem near, but Mizune, who dreams of someday becoming a Journalist, is already thinking of better days for her country's future.
