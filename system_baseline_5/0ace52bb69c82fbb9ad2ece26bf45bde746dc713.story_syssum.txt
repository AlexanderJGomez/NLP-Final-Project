(CNN) -- Syrian opposition forces may have executed as many as 30 people, most of them government soldiers, in rural Aleppo, according to the United Nations, which cited videos of the killings posted on the Internet in July.
Reminding opposition forces that all captured or wounded soldiers must be treated in accordance with international law, Pillay said, "Opposition forces should not think they are immune from prosecution.
The U.N. human rights office also said Friday that investigators have been allowed to visit rebel-controlled Khan al-Assal as part of a separate investigation into the alleged use of chemical weapons.
