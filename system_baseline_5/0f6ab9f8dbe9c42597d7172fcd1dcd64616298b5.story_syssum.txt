A video installation, called "A Letter Can Always Reach Its Destination," featuring people reading from scam emails, is one of the five winning pieces of the Abraaj Capital Art Prize unveiled at Art Dubai this week.
Hadjithomas said they chose 45 emails to read out for "A Letter Can Always Reach its Destination" from some 4,000 received over the years.
"You can read a kind of history of the world over the last 10 years in a different way through these emails.
A more personal piece comes from the Palestinian artist Taysir Batniji, who produced "To My Brother, which he describes as a tribute to his brother Mayssara, killed by an Israeli sniper during the First Intifada in 1987.
"My work is about disappearance in general and especially in the Palestinian context," said Batniji.
His work "China" features seven Chinese porcelain vases featuring key battles from Lebanon's civil war.
"Apart from being trade gateways, these cities were also sites of resistance and rebellion against the imperial powers," says the exhibition booklet.
Muller said the $120,000 prize money given in advance based on proposals allowed artists to make work that would not otherwise have been possible.
"It's extremely important that there's production money because that's the most difficult thing for artists to find resources to concentrate on a piece they want to make," she said.
