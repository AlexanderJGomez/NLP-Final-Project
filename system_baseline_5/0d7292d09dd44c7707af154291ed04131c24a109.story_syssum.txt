Manila, Philippines (CNN) -- As the bodies of eight tourists killed in a bus hijacking in the Philippines arrived in Hong Kong, China, on Wednesday, the Hong Kong government urged citizens not to take their grief and anger out on Filipinos despite "the poor way" the hijacking was handled by authorities.
Two of three remaining hospitalized victims had been expected to be released from Philippine hospitals in time for the flight, but it was not known if they were on the plane that landed in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong's Chief Executive, Donald Tsang,  was to lead a ceremony to raise the flag and lower it to half-staff on  Thursday, and a three-minute period of silence was scheduled for 8 a.m.,  according to the Hong Kong government.
Former police officer Rolando Mendoza, who was apparently upset about having lost his job, took hostage a busload of tourists from Hong Kong on Monday.
Santiago said police killed none of  the hostages, though a ballistics investigation has yet to be completed.
In Hong Kong, flags also were lowered and traders at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange paused in silence.
In Manila, a makeshift shrine was erected in front of the bus, with flowers left for the victims.
"We do not want to pass sweeping judgment or make early conclusions except to say that our intention to peacefully end this hostage drama was spoiled when the hostage-taker suddenly exhibited violent behavior and began shooting the hostages," Philippine National Police Chief Director Gen. Jesus A. Verzosa said Tuesday in a statement.
Gordon said survivors said the situation inside the bus changed dramatically toward the end of the 10-hour standoff.

Moreno said that Mendoza's brother was arrested during the standoff because he was "guilty of conspiring with his brother" and allegedly helped instigate the shooting.
