The Braley campaign confirms the first lady's plans to come to Iowa next month, though no dates, events or locations have yet been set.
It might not come as a big surprise to Iowans that the first lady will be making a public appearance on the trail instead of her husband.
Other popular Democrats will appear in Iowa this weekend as well.
The Des Moines Register first reported Obama's plans.
