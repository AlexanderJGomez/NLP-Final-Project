ROME, Italy (CNN) -- Police Wednesday arrested the suspected head of an Italian mafia murder squad following a two-day manhunt after he eluded police by crawling through sewer pipes, according to Italian media reports.
Setola is believed to have slipped into a tunnel built under his hideout near Naples on Monday, as police closed in on him, according to the reports.
Anti-mafia police have been searching for Setola for months, and had already arrested his wife and two suspected members of his crew, according to the reports.
The Casalesi clan is featured in the best-selling book "Gomorrah" -- a play on the word "Camorra" -- written by Roberto Saviano who now lives under constant police protection.
In November, police arrested an Italian police officer suspected of informing Setola about police operations.
