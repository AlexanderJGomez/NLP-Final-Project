Berlin (CNN)Fans and film critics battled to be the dominant voice at the international premiere of "Fifty Shades of Grey" in Berlin Wednesday night -- and it was the unrestrained exuberance of the fans that won the day.
Several hundred fans huddled together for warmth, spurred on by a shared devotion to the books of E.L. James and the anticipation of catching an eyeful of Jamie Dornan, the handsome actor who plays her bondage-loving billionaire, Christian Grey.
Some fans had come along as couples, revealing different approaches to "Fifty Shades."
Scuffles broke out between camera crews defending their inadequately-allocated space.
For Dornan and Dakota Johnson, who plays submissive Anastasia Steele to Dornan's dominant Grey, it's been a long road from the film's notorious bondage dungeon, the "Red Room of Pain," to the red carpet.
The "Fifty Shades" books have sold over 100 million copies worldwide and been translated into more than 50 languages -- the film's forthcoming Valentines Day release is this year's hot ticket.
It will likely fare less well with most critics.
It's one of several scenes which support Taylor-Johnson's claim to have empowered her heroine.
One scene involving the erotic deployment of an ice cube could have been cut straight out of "9 1/2 Weeks," that other notorious S&M movie which starred Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke, whose character would have kicked Christian Grey's butt.
And when a movie becomes an "event movie," drawing crowds in vast numbers for a fun night out, the cheers of "Fifty Shades" fans may effectively pop a gag into the mouth of the most po-faced critic.
