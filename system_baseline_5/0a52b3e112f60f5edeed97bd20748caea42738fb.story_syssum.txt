My second trip to Libya consisted of traveling from the Egyptian border to Benghazi and then onto the front lines in Misurata, embedding with a few different rebel groups along the way.
One rebel I spoke with had left the hospital earlier that night -- despite having lost a leg -- so that he could get back to the front lines.
Risking your life for freedom is one thing.
This was a different Libya than the one I experienced last year -- a completely new country.
