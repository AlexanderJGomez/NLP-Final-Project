WASHINGTON (CNN) -- There is "no remaining hope" of finding six men trapped for almost a month in a Utah coal mine alive, a federal official said Saturday.

"We basically told the families that at this point in time we've run out of options," Stickler said at a news conference late Friday.
It's finished," the attorney for the families said, according to the Saturday edition of The Salt Lake Tribune.
Murray said last week that the search effort would stop if no signs of life were found at the sixth hole.
MSHA's Stickler said that hole was drilled into the Crandall Canyon Mine on Thursday, but there were problems with a robotic camera that teams were trying to lower into it.
Murray said last Saturday he has already filed paperwork with federal regulators to permanently close and seal the Crandall Canyon mine.
