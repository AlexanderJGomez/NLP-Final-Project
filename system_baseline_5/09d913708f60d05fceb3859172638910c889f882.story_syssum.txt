A pair of New York brothers will appear in court Tuesday on charges of running a multimillion-dollar ring that peddled fake products distributed up and down the East Coast, authorities said.
"Health and beauty products like lip balms, oils, shampoos and inhalers are highly regulated in order to protect consumers, but these defendants are charged with going around those protections and stealing the brands of major corporations that comply with the law," District Attorney Kathleen Rice said in the statement.
The fake products included ChapStick, Johnson's Baby Oil, Vicks VapoRub, Vicks Inhaler, Vaseline and Always sanitary pads; the producers of the real products include major international brands such as Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble and Unilever, prosecutors said.
Nassau County Fire Marshall officials took samples of products they found and sent them to the manufacturers, who verified the counterfeits.
Counterfeits will not have the same quality or consistency of real products.
