The two situations -- protests in Ferguson and drunken violence in Keene -- are not equivalent.
The protests were largely peaceful, but there were some looters and other troublemakers.
Police aggression made the protests worse.
"Ferguson Thugs Harass, Verbally Abuse Police Officers," read a headline on the conservative website RightScoop.
Now, let's turn to white protesters: In mid-October, during the annual Pumpkin Festival in the small New England town of Keene, New Hampshire, some white college kids apparently had too much to drink and turned violent.
Which is true -- and makes the contrast between how society perceives black and white behavior all the more striking.
Why?
No.
And there's more.
The same year football fans at the State University of New York in Cortland rioted even before the game started.
Why aren't we talking about the epidemic of sports-induced violence among white people?
And if there's any violence from a few angry demonstrators, let's keep things in perspective considering the marauding bands of rowdy white football fans and rioting Pumpkin kids.
