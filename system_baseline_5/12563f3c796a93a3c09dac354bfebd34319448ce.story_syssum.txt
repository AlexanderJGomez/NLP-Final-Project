Kingston, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Two weeks ago, a growth was found on the chest of Sara Polcari's 6-year-old dog, Charlie.
" Polcari said.
That's when the vet told them about Fairy DogParents, a nonprofit that helps dog owners pay for their pets' needs during times of economic hardship.
"It's to prevent dogs from being surrendered to shelters or euthanized when their owners cannot afford care," said Marlo Manning, who founded Fairy DogParents.
"I've never had to choose between caring for my dogs or caring for myself," said Manning, 39.

Manning knows how much an ailing dog can cost.
Over time, the costs for Ladybug's medicine, vet bills and special food averaged about $300 to $400 a month, Manning said.
"
They couldn't afford to feed them, never mind get them medicine," Manning recalled.
"
I chose to find a way to sponsor other people who could not afford to keep their dog.
"The money is given directly to the vet or pharmacy," Manning said.
"A lot of the people that we sponsor ... have already lost so much that the one thing they try to hang on to is their dog," Manning said.
And the dog, to them, is some sort of normal or a tie to a happier time.
This dog is with its family and never had to go into a shelter," Manning said, beaming.
The dog doesn't even know we exist, and we're just making sure it gets to the ball."
