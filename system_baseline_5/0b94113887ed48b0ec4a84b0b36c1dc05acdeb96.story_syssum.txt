Jos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Tensions ran high in the central Nigerian city of Jos on Sunday in the aftermath of an explosion outside a Catholic church that left six people dead, according to hospital and government officials.
After the explosion, youths took over a roadblock on the street leading to the church, and an agitated crowd of residents upset with the violence gathered nearby to talk with Jang.
The explosion at St. Finbar's church was the second in two weeks at a Christian church.
In a statement issued by his spokesman, Jonathan urged residents to refrain from reprisal attacks.
