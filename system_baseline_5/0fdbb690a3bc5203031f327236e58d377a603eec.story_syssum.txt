OP to RS: Angel please don't say a thing to anyone.
RS to OP: There are a lot of things that could make us both feel like s**t.
OP to RS: I do appreciate it.
RS to OP: I certainly have never been a prude and I've had fun but all innocent and without harmful repercussions.
I'm terribly disappointed in how the day ended and how you left me.
I do everything to make you happy and to not say anything to rock the boat with u.
I'm so upset I left Darren's party early.
I'm the girl who fell in love with u and wanted to tell u this weekend.
Do this don't do that.
I just want to love and be loved.
OP to RS: I want to talk to you.
And when I spoke up you introduced me which you could've done but when I left you just kept on chatting to him when clearly I was upset.
I'm sorry I asked you to stop tapping my neck yesterday, I know you were just trying to show me love.
RS to OP: I like to believe that I made you proud when I attend these kind of functions with you.
I might joke around and be all Tom boyish at times but I regard myself as a lady and I didn't feel like one tonight after the way you treated me when we left.
I'm a person too and I appreciate that you invited me out tonight and I realize that you get harassed but I am trying my best to make you happy and I feel as though you sometimes never are, no matter the effort I put in.
