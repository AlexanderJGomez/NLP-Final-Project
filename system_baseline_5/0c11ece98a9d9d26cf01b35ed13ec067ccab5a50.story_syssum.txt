Bob Greene recalls Farrah Fawcett's cheerful greetings to the crew every morning on a movie set.
"Morning, Farrah," we would say back, feeling gray and dull in her presence.
Farrah was one of the female leads.
Most people in show business would do just about anything to possess that level of connection with the people out in the seats -- to move through life having everyone in the world feel they know you.
She understood that.
Farrah?
I'd never been on another set.
Steve Allen, a luminary in the early days of television and a cogent observer of the world around him, said that when people see a person who is regularly on TV, it is as if the television performer emits a glow.
Maybe he was right -- but with Farrah, the glow endured.
Yet no one always wins.
"Farrah's not in the movie," he said.
The powers that be with the authority to make such decisions, the story went, after some screenings in front of test audiences had decided that the movie didn't work well with Farrah in it.
The movie had been recut as if she had never existed.
"Morning!"
