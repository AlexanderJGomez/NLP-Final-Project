It has become a real point of contention, with some -- including top sports stars -- threatening to move abroad.
"What you see is that French football loses good players, all leaving for England, so the Premier League will be above all the other leagues," Marseille manager Elie Baup told reporters.
"
"I'm not surprised that they want to play there because it's the best league, but I am surprised by just how many French players have gone there at the same time," former Newcastle and France player Didier Domi told CNN.
When the French players come back to France after a spell in England, they all talk about how great it is.
"I arrived in London 12 years ago and I remember reading the headlines in the newspapers then about how French people were moving for tax reasons.
Even now there is a lot being written about people leaving because of the 75% tax reasons.
Lemaire also doubts that recent raft of French arrivals at Newcastle has anything to do with the levels of tax in their own country.
"
One Frenchman who made the move to England and then to Newcastle was football writer Kevin Quignane, who believes the most difficult task facing his fellow countrymen is understanding the locals' notorious "Geordie" accent.
While it might take time for the newcomers to adapt to the local lingo and swap their Chardonnay for a pint of Newcastle Brown Ale, Quignane believes the recent arrivals will enjoy life in the city.
Back in France the arrival of a world superstar in Beckham at Paris Saint-Germain has helped softened the blow of so many departing French players.
"I am very glad," Lemaire said of Beckham's arrival in the French capital.
