Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- During the summer of 2009, Egyptians from all walks of life waited in hopeful anticipation for the arrival of newly-elected U.S. President Barack Obama in Cairo.
It is hard to tell there was a revolution in many parts of Cairo just months ago.
Cairo, like many major cities in the world, has historically observed the U.S. presidential election closely and with a great deal of skepticism.
We used to talk a lot more about U.S. politics than we do now.
In 2008, Cairo closely watched as America neared the election of the first African-American president, the candidate of hope and change.
While many Egyptians feel George W. Bush had a clear position on democracy and freedom of speech in Egypt, Obama came to Cairo in 2009 and made promises to the Egyptian people that were not necessarily kept.
In the past, many Egyptians sought out hope and salvation in the actions of foreign governments -- but this electoral season, after a year of real change in Egypt, many Egyptians learned that hope will have to come, or at least start, from within.
