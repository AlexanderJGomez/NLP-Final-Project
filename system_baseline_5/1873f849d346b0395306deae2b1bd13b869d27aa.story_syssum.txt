"Man of Steel" director Zack Snyder will direct the film, and current Superman Henry Cavill will star, Warner Bros. said.
"Superman and Batman together on the big screen is a dream come true for DC (Comics) fans everywhere," said Diane Nelson, president of DC Entertainment.
CNN partner Entertainment Weekly reported that "Man of Steel" actor Harry Lennix took the stage with Snyder and read a line from Frank Miller's 1986 book, "The Dark Knight Returns," in which Batman wages battle with the man from Krypton.
Nolan will, however, have a hand in the upcoming Superman-Batman film -- he's serving as one of the executive producers, Warner Bros. said.
Warner Bros. and DC Comics, the publisher of "Superman" titles, are both units of Time Warner, CNN's parent company.
