But come Saturday, countless millions of racing fans the world over will be in mourning for one of the greatest racehorses the sport has ever seen.
Unbeaten at two, three and four years old, Frankel's career yet seems too short for a talent that burned so bright.
But Frankel's last race will also be his toughest yet, pitting him against the second best horse in the world on rating, Cirrus des Aigles, winner of this race last year and looking in imperious form after a stunning victory in his native France over the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe weekend.
Ascot has already witnessed what was arguably the greatest win of Frankel's career -- maybe even the greatest win of any racehorse's career -- his 11-length victory in this year's Queen Anne Stakes at this year's Royal Ascot.
One year earlier, Frankel had started in the 2011 St James's Palace Stakes.
Spot the Fez!
Frankel fans will no doubt be hoping the Queen's royal endorsement will bring him a similar degree of luck on Saturday.
But he was determined to be at York for Frankel's debut over the mile-and-a-quarter distance that he will attempt again on Saturday.
In a little over a year from now, the first of Frankel's foals will be taking his or her first long-limbed steps in a paddock in some corner of England.
But if they inherit just some of their sire's speed, his aggression and his indomitable will to win, a little bit of Frankel's magic will live on.
