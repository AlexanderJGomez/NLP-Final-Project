The Palestinian negotiating team has resigned and will not participate in peace talks with the Israelis, a spokesman for the Palestinian mission to the United Nations told CNN Wednesday.
Settlement building in East Jerusalem and on the West Bank is "the issue that will make or break the negotiations," he said.
The negotiators submitted their resignations to Abbas, Hanan Ashrawi told CNN in an interview in Ramallah on the West Bank.
Talk about expanding settlements has "rendered the peace talks irrelevant if not a total mockery," she said.
Lara Friedman, director of policy and government relations at Americans for Peace Now in Washington, said the plans had included construction in areas deep in the West Bank, east of the barrier that separates Israel from the West Bank.
