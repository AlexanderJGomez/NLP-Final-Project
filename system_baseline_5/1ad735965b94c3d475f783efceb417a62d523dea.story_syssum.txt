(CNN) -- He didn't win the 14th stage of the Tour de France but Chris Froome's Saturday at cycling's most prestigious race was better than his Friday.
Belkin's Mollema remains two minutes, 28 seconds behind Froome, with Saxo-Tinkoff's Contador staying 2:45 behind.
Italy's Matteo Trentin made it two stage wins in a row for Omega Pharma-Quick Step when he came from behind to beat Switzerland's Michael Albasini by half a wheel in a sprint finish.
"It's infuriating to miss out on a stage win because we know that, for our team, the opportunities are rare," Sojasun's Simon said.
"Today we had one chance, and then in the Alps we are on terrain that is not favorable to us."
