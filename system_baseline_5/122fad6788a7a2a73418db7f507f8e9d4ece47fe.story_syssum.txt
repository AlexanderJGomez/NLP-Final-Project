The report noted "missed opportunities" by Lanza's  mother, the school district, and multiple health care providers.
The report was dedicated to the 20 first-graders who died at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012.
Despite sharing her worries about her son's condition with friends, the report said it does not appear Lanza's mother, Nancy Lanza, communicated any concerns to mental health or medical professionals in her final months.
It was during this late elementary school period that major mental health red flags were raised, the report said.
The report concluded that a pattern of accommodation to Lanza's mental health conditions -- rather than addressing his underlying needs -- by Nancy Lanza and certain health care providers, exacerbated Lanza's mental status.
The report singled out a period of homebound education during which Lanza was taken out of school during his eighth-grade year as an especially dangerous health care decision that contributed to his isolation and deterioration.
The report also noted that it appeared Nancy Lanza made no effort to curtail her son's access to guns in the house in the months leading up to the shooting, despite Adam's severe mental deterioration.
