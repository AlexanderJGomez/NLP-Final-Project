A few hours later, my mom woke me up telling me there were a couple of men here to see me and that they said something about it being official or federal business.
I did not get to use it the first time, but I stayed after school that evening to see if I could get a chance to try it out.
That junior high school computer math program lead me to computer classes in high school.
Some of my friends already had computers and now my time came and I finally got my own.
We were a curious group and we were eager to learn more and more about the different computers made and how they worked.
At some point, we started calling our group the "4-1-4s," a name we came up with after hanging out at a local park.
Remember, back then home computers were very new, so there were no computer hacking laws.
So I explained that I would like to be around to see the birth of my baby and live a happy and normal family life.
Today, more than 30 years later, I'm still fascinated by computers: I'm employed as a network engineer and, at home, I tinker around on about half a dozen computers.
There are still lots of issues with people using simple passwords, companies leaving too many doors open and just the massive amounts of computing power available to work on decoding and breaking into systems.
