Earlier, the Air Force said only a small number of body parts had been buried in a commercial landfill and claimed it would be impossible to make a final determination of how many remains were disposed of in that manner.
The Air Force also said that 1,762 body parts were never identified and also were disposed of, first by cremation, then by further incineration and then buried in a landfill.
When bodies are not intact -- for instance, in the aftermath of a crash or explosion -- a body may be released to the family before some parts have been identified by the Air Force Mortuary at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware.
Since the policy was changed in 2008, the unclaimed body parts are buried at sea.
"That makes us proud to be an American, that we would do that," Holt said.
"I think the secretary is comfortable with the way the Air Force has handled this," said Pentagon spokesman Capt.
Later Thursday the Air Force said it was ready to apologize to any family that objected to the disposition of a loved one's remains.
"We regret any additional grief to the families past practices may have caused," said Air Force Lt. Gen. Darrell Jones, deputy Air Force chief of staff.
So far since 2008, he said, only 14 urns containing body fragments have been disposed of at sea.
