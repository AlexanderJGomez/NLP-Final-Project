The brother of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri is proposing to mediate a peace deal between the West and Islamists.
Mohamed spent 14 years in Egyptian jail on charges including terrorism and involvement in the 1981 assassination of President Anwar Sadat 1981.
He wants peace, he says, between Muslims and non-Muslims and has written a proposal that outlines the terms.
Al-Zawahiri says his offer puts him at risk from radical Islamists, but says he is not acting from weakness or for personal gain.
Back then he reportedly had disagreements with his brother about the way forward for the group.
He says he told his interrogators he could work a truce with Islamists but he says his jailers didn't want to know.
"This is a very tough mission.
He says his brother will listen to him, but admits he hasn't talked to him in long over a decade.
