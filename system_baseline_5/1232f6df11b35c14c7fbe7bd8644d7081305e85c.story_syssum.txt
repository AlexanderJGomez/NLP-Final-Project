Devon Byrd, 16, and Wade White, 18, were killed when a natural gas tank at a well production site exploded last fall in Carnes, in southern Mississippi.
Investigators say they found a lighter, but don't know whether it was involved.
"If these tanks are sitting out there in the middle of nowhere, no protection around them, no warning, they are just an accident waiting to happen," CSB Chairman John Bresland told CNN.
Delphi Oil, the company that owns the tank that blew up, told CNN it could not discuss the accident because of pending negligence lawsuits filed by the families.
In nearby Laurel, city zoning laws require oil and gas tanks to be fenced in with warning signs, according to Emergency Management District Executive Director Terry Steed.
"There's nothing we can do to bring Devon and Wade back, " said White's girlfriend, Maria Thompson, 16.
"
But it'll be a deterrent, and it's a step in the right direction."
