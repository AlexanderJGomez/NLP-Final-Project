The company expects to roll out an update to its free Google Search app later this week with the new feature, which uses speech-recognition technology to understand spoken, natural language search requests.
The app also can give answers specific to your location, such as movie times or weather.
For example, a search for "Luxor" will suggest the Las Vegas casino, the city and the original Egyptian temple in search field.
A search for famous astronauts will bring up images of relevant people, along with dates of birth and death.
When the feature is on, Google will search the Web as well as all the e-mails in your account and include a list of relevant e-mails or contacts on the side of your screen.
In 2011, the search team conducted 58,000 experiments on search and made 530 tweaks to how search works.
"The destiny of search is to become that 'Star Trek' computer," he said.
