Lopez took his own .45-caliber handgun onto the sprawling post Wednesday and killed three people and wounded 16 more before taking his own life, according to authorities.
A family spokesman confirmed the account belonged to Lopez.
In early March, around the time investigators said he purchased the .45-caliber pistol used in the shootings, Lopez wrote: "My spiritual peace has just gone.
In another Facebook post, Lopez talked about Lanza, 20, who killed his mother, Nancy, before fatally shooting 20 children, six staff members and himself at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown in December 2012.
He added, "It is stupid to me that anyone can have easy access to a powerful weapon without being mentally evaluated.
It has been exactly 1 year and 2 days since left Iraq seeing in Fallujah the most brutal explosion...
Lt. Gen. Mark Milley, the post's commanding general, said Lopez did not experience direct combat in Iraq.
Before Wednesday's shooting, Lopez stopped at the post's personnel office to pick up a leave form, according to the sister of one of the soldiers injured in the attack.
The soldier was told he would have to come back later, Otis said.
Glidden Lopez Torres, a family spokesman, said Lopez' mother, Carmen, an emergency room nurse in their hometown, died of a heart attack in November.
