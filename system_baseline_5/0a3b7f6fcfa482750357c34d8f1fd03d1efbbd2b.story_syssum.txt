The Coast Guard first encountered Baluchi on Wednesday after receiving a report about a man in a bubble off the coast of Miami, disoriented and asking for directions to Bermuda, a Coast Guard press release said.
A Coast Guard cutter found Baluchi.
The Coast Guard monitored his progress and on Saturday morning  an exhausted Baluchi activated his personal locating beacon, the Coast Guard said.
"Part of his effort was to make world peace but he got caught up in the Gulf Stream," said Coast Guard public affairs specialist Mark Barney.
Now he is an American citizen.
But you gotta be a little crazy to undertake such an endeavor, right?"
