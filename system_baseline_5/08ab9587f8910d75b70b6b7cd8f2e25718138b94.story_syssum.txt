Los Angeles (CNN) -- Heavy rains prompted the emergency evacuation Monday of nearly 2,000 residents of a flooding Southern California town and the temporary closure of at least two highways because of mudslides.
The National Weather Service said additional rain is expected in the area through Tuesday.
"A serious situation will develop now with the mudslide danger that will continue over the next several days," Cabrera said Monday.
"Storm totals of 5 to 10 feet above 7,000 feet are likely," the weather service said, and periods of heavy snow will continue through Monday.
High winds are also forecast for the region, which received several feet of snow over the weekend.
"The decks have a good 5 feet of snow on them," and there's flooding at the end of the neighborhood, she said.
