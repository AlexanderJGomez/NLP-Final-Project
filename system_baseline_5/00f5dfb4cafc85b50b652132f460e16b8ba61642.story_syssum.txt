Paris (CNN) -- Investigators trying to determine why an Air France plane crashed mysteriously two years ago have recovered the complete contents of the flight data recorder and the last two hours of cockpit conversation, they announced Monday.
They will not bring more bodies up from the ocean if they cannot identify the two they already have, they said Thursday.
Those two bodies are being examined to see if there is enough DNA to identify them, investigators said, adding that they hope to have results by Wednesday.
The fuselage was discovered in April with bodies still inside, investigators said.
