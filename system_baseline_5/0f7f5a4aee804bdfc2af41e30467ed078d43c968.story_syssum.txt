That's why I eagerly agreed in the mid-2000s to help lead the Pew Ocean Commission, a special effort to bring together leading voices from around the United States to examine the health of our oceans through the lens of science, not partisan politics.
Ten years ago, the commission released its findings, the nation's first comprehensive report on the state of America's marine environment in more than 40 years.
Many of our nation's commercial fisheries were being depleted and fishing families and communities were hurting.
In 2005, President George W. Bush worked with congressional leaders to strengthen America's primary fisheries management law, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.
In fact, an important milestone was reached last June when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced it had established annual, science-based catch limits for all U.S. ocean fish populations.
Despite the strides made in the 10 years since the Pew Oceans Commission issued its report, challenges remain.
But I'm perhaps most proud of the work the Pew Ocean Commission did to warn about the threat posed to our oceans and call for change.
