That's the message the University of Virginia is trying to send its students and others after a scathing Rolling Stone story detailed allegations of a gang rape at a fraternity party, and the school's supposed indifference toward students who are victims of sexual assault.
"To the survivors of sexual assault and their families, I am also sorry."
The actual specifics of the new policy will be worked out later, university officials said.
Eramo said there had been 38 reports of sexual assault last year.
Jackie and other victims of assault at the school said Eramo helped them tremendously as they dealt with what happened to them.
Another victim who spoke to CNN, Lyra Bartell, said that Eramo has "the hardest job at UVA" and said the problems highlighted by Rolling Stone are more about the policy than about a person.
"Not our reputation, not our success, and not our history or tradition."
