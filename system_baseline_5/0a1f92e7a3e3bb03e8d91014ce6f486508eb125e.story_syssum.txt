Authorities said the boy was found unconscious and unresponsive on the floor of the bathroom at The Ritz Plaza, a luxury high-rise in the Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan.
In a statement last week, King's attorney, Bryan Konoski, said: "My client is not charged with homicide at this time and she is presumed to be innocent of allegations against her.
"We're trying to get this child buried with dignity and respect," said Tony Herbert, a spokesman for Dobson.
King told police that Myls' father dropped the child off for her to watch on December 17 and that she was the "child's primary and sole caretaker" until the time of his death, the complaint said.
No.
David Bookstaver, a family court spokesman, said Wednesday that the mother's financial straits or stay at a shelter had nothing to do with her losing custody of the child.
Dobson told police that Myls later fell down stairs and struck his head.
Philip Lights, Dobson's lawyer, said the case was later dismissed after his client agreed to counseling and treatment under the supervision of child welfare authorities.
King, the baby-sitter, told police that on December 29 she removed a hot rack from an oven with a glove and allegedly placed it against the boy's right leg, leaving linear burn marks, the complaint said.
King told authorities that the boy was "being very difficult eating and that the last full meal he ate was on December 26, 2013; after that he would only pick at his food," the complaint said.
After arriving at King's home on December 17, the complaint said, Myls Dobson lost 20 to 25 pounds.
"Each one of these tragedies, it's our job to try to stop," he said.
