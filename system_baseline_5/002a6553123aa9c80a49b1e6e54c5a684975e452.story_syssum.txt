Following a lengthy trial, he and his former interior minister, Habib al-Adly, were found guilty and sentenced to life in prison last year on charges that they were complicit in the protesters' killings.
Mubarak and the other defendants have pleaded not guilty to all charges.
Mubarak has been held since his guilty verdict last year.
He also faces a corruption charge that was not part of the original trial.
