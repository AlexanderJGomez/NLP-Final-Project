Washington (CNN) -- On the walls of Barbara Mikulski's Capitol hideaway are some of her most prized possessions -- portraits taken every two years of all the women in the Senate.
Mikulski remarks that there are more women in that photograph than had served in the Senate in all of American history when she arrived some three decades ago.
Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Republicans Olympia Snowe of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joined Mikulski to sit at a table that came from her childhood home and explained how hard the women of the Senate work to maintain a lost dynamic in Congress these days: comity.
Murkowski said when her husband sees one of the Senate women dinners on the calendar, he knows it's non-negotiable.
Gillibrand recalled getting tremendous help from Snowe and Murkowski on the 9/11 first responders legislation.
It's almost instinctive," Snowe said, turning to Gillibrand, "I can remember the conversations that we had.
Murkowski offered another explanation for what makes Senate women different from the men: ego.
And I think that the listening part of it is an important part of how we get the results," Murkowski said.
"I think that my party is in an unfortunate place right now as viewed by many women in this country who are feeling very anxious about what they believe to be attacks on women's health," she said.
"If anything, these women have more demands upon them," said Mikulski, who notes Gillibrand has two young sons and Murkowski is the mother of teenagers.
"I won't always be here, but I hope the legacy of civility, that I've worked with the other women to create will remain," she said.
