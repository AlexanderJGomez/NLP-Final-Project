I was walking home from the library carrying nine books.
I can't know for sure if it was exactly nine books.
I don't remember exactly when I started to hear my mother's screams.
I'm not sure if I knew the cop.
The cop put me in the squad car.
I remember that.
I'll never forget the movie, Bataan, starring Robert Taylor as Sergeant Bill Dane.
They're cut down one by one until only Sergeant Dane and two others remain.
I don't remember what it was like when I got home that day.
I'd been so close to my father -- yet I refused to go.
I never went back to that library again, and from that day on I was nervous if I saw a squad car in my neighborhood.
