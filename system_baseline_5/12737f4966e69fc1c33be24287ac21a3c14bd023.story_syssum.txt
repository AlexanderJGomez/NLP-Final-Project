"Mohamed told me and his brother that ISIS took him," according to Said Musallam, his father.
The man they knew as a kind and funny brother and son who was once a volunteer firefighter had grown a long beard and was carrying a rifle.
About a month ago, Said Musallam said, he was told his son was taken by ISIS when he was on his way back and trying to cross the border.
Ahmad Musallam said he'd seen the video of his brother and was devastated by his death.
In the ISIS video, Musallam seems to be reading what appears to be a prepared confession, saying he is an Israeli intelligence agent working for Mossad, sent to infiltrate ISIS.
Musallam's family members said they believe he was coerced in the video, forced to lie about ties to Israeli intelligence.
An ISIS propaganda video released in January -- one that CNN could not independently verify -- shows a boy with a pistol apparently shooting two men in the back of the head.
