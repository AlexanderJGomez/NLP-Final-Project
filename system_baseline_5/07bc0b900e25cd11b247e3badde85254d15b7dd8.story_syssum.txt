(CNN) -- Wildlife officials in Colorado say they have killed a bear believed to have been involved in an attack on a teenage boy Friday morning.
The bear entered a tent occupied by a teenage boy and at least one other person early Friday.
Wildlife officials who responded to the scene determined that the black bear had been poking around the campsite before it attacked the teenage boy.
If he didn't run for help ... luckily the bear chased him.
Earlier this month, a man was killed in a grizzly bear attack in Wyoming's Yellowstone Park.
