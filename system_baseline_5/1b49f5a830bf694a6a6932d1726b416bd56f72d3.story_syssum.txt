London, England (CNN) -- Whether in the form of personal history or political biography, Jung Chang has spent her writerly life telling the story of China's tumultuous recent past.
CNN caught up with Chang, who currently lives in London, and asked her about China and why it's so important to remember the past.
Why is it so important to tell this story?
CNN: Your books are banned in China.
JC: I feel frustrated and very unhappy of course.
Hong Kong is still largely separate from mainland China, which is wonderful from my point of view as a writer.
People are under the impression that China is what it is today because Mao had laid the foundation.
Of course, having said all that, there are still many things that frustrate me.
JC: If there isn't anything dramatic happening, I think the country will probably go on as it is for a very long time.
China -- as a culture, as a people -- is something that I care about.
I guess I miss the whole place, the people who have been through so much and the country, which is so old and yet so young and energetic.
