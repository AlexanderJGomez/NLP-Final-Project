(CNN) -- A blustery nor'easter that made travel throughout the Northeast absolutely miserable Tuesday is going to stick around for a few more days.
Heavy rain tapered off Tuesday evening, but some areas were still flooded, the New York office of the National Weather Service said.
"We are proactively deploying as many resources as necessary to assist communities in the storm's path to prepare for and manage whatever Mother Nature brings."
I'm actually trying to get home so I don't know how I'm going to get over there, I'm going to have to walk through it again," Sean O'Malley told WCBS of his trek through the water-logged streets of Sea Bright, New Jersey, on the Atlantic Ocean shore.
Some areas could get up to 12 inches of snow by Thursday.
The highest elevations of northern California might get 10 inches of rain, forecasters said.
