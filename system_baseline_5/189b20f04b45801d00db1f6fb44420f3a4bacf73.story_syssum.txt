"I already feel like I spend too much time online.
But many of my closest friends are on the East Coast or in Europe, so by the time I get my kids in bed, it's too late to call.
Online conversation can be a great boon to your friendships, but only if you organize your online socializing around the kinds of relationships -- and that specific people -- that matter to you.
You wouldn't hang out at the latest trendy bar if your friends were still gathering at the neighborhood pub; don't get caught up in the race to join the latest hip network if it takes you away from the online communities that engage your dearest friends.
If you focus your online and phone time on a couple of close friendships, you'll have more meaningful conversations than you can sustain with a large circle.
Make that "friends," not friends.
Ironically, this contributed to our decision to stay put: Once we focused our time and attention on the people we saw as lifelong friends, our social life became much more meaningful and satisfying.
As we compared notes on our jobs, kids and sex lives (like I said, close friends), I found myself looking wistfully at the table next to hours, where four women made up a "Sex and the City" quartet huddled in an intimate conversation.
It's Saturday night, and as my husband and I banter across Twitter, we're joined online by friends who weigh in on our latest debate and tease us for our geekiness.
Maybe you'd like to spend more time with your BFF, but your husband finds her husband dead boring.
