Moscow (CNN) -- Russian authorities said Friday they have decided to move Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, a jailed member of the Russian punk rock collective Pussy Riot, to a different prison.
But on September 23, she declared the conditions at the prison camp to be intolerable and began a hunger strike.
Verzilov warned then that Tolokonnikova would resume her hunger strike if she was sent back to Penal Colony No.
Maria Alyokhina, another convicted member of Pussy Riot, went on a hunger strike earlier this year, protesting conditions in a different remote prison camp.
