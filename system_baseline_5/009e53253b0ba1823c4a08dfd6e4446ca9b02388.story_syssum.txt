The most recent ISIS propaganda video was produced in English for a reason.
Why?
ISIS then beheaded a British journalist, so the British stepped up its military support in the campaign against ISIS.
Yes, the violent terrorism of ISIS is medieval and inhumane.
Why would ISIS goad the world to attack it?
But right now, we are the dog being wagged by the tail of ISIS.
The leadership of ISIS may do abhorrent things because of a crazy adherence to an apocalyptic interpretation of Islam, as Graeme Wood has just written in The Atlantic.
Recruits are flocking to ISIS.
We have to stop responding with bombs every time they provoke us with videotaped slayings.
