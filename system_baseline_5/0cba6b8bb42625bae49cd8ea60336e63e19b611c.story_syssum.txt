But for a little more than $100 a month, Hong Kong resident Ken Chan can develop his start-up, network with like-minded people and relax with a game of ping-pong -- all under the same roof.
"Coming here, you can feel supported by other people working on their businesses and feel less alone," said Chan, who goes to the co-working space CoCoon, where he works on his Internet start-up, wholedaybuy.com.
"It's only becoming acceptable to take the risk of starting tech start-ups or being a freelancer," says Constant Tedder, the British founder of The Hive in Hong Kong, a co-working space that opened in May.
"There's definitely this emerging segment of people who don't want to project a corporate image, but they want a comfortable space to work," he says.
"We think Hong Kong can use another place to foster entrepreneurs, and we hope talent can collaborate amongst themselves," says Erica Ma, one of CoCoon's founders.
Yet people working on Internet start-ups do not get much support, as the field is still seen as unconventional in Hong Kong.
