And the National Rifle Association said it will file suit to stop the move.
The rule, he said, "will improve the ability of the (ATF) to detect and disrupt the illegal weapons transfers" from gun buyers in the U.S. to drug traffickers in Mexico and along the border.
"This (Fast and Furious) has become a full-blown scandal, and I think they're trying to change the subject from Fast and Furious to something else," said NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre.
LaPierre said the NRA would file suit as soon as the ATF delivers the first "demand letter" requiring a licensee to report the sale of a long gun.
But critics said the administration moved forward with the proposal to re-frame the "Fast and Furious" debate.
Cummings issued a report last month that recommended ATF collect reports of multiple long gun sales.
