WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Pirates off the eastern coast of Africa fired on U.S. sailors Saturday as they tried to reach the lifeboat where an American captain is being held, a U.S. official familiar with the situation told CNN.
"For security reasons, the vessel will berth in a restricted area of the port and will not be accessible to the media.
The crew will not be available to the media in Mombasa," Maersk Ltd. said.
That's kind of the way it is in these communities.
Earlier Saturday, pirates sailing a hijacked German cargo ship returned to port after failing to reach the area of the standoff with the Bainbridge, a local journalist told CNN.
The pirate crew had intended to help the pirates holding Phillips but turned back because of the U.S. naval presence, the journalist said.
They are using hijacked vessels and skiffs launched from larger ships, the official said.
For the U.S. Navy, bringing in more firepower is more than just a means to resolve a hostage situation, said Chris Lawrence, CNN's Pentagon correspondent.
"Well, we got the international news stories on television on the ship and everybody's concerned about the route that we were on because there was always the possibility that we would be approached by pirates," one male passenger said.
