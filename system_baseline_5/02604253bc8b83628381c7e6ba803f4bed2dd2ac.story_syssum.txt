(CNN) -- Millions of people are expected to go to Washington to celebrate Barack Obama's inauguration on January 20, but with a troubled economy and pocketbook issues on the mind, the president-elect must be careful to set the right tone.
There is no law restricting the size of donations, but in the past, inaugural committees  have set contribution limits as high as $250,000.
Watchdog groups say there are some things Obama can do to take control of the tone.
As inauguration organizers work to keep the tone in check, they are speaking out against those trying to make money by scalping tickets to the event.
Organizers of the inauguration say it violates the spirit of the event and could spell disappointment for people who buy tickets for the ceremony.
