Republican House Speaker John Boehner informed President Barack Obama that he would not bring a vote on immigration reform to the floor this year.
Republicans had a year to either bring the Senate immigration bill to the House floor, or come up with an approach of their own that would deal with the different moving pieces necessary to fix our broken immigration system.
A week later Republicans said they couldn't move on immigration reform because they couldn't trust the President to enforce the law.
And then there's the biggest excuse of all: border security first.
Republicans have used every excuse in the book to block a bill that would have actually addressed their biggest priorities when it comes to immigration reform -- border security, enforcement, employment verification, high tech visas etc.
No more.
The President proved that he's willing to go to bat for immigration reform.
Mr. President, America is behind you on this every step of the way.
