(CNN) -- A 93rd minute Thiago Silva goal salvaged a late draw for AC Milan as they held Barcelona in their opening European Champions League Group H match on Tuesday.
And when David Villa scored with a brilliant second half free kick, it looked like Barcelona would start their defense of the crown with an impressive win against one of the strongest teams in European football.
The result of the night, however, came from Cyprus where Apoel Nicosia came from a goal down against Russian champions Zenit St Petersburg with under 20 minutes left to win 2-1 in Group G.
In Group F Didier Deschamps' Marseilles got their Champions League challenge off to the best possible start against Greek side Olympiakos.
