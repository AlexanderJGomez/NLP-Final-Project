(CNN) -- The fight to block construction of the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline through east Texas stepped up Monday as protesters locked themselves to machinery.
All of the blockade protesters were removed from the construction sites by 2 p.m. and 12 of them were arrested, he said.
"Today's Day of Action is in solidarity with local landowners struggling to protect their water and land from TransCanada's toxic tar sands pipeline," the protest group said in a written statement Monday.
