Kennedy Space Center, Florida (CNN) -- NASA launched its Ares I-X rocket Wednesday, after multiple delays over two days because of bad weather.
It was the first flight test for the Constellation Program, NASA's next-generation spacecraft and launch vehicle system.
As the clock ticked toward noon, NASA officials nervously awaited all-clears for technical items and a weather clearance from weather officer Kathy Winters who, time and again, said conditions were "red," meaning a no-go.
If static surrounds the rocket, it can interfere with radio signals sent by or to the rocket.
Part of the test rocket mission is for scientists to try out three massive main parachutes, measuring 150 feet in diameter and weighing one ton each -- the largest rocket parachutes ever manufactured.
The top of the rocket, known as the upper stage, includes a mock Orion crew capsule and a launch abort system.
