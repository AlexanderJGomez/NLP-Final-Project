But the 31-year-old is back with a bang, having terrorized Sri Lanka's batsmen to help the home side clinch a 2-0 series win in Melbourne on Friday.
"The plan through this Test match was to get up their batters and unfortunately for them they got a few injuries out of it," said Johnson, who passed the milestone of 200 wickets in his 49th Test.
It marked a minor career resurrection for Johnson, who was Australia's main strike bowler until his form fell apart during the 2010-11 Ashes series against England.
"I've always been happy playing for Australia, it just got to the point where I was feeling the pressure.
I'm 31, I've been around the game for a long time now and I think I've matured in that I have belief in myself and just go out there and play my game and do the best job I can."
I think Birdy played a huge part in Mitch's success in the first innings, and it allows a bowler like Mitch to be able to attack."
It is the first bilateral series between the neighboring countries in five years.
The three-match one-day series will start on Sunday.
