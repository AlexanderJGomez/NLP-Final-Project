There will be quick-fire Spanish, varying degrees of English and jokes in the way I've only ever heard my Cuban relatives parry back and forth.
I'm flying not to Havana but to Miami, where my grandparents and other relatives came years after Fidel Castro took over Cuba, when it became clear there would be no free speech for anyone but him.
I have never seen that apartment.
Every bit of Cuba I get is gleaned from pictures, music, stories people tell me and these trips to see Miami family, where I get hints of my ancestry in the food and jokes and presents.
I've never seen the sleepy, agricultural town of Pinar del Rio where my mother was born and lived until her teenage years.
Around midday on Christmas Eve some of us will head to El Palacio de Los Jugos for lunch and Cuban sandwiches.
But we will be fine.
To Miami, not to Cuba.
I don't want to hear any more stereotypes about who my people are or tourists talking about going to visit Cuba "before it changes."
I want to put those hints together, fill in the gaps and see for the first time, where I am from.
