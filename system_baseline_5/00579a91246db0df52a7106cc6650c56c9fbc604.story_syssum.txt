Police were hunting for Ryan Alexander Jenkins after the death of Jasmine Fiore.
Earlier Sunday, Canadian authorities said they had credible information that Jenkins was in Canada and called on him to turn himself in.
The nude body of Jenkins' wife, former swimsuit model Jasmine Fiore, was found last weekend in Orange County, California.
Jenkins reported Fiore missing last Saturday night to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, authorities said.
And in 2007, Jenkins pleaded guilty in Calgary, Alberta, Canada to assault in a separate case.
51 Minds is investigating what went wrong and taking steps to ensure that this sort of lapse never occurs again."
