(CNN) -- Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wants a mandate.
Abe put economic rejuvenation at the top of his policy agenda, seeking to end two-plus "lost decades" to both consolidate political support and, perhaps even more significantly, to provide the foundation for a more robust international role.
For the vast majority of Japanese voters, support for the LDP stemmed from the prospect of economic revival, and they were prepared to swallow parts of Abe's security agenda if that was part of the package.
The economic woes mean Abe can't buy support for the rest of his agenda; in fact, public complaints about the Abe administration are increasing.
Why?
Not surprisingly, support for the DPJ, still the largest opposition party, today hovers around 10%; 37% of voters say they will back the LDP in this month's vote.
The LDP is such a party.
They also fear that Abe will instead focus on foreign policy and press the more controversial elements of his national security agenda.
If he does, the Prime Minister will simply end up undermining whatever mandate he will claim after this week's ballot.
