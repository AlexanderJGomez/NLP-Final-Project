(CNN) -- Sports superstar Roger Federer has organized a charity event to raise funds for the victims of the Haiti earthquake, as the tennis world rallies to contribute to the cause.
I know it's on the eve of the first Grand Slam of the season, so for some it's not so easy maybe mentally to separate a few things -- but I think it's a great initiative.
Meanwhile, Marcos Baghdatis, who lost to Federer in the final of the 2006 Australian Open, has donated $5,000 of his prize money for winning the Sydney International tournament on Saturday to the World Vision Australia Haiti Earthquake Appeal.
"I don't think we can fully comprehend the devastation of the earthquake over in Haiti, and we just want to do our part in helping everyone who is suffering during this difficult time," Nestor told www.atpworldtour.com.
What happened there makes us realize how lucky we are," said Isner, who defeated France's Arnaud Clement 6-3 5-7 7-6 (7-2) in the final of the Heineken Open on Saturday to claim his first ATP Tour title.
