Relief groups and state agencies are registering volunteers to help with recovery efforts in storm-damaged areas in the days and weeks to come.
The organization is preliminarily registering volunteers and will be organizing disaster recovery projects after the storm passes.
Samaritan's Purse will be organizing teams to help with debris clean up throughout the East Coast.
Red Cross volunteers have been dispatched from across the country to help the East Coast.
In all emergency and disaster situations, volunteers should not self-deploy -- for their own safety and the safety of others.
