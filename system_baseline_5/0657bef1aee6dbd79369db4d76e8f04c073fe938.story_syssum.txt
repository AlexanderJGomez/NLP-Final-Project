But is the Uber story really as good as it seems?
In contrast, Uber has embraced a take-it-or-leave-it approach that may be tough for consumers to swallow over the long haul.
According to its Terms & Conditions agreement, Uber is not a transportation service.
The car drivers are Uber's actual customers.
Surprisingly, Uber does not claim to "assess the suitability, legality or ability" of any third party providing services procured through Uber, and UberX drivers may not be professionally licensed or permitted.
I am sure there are fellow riders who, like me, take issue with the company not disclosing their passenger rating in the Terms & Conditions or privacy policy for the app.
In addition to the security of corporate data, there is the issue of whether individual drivers have access to personal passenger information and how Uber protects riders from unauthorized breaches.
Consumers both love and fear disruptive companies like Uber.
For Uber to get the value of its disruption, in the form of consumer goodwill, people will need to know why Uber-instigated changes in the taxi industry are good, not bad.
Explain to the entire ecosystem of drivers, riders, regulators, regulated, investors and employees the value and benefit of the turmoil Uber brings when it rolls out in new markets.
I happen to love Uber.
It must bring context to the chaos it creates and be known as a positive force for change that always acts on behalf of its consumers, not its business model.
