How do you stand out as loyal to the people you are leading?
When you practice this kind of self discipline regularly, you'll naturally stand out from the pack -- because most people avoid the hard stuff.
Self discipline doesn't have to be hard -- you just have to change the way you think about it.
The next time you feel yourself putting something off because you're afraid -- of uncertainty or failure -- just "do it scared."
Until one fireman said: "that's OK, just do it scared."
It's fine to be scared -- do it scared.
And by just doing something, you create movement and momentum that will lead to progress and results.
The best way to overcome this impulse is to put your self esteem into stellar work habits instead of results.
The difference between those who stand out in the careers and those who blend in lies in what you do when you reach these critical turning points.
Stop fixating on the here and now, and think about the big picture.
Having this perspective and faith will help you press forward at the moments when others turn back.
