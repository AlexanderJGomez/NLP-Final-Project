(CNN) -- For Thomas Tugend, there was no doubt which side he was fighting for as a young infantryman in Europe in World War II.
That the Tugend family was successful, educated and loyal Germans no longer meant anything.
As a result, the Tugend family was forced to move from their comfortable home to a poorer part of the city.
"He told my mother to forget the furniture and pack up what she could and get out," Tugend said.
"The reason so many German Jews didn't leave when they had the chance was because they couldn't believe what was happening," Tugend said.
"I couldn't wait to get away from home," he said.
"Even then I knew the historical significance of the war and I wanted to be a part of it," he said.
Once the Army found out Tugend spoke fluent German, his commanders created a new job for him.
"Every town and village I went to," Tugend said, "I would be told, 'No, I'm not a Nazi.
"You have to understand, the average German may have known what the Nazis were up to, but I think most of them were just trying to survive," he said.
Tugend left the Army soon after the war's end, but he wasn't finished fighting.
After all these years, Tugend is philosophical about his family's escape from certain death at the hands of the Nazis, and his time as an infantryman at war.
