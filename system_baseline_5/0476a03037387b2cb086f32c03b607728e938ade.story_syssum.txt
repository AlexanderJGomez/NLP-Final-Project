Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has denied allegations that she failed to heed warnings of possible corruption in a rice subsidy program whose recent problems have stoked anger among farmers in the country's rural heartland.
Yingluck insists that the rice subsidy program, introduced in 2011, has been successful and benefited farmers.
The situation has left Yingluck's weakened caretaker government struggling to operate effectively and ensure payments are made to rice farmers.
The farmers said their planned protest wasn't political -- unlike the anti-government demonstrators in central Bangkok, they say they don't want to see the ouster of Yingluck.
The protest leaders say they want to rid the country of Yingluck and her wealthy brother, the deposed former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.
The protesters say they want Yingluck's government replaced by an unelected "people's council," which would oversee electoral and political changes.
