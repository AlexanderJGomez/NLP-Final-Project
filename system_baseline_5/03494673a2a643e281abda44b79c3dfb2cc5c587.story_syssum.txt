"Syria as a civilization is unraveling, with as many as half of its citizens in need of urgent help as a result of this savage conflict," said Antonio Guterres, the world body's high commissioner for refugees, who announced the goal in Geneva.
The announcement came as the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs predicted that 3.45 million inside Syria could have crossed its borders by the end of the year and another 6.8 million people remaining inside Syria will need aid.
At least 52 people -- including three women and four children and one under torture -- were killed Friday nationwide, the rebel Local Coordination Committees of Syria said.
On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow was prepared to replace them, Russia's Itar-Tass news agency reported.
U.N. spokeswoman Josephine Guerrero said Filipino and Indian peacekeepers will remain in the region to enforce the peace deal between Israel and Syria reached in 1974, nearly seven years after Israel first captured Quneitra in the Six-Day War.
