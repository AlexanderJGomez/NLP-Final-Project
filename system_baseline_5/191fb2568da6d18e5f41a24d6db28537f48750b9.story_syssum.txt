Or compromised electrical wiring.
We know the Boston Marathon is seen around the world.
And we do not need the president to say the word to feel the word.
But then again, is our paranoia that irrational if something as celebratory as the Boston Marathon is no longer a safe place to be?
We will never, ever be safe again.
"Justice" won't take us back to September 10, 2001 ... back before the word "terrorism" was on the tip of every American's tongue.
If April 15, 2013, was the day the Boston Marathon became a target for terrorism, then September 11, 2001, was the day we all were warned that it would be.
Nothing will be the same.
