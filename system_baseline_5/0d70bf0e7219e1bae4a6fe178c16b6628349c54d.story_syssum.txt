Low-wage workers have been the hardest hit since the onset of the financial crisis, and low-wage jobs remain a fixture of the new economy.
Congress should help low-wage workers gain access to predictable work schedules.
America's major fast-food chains, retailers and department stores use "just-in-time" scheduling to maximize profit, which in turn creates unstable and stressful work environments for low-wage workers.
A University of Chicago study found that 41% of early career hourly workers and 47% who work part-time received a week or less of notice of their work schedules.
Similarly, a large proportion of minorities work low-wage jobs.
Traditional economic safeguards have offered little help to these workers.
Real solutions exist.
Last summer, The Schedules that Work Act was introduced in Congress.
According to the National Women's Law Center, the bill would provide workers the right to request and receive predictable work schedules, receive compensation for sudden scheduling changes, and not fear retaliation if they request scheduling accommodations from their boss.
The bill protects families and allows them to attend to their many obligations, not just work.
It's the Arby's line cook in Fort Worth who needs reliable shifts to make her dialysis treatments.
They can start by passing legislation that better protects shift workers from arbitrary and unpredictable scheduling practices.
