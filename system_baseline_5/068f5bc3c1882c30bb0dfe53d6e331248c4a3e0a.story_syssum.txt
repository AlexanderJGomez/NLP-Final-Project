Paul Embleton's BRAVE Foundation has trained more than 1,000 volunteer firefighters in Guatemala.
[Firefighters] would respond to these calls, grab the patients from the streets and throw them in the back of the pickup truck.
Embleton launched the BRAVE Foundation -- Bomberos Resourceful And Valiant Efforts -- to provide emergency response training and equipment to volunteer firefighters (bomberos) in Guatemala.
"I'd gone back to my hotel to try to think how I was going to teach with the same limited resources they had," Embleton said.

"Things have improved drastically since our program began," said Embleton.
We're educating the people that the firefighters are here to help."
"The firefighters have the motivation, and you get a heart for it because you see how well we have it in the States," Embleton said.
Despite his personal sacrifice, Embleton is quick to share credit for BRAVE's efforts and success, citing the help of volunteers, private donors, firefighters, Rotary and the Guatemala community.
