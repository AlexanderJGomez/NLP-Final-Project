Reilly also said the drama will address Cory Monteith's death in the third episode, during which Fox will air public service announcements about substance abuse.
Reilly could not say how show creator Ryan Murphy will deal with the character's passing since the script has yet to be completed.
He was open about his addiction in the past, just not as open about it in the present.
Reilly also said proceeds from the music sold from the episode will go to Monteith's family.
