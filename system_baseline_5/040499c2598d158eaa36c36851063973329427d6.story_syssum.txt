Medalist Sarah Hughes says the Games are about excellence and unity.
Obama's visit to Copenhagen will make him the first U.S. president to attend an Olympic host-city vote.
His visit will not be the first by a president (or prime minister) whose country went on to win a bid for the Games.
It is easy to come to the conclusion that I might be biased, having won a gold medal in figure skating at the 2002 Salt Lake City Games, but I was an American and a fan long before those Games, and I will be one long after.
They are about greatness, they are about excellence, but above all, the Games are about unity.
