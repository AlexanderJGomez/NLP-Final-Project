Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Rebels marched toward Tripoli Wednesday, capturing a town southwest of the capital from Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's forces, a rebel fighter told CNN.
The rebels captured the town around 2:30 p.m., entering from all three fronts, some having captured vehicles belonging to Gadhafi forces.
Rebels, whose casualties included at least seven dead and 15 wounded, said their next target would be Al Assabiah, said Adams.
The rebels said they were moving northward, closer to the capital on the Mediterranean Sea.
Also Wednesday, NATO said its air forces targeted military re-fueling equipment in the Brega area southwest of the rebel stronghold of Benghazi.
