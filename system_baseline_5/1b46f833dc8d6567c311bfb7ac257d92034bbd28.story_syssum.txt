The Olympic and Paralympic sprinter is facing a maximum five-year prison sentence after he was found guilty of the negligent killing of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on February 14, 2013.
Born with a congenital abnormality, Pistorius, 27, had both his legs amputated below the knee before his first birthday, but through sheer determination carved out a career in world-class athletics.
While he failed to win a medal, Pistorius' presence on the track was hailed as a triumph over adversity and a victory over critics who claimed his blades gave him an unfair advantage over the able-bodied.
Was Pistorius violent?
In an exclusive interview last summer, Arnold Pistorius said his nephew was heartbroken.
It was known that Pistorius owned guns.
And that's the mentality that I've had," Pistorius told CNN in late 2012.
He said the 20 months since Steenkamp's death had been harrowing for both families and Pistorius -- and had left everyone emotionally drained and exhausted.
Her father Barry Steenkamp told the Afrikaans-language newspaper Beeld: "It doesn't matter how rich [Pistorius] is ... and how good his legal team is.
Another, Samuel Motau, described Pistorius as "a very generous man."
In 2004, Pistorius took his first gold at the Athens Paralympics and one year later competed against able-bodied Olympics for the first time, at the South African Championships.
During the very last track event of the Paralympics, Pistorius again picked himself up and smashed the 400-meter T44 Paralympic record in a time of 46.68 to take gold.
When asked about his thoughts on being a role model, Pistorius told CNN before the shooting: "I think it's a massive blessing.
Pistorius has more than 300,000 followers on Twitter, tens of thousands of whom added in the days since his arrest last year.
