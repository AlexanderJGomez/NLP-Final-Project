When Beckham announced his decision to retire from football Thursday, there was one man who had already anticipated such an event.
"The impression from the very first time we met was that he was a devoted dad," Clement told CNN.
"That's the sacrifice I have to make as a father and as a husband: being away from my family," Beckham said.
"The kids have moved across the world and I think he wanted them to have some stability," added Clement.
"It was great to have him around and talk, but I've got my family here and that's been so good for me.
"For me, it was great that he was there just after Nick died because that was an awful time.
"It was great to have him around.
But he might have been a bit-part player next season or had to move to another club and I think he wanted to go out at the very top.
While Beckham will curtail his time in Paris at the end of the season, Clement hopes to remain to continue his work alongside manager Carlo Ancelotti.
"But it's more important to work with good people."
