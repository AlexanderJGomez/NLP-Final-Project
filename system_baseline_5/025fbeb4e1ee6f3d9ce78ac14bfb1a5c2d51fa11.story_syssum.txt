Lameck Chiso, 29, said he was stopped at a police checkpoint on his way from work in the diamond fields.
"Three men in army uniform jumped into my car and asked me to drive them back to the mining area," Chiso said.
The money from blood diamonds can end up funding rebel violence, the Kimberley Process group said.
Separately, Human Rights Watch has accused the armed forces of funneling money from the fields into ZANU-PF, President Robert Mugabe's party.
"The money will not be handled by any party but by the Treasury," he said.
