And so it is.
To begin with, Marathon Monday is a holiday â€” Patriots Day, an annual commemoration of the Battles of Lexington and Concord.
To complete the celebration, Patriots Day marks the annual 11 a.m. Red Sox game at Fenway Park, an utterly local tradition concocted so baseball crowds wouldn't get in the way of marathon crowds.
As a spectator sport, the Boston Marathon probably hit its peak in the 1970s, when local favorites Bill Rodgers and Joan Benoit Samuelson were dominating the race.
As the terrible news began to spread, my Facebook feed was filled with messages from people I know telling me they were all right, or asking if someone else had been heard from.
Sadly, the marathon will not be the same after today.
And we are.
