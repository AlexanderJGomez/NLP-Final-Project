(CNN)A leader of pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region said Friday he is not interested in a truce with the Ukrainian government in Kiev because his troops are on the offensive.
"There will be no attempts from our side to talk about the ceasefire," he said, reported Russian state news agency RIA.
Despite the talks in Berlin, violence in the breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine shows no signs of abating.
On Wednesday, for instance, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said that "more than 9,000 Russian troops (crossed) our Russian-Ukrainian border, bring with them hundreds and hundreds of tanks, armed personnel carriers, and killing Ukrainian civilians and attacking Ukrainian troops."
"As to the flow of troops and armaments, this is not the first time we hear something like that," he said.
At least 262 people were killed in the fighting from January 13 through Wednesday alone, the report said.
Then in April, violence broke out in two Ukrainian regions that border Russia -- Donetsk and Luhansk -- as separatist leaders declared independence from the government in Kiev.
