(CNN)  -- E. Lynn Harris, the author who introduced millions of readers to the "invisible life" of black gay men, was a literary pioneer whose generosity was as huge as his courage, friends said Friday.
Though Harris wrote primarily about black gay men, some of his biggest fans were black women.
"It was hard to go on a subway in places in New York or D.C. and not see some black woman reading an E. Lynn Harris novel," Boykin said.
Tina McElroy Ansa, author of "Taking After Mudear," met Harris at the beginning of his literary career when he was selling his first book "Invisible Life."
In 2000, Harris told the magazine Entertainment Weekly how important "Invisible Life" was for him.
Harris was as generous with his fans as he was with his friends, some said.
She said Harris had been a cheerleader in college "and a spirit of joy followed him through his life."
He was born in Flint, Michigan, and grew up in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Boykin said Harris received most of his criticism not from outraged straight critics, but people within the black community.
In a 2003 Detroit Free Press interview, Harris said he resisted becoming an advocate for gay rights.
Harris took a little of that pain away with his life and his books.
