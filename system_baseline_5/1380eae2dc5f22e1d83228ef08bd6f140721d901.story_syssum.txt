Until last week, the White House had said final decision on the pipeline would be up to the State Department, following an environmental impact analysis and a public commenting period.
Those gathered Sunday afternoon in Washington -- from as far north as Maine, as far south as Florida and as far west as Nebraska, said organizers -- hoped public pressure would persuade the president.
"I'm hoping to God that the president, or whatever higher power, will use rational sense and understand that people don't want this," Willa Tharnish, a senior and environmental studies major at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, said of the project.
Michael Brune, the Sierra Club's executive director, said from the rally that he felt the activist push against the pipeline is surging.
"Folks in Nebraska, like folks all across the country, aren't going to say to themselves, 'We're going to take a few thousand jobs if it means our kids are potentially drinking water that would damage their health,'" Obama said.
"There's a way of doing that and making sure the health and safety of the people of Nebraska are protected," he said.
