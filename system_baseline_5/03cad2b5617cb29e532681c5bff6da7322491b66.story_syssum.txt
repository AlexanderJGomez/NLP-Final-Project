New York (CNN) -- A former Army sergeant is facing conspiracy charges in a federal sting operation that focused on a team he allegedly supervised in what the team thought was international drug trafficking and planned killings, according to the U.S. attorney in Manhattan.
The story as spelled out in a federal indictment starts in early 2012 when Hunter believed he had made contact with Colombian drug traffickers.
The men Hunter thought were Colombian traffickers "were in fact confidential sources for the DEA," according to the indictment.
There are references to talks among the alleged team members about "bonus work," which Hunter explained meant assassinations, the indictment said.
Bharara said at a news conference Friday that those two killings claimed by Hunter in his talks occurred outside the United States and "there is corroboration for the allegations in the indictment."
Hunter was arrested in Thailand and was expected to arrive in New York on Friday evening.
According to the indictment, Hunter served in the U.S. Army from 1983 to 2004, attaining the rank of sergeant first class.
