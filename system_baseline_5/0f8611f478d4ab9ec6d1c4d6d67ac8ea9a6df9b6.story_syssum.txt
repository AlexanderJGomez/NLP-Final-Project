It was a sad moment but, as a life-long patriot, he knew he had to resign as secretary of Veterans Affairs.
Unfortunately, the best person in the country to run the VA is the least available: Robert Gates.
He was not only superb at running the CIA but was then successful in running Texas A&M (the seventh-largest university in the country) and went on to serve with great distinction as secretary of defense, winding down two wars for Presidents Bush and Obama.
After Gates, the next best choice is likely to be his last deputy at DOD, Ashton Carter.
A smart White House would recruit some of the best among them and put them to work fixing the VA in some imaginative way -- possibly in full-time stints, possibly in consulting teams.
Start with Maura Sullivan, for example: Northwestern undergrad, Marine officer in Iraq, graduate of the Harvard Business School and Kennedy School, now rising in leadership ranks at PepsiCo and serving on a federal veterans advisory board.
Iraq and Afghanistan veterans have had too little voice in the VA.
