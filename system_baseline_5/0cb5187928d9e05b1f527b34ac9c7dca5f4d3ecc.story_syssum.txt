Many of the protesters taking part in the sit-in are voicing their anger over the disqualification of Islamist candidate Hazem Abu Ismael from the May 23 presidential election.
The election commission has disqualified some 10 of the 23 presidential contenders, its chief has said.
Egypt's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces said on its Facebook page Thursday that the clashes in Abaseya were aimed at delaying the presidential elections and stalling the formation of a constituent assembly.
A "revolutionary march" toward the Ministry of Defense has been called for Friday by the April 6 Movement, which wants accountability from the Supreme Council for the Armed Forces over the deaths of protesters in the Abaseya clashes.
"The right to peaceful freedom of expression and assembly is integral to Egypt's transition to democracy, and it is crucial at this stage of the presidential election process that it is not threatened by the return of such violence," he said in a statement.
Assailants targeted the protesters in Cairo early Wednesday, medical sources said.
A day before the clashes, state TV broadcast videos showing protesters chanting against the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which has ruled Egypt since Mubarak was forced from power last year.
"There were no riot police or military that tried to evict the sit-in by force," said Gen. Marwan Mustapha, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry.
Clashes have erupted in Egypt since an uprising led to the toppling of Mubarak in February of last year, with protesters demanding the military leaders who took over hand over power to a civilian administration.
