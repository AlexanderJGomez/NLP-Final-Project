(CNN) -- While Real Madrid signed Gareth Bale in the summer's highest-profile football transfer and added several other big names, Manchester United fans were left largely underwhelmed by the Premier League champion's moves in the off-season.
"It's been pretty disappointing," said Andy Green, a United supporter who tweets about football finances.
"You have all these commercial deals but it's no benefit to the football club."
United is "delighted to have David Moyes lead our football team into a new and exciting chapter," Woodward said.
