The Wot Rocket is waiting for confirmation from the World Sailing Speed Record Council to attempt, once again, an unprecedented technology known as "supercavitation" -- sailing just above the water in a gas bubble created by the deflection of water.
"Wot Rocket is so exciting as we push to sail up to three times the speed of the wind," Langman told CNN.
"But really I feel very safe doing anything on water as that what I've done my whole life.
Most said I'm a lunatic but one said 'I want to work with you'."
It's really about ideas versus science and trying to make it work," Langman explained.
