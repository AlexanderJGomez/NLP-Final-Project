Dr. Joseph Adelegan has pioneered new energy sources, including using cow waste to create cooking gas.
Three years ago Adelegan won plaudits for his "Cows to Kilowatts" project, which used effluents and waste products from abattoirs to produce cooking gas.
However, waste from cassava refining is a major public health problem in Nigeria, causing water pollution and emitting noxious greenhouse gases.
Using this method, Adelegan says he hopes to generate 200kw daily, which will provide basic electricity for more than 2000 households initially.
The scheme will cost $310,000 and will become profitable in little over three years, Adelegan says.
Enter Chewang Norphel, a softly-spoken but sprightly 72-year-old has created artificial glaciers and managed to generate water and greenery in this barren landscape.
So that local farmers get a real headstart when they need it most," Norphel says.
For Norphel, there are several advantages of an artificial glacier over a natural one.
Natural glaciers, on the other hand, are located way up in the mountains and they melt slowly in summer, releasing water to the villages quite late.
In 1996, one year after he had retired, Norphel joined the Leh Nutrition Project, a non-governmental organization, as project manager for watershed development.
