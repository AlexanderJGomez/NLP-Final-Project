WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Jordan's King Hussein sent a secret message to President Richard Nixon in 1970 pleading with him to attack Syria, according to declassified documents released Wednesday by the former president's library.
"We are declassifying the records today that laid the basis for Richard Nixon's decision in 1969 to accept the fact, a fact of life, that Israel had a bomb, a nuclear device," said Naftali.
"Even though it is clear from the documents that the United States government did not encourage Israel to acquire a nuclear deterrent, it became a fact of life," Naftali said.
"Syria had invaded Jordan and the Jordanian king, facing what he felt was a military rout, said please help us in any way possible."
The library has withheld the Nixon documents from public access until Wednesday and have been reviewed for release and/or declassified, Naftali said.
