Washington (CNN) -- What may be the most contentious Pentagon contract is the focus of yet another fight, with this round centered on whether a bid for a $35 billion contract should be thrown out because it arrived five minutes late.
US Aerospace said its bid arrived at Wright-Patterson half an hour before the deadline.
A spokesman for US Aerospace, Chuck Arnold, said the Defence Department "still feel[s] the cold war is on" and doesn't want US Aerospace to succeed in the bid.
Chuck Arnold, a spokesman for US Aerospace, said the bid proposal was on time.
US Aerospace is fighting that decision and asking that its bid proposal, which it said will save U.S. taxpayers millions of dollars and produce a better tanker plane, be considered.
Morrell said he is confident that the dispute with US Aerospace will not slow the process again.
