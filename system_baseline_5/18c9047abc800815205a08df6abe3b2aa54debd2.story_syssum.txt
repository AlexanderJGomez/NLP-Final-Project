Los Angeles (CNN) -- Octuplets mom Nadya Suleman faces welfare fraud charges as she's accused of not reporting money earned as a topless dancer and adult film actress.
An adult video featuring Suleman was released in June.
"I wouldn't even kiss somebody for money," Suleman told CNN's Nischelle Turner.
The criminal complaint, filed by Deputy District Attorney William Clark with the public assistance fraud division, said Suleman applied for public assistance in Lancaster, California, in January 2013.
Suleman faces up to five years, eight months in prison if convicted, the prosecutor said.
