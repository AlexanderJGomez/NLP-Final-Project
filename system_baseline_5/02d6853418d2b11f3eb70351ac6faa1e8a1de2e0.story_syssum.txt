Sollecito and Knox were convicted of Kercher's murder in 2009 but set free on appeal in 2011.
While maintaining his innocence, he says he does not clearly remember even if Knox spent the night with him.
Sollecito writes that at times, he was uncomfortable with Knox's "bizarre behavior," which he says prosecutors used against both of them.
Neither he nor Knox had solid alibis for the night of Kercher's murder, Sollecito writes.
They were intent on getting Sollecito to abandon Knox and accuse her of the murder, he wrote.
Mignini declined to comment about the book or the case until the high court appeal is completed.
Sollecito condemns his treatment by Perugia police who, he says, would not give him food or access to a lawyer during the questioning, even though it was clear to him that they were treating him as a suspect and not just a person informed of the facts of the case.
Guede is writing a book but does not have a publisher, according to his lawyers.
Knox's book is due to be released in the spring.
