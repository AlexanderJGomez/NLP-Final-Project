One of the most urgent is child farm labor.
A Human Rights Watch 2010 study shows that children laboring for hire on farms routinely work more than 10 hours per day.
Children 14 and older can work long hours at all but the most dangerous farm jobs without their parents' consent, if they do not miss school.
In 2011 Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis proposed more stringent agricultural labor rules for children under 16, but Obama scrapped them just eight months later.
It is the most dangerous for children, accounting for about half of child worker deaths annually.
Farm parents, their children, and the American Farm Bureau objected strenuously to the proposed new rules.
And until the economy stabilizes, the savings farms realize by hiring children makes it likely that even more of them will be subject to the dangers of farm work.
Unenforced rules won't protect the nearly million other children who work on farms.
Let's make sure it's not one our children have to die for.
