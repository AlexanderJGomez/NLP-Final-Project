Global health experts on Friday declared the Ebola epidemic ravaging West Africa an international health emergency that requires a coordinated global approach.
"A coordinated international response is deemed essential to stop and reverse the international spread of Ebola," WHO said.
"All our Ebola experts are mobilized, we simply cannot do more," Janseens said.
"The scope and scale of the epidemic ... now exceed the capacity and statutory responsibility of any one government agency or ministry," she said.
Washington said it's sending experts to Liberia, including 12 specialists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and a 13-member disaster assistance response team from the U.S. Agency for International Development.
They later progress to vomiting, diarrhea, impaired kidney and liver function -- and sometimes internal and external bleeding.
