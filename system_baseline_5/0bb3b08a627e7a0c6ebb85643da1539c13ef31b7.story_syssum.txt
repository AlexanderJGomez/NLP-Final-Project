The surprise was not so much that 18 million votes were cast for Rouhani, slightly more than half the ballots, but the fact that the regime had endorsed his victory, triggering hope that international pressure over Iran's nuclear program and growing internal rifts at home might have forced the leadership to restore some of its lost legitimacy.
During the campaign, he presented himself as a moderate, a platform that appeals to Iran's young electorate, and called for drawing Iran out of its international isolation.
The Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, along with his military loyalists, the Revolutionary Guards and its militia wing Basij -- the alliance that many believe stole the election in favor of the incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad -- still remain in ultimate power.
The Guards and the Basij campaigned vigorously for Saeed Jalili, a Khamenei loyalist and Iran's hard-line nuclear negotiator.
Voters recalled Rouhani as the county's pragmatist nuclear envoy who deterred threats in 2003 by signing the Additional Protocol, allowing inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency to visit Iran's nuclear facilities.
Further, Iran suspended its sensitive uranium enrichment activities, a process that can be used to make nuclear fuel or a nuclear bomb if uranium is enriched to high levels.
If Khamenei is willing to end international pressure over Iran's nuclear program, Rouhani provides the perfect opportunity.
