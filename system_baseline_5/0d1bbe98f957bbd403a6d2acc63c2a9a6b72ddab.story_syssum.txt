Blake Mycoskie started TOMS Shoes in 2006.
Mycoskie: The TOMS initiative is very simple: For every pair of shoes we sell, we give a pair away.
I started thinking, what if I started a business where every time I sold a pair of shoes, I would guarantee that customer that I would give another pair to someone who does not have shoes?
Mycoskie: I had absolutely no experience in shoes or fashion so I approached the business how I have done everything in my life, and that's with reckless ambition.
Mycoskie: I think the crowning moment was when Vogue magazine called and that was a few months after we started.
Mycoskie: A big part of our business that has changed over the past year is that now we also have a travel organization that takes volunteers all over the world on these trips and [they] get the experience of giving away the shoes.
Mycoskie: I can honestly say that TOMS is my future.
Mycoskie: The future of TOMS is really creating a whole new business model of this one-for-one giving and expanding the TOMS model from shoes into other products as well.
