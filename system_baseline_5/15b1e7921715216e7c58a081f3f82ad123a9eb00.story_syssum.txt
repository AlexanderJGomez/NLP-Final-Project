Saucedo grew up in El Paso and Ciudad Juarez across the border in Mexico, and says violence is now a normal part of life on the border.
I decided to use a pi√±ata because it's a way to identify with my culture," Saucedo said in a phone interview.
"They don't represent anyone in particular, just the violence in the border," Saucedo said.
El Paso Library spokesman Jack Galindo said the library had only one official complaint -- a man said he was "very offended" by the pieces.
I feel it's my responsibility as an artist to represent those feelings," said Saucedo.
Criminal groups have changed their strategy.
