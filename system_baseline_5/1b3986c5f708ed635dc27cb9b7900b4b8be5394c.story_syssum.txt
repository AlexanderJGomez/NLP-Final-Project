It can be exhausting nursing a child through a nasty bout with the flu, so imagine how 22-year-old Fatu Kekula felt nursing her entire family through Ebola.
Fatu stayed healthy, which is noteworthy considering that more than 300 health care workers have become infected with Ebola, and she didn't even have personal protection equipment -- those white space suits and goggles used in Ebola treatment units.
Every day, several times a day for about two weeks, Fatu put trash bags over her socks and tied them in a knot over her calves.
UNICEF Spokeswoman Sarah Crowe said Fatu is amazing.
Her Ebola nightmare started Juy 27, when her father, Moses, had a spike in blood pressure.
Fatu took her father to Monrovia, the capital city, about a 90-minute drive via difficult roads.
They said he had typhoid fever and did little for him, so Fatu took him home, where he infected three other family members: Fatu's mother, Victoria, 57; Fatu's sister, Vivian, 28, and their 14-year-old cousin who was living with them, Alfred Winnie.

"I'm very, very proud," her father said.
