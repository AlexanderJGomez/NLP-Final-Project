McCain responded by tossing out the name of a dear old friend and colleague, the very man who would be nominated to that post by a Democrat and frequent McCain target 13 years later.
When Hagel was elected to the Senate, the two men shared a bond over their service in Vietnam.
"His life has been committed to something larger than he is," Hagel said after McCain suspended his campaign effort to make way for an ascendent George W. Bush.
Later that year, Hagel introduced McCain on the stage of the party's convention with a giant embrace.
A source close to McCain said the friends just drifted apart as friends sometimes do, not because of policy differences.
But citing their long friendship, McCain said he would not oppose Hagel before the hearing.
