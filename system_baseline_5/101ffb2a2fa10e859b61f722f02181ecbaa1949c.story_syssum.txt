Dandong, China (CNN) -- The sun is rising over the Yalu River and North Korea.
Tourists often do just that when they go right up to the fence that separates the two countries and leave cigarettes, old watches and other goodies for the North Korean border guards.
"Go inside North Korea!"
China is North Korea's largest trading partner by a long way, and despite Beijing's official displeasure with the DPRK's pursuit of nuclear weapons, this trade continues to grow.
"People can eat and have clothes on their backs, but not over there, even the North Korean soldiers have nothing."
We can't use Chen's real name, he claims that Dandong is crawling with North Korean spies.
And you can find them all across Dandong in North Korean themed restaurants, karaoke bars, and musical review shows.
And as the four-piece all-female North Korean band plays to the Chinese tourists drinking North Korean beer, I think how perfectly it sums up this city: extremely bizarre and perhaps a little tragic.
