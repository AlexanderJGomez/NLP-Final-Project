(CNN) -- A Sikh farmer in India has surpassed a month on a hunger strike, demanding the release of six men from his community jailed since the 1990s during a period of a deadly Sikh separatist movement in the country.
India's then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was killed by her Sikh bodyguards in October 1984, the same year she had ordered a military raid on the Golden Temple, the holiest of the Sikh shrines, to flush out militants holed up inside.
International rights groups have accused both the Sikh separatists and Indian forces of serious violations during the insurgency.
Khalsa is "weak but says he will not end (his hunger strike) until he sees those six prisoners free," his aide said.
It's my personal opinion all such prisoners â€” whichever community they may belong to â€” should be set free now," said Sukhdev Singh Bhaur, general secretary of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), the top Sikh religious administration in Punjab.
"There were serious human rights abuses during the Punjab insurgency," the human rights group said.
Both militants, with their attacks, and the security forces, abusing the now repealed terror law, committed human rights violations, the group said.
Himself a Sikh and the country's first non-Hindu head of government, Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh issued a public apology for the deadly events -- 21 years after their occurrence.
