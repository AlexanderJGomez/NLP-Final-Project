So who could resist the touching story of the New York policeman who, seeing a homeless man sitting barefoot in the cold, walked into a shoe store and bought him a new pair of all-weather boots?
Hillman, who became much less famous than his benefactor, is barefoot once again.
New York City officials say Hillman has had an apartment but, for some reason, returns to the streets.
New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly gave DePrimo a pair of cuff links.
Remember the homeless man with the velvet voice, Ted Williams?
What matters is that Hillman, like thousands of others, in the street, in a country that, despite all its economic challenges, remains the richest nation the world has seen.
The reminder is particularly timely now as the country's leaders negotiate over the "fiscal cliff."
The U.K.-based Charities Aid Foundation, says Americans are the most generous people on earth.

Not for any of the homeless people in the streets of New York or Paris, Stockholm or Atlanta, whom we glimpse briefly as we move on with our lives.
But the more effective act of generosity, the real miracle, would come if the millions looking at the picture of the generous police officer trying to help a man in need wrote the perfect Chapter 3, pushing for better mental health services, more affordable housing, more job training.
