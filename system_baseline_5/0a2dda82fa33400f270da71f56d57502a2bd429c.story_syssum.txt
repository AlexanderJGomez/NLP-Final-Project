(CNN) -- Facebook is expanding its Gift feature to include plastic gift cards that carry balances for multiple stores and restaurants.
The cards will be rolling out gradually for Facebook users in the United States.
It also offered gift cards for specific vendors such as Starbucks and iTunes.
The new product falls somewhere between store-specific cards and bank-issued open gift cards that can be used almost anywhere credit cards are accepted.
Choosing cards from specific vendors like a favorite coffee spot or clothing store can be slightly more personal than a Visa card to be used anywhere.
A Facebook spokesperson said the company had nothing to share about how it will make money off the Card service.
