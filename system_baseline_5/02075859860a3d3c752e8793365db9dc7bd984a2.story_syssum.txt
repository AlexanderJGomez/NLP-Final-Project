London (CNN) -- Rupert Murdoch is the last of a dying breed: An old-fashioned press baron with ink running through his veins, a hefty checkbook, and a hunger for the next big story.
The same year, Murdoch filed for divorce from his third wife, Wendi Deng.
The newspaper business is in Murdoch's blood.
"I was raised in a newspaper family by a father who believed that the newspaper was among the most important instruments of human freedom," Murdoch declared in his 2008 Boyer Lectures.
"I found myself a newspaper proprietor at the age of 22," Murdoch said in 2008.
That desire to be first with the big news has led some to question his methods -- even before the phone-hacking scandal.
"He ran close to what might be considered journalistic ethics," said Lou Colasuonno, former editor-in-chief of the New York Post, which Murdoch took over in 1976.
"If I see things in the paper which I think are incorrect, I'll certainly point it out and say 'so-and-so made a mistake here,' or 'this wasn't as good a report as was in the opposition newspapers,'" he told the makers of BBC documentary "Who's Afraid of Rupert Murdoch?"
On the same program, Robert Spitzler, former managing editor of the New York Post said Murdoch's role went beyond commenting and suggesting.
But even those who may be considered his enemies recognize Murdoch's business acumen.
