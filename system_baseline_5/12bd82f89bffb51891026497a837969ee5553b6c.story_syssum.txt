(CNN) -- After 60 years of waiting, Egyptians may very well find themselves with a strong, assertive Parliament.
Egypt has an odd, three-round voting system, so Egyptians won't know the official outcome until January.
Because Egypt is still operating under a presidential system, with the ruling military council as the executive authority, Parliament will not be able to form a government.
Most importantly, the Parliament will appoint a committee to draft a new constitution.
But the Parliament will be the only nationally elected body that can claim to represent the will of the people.
This struggle for power will be just as meaningful -- and likely much more contentious -- than the elections that preceded it.
