At the time, he had been the rising star of Swiss skiing with four World Cup wins to his name and a solitary world title -- the 2007 Super Combined.
His first memory was of a hospital ceiling and it was three weeks after regaining consciousness that he once again remembered his name and the fact he had been a top skier.
The feeling was great because the slope was in good shape and I was fast in first training and I was skiing easily.
"If I watch myself in Kitzbühel then I feel like it wasn't me because I don't have any memory of him.
But remarkably, it did not end his career, rather it was a dislocated left kneecap after crashing in another training run at Lake Louise, Canada in November 2012 that finally called time on his professional career on the slopes.
"The first time I was on skis, I thought 'okay, shit, this is a nice feeling, I wanna go back in the World Cup'," he recalls.
He still recalls the feeling of being in the start gate for that first race back: "It was a great feeling.
But if you are a skier, if you are a pro, if you're the downhill, it's not so dangerous because you know what you can do, you know how it works and, for us, Kitzbühel, when you ski it's easy."
You came back, you were in the World Cup again, you did it, you have you're whole life in front of you'."
Part of him, the racer within, would like to be in that start gate to tackle the slope on which he was lucky to survive.
