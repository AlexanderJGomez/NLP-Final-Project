Sean and Carolyn Savage with daughter Mary Kate (now 18 months) and sons Ryan, left, and Andrew.
In a tragic mix-up, the Savages say the fertility clinic where Carolyn underwent in vitro fertilization implanted another couple's embryos into Carolyn's uterus.
"He walked in and was as white as a sheet," Carolyn said.
At the time, Carolyn was 39 and her chances of having a child naturally after this one were waning.
"That was a scary time for us," said Carolyn.
Carolyn and Sean tried on and off for 10 years to have another child before turning to IVF.
With five embryos left over from IVF -- and despite the risks to Carolyn's health -- the Savages, guided by their religious beliefs, refused to let the unused embryos at the clinic languish.
"They didn't choose this path either," Carolyn Savage said of the DNA parents, who declined to speak with media.
The Savages are not releasing the name of the clinic where they underwent the IVF procedure, but provided CNN with proof of their reproductive predicament, including results of amniocentesis, a genetic test, indicating the baby Carolyn is carrying is not  theirs.
The Savages say the five embryos they originally had cryogenically preserved at the clinic in Ohio are still unused and have been moved to another clinic in Atlanta, Georgia.
"I know that tug will be there every day wondering if the baby's happy, healthy and OK," said Carolyn.
