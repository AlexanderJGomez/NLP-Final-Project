(CNN) -- A California educator who authorities say is the person accused in a YouTube video of sexual abuse by a former student was charged Monday with 16 felony counts of child sex abuse, the Riverside County District Attorney's Office said.
But John Hall, a spokesman for the district attorney's office, said there is no statute of limitations on the most serious charge -- aggravated sexual assault on a child under 14.
David Ring, lawyer for the older woman, said, "She is very gratified that the DA has brought charges against this perpetrator.
The first alleged victim said the abuse took place "off and on" for her between the ages of 12 and 18.
The alleged victim said she didn't want a physical relationship, but she said the teacher threatened her multiple times.
