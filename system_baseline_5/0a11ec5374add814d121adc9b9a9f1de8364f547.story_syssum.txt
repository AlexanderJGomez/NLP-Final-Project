Ibrahim, who is eight months pregnant, is a Christian, her husband said.
I don't know what to do," said her husband, Daniel Wani.
Sudanese parliament speaker Fatih Izz Al-Deen said the verdict is not final and is in the hands of the judiciary.
However, the lawyer representing Ibrahim's family said Sunday that the mother is a devout Muslim.
He uses a wheelchair and "totally depends on her for all details of his life," said Jar Elnabi, her lawyer.
In past cases involving pregnant or nursing women, the Sudanese government waited until the mother weaned her child before executing any sentence, said Christian Solidarity Worldwide spokeswoman Kiri Kankhwende.
