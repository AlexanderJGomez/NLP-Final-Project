The investigation of the attack that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans  continues, these people said, as investigators try to build their case against Khattala and others who authorities believe were involved.
But people close to the case said the investigation has moved significantly in recent months.
In a recent interview with CNN's Arwa Damon, Khattala acknowledged being at the Benghazi mission after the attack but denied any involvement.
The investigation is led by agents from the FBI in New York and has included some members of the Washington field office, who have traveled to Libya to interview hundreds of witnesses, those briefed on the investigation said.
"It's been frustrating for many of us that it hasn't moved faster, but it is a very difficult working environment for our agents," said Schiff.
But Schiff said there has been progress.
