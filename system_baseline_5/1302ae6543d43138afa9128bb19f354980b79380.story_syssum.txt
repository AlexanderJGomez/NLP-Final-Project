(CNN) -- Ringo Starr walks into the hotel suite at the Beverly Hills Hotel carrying a brown paper bag.
"I feel like it's harder now for the celebrities," he tells CNN Entertainment Correspondent Kareen Wynter.
The celebrity of today is so documented that I think it's a lot harder now.
As one of two surviving Beatles, people are treating him like a living treasure -- and these days, he and Paul McCartney seem to be treasuring each other.
I love to play, I love to hang out with musicians and I like to make records, actually.
When I'm not doing that, I like to paint, I like to watch TV, I like to go to the cinema, I like to do all that stuff.
I like to get up early, and I don't like to get up and get right at it.
It was hard enough, and thank God, there were four of us to keep each other in some sort of reality.
Starr: Well, of course I miss them.
There were only four people who understood what we went through, and it's down to two now.
Starr: Paul can do it.
Starr: Well, we had a great time at my birthday.
I have to be very definite about that because they will say, "Oh, is he coming?
Starr: Well, the door is open that Paul and I might play together, but it is not like a reunion.
Starr: It's good.
Starr: Great.
Starr: Very down to earth.
Starr: As we all know, the world is going through a change, especially in Egypt and the Arab countries.
And it is great to see there is a lot of this (gives peace sign) going on in the world, and that is what it's about.
Starr: A lot of young people love "Peace and Love."
I just keep it going because it is a second in my life to think, "Peace and Love."
Starr: Well, I think you tackle that as it comes along.
