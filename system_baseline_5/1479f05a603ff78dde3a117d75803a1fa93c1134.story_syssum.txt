(CNN) -- Zara Phillips is not one to rest on her laurels.
But come back quickly she did.
"I always wanted to get back for the Worlds at the right time," Phillips says.
"When you come out of the Olympics you just go, 'Let's just do it all again,' " Phillips says.
Come 2016, Mia -- who will be superseded as the youngest member of Britain's royal family when William's wife Catherine gives birth for the second time -- could be watching her mother's bid to win gold, having already spent time on the equestrian circuit.
"We're lucky because we can ride and go back and forth a bit, it fits in really well.
I'm lucky, she's really good."
Olympic success came alongside High Kingdom, and he could well be Phillips' partner in Rio, given that she rode the bay gelding in Normandy.
Phillips' equestrian career, though, has not come without its setbacks.
It was great fun, you know," Phillips says.
"Horses mean everything to me," Phillips adds.
