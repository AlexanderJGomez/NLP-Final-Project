The central government of leftist President Evo Morales, Bolivia's first leader from an Indian majority centered in the western highlands, is conducting talks with governors of largely white provinces in the east who want autonomy.
The government of Evo Morales took power by a majority and now these opposition governors don't want to let him govern," Torrico said.
Anyelo Cespedes, president of the Santa Cruz Youth Union, which opposes Morales, said they don't want a dictatorship or a communist regime.
Morales, an ally of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and former Cuban President Fidel Castro, said the moves could cause Bolivia to disintegrate.
Morales has said the opposition leaders are trying to overthrow the government.
Ivan Canelas, a government spokesman, said the talks provide a critical opportunity to break an impasse that has split the country for months.
He said the goal is to "give peace back to our country and give certainty to Bolivia."
