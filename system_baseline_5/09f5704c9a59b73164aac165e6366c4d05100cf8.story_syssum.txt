(CNN) -- An Australian pilot landed a company plane in the ocean off Darwin on Friday, in a water landing that prompted comparisons to last month's landing of a US Airways jet in New York's Hudson River.
"It's essentially a good story," Blyth said.
The plane's trajectory took it over the water, giving the pilot limited opportunities to ditch the plane on land, Blyth said.
Australian media dubbed the captain of the Darwin plane "Sully Lite," comparing him to the captain of the US Airways Airbus jet that landed safely in the Hudson.
"The correlation for a water landing is as close as it gets," he said.
