The comparison between smartphone data usage on Verizon's network and iPhone data usage on AT&T's network is important to note, because iPhone users have typically been viewed as the heaviest data users in the entire mobile market.
The fact that Verizon is seeing a major uptick in data usage in the past six months, largely due to new Android smartphones, could be a key predictor of wireless data usage patterns going forward.
Smartphone data usage started exploding for Verizon when the company launched its first Android phones in the fourth quarter last year, Finegold said.
For example, 71.2 percent of all AT&T cell phone subscribers, which includes users of smartphones like the iPhone as well as feature phones, use data services, while only 43 percent of all Verizon cell phone users subscribe to data services.
According to data analyzed by Validas, about half of AT&T's iPhone customers use less than 200MB of data per month.
Verizon Wireless smartphone subscribers have similar usage patterns to those on AT&T's network.
In an effort to keep iPhone data usage in check so it doesn't completely overwhelm its network, AT&T recently eliminated its all you-can-eat data plan.
Verizon still offers its unlimited data plan.
Validas' analysis also clearly shows that heavy data users are primarily using AT&T and Verizon Wireless, while customers who tend to use less data, are subscribing to Sprint Nextel and T-Mobile USA.
T-Mobile only has about 22.3 percent of its cell phone subscriber base subscribing to data, and those consumers are only using about 120MB of data per month.
So it will be interesting to note whether the launch of this device will significantly move the needle on data usage on Sprint's network.
