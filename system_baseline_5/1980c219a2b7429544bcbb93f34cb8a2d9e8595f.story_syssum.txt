Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A judge on Friday ordered actress Lindsay Lohan to remain in a drug rehabilitation program until January 3 for a probation violation.
Lohan, freed on $300,000 bail after 14 hours in jail, voluntarily checked into the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, California, three days later.
However, Lohan failed a drug test less than a month later, triggering Friday's probation violation hearing.
Just two weeks after checking out of a Malibu, California, drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility, she was arrested again in July 2007 after a woman called Santa Monica, California, police, saying Lohan was trying to run her down with a car.
