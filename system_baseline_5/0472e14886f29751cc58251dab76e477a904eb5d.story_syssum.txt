Earlier in the day Laura Trott added to the gold she won in the women's team pursuit with triumph in the omnium event, but home crowd favorite Victoria Pendleton was beaten to gold by Australian Anna Meares in the individual sprint.
I saw everyone stepping up to the plate and thankfully it worked out for me too.
He has now eclipsed the five gold medals won by rower Steve Redgrave to become Britain's most successful ever Olympian.
In the women's individual sprint final Meares gained revenge for defeat in the same event four years ago, as Pendleton had to settle for silver in her last race before retiring.
I would have loved to have won on my final race but I'm so glad it's all done and I can move on," she said.
Prior to Pendleton's farewell race, 20-year-old Laura Trott secured her second gold in her first ever Olympics by winning the multi-discipline women's omnium event.
She set a new Olympic record in the the 500m time trial event to beat American Sarah Hammer and add to the gold she won in the women's team pursuit.
