The Duke of Cambridge was speaking just before the first official football match at Buckingham Palace.
Many of those volunteers were invited to the palace to see the match.
This is a space normally graced only by family members and the odd garden party.
Now the historic match is over (Polytechnic won 2-1) the corgis and geese have their garden back.
