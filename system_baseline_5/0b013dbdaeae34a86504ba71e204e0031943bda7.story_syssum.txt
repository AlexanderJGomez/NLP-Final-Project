(CNN) -- Bayern Munich dropped their first Bundesliga points of the season under new manager Pep Guardiola Tuesday -- frustrated by a late SC Freiburg equalizer in a 1-1 draw.
"If you're only 1-0 up in the Bundesliga, things like this can always happen," Guardiola told Bayern's official website.
The score stood at 1-1 at the time, but Schalke pulled ahead for the second time when Julian Draxler scored in the 79th minute, a crucial second away goal.
The English Premier League side had won the away leg in Turkey 3-0 but still fielded a strong side for the return leg, with Welsh international Ramsey again outstanding.
