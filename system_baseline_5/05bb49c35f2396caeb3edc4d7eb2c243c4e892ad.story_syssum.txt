The city was a flashpoint for the violent conflict between unionists and nationalists that swept Ireland from the 1960s through the 1990s.
This weekend, however, Derry-Londonderry plays host to an event its organizers hope can help unite this divided city, at least for a few days.
Each have drawn throngs of people who packed the streets, faces bright with wonder, to witness their city be transformed if only for a moment into something magical.
Marriage had to persuade skeptical city officials to shut down parts of central London and reroute traffic while convincing them the event wasn't just a piece of frivolous disruption.
And we'd like to shut the city (down) for four days,'" she said.
And of course their instinct is to say no," she said.
And immediately the response was different.
"It's always an incredible moment when the city is returned to the people who live and work there.
Thanks to a fast broadband connection, people in London could peer into the "tunnel" and see a live feed of New York City, and vice versa.
Marriage and her team followed that in 2009 with "One & Other," which took over London's Trafalgar Square for 100 days and nights.
The event began in July and ran for 2,400 hours, day and night, with a new person occupying the plinth each hour.
"People used it in incredibly imaginative ways," Marriage said.
We work in the streets, using the buildings of the city, the architecture of the city, as the stage."
The success of Lumiere in Durham inspired Marriage to double down this year on the festival in Derry-Londonderry.
But Marriage is optimistic.
