(CNN)  -- Two people were found dead and a third person is still believed missing in a North Carolina food plant heavily damaged in a morning explosion, police said Tuesday night.
"There was no warnings, no signs," Garner Mayor Ronnie Williams said.
More than 300 people were in the plant when the explosion happened, authorities said.
The search crews were moving slowly in part because the building is very unstable, officials said.
Gail Ruffin, a ConAgra worker who was in the plant when the explosion happened, told WRAL she heard a boom.
