The irritating glare won't, of course, affect the way we navigate our way to London's Heathrow Airport; a complicated and well-engineered computer system using GPS positioning provides information to air traffic controllers.
That was a question facing pilots in airspace over the United Kingdom on Friday, when Shanwick Oceanic, a part of the UK's NAT system of air traffic control, developed a computer glitch.
Traditional radar is still available once the flight travels in range of a land-based facility.
Before the latest computer technology became prevalent, oceanic controllers would track airplanes manually based on verbal pilot position reports at designated degrees of longitude.
When the current technology system breaks down, the solution is either to increase separation limits or just wait until it is fixed.
This of course raises the question of whether the global air traffic control system has become computer dependent.
With all that in mind, we are just going to have to suffer through the compromise of inconvenience when the technology breaks down.
