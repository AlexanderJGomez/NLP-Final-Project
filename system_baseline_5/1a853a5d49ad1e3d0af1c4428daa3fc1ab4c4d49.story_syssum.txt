But while she battles for the gold, Johnson is fighting another battle: with Crohn's disease, one of the two most common inflammatory bowel diseases, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
However, many suffer in silence, as the effects of Crohn's are often not openly discussed.
Crohn's disease is an autoimmune disease of the digestive tract that most often affects the small or large intestines, and sometimes both.
"Crohn's is a chronic, lifelong disease for which there is no cure," he said.
Each patient is different, and treatment is a trial-and-error process.
Early treatments for Crohn's disease primarily centered on steroid drugs such as prednisone, which relieved the inflammation but did little more.
A diagnosis of Crohn's disease often brings more questions than answers, and patients can face a long list of ever-changing complications.
According to the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America, about 70% of Crohn's sufferers eventually require surgery.
This is one of the most serious complications of Crohn's.
The foundation is the largest voluntary nonprofit health organization dedicated to finding cures for inflammatory bowel diseases, a classification that includes Crohn's and colitis.
