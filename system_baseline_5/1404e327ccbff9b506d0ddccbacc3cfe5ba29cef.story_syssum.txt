(CNN) -- It's been more than a week since Brown University student Sunil Tripathi was last seen, but authorities appear to be no closer to knowing where he is.
According to his family, the FBI is assisting in the investigation, which is being led by the Providence Police Department.
Tripathi grew up in Radnor, Pennsylvania.
A public Facebook page has been created to help find Tripathi.
