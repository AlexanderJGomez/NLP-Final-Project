(CNN) -- McLaren may want a reunion with Fernando Alonso, but the Spaniard has no intention of leaving Ferrari.
But any hopes McLaren had of luring Alonso back were quickly quashed, with the two-time world champion declaring he saw his long-term future with Ferrari.
Two-time world champion Alonso has been with Ferrari since 2010, but his position as the team's undisputed No.
Alonso's solitary season with McLaren was a turbulent one, with in-fighting damaging team unity as both the Spaniard and rookie driver Lewis Hamilton challenged for the world championship.
