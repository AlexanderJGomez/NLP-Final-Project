Their lawsuit names the Army Corps of Engineers and the National Weather Service, which have acknowledged that a lack of communication undercut flood warnings.
The Cumberland eventually crested at nearly 52 feet in downtown Nashville, almost 12 feet over flood stage and about 10 feet higher than forecast.
The lawsuit argues that the Corps "repeatedly provided incorrect and inaccurate information" to the Weather Service, which issued flood warnings for the Cumberland River.
But forecasters weren't told about the additional releases, and the Cumberland passed its predicted crest of 41.9 feet within two hours of their advisory, the report stated.
