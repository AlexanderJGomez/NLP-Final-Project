The former heavyweight world champion has teamed up with colorful Canadian businessman and philanthropist Yank Barry to help Syrian refugees in Bulgaria.
As soon as we arrived, Holyfield and Barry were surrounded by hundreds of refugees angry at camp conditions in Bulgaria.
In midst of the chaos, Barry said to Holyfield: "We can't blame them for being angry.
The refugees questioned why more was not being done to help them.
That did not appease the refugees.
Barry offered to place them in a converted hotel with other Syrian refugees for up to a year.
When asked why he would have more success than others in reaching out to Assad, Barry said: "I know he loves Louie Louie.
It's my song.
It's dark by the time we reach our next destination -- the hotel that Barry is using to rehouse refugees.
Barry says enthusiastically.
Barry says he is already looking for another hotel to house more refugees.
"The amount refugees pay varies according to the number of people trying to cross the border.
It's unacceptable that they go on suffering once they reach the EU," U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees AntÃ³nio Guterres said recently during a trip to a refugee camp in Sofia.
Bulgaria is now building a wall along the most thickly-forested section of Bulgaria's border with Turkey, in an attempt to keep people out.
