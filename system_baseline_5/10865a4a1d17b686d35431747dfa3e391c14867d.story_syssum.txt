Despite all this, Lilly's heart is really in writing.
Working on that project is what inspired me to start writing [her children's book] "The Squickerwonkers" and get it published.
Lilly: Tauriel was half as daunting as a character from the book.
CNN: Since she is not in the book, we don't know what will become of her.
But there's a lot more emotional material for Tauriel in this film, which is good to see.
There's nothing as pleasurable to me as writing.
If this wasn't the right fit -- an amazing job that most people would covet -- I thought that writing would be that.
What was that experience like?
This one is very much a heist film.
The heist is being masterminded by myself, my father and Scott Lang.
