(CNN) -- Gonzalo Higuain scored the first hat-trick of the 2010 World Cup as Diego Maradona's Argentina took a big step towards qualifying for the second round by crushing South Korea 4-1 in Johannesburg on Thursday.
South Korea pulled a goal back on the stroke of halftime as Lee Chung-Yong pounced on an error by Argentina defender Martin Demichelis, but Yeom Ki-Hun squandered a golden chance to level in the 58th minute.
Higuain made it 3-1 in the 76th minute after Messi's first shot was blocked by the legs of goalkeeper Jung Sung-Ryong and his second rebounded kindly off the base of the post.
Greece pressed forward and equalized just before halftime as Dimitrios  Salpingidis saw his shot deflected into the net off Nigeria's Lukman Haruna.
Even Nigeria are not entirely out of it, but would require a big win over South Korea to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stage.
