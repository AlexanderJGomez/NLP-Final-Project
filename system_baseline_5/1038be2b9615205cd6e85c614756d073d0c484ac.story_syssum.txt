(Mental Floss) -- Golf's U.S. Open teed off Thursday at Torrey Pines Golf Course in San Diego.
Amateur Championship at the club, which made the Open something of an afterthought.
Although the tournament was called the U.S. Open, winning was strictly a British affair in its early days.
Thus, it's an "open" tournament.
Amateurs with handicaps of 1.4 or less can play in the U.S. Open if they make it through the qualifying process, which includes a local qualifying round and a sectional qualifying round.
He took the course for the 1898 Open at the Myopia Hunt Club in S. Hamilton, Massachusetts, and proceeded to shoot a 157 in his opening round.
At the 1938 Open at Cherry Hills in Englewood, Colorado, Ainsley hit into a creek on the 16th hole of his second round.
And again.
Although he was an amateur facing stiff competition from celebrated British pros like Harry Vardon and Ted Ray, Ouimet managed to squeak out a victory following an 18-hole playoff.
Amateur golfer Bobby Jones was undoubtedly one of the best golfers of all time, and he had the hardware to back it up: four U.S. Open wins, another three wins in the British Open, and six more wins between the U.S.
Jones said he was certain the ball had moved and penalized himself.
Olin Dutra's win at the 1934 U.S. Open was as much a medical marvel as it was an athletic achievement after Dutra got sick on his way to the tournament.
By shooting a final-round 72, Dutra passed Bobby Cruickshank and Gene Sarazen to win his only U.S. Open crown by just one stroke.
