Nikolsky hesitates when recalling the moment he realized armed bandits were fast approaching his ship off the coast of Somalia.
On the September 25, 2008, however, the ship's second officer approached Nikolsky to inform him he had spotted two small dots in the distance moving towards the Faina at speed.
"When they saw what kind of cargo they were surprised," Nikolsky said.
This meant Nikolsky was in command when the pirates attacked.
As the days and weeks passed, Nikolsky began to talk to the leader of the pirates, eventually gaining his trust.
Nikolsky said his heart sank at this moment.
He told us that everything was clear and all the pirates left the vessel."
The Faina sailed into the port of Mombasa, Kenya, a few days later where Nikolsky was reunited with his wife and family.
"But I spent at sea all of my life, 45 years ... (and) now I like my village, I like my job here."
