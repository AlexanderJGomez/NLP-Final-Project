Days after he was found dead, then-NFL star Aaron Hernandez was arrested and charged with murder.
Hernandez also faces murder charges in a 2012 double homicide.
"I saw a closeness with them that I'd never seen before," Montgomery said of the relationship between Hernandez and his father.
Hernandez was one of more than 20 people interviewed by police, and he was the only one who did not make a statement after invoking his right to counsel.

Before the draft, Hernandez was expected to be a first- or second-round pick.
"He said he was at the club with Mr. Hernandez, and that they were partying and he had a good time, and that Mr. Hernandez spent a good amount of money," Branch recalled.
Lloyd said Hernandez spent about $10,000 that night.
Daryl Hodge was with Lloyd when he said Lloyd got a text from Hernandez, asking to hang out later that night.
Nine days later, Hernandez was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and other weapons-related charges.
He pleaded not guilty.
Jurors also didn't hear anything about what happened in Boston on July 16, 2012 -- the night two men were murdered outside a club where Hernandez had been.
After leaving the second nightclub, Hernandez and the friend returned to their SUV and pulled over on a nearby street where Hernandez removed a revolver from the engine block, Haggan said.
Hernandez was charged in the double homicide in May, and he pleaded not guilty.
Investigators found evidence they believe links him to the 2012 slayings while investigating the death of Lloyd.
