"I'm just happy to be alive," said passenger Jarrod West, who slid down holding his black Chihuahua.
A loud pop initiated the brush with disaster, said West and other passengers who spoke with KCAL from the airport in Long Beach, California.
Actor Jackson Rathbone was on the flight with his wife and child.
Fortunately, not far from its departure airport, the plane made a sharp turn back toward it, Rathbone said.
Then flight attendants prepared the passengers in the event of a hard landing.
He did good," West said.
JetBlue spokeswoman Jessica Felipe said everyone evacuated the plane by using emergency slides.
Passengers were led to a room, where they were debriefed, Rathbone said.
KCAL reported that those wishing to continue to Austin were put onto a later flight.
Rathbone and his family went home to celebrate their living through Thursday's scare with a wine and champagne tasting, he said on whosay -- they opened a half-dozen bottles.
