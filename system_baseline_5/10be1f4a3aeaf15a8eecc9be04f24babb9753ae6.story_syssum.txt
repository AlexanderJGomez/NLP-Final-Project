The world's largest gathering of computer hackers -- DEF CON, which is happening this weekend at the Rio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas -- held its first-ever hacking classes for kids this year, at an event appropriately called DEF CON Kids.
"You can watch lock-picking videos on YouTube, but where do you hear the ethical side of this?"
said Steed, the uncle.
That's happened before, he said, so that skill might be handy.
"Our family has had some trouble with locks," he said, smiling.
Those skills could be used for criminal activity, but quite a few DEF CON attendees are actually computer security professionals -- the "good guys" trying to make the Internet less vulnerable to attacks by computer criminals.
The DEF CON Kids event also included a competition, where kids went around the hacker conference trying to break codes and solve puzzles.
If you do bad things, that's going to stick with you," he said.
