(CNN) -- Small waves lap at the hulls of the ocean-going container ships as they approach the South African Port of Ngqura.
It's this combination of maritime port and landside infrastructure just outside the city of Port Elizabeth that is making the operation boom.
But a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers blames "comparatively high tariffs payable by vessels calling at South African ports" for the decline in shipping business.
"The Coega industrial development zone has a very important role to play in the economic growth of the area," says Christopher Mashigo, business development executive manager at the Coega Development Corporation.
The industrial zone created more than 13,000 jobs last year.
As well as individuals gaining skills and jobs, small and medium size businesses in the area are also benefiting from the zone.
The port is allowing some small business owners to grow their existing operation, but it's also leading to the beginnings of totally new businesses.
While some of these successes prove the value of the port and industrial zone, there is much more to come.
