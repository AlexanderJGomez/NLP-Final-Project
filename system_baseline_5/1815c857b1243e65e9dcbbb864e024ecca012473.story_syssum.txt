Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Sister Maria Gomez is an 87-year-old Catholic nun.
One day after her appearance in court, she issued a statement denying the allegations saying they were deeply disgusting and that she has never known a single case of a newborn being taken from a mother through coercion or threats.
We traveled to Spain to talk to those parents who believe their children were stolen and some who believe they were taken from their birth parents.
"In fact, my dad was given a choice: boy or girl," Moreno said.
Barroso said: "I was so angry and I threatened her: you're going to have problems.
Like two kilos of tomatoes.
After that, Barroso set up Anadir, an association for Spain's stolen children.
Ines Perez and her daughter, Ines Madrigal, have a typically loving mother-daughter relationship but are also caught in the stolen babies scandal.
When she arrived, she says, he placed a newborn baby in her arms and handed her a falsified birth certificate.
"The doctor said "Just put her in the car between two hot water bottles," Perez recalls.
In a summary of his testimony to investigators in the case of Ines Madrigal, Vela denies any wrong-doing, saying that he only helped women who wanted to put their children up for adoption, never pressuring any mother to do so.
"If I wasn't stolen, then where is the signature of my birth mother?"
"I just want to know the truth."
