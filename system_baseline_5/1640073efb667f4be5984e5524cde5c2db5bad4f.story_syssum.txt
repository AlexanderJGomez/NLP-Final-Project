Sherlock Holmes has the Sherlockians, scholars of the canon of books and short stories written by author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
The movie really showed Watson as a trusted companion to Holmes, coming to Holmes' aid in times of need.
He is tough.
The movie shows Watson as intelligent, able to be a good assistant; Watson, the doctor, concerned about his friend's well-being; and it shows his reasonable frustration with his friend's often thoughtless ways," said Julia Carlson Rosenblatt, a Baker Street Irregular since 1981 and co-author of "Dining With Sherlock Holmes."
The plot of the new Sherlock Holmes movie, starring Robert Downey Jr., as Holmes and Jude Law as Watson, isn't based on an actual Conan Doyle story.
For instance, in this film, Watson introduces his fiancee, Mary Morstan, to Holmes for the first time.
Holmes already knew her," Peck explained.
"When William Gillette, working on a Holmes play, asked Doyle if it was OK for Holmes to marry, Doyle is said to have replied, 'You may marry him, or murder him, or do anything you like to him.'
