Not just for an electric car, but for traditional petrol-engine cars as well.
Mate Rimac says that he has always been motivated by the desire to demonstrate the superiority of electric over petrol-powered cars: "I have two passions; cars and technology," Rimac says.
"I decided to combine my two passions, technology and cars and make an electric car that can prove the electric motor is much better even on the racetrack.
After several years of rebuilding and alteration, Rimac set a world record with his car, which became the fastest accelerating electric car in the world.
And we did all that with less than 0.1% of the budget which is usual in the car industry," Rimac says.
Still, the notion that an electric car might soon not just match, but outperform the best petrol vehicles on the planet is certainly a captivating one.
