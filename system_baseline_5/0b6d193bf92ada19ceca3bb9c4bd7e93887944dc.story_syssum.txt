Then there's "Santorum Two."
Santorum is not hiding this.
Yes, that means exactly what you think it does: Santorum believes that each and every one of our government's laws must match God's law, warning that "as long as there is a discordance between the two, there will be agitation."
Some of you might be asking: How far will "Santorum Two" take this?
Santorum's fundamental problem with Sharia law is that it's "not just a religious code.
Now, where did I hear about someone wanting to impose only laws that agree with God's law in America?
Santorum recently declared that not only does he oppose gay marriages, but he supports a federal constitutional amendment that would ban them, invalidating all previous gay marriages that have legally been sanctioned by states and thus callously destroying marriages and thrusting families into chaos.
Santorum would ban all federal funding for birth control and would not oppose any state that wanted to pass laws making birth control illegal.
While there may be millions of Americans who in their heart agree with the views of "Santorum Two," it is my hope they will reject any attempts to move America closer to a becoming the Afghanistan of the Western Hemisphere.
