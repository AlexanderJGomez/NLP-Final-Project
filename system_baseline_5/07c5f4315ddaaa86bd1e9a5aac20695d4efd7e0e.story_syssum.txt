Kang, who was vice principal at Ansan's Danwon High School, was rescued from the sinking Sewol ferry.
His family members -- one son, two daughters and his wife dressed in all-black traditional Korean wear followed the hearse.
"As the one in charge of the safety of the students, he was suffering from guilty feelings," another teacher had told Korean media.
Over 300 students from the school and their teachers were aboard the ferry.
He said he could not live not knowing where his students are.
During this period, several students from the high school came to the funeral home to pay their respects to Kang's family.
He really liked students a lot."
"The vice principal really liked students," she said.
"We are so sorry..." tweeted Kim Min Hyuk, a senior at the high school, who tweeted the name of the vice principal along with the names of other dead teachers from the ferry tragedy.
The hearse carrying his coffin traveled a few miles east and pulled into Danwon High School, circling the campus for one last time -- signifying Kang's last visit to his school.
