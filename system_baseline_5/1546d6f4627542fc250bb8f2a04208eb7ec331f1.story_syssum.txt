New York (CNN) -- A day after saying homosexuality is not "an equally valid or successful option," New York gubernatorial candidate Carl Paladino denied being anti-gay Monday but said it was "disgusting" that his opponent took his children to a gay pride parade.
Cuomo criticized his remarks Sunday, as did an advocate for gays and lesbians and an organization for gay and lesbian Republicans.
Paladino's nephew, Jeffrey Hannon, a member of his campaign staff, declined to comment when contacted by CNN early Monday.
Asked whether he believes homosexuality is a choice, Paladino said, "I've had difficulty with that.
Paladino emphasized in a statement Sunday night that he did not include those lines when he delivered his remarks, and said Monday he had crossed them out from his prepared remarks.
Paladino told CNN he didn't know who wrote the remarks.
I don't think they should be married," he told CNN.
"Don't misquote me as wanting to hurt homosexual people in any way," Paladino said Sunday.
Paladino also criticized Cuomo for marching in New York's gay pride parade in June.
New York "celebrates our diversity" with festivities such as the Columbus Day parade and the gay rights parade, he said.
Gay rights groups also criticized Paladino's remarks.
"Carl Paladino's statements are unfortunate and show he lacks an understanding of what it means to be gay," said Gregory T. Angelo, chairman of the group.
It isn't."
"Watch," Paladino said before walking off.
