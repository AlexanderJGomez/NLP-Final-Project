LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The mayor of West Hollywood has condemned a Halloween display resembling Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin hanging by a noose.
"While these residents have the legal right to display Senator John McCain and Governor Sarah Palin in effigy, I strongly oppose political speech that references violence -- real or perceived," he added.
One, who identified himself to CNN affiliate KCAL-TV in Los Angeles only as "George," said the display takes the spirit of Halloween "too far."
Its time to be spooky," he said.
