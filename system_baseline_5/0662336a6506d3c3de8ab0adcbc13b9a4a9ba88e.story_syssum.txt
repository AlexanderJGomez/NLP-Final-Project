Natalie Cole received a kidney transplant Tuesday in Los Angeles.
"I'm on a very long list, which is why we are looking to donors," said Cole, the daughter of legendary crooner Nat King Cole.
Cole said her kidney troubles date to February 2008 when she was diagnosed with Hepatitis C. Cole said she attributes the Hepatitis C to her well-publicized struggles to stop using cocaine and heroin.
Since then Cole has been on dialysis three days a week and has been searching for a kidney, she told King in one of the first public interviews about the issue.
It's -- it's amazing," Cole said.
That's all I can say," Cole said.
Cole is expected to return to the tour after three to four months of recovery.
