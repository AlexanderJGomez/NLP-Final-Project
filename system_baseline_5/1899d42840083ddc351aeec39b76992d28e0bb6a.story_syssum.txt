The ruling followed a surprise appearance on the witness stand by Jordan Linn Graham, who faces first- and second-degree murder charges in the death of her 25-year-old husband, Cody Johnson.
Graham was indicted last month on charges she intentionally pushed her husband to his death in an angry rage.
During her 15 minutes of testimony, Graham accused FBI agent Stacey Smiedala of making her uncomfortable by placing his hand on her knee during an interrogation.
In a case that has gained national attention, Graham did not initially report the incident.
Only after a FBI agent Smiedala showed her a surveillance photo of the couple entering the gates to Glacier National Park did Graham change her story and confess to pushing him off the ledge.
Donahoe, the public defender, has criticized prosecutors for labeling Graham a sociopath, accused them of distorting statements she made, and contended they recorded only those segments of interviews that bolstered the government's case.
Donahoe said federal attorneys have not disclosed any evidence of the premeditation alleged in the first-degree murder charge except for mentioning during a recent telephone conference that "the government now believes Jordan placed a blindfold on Cody before pushing him off the ledge," court documents show.
