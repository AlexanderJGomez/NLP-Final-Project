Washington (CNN)  -- It was one of those behind-the-scenes moments that a reporter covering the Tea Party rarely gets to witness.
The bus was hard to miss, wrapped full-on in a Tea Party advertisement.
But one thing was very clear: The Tea Party had once again attracted attention from one of its many critics.
On the drive to Washington, the activists had aimed their ire at cable news channels, news sites or blogs they felt were biased against the Tea Party movement.
Virtually every seat was spoken for.
One guy slept on the floor next to one of them, in the middle of the narrow walkway that attached the front of the bus to the back.
But I also spent time in the back, working out of a cramped space with the other journalists embedded for the trip.
The pooch sat on one of the leather bench sofas along the window for most of the trip.
At one point, as I was interviewing Williams, he mentioned Casey, put a laptop in front of her, and said she likes to blog from the bus.
