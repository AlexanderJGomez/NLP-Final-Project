Theo Zwanziger, the former head of the German Football Association, wants a key report into alleged corruption into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups made available to the public with names redacted.
"I support the publishing of the Garcia Report, appropriately redacting to respect prior witness confidentiality agreements," added Webb, referring to Michael Garcia, the American lawyer who investigated the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding process for FIFA.
According to the FIFA agenda for next week's meeting, he will address members on how much of the 430-page report should be made public.
Reinhard Rauball, president of the German football league, warned that UEFA's 54 member nations could leave FIFA if the report into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 was not published in full.
His remarks came just before the Dutch Football Association demanded FIFA hand over a copy of the report, while Greg Dyke, chairman of the English Football Association warned that "urgent action" must be taken to restore confidence in the world governing body.
