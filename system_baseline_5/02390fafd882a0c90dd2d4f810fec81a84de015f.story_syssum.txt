"It is a human right if you were born a male or female and you want to have a sex change or lead a life of a different gender," said Kamnoon Sittisamarn, the spokesperson of Constitution Drafting Committee, which is working on a new draft of the country's constitution.
The old constitution recognizes people of different religion, age, gender -- but had not extended to transgender people.
There's a perception that transgender people are well accepted in Thailand, due to the availability of gender reassignment surgery.
Another problem is that the gender marked on government documents doesn't match how individuals identify their gender.
"For trans people, we cannot change our title name.
Asian countries including Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh have implemented policies recognizing third gender in recent years.
And Thailand does not have plans to legalize same sex marriages in its constitution, said Sittisamarn.
