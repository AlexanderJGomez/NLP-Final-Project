(CNN) -- Syrian opposition voices spoke out Monday against a proposed law that would allow for new political parties, calling it little more than a publicity stunt.
"The law stipulates that any political party needs to have at least 2,000 members representing at least seven Syrian provinces before being active," said Damascus lawyer Anwar Al Bounni, who heads the Syrian Center for Legal Studies and Research.
Anti-regime demonstrators took to the streets Sunday night, chanting for the fall of the regime into the early hours of Monday, according to activists and protest videos posted on the Internet.
It would require that new parties adhere to principles similar to those of Western democracies, SANA reported.
Human Rights Watch says Syrian security forces have intensified their campaign of mass arrests in cities that have had anti-government protests.
Local Coordination Committees of Syria estimates that more than 15,000 people arrested since the beginning of the protests remain in detention, Human Rights Watch said.
