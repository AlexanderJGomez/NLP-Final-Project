(CNN) -- Along with math, science and social studies, gun safety could soon be part of the first-grade curriculum in some Missouri public schools.
There is no reason for them to be teaching about gun safety when there are children with parents like me," Aimee Patton, a Kansas City blogger and mom to a 6-year-old girl, told CNN in a phone interview.
It encourages schools to teach gun safety to first-graders through courses such as the National Rifle Association's "Eddie Eagle" Gunsafe Program.
A number of other states have taken steps encouraging schools to promote gun safety.
Eddie Eagle is a mascot dressed as an eagle who addresses gun safety issues for children in pre-K through third grade.
Scott Holste, a Nixon spokesman, told CNN the program is optional for school districts and is not mandated under the new law, which authorizes schools to seek public grants to fund safety programs.
I agree, I think they should know gun safety.
Pediatricians and gun safety experts say, however, that the efforts behind the measure may be misguided.
Because it doesn't matter if the kids have been to a gun safety program or not," said Albrecht.
Brown said first-graders shouldn't be doing experiential learning with guns and felt the "Eddie Eagle" video would be enough.
