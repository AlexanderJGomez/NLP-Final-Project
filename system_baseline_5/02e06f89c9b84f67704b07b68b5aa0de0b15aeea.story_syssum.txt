Tsipras has vowed to end austerity measures and renegotiate the terms of Greece's European Union bailout.
Syriza's pledges to try to get some of Greece's colossal debt written off and roll back unpopular austerity measures appealed to exasperated members of the electorate -- even if they potentially jeopardize Greece's place in the eurozone.
European Central Bank Executive Board member Benoît Cœuré told CNN on Monday that Greece  would still have to pay its debt.
Greece has made remarkable progress in recent years, and we stand ready to continue to assist Greece in addressing the remaining reform challenges," he said.
"I got a country on the verge of ruin.
"Our victory is, at the same time, it's a victory for all the people of Europe that are fighting against austerity that's ruining the common European future," he said.
But it's unclear how Syriza's plans to renegotiate the bailout would play out.
