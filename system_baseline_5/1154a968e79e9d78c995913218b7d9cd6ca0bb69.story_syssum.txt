ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- More than 80 years after his family was ordered from the country, the grandson of one of the last Ottoman sultans was buried Saturday as hundreds of admirers looked on.
"Osman himself was born into a family that still ruled an empire stretching from the Balkans to the Indian Ocean.
Ertugrul Osman, who had played as a boy in the imperial palaces of Istanbul, was sent with the rest of his family into exile.
Over the years, Osman told reporters he had no interest in assuming the Ottoman throne.
The hundreds of mourners at Saturday's funeral stunned other surviving members of the Ottoman royal family.
It is the first time I have seen such an outpouring."
Hundreds of police officers blocked traffic as Osman was buried in a garden filled with the gravestones of Ottoman pashas and viziers, beside the ornate tombs of his grandfather Sultan Abdulhamid II and another ancestor, Sultan Mahmut II.
