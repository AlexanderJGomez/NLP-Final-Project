(CNN) -- As investigators are determining whether a skull and bones discovered behind an abandoned Central Virginia home on Saturday are those of Hannah Graham, the lone suspect in her disappearance has been indicted in an assault from almost a decade ago -- a case that police say forensically links him to another female college student who vanished from the same area as Graham.
Dale Terry of the Chesterfield Sheriff's Department and his small search team were finishing up for the day when behind an abandoned home -- just eight miles from where Hannah Graham was last seen -- they found a skull and bones scattered across a creek bed.
"It was not buried, and its location was not far from the road," he told a local television station.
Furthermore, police now consider the Graham case "a death investigation," said County Police Chief Steve Sellers.
The Albemarle County Police Department said it didn't know how long it will take for the forensic results to come back.
