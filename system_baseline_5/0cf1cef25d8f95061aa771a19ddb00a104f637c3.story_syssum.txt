"Most of our farmers ... are illiterate," says Rex Chapota, executive director at Farm Radio Malawi.
Farm Radio Malawi is one of the partner stations of Farm Radio International, a non-profit organization that's been teaming up with African radio broadcasters since the late 1970s.
"The issue of radio listeners' clubs is very critical to our model," says Chapota.
Patrick Chimuvi, a government agriculture advisor in Malawi, says the radio programs have been very successful in helping farmers improve their skills and harvest their produce at the best time.
From preventing the loss of produce to increasing harvests, the broadcasters believe that the lessons learned over the radio airwaves can help fight food insecurity and improve lives in Malawi's rural communities.
