The fighting came to an end in 2003 and five years later Jones decided to pay a visit to Liberia.
"When I got there I was absolutely shocked and devastated by what I was seeing," says Jones.
"I decided to focus specifically on water because the issue of water really crosses all aspects of development," says Jones, 30.
Jones, who travels to Liberia every three months to oversee the group's projects, says that at least half of Liberia's 4 million population lack access to adequate drinking water.
As well as saving lives, Jones says that access to safe drinking water can also encourage economic growth and improve the educational development of children, especially girls.
Jones says that limited funds affect the group's scaling capacity as well as its ability to have more people on the ground.
She says her long-term goal is to bring access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene to as many regions of Liberia as possible, as well as other post-conflict countries that face similar problems.
