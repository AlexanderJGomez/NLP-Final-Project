That was the selection made Wednesday by Kwasi Enin, the New York high school student accepted by the eight Ivy League schools -- Harvard, Yale, Brown, Columbia, University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth, Princeton and Cornell.
"My Bull Dog Days experience last week was incredible," he said.
"We are grateful for all the inspiration," he said.
He's also ranked 11th in his class at William Floyd High School, a public school on Long Island, according to his principal, Barbara Butler.
Butler said Enin is not only a model academic student, but also plays three instruments for the chamber orchestra, sings in an a cappella group, throws shot put and discus for the high school's track and field team, participates in student government and has had a lead role in school plays since the ninth grade.
"He is an incredibly modest, humble and respectable person," Butler said.
"It's quite atypical," Rubin said, adding that most students do not apply to all the Ivy League schools.

Enin admitted all along that he favored Yale.
Enin added that Yale also has a strong music program, one of his beloved hobbies that he hopes to continue when he isn't hitting the books in college.
"Follow your passions in high school and not just follow suit for what you think can get you into these schools," he said.
