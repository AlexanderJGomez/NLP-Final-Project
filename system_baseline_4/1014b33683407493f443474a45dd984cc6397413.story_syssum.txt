As the rover touched down on Mars, the nation seemed to catch the fever and excitement.
Or are Americans rekindling their romance with science after what seemed like a long and tepid stupor?
The destination only made it more gripping: Mars has been a lodestone for the imagination for at least a century.
Maybe we saw something deeper in the successful landing of Curiosity.

Scientists have long sought to unlock the rules and regularities in the natural world.

When a rover millions of miles away can light our hearts, it's hard to say whether we wanted to know more about Mars, or space colonies, or Earth, or ourselves.
