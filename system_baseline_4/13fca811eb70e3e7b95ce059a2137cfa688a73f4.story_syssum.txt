Jamarat is a re-enactment of an event when Prophet Abraham stoned the devil and rejected his temptations, according to Muslim traditions.
The government has erected three massive pillars and completed a $1.2 billion, five-story bridge nearby where pilgrims can toss stones.
About 3 million pilgrims move in a small geographic area at the same time wanting to do the same ritual.
Each van can take up to 14 pilgrims."
According to Mohammadi, the project has 509 advanced closed-circuit television cameras monitoring pilgrims' movements.
The stoning ritual is done over at least two days, where pilgrims stone three pillars at Mina -- believed to be where the Prophet Abraham stoned the devil when he tried to dissuade him from obeying God's orders to slaughter his son.
It's where pilgrims go around the black cube seven times counter-clockwise asking that their Lord accept their pilgrimage and grant them another visit to the holy city.
