(CNN)Wrapped up in a long brightly-colored scarf, which does little to contain her free-flowing curly hair, Nneka sits back quietly as she tries to bring to mind her very first memory of music.
In 2005, she released "Victim of Truth," a much-lauded debut that fused soulful beats, tasty hip-hop-and reflective ballads with politically-charged lyrics and black consciousness.
Boko Haram has always been an issue obviously for the past five, six years -- funny wise, there's a track in the album called "Pray For You" which I recorded when not too many people knew what was going with Boko Haram in the West.
People are afraid to express themselves politically, and even in their home -- I remember the way we grew up, I didn't look my father in the eye until I was 22; you call your father "Sir, Sir, Sir" -- apparently it's a form of respect, OK, but respect should not be mistaken with fear.
He [Goodluck Jonathan] says he wants to tackle Boko Haram, obviously every Nigerian is asking why now, he could had done it a long time ago...but I'm not good at the whole blaming game, I don't want to blame anybody but I pray that he comes up with a good idea for us if he is an honest and genuine guy.
Nneka: All I can say is that we do need proper leadership.
Nneka: My personal life always inspires me, in the first place, and then I try to expand it to the world.
Nneka: The way forward is going to be easier said than done, but tribalism is not they key.
Nneka: Being on tour for like five months; I mean you get used to the life, but [it's hard] when you're coming back home and then realizing that people move on when you're not around.
