(CNN) -- Reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward relied on FBI insider W. Mark Felt as a reliable but anonymous source for their stories on the Watergate scandal that led to President Richard Nixon's resignation in 1974.
He was one of many sources in Watergate who had both the intelligence and the courage to tell the truth.
AM: The way that he was portrayed by Hal Holbrook in "All the President's Men" was he would give your partner Bob Woodward a little bit of a tease and say, "I'm not going to tell you anything more than that; you've got to follow the trail."
Bernstein: Yeah.
So I think Mark Felt's confirming this information (and occasionally he gave us some important information that we hadn't obtained, toward the end, elsewhere), it was absolutely invaluable.
Bernstein: To both of us.
And we went to see Mark Felt, and we had a kind of wonderful couple of hours with him.
Bernstein: First time I had met him, yes.
Bernstein: First of all, I was aware that he was 95 years old and in the last stages of his life.
Would you agree?
The Constitution is more important in this situation than a president of the United States who breaks the law."
