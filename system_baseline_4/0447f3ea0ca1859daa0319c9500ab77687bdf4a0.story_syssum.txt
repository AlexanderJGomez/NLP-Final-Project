"Chelsea is the center of America for contemporary art," Zach Feuer, owner of Zach Feuer gallery, told CNN.
"I would not be surprised if, when it's all said and done, the damage that is done to our art world will be in the hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars in unrecoverable work," gallery owner Leo Koenig said.
From a back window he was able to see boxes on the ground floor that had floated up when flooding in his 1,800-square-foot basement nearly reached the ceiling.
"My common sense told me that if there was a foot and a half of water standing on 23rd Street, the world was about to end," he said.
From Eller's basement to those barely affected, galleries and conservators seem to agree that the priority right now is recovering as much work as possible and keeping it dry.
"The conservators were here immediately, there are trucks leaving with art constantly to get repaired," said Feuer, who estimates millions of dollars in damage to his gallery alone.
Newman is now using the space above her gallery to hold and restore other works.
This sentiment seems to be echoing through the galleries of the damaged neighborhood, and many have been adamant that Chelsea's art culture will not only recover but maintain its prestigious position within the art world.
"The thing about the New York gallery community is that it's an industry full of extremely intelligent, extremely capable people," gallery owner Cristin Tierney said.
