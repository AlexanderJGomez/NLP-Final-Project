In the midst of the fight against Islamist rebels seeking to turn the clock back to the 7th century, a Kurdish region in Syria has just approved a new law ordering equality for women.
It is a real transformation in the legal status of women.
We are the ones who share your ideas about human rights and equality.
The decree was issued by the Jazira district of Syria's Hasakeh province, about 100 miles from the now-legendary town of Kobani, where armed Kurdish men and women are holding their positions, battling to prevent the ultra-radical Islamic State, also known as ISIS, from overrunning their territory.
Although women have been a part of Kurdish fighting forces since long before ISIS swept across Syria and Iraq, women have fought for full equality.
ISIS has engaged in the systematic rape of women, and even young girls have been handed off as "wives" as a reward for militants.
In areas under ISIS rule, women are required to cover completely and may not leave their homes without a male relative.
Still, ISIS, too, claims it empowers women.
The women's battalions also help in body searches, preventing men dressed as women from moving through checkpoints.
There are reports of armed women stopping girls in the street, quizzing them on their knowledge of Islam and of ISIS rules.
In Kobani, about a third of the warriors are women.
To be sure, the Kurds don't have a perfect record on the treatment of women.
And the pressure from ISIS may just be moving them even farther along the road to equality.
