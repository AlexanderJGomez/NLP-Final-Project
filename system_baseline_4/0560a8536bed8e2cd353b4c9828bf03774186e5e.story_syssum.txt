(CNN) -- The Republican Senate primary in Mississippi had long been in the spotlight over nasty politics, but events just prior, during and now after the vote have placed the race in its own unusual category.
But late in the game, things took a bizarre turn and have gotten more complicated since the June 3 primary resulted in a runoff, which Cochran won three weeks later.
Dirty tricks: In May, three tea party supporters and apparent allies of McDaniel were arrested for conspiring to photograph Cochran's bedridden wife in a hospice in an apparent case of political dirty tricks.
Crying foul: Separated by less than 1,500 votes following the primary with McDaniel ahead, the two then turned their attention to a runoff won by Cochran with a narrow, but more comfortable margin of nearly 7,000 votes.
McDaniel's campaign and its tea party supporters are making the rounds of all 82 counties to look into voting records and still have a dozen stops to make.
$1,000 Reward: On Thursday, McDaniel's campaign announced $1,000 rewards for evidence of voter fraud.
Steve Fielder, a pastor in Mississippi, alleged the Cochran campaign was offering $15 for voters to support Cochran at the polls.
Claude McInnis, alleged that the chairman of the county's Republican Party worked with McInnis to allow voters who had voted for a Democrat in the primary to cast a ballot in the runoff -- which is illegal.
Why is it OK to harvest the votes of black people?"
Lawsuit: True the Vote, a conservative election watchdog, filed a lawsuit Tuesday in federal court against the Mississippi secretary of state and the state's Republican party calling for full, unrestricted access to voting records.
Churchwell said the state party was included because of the "shared responsibility" between state officials and the state's Republican party.
