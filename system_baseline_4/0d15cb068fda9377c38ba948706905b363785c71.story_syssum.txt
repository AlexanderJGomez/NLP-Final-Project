(CNN) -- The Space Shuttle Discovery launched late Thursday afternoon from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, marking the start of its 39th and final flight.
ET launch.
Five minutes in, NASA's official blog reported "a good separation for solid rocket boosters," which separated from the main shuttle after pushing the shuttle through Earth's lower atmosphere.
It has also carried 246 crew members, more than any space vehicle in history.
The last scheduled launch of Space Shuttle Endeavour is set for April 19 and will be commanded by Mark Kelly, the husband of U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who is recovering from being shot last month in Tucson, Arizona.
"What is not acceptable is the fact that the most powerful nation in the  world, the United States of America, finds itself in a situation that  we didn't do the proper planning to have a vehicle in place to replace  shuttle when it lands its last landing," Charles Bolden said.
