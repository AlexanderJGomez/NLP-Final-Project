(CNN) -- Marin Cilic made a winning return to the ATP circuit Monday after serving a reduced doping ban.
The decision allowed Cilic to enter the final regular season tournament on the main tour in the French capital and he took full advantage.
World No.1 Rafael Nadal, who is playing in Paris for the first time in four years, told gathered reporters that he was delighted to see Cilic return to action.
That's all.
Nadal will open his campaign later in week but the early headlines will surround players attempting to book their passages to the ATP World Tour Finals in London.
"The last tournament of the year is important," he told the official ATP Tour website.
I hope this year I can change that situation.
I hope to play well here and then we'll see."
