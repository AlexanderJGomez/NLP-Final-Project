She didn't notice she was pulling into a Delta employee parking lot, where she said she was waved through two security checkpoints and allowed to park.
It was the tarmac with a big airplane sitting there," Reynolds said.
The airport employee who let her into the secure area told her to go downstairs and go through security as she normally would, Reynolds said.
"TSA is conducting an investigation to determine how an individual without proper credentials accessed the secure area of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport via an airline employee parking lot."
"We have taken aggressive action with our security vendors at the parking lot to emphasize that all security procedures, especially verification of credentials, are strictly adhered to," said Delta spokesman Morgan Durrant in a statement.
