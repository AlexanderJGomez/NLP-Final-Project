(CNN) -- A 56-year-old married woman has won half of the second-largest Mega Millions jackpot in U.S. history and has taken the cash option, which after taxes, will be about $120 million, Georgia Lottery President Debbie Alford said Wednesday.
Alford gave a few details about Curry, saying she is married and had her daughter check online for the winning numbers after a radio announcer mentioned 7 was the Mega ball number.
"(Curry) had the radio on, and the announcer was talking about the Mega ball, which was seven," Alford said.
Alford said she suspects Curry called her boss to say she wouldn't be coming in to work because Curry met with lottery officials between 11 a.m. and noon.
Twenty ticket holders will win $1 million after matching all the numbers except the Mega ball.
The California winning ticket was sold at Jenny's Gift Shop in a San Jose strip mall, lottery officials said.
The odds of hitting the jackpot, which were 1 in 176 million, are now 1 in 259 million.
It's now 1 to 75.
