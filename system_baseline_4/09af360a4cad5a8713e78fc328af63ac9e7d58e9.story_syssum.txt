Smart, now 25 and married, spoke to CNN's Anderson Cooper Monday about her book "My Story," which she said tells 100% of what happened to her.
"I want them to know that these things do happen, but that doesn't mean that we have to be defined by it for the rest of your life.
Smart's horrific story began on the night of June 5, 2002, when Brian David Mitchell dragged the 14-year-old from her bedroom in her family's Salt Lake City home.
"He said 'I have a knife at your neck, don't make a sound, get up and come with me,'" Smart told Cooper.
"I kept looking, I kept waiting for something to happen, for some way for me to get away," she said.
because, in my mind, I wanted my parents to know what had happened to me," she said.
And then we kept going and I remember we got a little further and I stopped him again and I said 'Well, don't you realize what you're doing, I mean, if you get caught you'll spend the rest of your life in prison?'
"I was terrified when I got to the camp, but the scariest thing about the camp was this woman," she said.
I mean, if hugs could speak this hug would have said, 'You're mine, you will do exactly what I tell you to do.'"
I mean, not just once, multiple times a day."
I mean, just every time I thought it couldn't get worse, something always happened."
"You can never judge a child or a victim of any crime on what they should have done, because you weren't there and you don't know and you have no right just to sit in your armchair at home and say 'Well, why didn't you escape?
I mean, they just don't know," she said.
The second half of Smart's interview with Cooper, in which she reveals details of how she was rescued, will air on CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360" Tuesday night.
