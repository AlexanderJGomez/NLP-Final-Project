(CNN) -- Another State of the Union address, another road trip for President Barack Obama to push now-familiar policies that he said he would pursue on his own if Congress won't cooperate.
In his address on Tuesday, the President talked a good game of acting on his own if necessary, but his words also showed he knows that true progress depends on cooperation with a divided and recalcitrant Congress.
He said what?
First Class Cory Remsburg, a disabled war veteran who sat next to First Lady Michelle Obama and waved with wounded limbs to a prolonged standing ovation.
"A speech by Barack Obama is a lot like sex," said GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos.
"Let's make this a year of action," Obama said.
On issue after issue, he invited Congress to work with him but said he also would go it alone.
"We hope the President will join us in a year of real action -- by empowering people -- not by making their lives harder with unprecedented spending, higher taxes, and fewer jobs," she said.
On another major reform issue, Obama chided Republicans for trying to undermine his signature health care law that passed in 2010 without GOP support.
"The American people aren't interested in refighting old battles," Obama said.
Obama said he will order the U.S. Treasury to create a new federal retirement savings account called MyRA, a savings bond that would guarantee "a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in."
It will be available to those whose jobs don't offer traditional retirement savings programs, he said.
Even as he cited a growing economy and increasing corporate profits, Obama said average wages have been flat.
