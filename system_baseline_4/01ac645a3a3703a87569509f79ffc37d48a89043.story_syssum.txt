"Just not that one," Segovia says.
"Welcome home Victor Segovia," one neighbor said as she carried a handwritten sign greeting the miner into his home.
While Victor's brother Pedro Segovia waits under the scorching sun of Chile's Atacama desert, he nervously toys with a brand new Sony media player.
"We missed him a lot," Pedro Segovia said.
"He'll tell me at some point," Pedro Segovia said.
"For you with all my heart," Segovia wrote his mother Blanca.
But for the guest of honor just getting to the party will be almost as difficult as the previous legs of his journey.
Tripods and cameras are posted like sentries in front of the Segovia home.
Pushing against the wave of cameramen, Chilean police nearly have to carry the miner into his family's home.
Segovia appeared understandably worn from his ordeal and the crush of media attention.
"That was quite something," he said simply of the August 5 mine collapse.
Segovia said he missed his family terribly while in the mine.
Before he goes back to the party, Segovia makes it clear he is not completely free of the mine.
"Here you have nightmares until you realize you are out."
