Gary Stein, who founded the Armed Forces Tea Party, said his commanding officer at Camp Pendleton near San Diego has accused him of violating a catch-all military justice provision against conduct endangering "good order and discipline."
Stein came under scrutiny from Marine officials after saying he would not obey Obama's orders.
"The allegations drummed up against me are no more than an agenda by the Marine Corps to use me as an example," Stein said in a statement posted to his page.
"They have to make some sort of stand with this," he said.
Stein has said that has carefully followed the Defense Department directive.
Comments Tuesday on the page were largely, but not entirely, supportive of Stein.
Stein is not the first service member to face controversy over comments about Obama.
