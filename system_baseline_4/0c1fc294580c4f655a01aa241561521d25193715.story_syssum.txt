Why aren't power lines, for example, buried safely underground?
Because it costs so much to bury power lines, it's crucial that the expense yields value for electricity consumers, who will ultimately bear all the costs associated with providing electricity service.
As of 2012, about 39% of the customers in the United States reported having underground electricity service.
For its part, the regulator cannot directly fix the power lines but still must ensure that any money the utility spends provides value for consumers.
A 2010 study on undergrounding a portion of the electricity system in the District of Columbia for the Public Service Commission found that costs would increase rapidly as utilities tried to underground more of their service territory.
So while customers may see fewer outages as a result of undergrounding, the duration of those outages may increase.
Second, burying power lines does not always protect them from storm damage.
In short, whether a community should go underground with its power lines is a question to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the utility, its regulator and the government.
