Vardzia, Georgia (CNN) -- In an isolated mountain valley on the southern edge of the former Soviet Union stands a cliff honey-combed with caves.
They live much like their ancestors did, in spartan cave dwellings on the side of the cliff.
One of the monks who lives in the cliff is Father Lazar.
"In the winter this is a quiet place.
In fact, Father Lazar says aside from the monks, the only other people who live in this valley, are the nuns who inhabit a small convent beyond a bend in the river.
"For the priests, it is not very good because they make a lot of noise," Father Lazar says.
"Visitors to Georgia are going to Vardzia and there is no infrastructure there at all," says Tengiz Bendukidze, an executive with Rakeen, an Emirati real estate development company.
And we are going to build a 4-star hotel and villas also."
Executives at Rakeen say they are still working out the final concept of the new Vardzia hotel project.
"It's a bad idea to build a big hotel right there, directly across from Vardzia," he says.
"If there's going to be a bar or a night club there, then that's also not good."
