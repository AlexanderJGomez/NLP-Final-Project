In December, Velentzas and an undercover agent discussed the shooting deaths of two New York City police officers who were ambushed in Brooklyn.
Velentzas and Siddiqui repeatedly expressed support for violent jihad, the complaint said.
"As alleged, the defendants in this case carefully studied how to construct an explosive device to launch an attack on the homeland," Loretta Lynch, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a statement.
In February, Velentzas and the undercover agent drove past a Home Depot in Queens.
