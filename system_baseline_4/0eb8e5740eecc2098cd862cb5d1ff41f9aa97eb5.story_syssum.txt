And while the actor is set to play Wu-Tang Clan member Ol' Dirty Bastard in a forthcoming film about the rapper, Williams is most excited about his new role as an executive producer.
It was that eerie," the Brooklyn-born Williams said of his latest project, the independent film "Snow on tha Bluff," which will be released on DVD June 19.
From there, Williams reached out the director, asked to be an executive producer and offered to do what he could to promote the film and tell Snow's story, which he got to know more of when they met in tha Bluff.
I get paid to be you, what you really are,' " Williams said.
Williams also said playing the fearless, drug-dealer-robbing and seemingly invincible Omar actually put him in a dark place.
Williams said he also dealt with his own "racism" with "The Wire," especially when the first season with a predominantly black cast was followed with a second season with more white characters.
"I got real bitter and angry," he said of his initial response.

In his first leading role in a major film, Williams is set to play the iconic artist in the last two years of his life, as seen through the eyes of his manager, Jarred Weisfeld, a former VH1 intern.
Like the man himself, the movie about Ol' Dirty Bastard's life has been fodder for debate over everything from the title to the subject matter.
It was just a very unfortunate accident how he lost his life," said Williams, who did most of his research for the role by spending time with the late rapper's mother.
From Snow to Omar to Ol' Dirty Bastard, Williams believes he has found his calling.
"I feel like I've been given an opportunity to paint people that society would deem as 'the gangster,' 'the thug,' as a human being with raw emotions," he said.
