Hoh Indian Reservation, Washington (CNN) -- For the Hoh, life centers on the silver waters just off their reservation.
Those same waters now threaten the tribe's future.
"We'd see the waves and the logs coming," Benally said standing in the musty ruin of the home.
Although the lowlands where her family lived were always prone to flooding, Benally said the water rises more often now.
Ernest Penn, the tribe's fish and wildlife officer, is a constant presence on the river and sees the difference too.
According to a department study, the coast where the Hoh live could see an additional rise from climate change in sea levels of as much as 3 feet over the next century.
Last year, Penn decided to move away from the reservation.
To rescue the tribe's future the Hoh leadership decided to move most of the reservation to higher ground and purchased new land for the expansion.
For Tribal Chairperson Maria Lopez, the move away from the water won't come soon enough.
"What would happen," Lopez asked, "if a tsunami comes while we are here?"
