Who doesn't want to know how to make Skittles-infused vodka ("Vomit the rainbow") or create an anytime jersey dress out of an oversized T-shirt?
From the time-lapse pregnancy photo montage to gender-reveal cupcakes to lunchbox hand-pies shaped like baby octopi, Pinterest left no familial event untouched.
It's not that these ideas were overly complicated.
It got me with the Tooth Fairy.
When I was kid, the Tooth Fairy, if the wench remembered to come all, would leave a quarter.
By the time my oldest daughter's first tooth was threatening to wriggle free, I'd hyped up the Tooth Fairy significantly.
"Me too?"
"I'm not sure what she's going to bring.
Unfortunately, as the day went on, the business of life combined with my chronic tendency to procrastinate proved more powerful than the Pinterest-derived Tooth Fairy extravaganza I'd planned.
Perhaps the gas station around the corner had candy ... wait no, the Tooth Fairy wouldn't give candy; that'd be like a doctor handing out Big Macs.
I found a few mini candy canes, but no, the tooth fairy would clearly be non-denominational.
Combined with a few chocolate chips ... that's something the Tooth Fairy would whip together in her Middle-Earth kitchen, right?
She was wearing a T-shirt dress.
The bags looked like something you'd sneak into a movie theater to save $5.
People even make matching miniature envelopes.
"Oh I was just seeing the Tooth Fairy out ..."), I still felt uneasy.
It just felt right at the time.
By now, I was so tired that I was having a semi-out-of-body experience and felt like I really was the Tooth Fairy.
About 3 a.m., I remembered seeing a website where you can superimpose pictures of a fairy on a photo of your sleeping child.
"There is fairy dust everywhere!"
I'm still trying to decide what the Tooth Fairy will bring the next time she pays a visit.
