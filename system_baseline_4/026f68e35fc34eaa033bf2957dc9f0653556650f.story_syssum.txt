Sarah Palin has called plans to build a community center and mosque near the site of the 9/11 terror attack in New York City an "unnecessary provocation."
He said the project "is not a mosque."
Voices opposing the center dominated a hearing on the subject last week.
"I'm ashamed to be an American today," said Rakif Gathwari, a Muslim-American who reminded the crowd that people from many countries and religions died in the attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.
Some Muslim community leaders say the project could provide an opportunity for improving interfaith relations.
