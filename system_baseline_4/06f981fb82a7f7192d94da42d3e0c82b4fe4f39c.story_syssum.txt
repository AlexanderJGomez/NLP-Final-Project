Bekaa Valley, Lebanon (CNN) -- In my nine years as a UNICEF ambassador, I've been to camps for people displaced by conflict.

More than a million people are in urgent need of humanitarian aid.
Syrian children can enroll in public schools in Lebanon as long as there is space, but many schools are already at capacity.
But for the kids I met, and millions more like them all across the region, politics is the farthest thing from their minds.
UNICEF still needs $172 million this year to assist Syrian refugees across the region, which means programs to support these children are threatened.
They need our help to stay alive, to go to school and to be kids again.
