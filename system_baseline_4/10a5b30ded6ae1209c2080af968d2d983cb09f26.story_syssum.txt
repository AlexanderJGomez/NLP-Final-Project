At least 50 rockets were fired at Israel after the cease-fire expired Friday morning, the Israel Defense Forces said.
The IDF said it "targeted terror sites across the Gaza Strip."
Hamas, the Islamic militant group that holds power in Gaza, said that Palestinian officials at peace talks in Cairo hadn't agreed to extend the truce but would continue negotiations.
In Hebron, at least 40 people were hurt during clashes between Palestinians and Israeli military and border police near the old city.
Islamic Jihad and the Al-Nasser Salah al-Din Brigades, two militant factions that have fought alongside Hamas in Gaza under the banner of "the resistance," said they fired rockets at Israel on Friday.
Two rockets fired from Gaza hit southern Israel a few hours before the truce was due to end Friday, the IDF said.
A Palestinian member of the negotiating delegation, not authorized to speak to the media directly about the talks, told CNN on condition of anonymity that the two sides failed to agree on the wording of a cease-fire extension that included the Palestinian demand for Israel to lift the blockade on Gaza.
Israel said Thursday it was willing to extend the cease-fire unconditionally.
Abu Zuhri said the Palestinian delegation arrived in Cairo five days in advance in an effort to reach a cease-fire agreement, but the Palestinian delegation did not receive an Israeli response to its demands.
As result, the Palestinian delegation, collectively, decided not to extend the cease fire agreement," said Abu Zuhri.
The message added, "Your statement said that you were disappointed that the parties were unable to agree to an extension of the ceasefire.
It's unclear how many of the Palestinian dead were militants.
Additionally, about 65,000 Gaza residents lost their homes to the fighting, according to U.N. estimates.
