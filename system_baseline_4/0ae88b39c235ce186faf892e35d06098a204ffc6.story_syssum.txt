Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- In 1998, Kevin Warwick became what some people call "the world's first cyborg."
This isn't just for fun, Warwick tells Motherboard.tv, VBS' technology channel.
Warwick doesn't want to turn into a robot: He wants to be a better human.
Technologists, meanwhile, see "augmented reality" applications for smartphones as doing something similar for our brains, fortifying them for life in a world overflowing with data.
"Technology, directly integrated with the brain, can help overcome some problems people have," says Warwick.
Someday, says Warwick, humans could become "a curiosity for the machines."
