Ashley and Tyson Gardner tried unsuccessfully for years to get pregnant.
Ashley Gardner: We tried EVERYTHING under the sun.
Gardner: So about a year and a half ago I decided to open up about our infertility struggles.
It was getting hard getting asked ALL THE TIME why I didn't have children yet.
I found that so many others were going through the same thing!
We just announced on our private pages to our friends and family and the picture was so priceless that everyone started sharing it and we started getting hundreds of friend requests from people we didn't know.
But at that time we literally had NEVER even thought once about this being a possibility.
My husband is the oldest of 10 children so he is ready to take on anything!
He is the favorite uncle to all our nieces and nephews.
After eight long, heartbreaking years of infertility and every month passing by with a negative pregnancy test you do get discouraged!
My endometriosis (cause of our infertility) was so bad that we found during the IVF process that it had compromised my eggs.
Gardner: Only thing I can think of is what I stated above.
