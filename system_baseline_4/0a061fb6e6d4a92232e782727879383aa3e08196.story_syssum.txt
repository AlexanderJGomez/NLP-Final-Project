(CNN) -- Egypt has agreed to allow two Iranian warships to cross through the Suez Canal in a move that puts the country's new military regime in a prickly position with its Israeli neighbor.
Before that, Egypt did not allow Israeli ships to sail through the canal.
Schenker said the Iranians had asked for a frigate -- the Alvand -- and a military supply ship -- the Kharg -- to cross into the Mediterranean.
It raises tension, particularly in this time of transition in Egypt," Schenker said.
Iran said earlier that the flotilla was on a yearlong intelligence-gathering and training mission to prepare cadets to defend Iran's cargo ships and oil tankers from the threat of attack by Somali pirates, according to the semi-official Fars News Agency.
Asked whether he was concerned about the ships' travel plans, he said, "It's not really about the ships.
The Israeli Defense Ministry said it was monitoring the movement of the Iranian ships and alerted its allies.
Millions of barrels of oil move through the Suez every day en route to Europe and North America.
