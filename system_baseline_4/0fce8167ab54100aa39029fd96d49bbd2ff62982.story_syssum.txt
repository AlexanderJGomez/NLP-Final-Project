Thomas Murray says doctors have responsibility for welfare of children conceived through IVF procedure.
For now, we can put aside the lifeboat problem: A human uterus is not built for eight passengers; the odds for each child to be born alive and healthy go down as the number in the lifeboat goes up.
What this case really does is split wide open a fault line running through infertility treatment in American medicine.
The point of infertility treatment, after all, is to create a child.
What happens, though, when the client's request shows little consideration or regard for the welfare of the would-be children?
What happens if a woman in her early 30s with six children wants eight embryos implanted all at once?
Carrying more than a couple of fetuses is dangerous to the pregnant woman and to the health and survival of the fetuses in her womb.
Here's the rub: Her concern was the ultimate well-being of the child that the clinic was being asked to help create.
The American Society for Reproductive Medicine acknowledged in a 2004 report that fertility programs may withhold services when they can provide "well-substantiated judgments" that the child will not receive adequate care.
Providers can abdicate almost all responsibility to anticipate the welfare of the children they help create by claiming "an obligation to treat all patients who would benefit from medical treatment."
