He said earlier in a statement that he was sorry for the trouble he has caused, said New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly.
Police found human remains in Aron's freezer and a trash bin which they believe are those of the boy, who went missing Monday afternoon.
Police said Aron, 35, made statements Wednesday implicating himself in the death of Kletzky.
Kletzky was supposed to meet his parents after walking seven blocks from his summer day camp, but became lost and asked the suspect for directions, Kelly said.
Police said Aron went to the wedding, but have not been able to confirm that Kletzky actually went with him, as no one has said they've seen him.
Aron, a clerk at a maintenance supply company, did not appear to have known Kletzky, Kelly said.
Kelly said that statements made by the suspect indicated that he kidnapped Kletzky and, as a neighborhood search for the boy intensified, he became panicked and killed him.
He also enjoyed karaoke.
"Even as I talked to him not long ago, everything was fine, no indications that anything was wrong."
