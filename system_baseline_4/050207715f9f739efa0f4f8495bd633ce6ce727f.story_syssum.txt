Washington (CNN) -- In a dramatic slap at congressional authority, a divided Supreme Court has struck down a key part of a law that denies to legally married same-sex couples the same federal benefits provided to heterosexual spouses.
The case examined whether the federal government can deny tax, health and pension benefits to same-sex couples in states where they can legally marry.
But the federal government didn't recognize Windsor's same-sex marriage, and she was forced to assume an estate tax bill much larger than those that other married couples would have to pay.
"For same-sex couples who wished to be married, the state (of New York) acted to give their lawful conduct a lawful status.
Thirty-five states have laws banning same-sex marriage.
Under DOMA, Social Security, pension and bankruptcy benefits, along with family medical leave protections and other federal provisions, did not apply to gay and lesbian couples legally married in states that recognize such unions.
We owed both of them better.
Windsor was in New York when the ruling came down.
Children born today will grow up in a world without DOMA, and those same children who happen to be gay will be free to love and get married as Thea and I did, but with the same federal benefits, protections and dignity as everyone else," Windsor said.
The Defense of Marriage law was defended in the high court by House Republicans, after Obama concluded the law was unconstitutional.
A bill known as the Respect for Marriage Act is working its way through Congress and would repeal DOMA.
That law does not prohibit states from allowing same-sex marriages, but it also does not force states to recognize such marriages performed in other states.
