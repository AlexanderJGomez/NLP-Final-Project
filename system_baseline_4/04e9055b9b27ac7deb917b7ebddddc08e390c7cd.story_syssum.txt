In December, attorneys for Edwards asked again to delay his criminal trial, saying Edwards had an unspecified medical issue.
The motion to continue the trial for 60 days filed on December 22 said Edwards' "unexpected" medical issue is explained in a sealed exhibit.
Attorneys for Edwards, who was the Democratic vice-presidential nominee in 2004 alongside John Kerry, also say in the motion a January trial would not give them enough time to prepare, especially given the "unusual and complex" prosecution.
A chief issue in the upcoming trial is whether money given to support Edwards' mistress, Rielle Hunter, by the then-candidate's benefactors should have been considered campaign donations, a contention Edwards' team has disputed.
They maintain the money was a gift to Hunter.
