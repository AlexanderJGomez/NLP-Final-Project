Why would they do that?
Although it is extremely distressing that children engage in these types of behavior, I don't find it surprising it all.
First, I am surprised that, before this study, most people assumed that children wouldn't engage in a behavior that is so common in teenagers and young adults.
Anyone who has children knows that they are subject to the same powerful emotions as adults.
After all, children are subject to extremely powerful emotions and have a tremendous capacity for fear and worry.
The final thing about non-suicidal self-injury that surprises me is that it occurs at all.
This suggests to me that self-injury might be related in some ways to a process, or processes, that have evolved over time.
This is more often the case with women and usually involves cutting the skin, although I've treated patients over the years who were addicted to other types of self-damaging behavior, such as hitting themselves in the face or inserting sharp objects into various bodily orifices.
People who engage in non-suicidal self-injury typically are struggling with other psychiatric conditions, such as a mood or personality disorder, so they are at increased risk of suicide generally.
In fact, the demographics of suicide and non-suicidal self-injury suggest that in some ways they are polar opposites.
Young adult females make 25 suicide attempts for every one completed suicide.
Our growing understanding of this fact has led to a proposal by the American Psychiatric Association that non-suicidal self-injury be given its own diagnostic category in the next edition of the DSM, which is the "bible of psychiatric diagnoses" in the U.S.
