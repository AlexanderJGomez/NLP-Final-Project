(CNN) -- Not so long ago, the idea of a Casey Anthony movie seemed like a certainty.
The cable channel Lifetime would seem the logical home for an Anthony movie -- it aired the Knox, Holloway and Rockefeller films, and it's in production on a movie about murder suspect Drew Peterson (with Rob Lowe in the lead).
But when CNN asked the network if it was pursuing an Anthony project, Lifetime said it had "nothing in development."
Actress Niecy Nash, who told CNN she watched "every minute" of the trial, is among those angered about the prospect of Anthony cashing in by selling the rights to her story.
"I do think there should be a movie made" about the case, Cooper said.
The possibility of a movie has inevitably spawned water cooler talk in Hollywood about who should play Anthony.
To play Casey Anthony's father, the white-haired George Anthony, we heard suggestions of John O'Hurley of "Seinfeld" fame, Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Blake.
Some people remain convinced there will be a Casey Anthony movie, including The Hollywood Reporter's Matthew Belloni.
"That conflict presents good fodder for a film."
