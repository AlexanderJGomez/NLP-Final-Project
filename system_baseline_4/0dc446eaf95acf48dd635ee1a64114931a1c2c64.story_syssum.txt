Jeremy McGuire: It's going as good as it can be.
EW: How much did you know that you were getting evicted?
EW: Yeah, it's true.
McGuire: Ah, well, I was making deals all the way up to the last day, so I didn't know until the last day.
I mean, I knew I was going with or without her vote.
McGuire: Yes.
EW: I think had Kaitlin not used her power of veto, you both would actually still be in the house.
McGuire: I don't know.
McGuire: Ah no.
McGuire: Yeah, I was warned a little bit about some of the things.
But I know who I am, and I know that no matter what anybody says, it's not going to change my feelings about myself.
McGuire: Yeah, I'm not racist, sexist, or homophobic, so I mean, I guess everything can be taken out of context.
EW: Well, I don't know how much some of these words can be twisted or misinterpreted.
EW: When we talked to Nick after he got voted out, he said that on some level when you're playing a game you don't want to rock the boat, but then you don't want to be that person who just stands by idly while someone is making such racial slurs and just saying some really unfathomable things.
You know, I -- like you said, you don't want to rock the boat.
McGuire: [Laughs] I don't know because I don't know what you're talking about.
McGuire: Yeah, I'm going back to the boat.
EW: Yeah?
McGuire: I think me and Kaitlin will.
How so?
McGuire: Yes.
EW: Yeah.
McGuire: Exactly.
