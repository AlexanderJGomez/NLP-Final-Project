(CNN) -- Maurice Sendak, author of the classic children's book "Where the Wild Things Are," has died, a spokeswoman for HarperCollins Publishers said Tuesday.
Former President Bill Clinton called him the "king of dreams."
"Where the Wild Things Are" won the Caldecott Medal in 1964, considered the most prestigious award for illustrated children's books.
It was in the news again when President Obama read the story to children at this year's White House Easter egg roll.
His books became children's classics, but in an interview with The Atlantic last year, Sendak said he didn't set out to be known as a writer for children.
I don't even know what a children's book is.
"Children can distort, and play with figures and ideas, with a fluidity that strains us -- which we grow out of," he said.
"My Brother's Book" will be published in February of next year.
