Reeves had been held in the Pasco County jail without bond since he shot and killed 43-year-old Navy veteran Chad Oulson after a confrontation over Oulson's text messaging inside a movie theater in the Tampa suburb of Wesley Chapel.
"It is unbelievably unfair."
Soon after that, a "very agitated" Reeves left the theater, then returned a few minutes later.
Escobar said Friday that Reeves "used the law of self-defense to preserve his life just like every citizen has the right to do," and described Oulson's conduct in the theater as violent.
But Grimaldi warned Friday that with Reeves back on the street, it could happen again.
