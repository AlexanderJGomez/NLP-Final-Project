The United States and the European Union "stand with the people of Ukraine" in their fight for the right to choose alliances with countries other than Russia, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Saturday.
The protesters have been in Kiev's Independence Square, or Maidan, since November, when President Viktor Yanukovych reversed a decision to sign a long-awaited trade deal with the European Union and turned instead toward Russia.
"Russia and other countries should not view the European integration of their neighbors as a zero-sum game," Kerry said.
As people across the country are taking to the streets, Ukraine's political destiny is still in the balance."
"Whatever the geopolitics, we have offered Ukraine a closer association with the European Union, the countries to its west.
And not against the great neighboring nation to its east, with which it shares a history and culture.
The future of Ukraine belongs with the European Union."
Lavrov also said the United States and the European Union appeared to be trying to push their own ideas on Ukraine.
They say the new amnesty bill -- which only comes into force if protesters vacate seized government buildings and unblock roads and squares -- is unacceptable.
"We are deeply concerned by increasing reports of protesters disappearing and being beaten and tortured, as well as by attacks on journalists," Carney said.
Ukraine's Interior Ministry has said it is investigating what happened to Bulatov.
