(CNN) -- The family of the man authorities say was dismembered by a Canadian porn actor called for the suspect's quick extradition Tuesday and expressed hope that their "devastating situation" could become something positive.
As the only son in the family, he was our pride and hope," his family said in a written statement issued Tuesday.
"We are calling for the extradition of the murder suspect back to Canada as soon as possible in order to bring justice and peace to our family, the Chinese community and the whole society," they said.
Police say they believe Magnotta killed and dismembered Lin and posted a 10-minute video of the slaying online.
The mailings and the discovery of other body parts behind Magnotta's apartment triggered an international manhunt.
