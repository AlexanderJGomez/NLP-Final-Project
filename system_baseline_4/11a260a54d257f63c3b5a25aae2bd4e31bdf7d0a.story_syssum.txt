(CNN) -- Syrian commanders say their troops along the border with Iraq are making strides in nabbing militants intent on staging suicide attacks in Baghdad.
Syrian commanders were interviewed by CNN along the border, where Syria and the United States have a complicated relationship.
The Syrian government "began limited cooperation with the United States in the global war against terrorism" after the September 11, 2001, attacks, the U.S. State Department has said.
Al-Khaled said Syrian troop outposts are strung along the vast, sandy 385-mile Syria-Iraq border, with 12 soldiers per post.
These jihadi groups belong to different nationalities, such as Egyptians, Saudis, Moroccans, Tunisians, and Libyans that fight in Iraq," Al-Khaled said.
The Syrian military said it has no communication with U.S. commanders along the border -- something that troubles Syrian commanders.
Americans say the errors are tactical or human, he said, but he doubts those assertions because of the U.S. military's acumen and resources.
Mohammed Askari, spokesman for Iraq's Defense Ministry, declined to comment, saying these are Multi-National Forces issues.
