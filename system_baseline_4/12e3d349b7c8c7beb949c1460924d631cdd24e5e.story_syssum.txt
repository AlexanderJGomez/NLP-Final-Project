But if the state of Texas has its way, Reed will be executed without those tests ever being conducted.
The fate of the DNA testing is the subject of a hearing in a Bastrop County court, scheduled for Tuesday.
Fennell was a police officer who was accused of committing acts of sexual violence and was ultimately sentenced to 10 years in prison for sexually assaulting a woman he took into police custody.
The prospect of finding that Reed is innocent would deliver a resounding condemnation of the state's criminal justice process -- its detectives, prosecutors, defense attorneys, judges, jurors and appellate courts.
The state has taken formidable strides toward a more accurate criminal process.
Texas also boasts a statewide Criminal Justice Integrity Unit that recommends lessons learned from wrongful convictions and oversees policy reform.
Moreover, Anderson, who had since become a district judge in Williamson County, was disbarred for his acts and briefly carted off to jail.
But the state has an obligation to Reed, and to its citizenry in whose name it is about to execute Reed, to test every bit of remaining evidence.
