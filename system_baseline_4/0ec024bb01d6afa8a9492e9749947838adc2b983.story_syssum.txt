An attorney for White's family said that because White was being held in solitary confinement at the Prince George's County Correctional Center, a corrections officer would have had to let whoever killed the prisoner into his cell.
"The killing of the officer is absolutely abhorrent, but also, Mr. White was presumed innocent and deserved his day in court just like any other citizens," Johnson said Monday night.
The FBI's Baltimore field office said it has opened a civil rights investigation into White's death.
White family attorney Bobby Henry said there are only two ways someone could get into solitary confinement.
"The family of Ronnie White is absolutely, unequivocally outraged, incensed and deeply saddened that the life of their loved one could be taken so cold[ly], so callously," Henry said Tuesday.
White had not had the opportunity to meet with an attorney, Henry said.
Henry said White's family was not notified of his death until several hours after it occurred.
"At this very moment, the family has not even seen the body of their loved one," Henry said.
"We'll follow the evidence wherever it leads," he said.
