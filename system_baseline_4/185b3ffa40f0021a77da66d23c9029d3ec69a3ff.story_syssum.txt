Singer Phil Everly -- one half of the groundbreaking, smooth-sounding, record-setting duo, the Everly Brothers -- has died, a hospital spokeswoman said.
Rolling Stone labeled the Everly Brothers "the most important vocal duo in rock," having influenced the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Simon & Garfunkel and many other acts.
"The amount of music that can be directly traced to the Everly Brothers is incredible," wrote one admirer on Twitter.
Phil and Don were born in the business, the offspring of country and western singers Margaret and Ike Everly.
In 1957, they found a Felice and Boudleaux Bryant song, "Bye Bye Love."
"Bye Bye Love" was "the first thing that really killed me," Paul Simon once recalled.
By the 1970s, the pair was performing in a band that also included legends Warren Zevon and Waddy Wachtel.
Their remaining years were highlights by occasional shows, hall of fame inductions and various other honors, including a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997.
