ET), Hannover police press officer Stefan Wittke said in a statement.
Enke captained Hannover 96, a team who currently lie tenth in Germany's Bundesliga top division,  and had been capped by his national side eight times after making his debut aged 29.
"We are in a state of shock," said team manager Oliver Bierhoff in a statement from the German Football Federation.
The German Football Federation (DFB) said Enke always said he wanted to play for the national team at the 2010 World Cup.
The couple's two-year-old daughter died in 2006 from a heart condition, and Honigstein said the loss of his child had taken a toll on Enke.
"I don't know why and how this happened," said Martin Kind, the chairman of Hannover 96.
Fellow players said they believed that Enke had been suffering depression.
