'Planet Solar' would be the world's fastest fully solar-powered boat and is projected to cross the Atlantic in two weeks.
If all goes according to plan, the boat will begin sailing summer 2010 -- first in European waters and then around the world.
Planet Solar will be covered in 470 square meters of solar panels -- the equivalent of two tennis courts.
Twenty-three percent of absorbed sunlight will be converted into energy that the boat can run on, compared with 17 percent for average panels, according to Planet Solar's project manager, Danny Faigaux of Grand Chelem Management.
Batteries on Planet Solar will be able to store enough energy gathered from the sun to allow the boat to sail in poor conditions for three days, said Faigaux.
Famous French sailor Gerard D'Abouville will skipper the boat alongside Domjan.
Up to 500 people at any one time will be will be able to visit the village's three inflatable "spheres" to learn more about Planet Solar, ecology and economy.
