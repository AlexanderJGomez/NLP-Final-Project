(CNN) -- On Thursday, Scotland goes to the polls to consider leaving the United Kingdom.
And while the English are known for introversion and a terror of being noticed, the heat generated by the independence referendum has been a testament to the Scots' uncompromising desire to say what they're really thinking.
English fields give way to massive Caledonian hills covered in green trees with bald patches of purple flowers.
But it's precisely these differences that have made the Union between our countries so remarkable -- and so important.
And, as such, Scotland's presence in the Union has been sustained hitherto largely by good will.
Many Scots turned toward independence as an alternative way of ordering their affairs (while many Englishmen drifted toward the conservative United Kingdom Independence Party).
In fact, the opposite is true.
We are predicted to overtake the perfidious French in the size of our economy by 2020 -- making us the fifth biggest in the world.
But it is still one of the most powerful in the world, boasts a nuclear deterrent (moored in Scotland) and is a lynchpin of the Atlantic alliance.
The army is perhaps at the heart of the emotional case for the Union.
Every New Year, we Britons sing "Auld Lang Syne" -- written by the Scottish poet Robert Burns.
To the Union and the world, the Scots have brought poetry both sublime and hilariously bad.
If Scotland votes this week for independence, we will divorce with dignity (excepting a few rows about debt and nuclear weapons).
But the United Kingdom will miss her dearly.
