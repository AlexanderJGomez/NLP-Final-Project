But one thing I, and I'm sure many of you, think we understand is obesity.
We know how people gain weight, and we think we know how to lose it.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that obesity-related medical costs were almost $150 billion in 2008, and the cost in health related expensed for an average person who was obese was more than $1,400.
Few of us dispute that we need to do something about this problem.
I know I've told people that making small, sustained lifestyle changes is the best way to lose weight over time.
I also tell them that setting unrealistic weight goals can actually sabotage your efforts.
People will say that eating more fruits and vegetables is a great way to lose weight.
But studies show that, on their own, eating more of them without making other behavioral changes doesn't result in any weight loss.
In other words, it's not necessarily bad to snack outside of usual meal times.
Studies do show that you can absolutely overcome genetic and familial factors to lose weight.
Over the past five years, my wife and I have lost quite a bit of weight.
Each time, I had ambitious goals of 15 pounds or more in two to three months, and each time I really restricted my caloric intake.
I avoid fried foods almost entirely, and I can't remember the last time I ate in a fast food restaurant.
I tell you this because more and more, I think that the journey to sustained weight loss is a very personal and individual path.
But one thing I doubt will ever be proved false is that it's much easier not to gain the weight in the first place than to take it off later.
