Almost symbolic of this change is the significant deal between social networking web site MySpace and three major record labels -- Sony BMG, Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group -- to form MySpace Music.
MySpace Music will allow users to listen to any song from the catalogs of the music giants for free.
While most experts believe record labels and the wider music industry have a strong future, there are mixed feelings about MySpace Music as a panacea for album sales.
Long-time music industry figure Bob Lefsetz was more critical of the new venture.
Avalon, however, told CNN he was optimistic about its chances.
Working against the record labels is a plethora of other online music promoters.
Not for a second, said Avalon.
But, if you are talking about someone who wants a worldwide hit or to sell a million or more CDs there's still no way to do that other than through a major record label," Avalon said.
Lefsetz told CNN that record labels had too many valuable catalogs to disappear, but he felt they would decline if they did not find a new business model.
"It's (album sales) probably going to continue to decline, but not at the level we have seen.
Lefsetz instead sees the future in a new business model for selling music, which offers the sale of bundled music at cheaper prices.
Dubber, meanwhile, is not convinced that the music industry will find a new model.
As fresh developments are realized, and the nature of music "sales" transforms, Avalon suggests the way in which we define "successful" records will need to change.
He questions whether it would be fair to celebrate artists only for their album sales when other musicians may not gain the same recognition for having 500,000 downloads from a Web site.
