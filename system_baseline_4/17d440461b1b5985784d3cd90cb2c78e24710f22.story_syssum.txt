Google launched a tool called Helpouts on Tuesday in which people can pay to get help from experts over a live video chat similar to Google Hangouts.
To start, Google has more than 1,000 providers signed up to offer things such as music lessons, cooking demonstrations and basic home repair tips.
There are eyeliner tutorials, cooking lessons and home improvement instructions.
But some problems and lessons need more than a one-sided demonstration.
Manber said Helpouts remove space and time barriers to make getting professional services more efficient and convenient.
Osi Imeokparia, director of product management, had a cooking teacher show her how to properly zest a lemon, and a home repair expert talked her through patching a hole in drywall.
Making its Helpouts free is smart marketing for Sephora, which can suggest its own products during the video sessions.
For now, Google is screening people and companies that want to offer their services through Helpouts.
Google Helpouts are HIPPA compliant to address privacy concerns, and Google is checking credentials for any providers in the medical field.
Companies already offer therapy sessions and one-on-one physician appointments over video.
Payment is handled by Google Wallet, and all the prices are set by the experts offing the Helpouts.
People who want to share their expertise for free could also flock to Helpouts, according to Manber, who said it could open up a whole new new way to volunteer.
