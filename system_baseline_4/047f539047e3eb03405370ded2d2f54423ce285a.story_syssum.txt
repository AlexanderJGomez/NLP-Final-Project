Since 2008, an independent panel of experts that advises the federal government on preventive care has discouraged the use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests -- a type of blood test -- to screen for cancer in men ages 75 and up.
According to a research letter published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association, PSA testing rates in men over age 75 have remained steady since the panel released its guidelines in 2008.
Treatments, including surgery and radiation, may be riskier than continuing to monitor a tumor, since they carry a risk of incontinence and sexual dysfunction.
Another, more troubling possibility is that some prostate cancer specialists are recommending PSA tests to collect the reimbursement fee and generate business.
"Physicians and patients latch onto the concept of screening for cancer and catching cancers early," Eggener says.
In 2011, the task force released draft guidelines that extended its recommendation against PSA testing to men of all ages.
Even among men in the 75-and-over bracket, Eggener says, screening might make sense for certain patients.
