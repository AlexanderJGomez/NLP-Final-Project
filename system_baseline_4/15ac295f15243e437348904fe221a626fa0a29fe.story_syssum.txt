(EW.com) -- James Cameron, in "Avatar," is the one American filmmaker -- at least to my eyes -- who has truly knocked the 3-D ball out of the park.
That, however, is the only time in the movie that Cameron uses 3-D to conjure a comin'-at-ya View-Master effect.
Of course, that might also be because no movie ever needed 3-D less than "Titanic."
We hardly have the vocabulary to describe a cornball love story, built around images of catastrophe startling enough to make your eyes pop, that isn't just swoony or awesome but, in fact, profound.
That's "Titanic."
What a difference one global economic meltdown and the rise of our own gilded one percent makes!
The other way that "Titanic" has gained with the years is that it's all but impossible to watch the sinking of the Titanic itself -- an instant human abyss almost beyond imagining -- without thinking of 9/11.
Some have called it callow, but I implore you to go back and see Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in this movie and watch how dazzlingly spontaneous and multi-faceted their chemistry is.
In recent years, a hint of off-putting harshness has crept into Winslet's work (in "Revolutionary Road" and "Mildred Pierce," she did too much gloomy suffering for our sins), but in "Titanic" she plays Rose as a spiky princess, trapped by privilege, who allows herself to melt like a girl and, in doing so, melts her own prison and finds herself as a woman.
Rose, with her hint of a Jane Austen dilemma (if she follows her bliss and goes off with Jack, it will leave her family in ruins), is the young feminist who now has the peril, as well as pleasure, of choice.
To watch "Titanic" again is to do nothing less than enter a movie and come out the other side, with one's spirit feeling just a little bit larger.
