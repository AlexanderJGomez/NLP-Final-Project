(CNN) -- It's been sort of a rough week for Google+.
"Google+ is a knee-jerk reaction, a study in short-term thinking, predicated on the incorrect notion that Facebook is successful because they built a great product," Yegge wrote in what was supposed to be an internal memo.
Facebook is successful because they built an entire constellation of products by allowing other people to do the work.
"Some people spend all their time on Mafia Wars," he wrote.
The memo comes on the heels of a report from Chitika Insights, a Web analytics firm, saying traffic on Google+ has plummeted 60% since it opened to the public on September 20.
"It would appear that although high levels of publicity were able to draw new traffic to Google+, few of them saw reason to stay," Chitika said in its report, released Friday.
"If Google's management truly believed in Google+ as the future of the company, they would be more engaged."
