(CNN) -- Israelis looking to know when to take cover are turning to their smartphones to get real-time notifications after Hamas fires rockets from Gaza.
Red Alert receives notifications when rockets are being launched from Gaza, and automatically sends out a push notification to users via the downloaded app.
Sprung works full time at a software development company, and tends to Red Alert in his free time.
Once the app is downloaded, users can select which Israeli cities for which they want to get alerts.
Today, Sprung tells CNN, there are approximately 290,000 Android users and 300,000 iPhone users worldwide, based on information from Apple's iTunes store and Google Play store.
The Android app isn't available outside of Israel due to limited server space; instead users with an Android device wanting to receive updates can do so through the "Yo" app.
The time it takes for Israeli's to seek shelter varies, based on how far they are from the Gaza border.
"In Israel, you might be in a closed room not near the sirens, so this new app allows you to know when something's going on.
