A new Pew Research Center study shows that millennial women are entering the workplace at near wage parity, with the narrowest pay gap on record.
But until women are paid the same as men, we will never be truly equal.
The wage gap has functioned across history to make women dependent on men as providers.
Millennial women can get involved by letting their representatives know they want legislation that addresses wage parity for men and women.
Young women are far more likely than men their age to cite the continued existence of the wage gap and the reality -- supported by a glance at a recent study on the stagnant role of women on corporate boards -- that men have it easier when it comes to getting the top job.
It's much less scary to imagine sexism as something that happens to other women.
But feminism isn't about making it possible for a few women to get power.
Some may take from this new study that millennial women, despite the narrowing wage gap, have a bleak view of their future.
