(CNN) -- The race to the South Pole is off -- although the trek still continues for Prince Harry and teams of wounded veterans.
"It was becoming evident that there was a higher degree of stress imposed on the team members, due to unprecedented terrain on the plateau," said Parker, a former British soldier who co-founded Walking With The Wounded in 2010.
Swedish actor and "True Blood" star Alexander Skarsgard is an honorary member of the U.S. team, while Dominic West, perhaps best known for his role as McNulty in "The Wire," joins veterans wounded in combat from the Commonwealth nations of Canada and Australia.
The three teams of seven participants each represent the United Kingdom, United States and the Commonwealth, which consists of several countries long affiliated with the British empire.
The participants on Sunday are set to resuming the walk, hoping to traverse the 70 remaining miles to the South Pole "with no stress being placed on the teams ... enabling them all to do this in their own time," Parker explained.
