I dialed the number and signed up with a private cord blood storage bank on the spot.
Cord blood is what remains in the vessels of the placenta and the portion of the umbilical cord still attached to it after birth.
Each private cord blood bank charges different fees.
Otherwise, families are encouraged to donate their newborn's cord blood to a public bank (if accessible in the area) for free, much like donating blood or an organ; in other words, the donated unit is not reserved for the family who provided it.
The National Marrow Donor Program offers the related Donor Cord Blood Program, which allows eligible families to store cord blood at no cost to treat an affected sibling.
