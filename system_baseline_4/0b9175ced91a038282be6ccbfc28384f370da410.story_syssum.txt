Moscow (CNN) -- A friend of mine who grew up in a small Soviet town realized he was gay by age 15.
...
When my friend told me this story many years later, we had a good laugh, agreeing that though things weren't easy for gay people in Russia, you did not have to stay shut in that closet for life.
President Vladamir Putin himself said in a recent interview that in Russia "people of nontraditional sexual orientation are not discriminated against" and that they are valued and equal citizens of the Russian Federation.
Putin even noted that he was open to a discussion with LGBT organizations.
Worse, several legislators have just introduced a bill to deny parental rights to one or both parents of "nontraditional sexual orientation."
When questioned about the discriminatory legislation, Russian officials often chide critics for exaggerating -- this is not the Soviet Union, and gay people live in Russia freely.
In other words, if you want to have a life, don't you dare poke your nose out of that closet.
