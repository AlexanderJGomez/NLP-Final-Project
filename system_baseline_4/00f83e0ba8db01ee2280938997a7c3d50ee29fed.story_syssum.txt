Phnom Penh, Cambodia (CNN) -- During the Khmer Rouge regime, I was put in prison at the age of 15 for picking mushrooms in the rice fields to feed my pregnant sister.
Months later, after running out of lies to tell the prison chief while begging for my life, one of the older prisoners stepped forward and pleaded to the prison chief on my behalf.
My experience is a mere footnote to the millions of other Cambodians who suffered and died at the hands of this regime, but it is illustrative of the ongoing struggle to find justice and closure.
Over 35 years after the fall of the Khmer Rouge regime, we still see the effects from this period in almost every facet of Cambodian society.
Like many families, my mother, my deaf sister, Keo Kolthida Ekkasakh, and I, all suffered under the Khmer Rouge.
I have been searching for his family members for years, in the hope that I can pay my respect for the courage and kindness he showed me.
Time and again, the international community has watched mass atrocities, genocide, and other heinous crimes proceed unchecked.
If only the international community would exercise the courage and resolve as the man in prison did for me, the world would need fewer verdicts.
