Social media immediately picked up on the horrific and very public killing.
#Farzana became a hashtag that provoked a conversation about the crime of so-called "honor killings" and society's tolerance and the police's alleged indifference to it.
Once the word got out, people around the world began talking about the issue over social media.
The misogyny in the killer's more than 100-page diatribe led women to begin using the #Yesallwomen hashtag to push forward a conversation on Twitter and Facebook and Tumbler about the rarely discussed though frequently experienced issues of violence against women, from sexual assault to harassment to domestic brutality.
Will crimes committed against women and girls across the globe finally come to be seen as harming and hampering not just women, but the communities in which they live?
The hashtag activism and social media outrage is an important start to addressing issues to which the world for so long had remained indifferent.
