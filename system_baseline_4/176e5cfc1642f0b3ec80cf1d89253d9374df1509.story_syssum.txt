"These are isolated incidents of misconduct and we're working every day to correct our behavior," Pierson told reporters Tuesday after leaving a closed meeting with top senators on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.
"We're human and we make mistakes," Pierson said when asked why the agency continues to be plagued by such problems.
Pierson, a Secret Service veteran, is the first woman to head the agency.
"I have made clear to the entire workforce that I will not tolerate unprofessional behavior or misconduct at any level -- both on and off duty," Pierson told the senators, according to prepared remarks released by the Secret Service.
He said he has confidence in Pierson to stay on the job and deal with the issues.
