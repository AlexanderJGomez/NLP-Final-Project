Yet Rubio has been his own worst enemy on what could have been his two signature issues: immigration reform and Cuba relations.
And unless he can offer new ideas, his climb to the Republican nomination will be steep.
Instead, Rubio has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration.
Meanwhile, both the Deferred Action program and President Obama's executive action on immigration are overwhelmingly favored by Hispanics.
But when it comes to Cuba policy, Rubio himself seems firmly stuck in the past.
By clinging to the notion that isolating Cuba is better than engaging with the communist country, Rubio has marginalized himself on an issue where he could have provided insight and leadership.
(In fact, Rubio signed his own family up for "Obamacare" on the Washington exchange, taking advantage of a generous federal subsidy offered to lawmakers.)
Sure, Rubio is young and charismatic.
By comparison, Rubio seems cautious and ill-suited to the task of rousing Republican voters.
Unfortunately, a fresh face on stale ideas is not a winning combination -- not for Rubio, and not for Latino voters.
