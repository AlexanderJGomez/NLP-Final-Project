Former Royal Navy officer Philip Beale hopes to sail a replica Phoenician boat 10,000 kilometers across the Atlantic in an ambitious voyage that could challenge maritime history.
"It is one of the greatest voyages of mankind and if anyone could have done it [before Columbus], it was the Phoenicians," said Beale.
Beale based his ambitious quest on a quote by Greek Historian Herodotus, who claimed the Phoenicians circumnavigated Africa in 600BC.
Using locally-sourced materials, shipbuilders stayed true to the original down to the exact thickness of the planks and position of the mast.
But at least there was no cleaning."
"Archeologists have found Egyptian mummies with traces of tobacco and cocaine which could only have come from the New World," Beale said.
He said copper coins with Phoenician iconography have also also been discovered in North America.
Setting off from Tunisia, the modern-day Phoenician vessel is expected to take two to three months to reach America -- granted Beale can raise Â£100,000 ($156,000) for the expedition.
"The conventional wisdom is that Christopher Columbus discovered America.
I put forward the theory that the Phoenicians could have been first and I hope to prove that was the case."
