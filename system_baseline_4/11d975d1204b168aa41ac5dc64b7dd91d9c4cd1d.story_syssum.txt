1 Els, who won his fourth major title and his first since claiming the British Open in a playoff in 2002.
Scott, who had led by four shots going into the final round, pulled his tee shot on the 18th into a bunker, but a fine third left him with an eight-foot putt to force a playoff.
A stunned Scott, who had started the day four shots ahead of American Brandt Snedeker and Graeme McDowell of Northern Ireland, admitted he had blown it.
I had it in my hands and managed to hit a poor shot on each of the closing four holes," he said.
McDowell, the 2010 US Open champion, also disappointed and fell away with a 75 to tie for fifth at two under with England's world number one Luke Donald, who raced up the leaderboard with a 69.
"It was my time for some reason," Els said.
He is the same age as last year's surprise British Open winner Darren Clarke, who missed the cut in his title defense.
