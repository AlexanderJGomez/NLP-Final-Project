(CNN) -- Octuplets mom Nadya Suleman pleaded not guilty Friday to welfare fraud charges relating to allegations that she did not report money that she earned as a topless dancer and adult film actress, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office.
Suleman, 38, performed in adult videos and danced topless at a Florida strip club last year.
An adult video featuring Suleman was released in June.
"But right now, people don't understand that."
Suleman faces up to five years, eight months in prison if convicted, the prosecutor said.
