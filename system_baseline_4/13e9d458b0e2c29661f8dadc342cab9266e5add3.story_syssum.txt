(CNN) -- The 13-year-old boy told them he knew wrestling on TV was fake, sheriff's officials in a New Orleans suburb said.
The half-siblings' mother left them at home when she went to the store Sunday, authorities said in a statement.
The juvenile suspect initially said he found Viloude lying in the bathroom, complaining of a stomachache, authorities said.
The youth said he was practicing "WWE"-style moves on the 5-year-old.
The boy smiled and appeared to enjoy talking about the wrestling moves, authorities said.

The mother will not face charges, according to Fortunato.
