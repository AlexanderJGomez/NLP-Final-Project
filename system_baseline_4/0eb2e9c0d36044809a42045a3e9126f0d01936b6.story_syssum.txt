A candidate, a former Secretary of State, who was campaigning in Massachusetts where she said that 'don't let them tell you that businesses creates jobs,'" Bush said, referring to a line Clinton made last week.
That should be the mission.
The former governor isn't the only potential GOP presidential candidate who knocked Clinton this week over the jobs comments.
Anybody here think businesses don't create jobs?"
They know that businesses do create jobs, and I hope you know that too."
The remark caused the Obama campaign quite a headache in 2012, and it looks like Clinton's comments on jobs could have the same impact in 2016, if she were to run.
