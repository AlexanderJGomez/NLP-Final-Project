(CNN) -- When Lukas Hartmann, 29, signed up for 23andMe's at-home genetic testing service, there were no surprises in his results.
Genetic testing can be a powerful tool.
The Food and Drug Administration on Monday ordered 23andMe to stop sales of its $99 home genetic testing kits, saying the Google-backed company has not proven the validity of its product.
"So GMOs, aspartame, artificial flavors & colors, pink slime ... no problem!"
It's one of the issues opponents to home genetic testing kits raise most often.
Scientists have identified more than 2,000 single gene disorders, says Rebecca Nagy, president of the National Society of Genetic Counselors.
"It's not that the science behind (this kind of genetic testing) isn't good.
The upside of these at-home genetic testing kits -- and 23andMe isn't the only company that sells them -- is that they've generated a lot of buzz about genetics, Nagy says.
Joseph Stolarski posted, "If you find something interesting, you then take it to a medical professional for further evaluation.
Nagy recommends anyone who wants to do genetic testing first talk to a genetic counselor.
"Know what you're doing so that when you get the results back you can really use them to your best benefit."
He says he submitted his "bug report" to the company and it apologized.
Hartmann says he now believes he will not get limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, although he says there is a risk he could pass the genetic mutations onto his kids.
