A producer then came out and said the show was over, Dealwis said.
Dealwis said the performer was wheeled away in a neck brace and was alert when he was taken to Bellevue Hospital.
The Spider-Man company met Tuesday with officials from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Actors Equity and the New York State Department of Labor to discuss additional safety protocols, he said.
"Nothing is more important than the safety of our Spider-Man family and we'll continue to do everything in our power to protect the cast and crew."
