WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Former Vice President Dick Cheney said Monday that he does not believe Saddam Hussein was involved in the planning or execution of the September 11, 2001, attacks.
Cheney restated his claim that "there was a relationship between al Qaeda and Iraq that stretched back 10 years.
... We know for a fact that Saddam Hussein was a sponsor -- a state sponsor -- of terror.
The evidence is overwhelming," Cheney said at the time.
Tenet "testified, if you go back and check the record, in the fall of [2002] before the Senate Intelligence Committee -- in open session -- that there was a relationship," Cheney said.
Among other things Monday, Cheney also called the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention center a "good facility ... if you are going to be engaged in a world conflict, such as we are, in terms of global war on terrorism.
Since Obama has already released memos detailing the interrogation methods, Cheney said, it is important to share the results of those interrogations with the public as well.
...
Cheney said Monday that the memos previously released also were the subject of ongoing lawsuits.
He has said that the interrogations saved the lives of "thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands."
