But New Zealand immigration authorities say the visa was denied because the man "no longer had an acceptable standard of health," that his ability to work was in question and that there is potential "high cost" of his healthcare.
After Buitenhuis and his wife arrived in New Zealand in 2007, they were granted subsequent visitor and work visas.
Their run-in with immigration began when the couple applied for New Zealand residency in 2011.
In May, Immigration New Zealand rejected his work visa application for health reasons.
"The applicant's ability to work is affected by the chronic knee joint condition that he suffers from," the agency stated.
Buitenhuis agrees with the notion that countries have to protect their taxpayers from high health expenses.
He said they've already put down their roots in New Zealand.
Now 75 pounds lighter, Buitenhuis said he was never warned about not meeting an "acceptable standard of health" until about a year ago.
"We've been kicked out of our home.
The couple hopes to remain in New Zealand as their relatives live there.
"I think governments are looking for ways to reduce the health care cost burden on the population on the taxpayer," he told CNN.
There are no winners, I'm afraid."
In 2009, a 297-pound American woman was denied residency there because of her obesity-related complications, according to the New Zealand Herald.
"There's always been a restriction on immigration based on health issues, so the basic principle has always been, if you've got a major health problem that's a drain on the state, that counts against you in immigration," Jim Mann, professor of medicine and nutrition at University of Otago in New Zealand, told CNN.
Yes it is.
