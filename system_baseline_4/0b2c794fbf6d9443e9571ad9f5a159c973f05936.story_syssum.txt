"I was amazed by the beauty of the fishing boats, many of which were old, damaged by the salt and the sun or abandoned," remembers Llonch, who was at the time cycling solo around the West African country.
Looking at the old, weathered canoes, Llonch started wondering whether he could find a new use for them while preserving the history of their owners.
"It's like a reincarnation of something that had life before -- a life in the Atlantic, a life in Africa," says Llonch.
Llonch says that what makes the furniture special is the history behind it and the creativity of the artisans working with raw materials that are hard to remodel.
"The main reason of this project is to preserve the wood as it was, with all the stories, all the nautical miles sailed in Atlantic," says Llonch.
"We started with the fishing boats ... because I was astonished when I saw the beaches with these stylish boats but maybe this is just the beginning," adds Llonch.
