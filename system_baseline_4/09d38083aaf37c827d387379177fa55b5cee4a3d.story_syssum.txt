However, an eruption from Bardarbunga that began on August 31 continues to this day and has now emitted the most lava of any volcano in Iceland since 1947 and shows no sign of stopping.
So far, however, the eruption has not caused any problems from ash clouds because it is erupting beyond the ice cap.
This subsidence marks a slow collapse of the caldera, a process that often ends with an eruption.
There are hundreds of metres of ice within the caldera, so any eruption would lead to the production of ash, once it melts its way through the ice cap; melting ice interacts with the magma, turning to steam and exploding the magma into fragments of ash.
This means that aircraft are now allowed to fly in areas containing low particle concentrations, and various efforts such as a collaboration of 26 European institutes called FUTUREVOLC, mean that models of ash concentration have been much improved since 2010.
Bardarbunga has had huge eruptions in the past, bigger even than the 1783-84 Laki eruption that led to a long-lived fog over much of Europe, which contributed to extreme low winter temperatures and many deaths.
Even without a huge eruption, threats remain from the continued possibility of large floods from meltwater, with potential risk to human life.
Taken overall, there remains a possibility of a significant ash eruption in Iceland that may well impact some flights.
