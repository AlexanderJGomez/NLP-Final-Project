Peter Bergen says the evidence is that coercive interrogations likely did more harm than good.
The first al Qaeda member to be subjected to "enhanced interrogation techniques" was Abu Zubaydah, a Palestinian al Qaeda logistician in his early 30s.
And so Zubaydah was the first prisoner to be placed in a secret overseas CIA prison, this one located in Thailand.
Abu Zubaydah's confirmation of Mohammed's role in the attacks on Washington and New York was arguably the single most important piece of information uncovered about al Qaeda after 9/11 and it was discovered during the course of a standard interrogation without recourse to any form of coercion.
Following his arrest in Pakistan in March 2003, Mohammed was also subjected to intensive coercive measures.
Following his defiance, Mohammed was subjected to a number of coercive interrogation techniques including being waterboarded 183 times.
Of the terrorists, alleged and otherwise, cited by the CIA inspector general that Mohammed fingered during his coercive interrogations, only Ohio truck driver Lyman Faris was an actual al Qaeda foot soldier living in the United States who had the serious intention to wreak havoc in America.
If that was the most threatening plot the United States could discover by waterboarding the most senior al Qaeda member in American custody, it was thin stuff indeed.
