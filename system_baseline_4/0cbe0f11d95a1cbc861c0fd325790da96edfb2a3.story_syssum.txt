Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- A South African pensioner has died while waiting in a queue to buy tickets for the soccer World Cup, with people lining up for 20 hours in some cases and system problems causing further delays.
South Africans across the country have been queuing since Wednesday afternoon in a last-minute bid to be part of the first football World Cup on the continent, with 500,000 tickets still available.
She said the first person in line there had been waiting for 20 hours -- and then he had to wait an extra hour due to problems with the ticket machines.
The tickets couldn't be printed," Mabuse said.
Mabuse said it is likely there will be empty seats at some of the tournament's group-stage games, especially outside the main cities, despite South Africans being offered tickets at a discounted rate of $18.
Another problem for local organizers is that South Africans are used to buying tickets on the day of events.
"It has been very difficult for South Africans to get tickets," Mabuse said.
"I asked FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke and he said that was not going to happen again -- they would rather have some empty seats than give tickets away," she said.
