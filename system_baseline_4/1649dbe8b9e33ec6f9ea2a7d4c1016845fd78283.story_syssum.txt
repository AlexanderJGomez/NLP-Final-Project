Far from the media frenzy dominating headlines, from the so-called "ground zero mosque" to a pastor's planned Quran burning, Aman Ali and Bassam Tariq traveled more than 13,000 miles into the heart of America over the last month, visiting 30 mosques in 30 days for Ramadan.
"After 13,000 miles, I think that America still exists, and I'm happy to know that it does," said Tariq, a 23-year-old American of Pakistani descent.
"It's really made America feel like home to me in a way that I've never felt before.
"And he doesn't flinch and doesn't get worried," Tariq said.
"
"It means so much to these people who've been displaced from their own country, and they come here to this place of worship," he said.
A pastor directed them to a woman, who kindly pointed them down a dirt road to where the nation's first mosque once stood.
As he approached the mosque, his heart pounded.
Praying in there was like hopping in a time machine," said Ali, a 25-year-old Muslim who was born in Columbus, Ohio.
Tariq said their blog also helps the rest of America realize "you have to accept Muslims are here in America to stay, and we've been here for awhile.
"It's a small but vocal group of Americans in this country pushing this anti-Muslim rhetoric," Ali said.
