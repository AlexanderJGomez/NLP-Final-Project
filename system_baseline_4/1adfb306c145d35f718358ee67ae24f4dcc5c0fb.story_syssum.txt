(CNN) -- iPads will soon be ubiquitous in American Airlines cockpits, but don't expect pilots to be playing "Angry Birds" instead of paying attention to the flight path.
"Really, we know what each aircraft burns in terms of weight per hour, so for every pound, you can measure the fuel burn."
Clark says the initiative is designed to not only save American money but, since each flight bag is made up of thousands of pages that must be updated constantly, to be a valuable time-saver as well.
"We've got all of our charts into a digital format," Clark said.
"Each kitbag can weigh 35 to 45 pounds," Clark said.
It's unclear if or how soon United will match American in getting the FAA's approval for iPad use during all phases of flight.
"It's a game-changer," Clark said.
"We are professionals, we have rules that we follow, and our licenses and crew depend on our being professional and following the rules.
