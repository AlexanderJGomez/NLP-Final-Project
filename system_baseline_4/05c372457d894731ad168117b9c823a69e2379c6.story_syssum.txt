Nell Minow says AIG's board must be held accountable for the $160 million in bonus payments.
They are the members of AIG's Board of Directors Compensation Committee.
This is particularly obvious in the case of AIG, which has been a serial offender in corporate governance, especially in executive compensation.
The Corporate Library released a report in February about the boards of the bailout companies, many of which were outliers in their governance and compensation practices.
Several other directors from these troubled boards also sat on either five or six boards altogether.
In all, 11 of the 27 companies we identified as "troubled" had at least one overboarded director.
At least 13 individual directors, all of whom sat on at least three corporate boards during this period, had received a 13 percent or higher negative vote.
Although the businesses of these companies do not overlap enough to impair Bischoff's designation as an "independent" director or to create legal conflict of interest concerns, it is relevant that McGraw-Hill owns ratings agency Standard & Poor's, which not only rates the other companies for which he was a director but also issues ratings on which the other companies rely in their assessment of risk.
Badly designed compensation is an indicator of poor corporate governance, and poor corporate governance is an indicator of investment risk.
In this case, insanity is allowing the same people to continue to serve on the board after massive failure and expecting them to produce a different result.
