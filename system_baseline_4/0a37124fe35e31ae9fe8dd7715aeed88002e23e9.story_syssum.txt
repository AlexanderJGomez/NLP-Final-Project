Homeland Security Adviser Fran Townsend turned in her letter of resignation to President Bush on November 6 and will be looking for new opportunities outside government.
"Fran has always provided wise counsel on how to best protect the American people from the threat of terrorism," Bush said in a statement.
She said she's been talking with the president about her planned departure for eight months.
"It was a hard decision as I have loved and will cherish my every minute of service," she said in an e-mail.
Townsend is part of the search committee to find a replacement by the beginning of next year.
