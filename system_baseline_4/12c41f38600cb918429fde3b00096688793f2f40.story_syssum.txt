(CNN) -- Just days after a Boeing 737 flown by Southwest Airlines made an emergency landing with a hole in its fuselage, the Federal Aviation Administration said in a press release Monday that it will mandate operators of about 175 specific older Boeing 737s to conduct inspections for wear and tear.
In a separate statement, Boeing said it was working with the FAA, the National Transportation Safety Board and Southwest, and it was preparing a service bulletin to recommend lap joint inspections on certain 737 models.
"The FAA reauthorization bill now headed to conference takes steps to strengthen the inspection process of passenger aircraft, and I hope we can move that bill quickly to a resolution," he said.
Those three will remain out of service "until Boeing recommends an appropriate repair," Southwest said.
As planes are cleared, they will be put back into service, Southwest said.
One flight attendant received minor injuries, the agency said.
It actually was terrifying."
The airline said it provided a full refund, an apology and two complimentary round-trip passes on the airline for future flights.
The plane's flight data recorders had no noteworthy information on them, Sumwalt said.
