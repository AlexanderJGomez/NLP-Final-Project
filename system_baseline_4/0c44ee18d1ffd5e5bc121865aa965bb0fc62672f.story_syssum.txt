Polokwane, South Africa (CNN) -- A South African court charged Julius Malema with money laundering Wednesday, and the firebrand politician scoffed at the accusations and riled up his supporters moments after his release on bail.
The 31-year-old, who was youth leader for the African National Congress, was thrown out of the ruling party this year.
The ruling party said the allegations are not politically motivated.
"Hands off Malema," placards outside the court read.
Malema, once a major ally of the president, is now one of his fiercest critics.
His populist rhetoric has made him a controversial figure in the nation and sparked outrage in the ruling party.
In recent years, he has accused his administration of intolerance and failure to improve the lives of the poor.
Malema's controversial road to fame includes his calls to seize white-owned farms in South Africa, especially incendiary in a nation with a history of racial tensions.
