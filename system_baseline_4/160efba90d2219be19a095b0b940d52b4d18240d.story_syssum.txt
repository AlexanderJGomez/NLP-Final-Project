NEW YORK (CNN) -- The missing engine from a US Airways jet that ditched in the Hudson River was recovered Friday, more than a week after the crash landing.
The divers who found it reported that it was in one piece, said New Jersey State Police Sgt.

Investigators said this week that they found a single feather and evidence of "soft-body impact damage" on the aircraft.
Meanwhile, a pilot program involving "birdstrike avoidance" radar systems will be expanded to include LaGuardia, said a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

The video, which the Con Edison utility company released Thursday, first shows a long wake behind the plane before zooming in on the aircraft.
Passengers run onto the plane's other wing as the aircraft floats off-screen for a few seconds.
Some passengers jump into the water, which was a chilly 41 degrees when the plane splashed down on the afternoon of January 15.
A person manning the camera from inside the plant saw the plane hit the water and redirected the camera, Olert said.
