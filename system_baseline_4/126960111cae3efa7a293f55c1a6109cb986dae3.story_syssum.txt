(CNN) -- A blind Michigan man, rejected by three law schools after scoring poorly on the Law School Admission Test, is suing the American Bar Association, arguing that the group's exam requirements discriminate against the visually impaired.
Binno's lawsuit counters that the LSAT is the only widely used, commercially available exam for assessing law school applicants, leaving, in effect, no alternative.
Before 1997, law schools could decide whether blind people must take the exam, according to Binno's lawyer, Richard Bernstein, who is also blind.
He graduated from Northwestern University School of Law in 1999.
"It's a situation where blind or visually impaired people can't interpret a diagram since they don't have spatial perceptions,'' Bernstein said.
"I want the American Bar Association to stop telling blind people that they have to draw pictures in order to go to law school," Binno said.
"We're fighting so we can have more disabled attorneys who are going to create more disabled rights,'' said Bernstein, who teaches social justice at the University of Michigan, and said he runs marathons and has completed an Iron Man triathlon.
