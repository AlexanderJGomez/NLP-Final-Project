Dushanbe, Tajikistan (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton thanked Tajikistan's president Saturday for his country's support of efforts to defeat al-Qaeda and bring security to neighboring Afghanistan.
But Clinton said the country still faces important challenges.
Several reporters have been arrested in Tajikistan for reporting on corruption or the arrests of religious activists, a senior U.S. State Department official said.
Pamir Energy is a cross-border electricity transmission project that is helping to light up two very remote provinces of Afghanistan and Tajikistan, the State Department said.
Clinton told Karimov that improvements were needed in the area of human rights, the official said.
