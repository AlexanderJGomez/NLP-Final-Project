(CNN) -- Marvin Miller died Tuesday at the age of 95.Â  And here's why you should know his name: Miller transformed the game of baseball even though he never put on a uniform.
In 1984, when Miller left the position, the average players' salary was $329,000.
And that was the innovation that Miller brought to the game, against the bitter opposition of team owners.
But Miller persevered and pursued the players' liberation of their capital through free agency in 1975.
Yes, fans are too often denied their game by selfish strikes perpetrated by players and owners alike.
The fact that Miller was denied entry into the Hall of Fame as recently as 2010 speaks to the influence of owners and their deep dislike of Miller's intrusions and innovations.
The most eloquent tribute to Miller might have been his extended inclusion in the documentary "Baseball" by Ken Burns, one of my favorite movies.
