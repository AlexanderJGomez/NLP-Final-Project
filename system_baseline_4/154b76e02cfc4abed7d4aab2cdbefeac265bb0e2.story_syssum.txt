The brother of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri is proposing to mediate a peace deal between the West and Islamists.
Mohamed spent 14 years in Egyptian jail on charges including terrorism and involvement in the 1981 assassination of President Anwar Sadat 1981.
He wants peace, he says, between Muslims and non-Muslims and has written a proposal that outlines the terms.
He says he's offering to be an intermediary between Islamists and the United States and the West.
Al-Zawahiri says his offer puts him at risk from radical Islamists, but says he is not acting from weakness or for personal gain.
Through his steely determination to get his voice heard and his message out it is hard to gauge how much hope al-Zawahiri is really investing in his initiative.
He says he told his interrogators he could work a truce with Islamists but he says his jailers didn't want to know.
It was followed a year later by the deadly 7/7 subway attack in London killing 52 people.
He says his brother will listen to him, but admits he hasn't talked to him in long over a decade.
It wouldn't be the first time the terms are unacceptably high.
