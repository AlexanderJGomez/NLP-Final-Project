(CNN) -- Kenyans gathered in the nation's capital Saturday for a state funeral honoring Nobel laureate Wangari Maathai, marking a final journey for the first African woman to win the peace prize.
Military forces stood guard next to a mounted picture of the activist, which had a small green shrub pinned on it.
Following the gathering, close relatives left for a private event at the crematorium.
For decades, Maathai has been at the forefront of a tree-planting campaign to stop deforestation and give locals, especially women, access to resources such as firewood for cooking and clean water.
"It is evident that many wars are fought over resources which are now becoming increasingly scarce," she said on receiving news that she had been awarded the Nobel prize.
The first African woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize died weeks before another milestone in the continent she fought for.
On Friday, the Nobel Committee awarded the peace prize to three women activists: Liberians Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the first African woman elected head of state and Leymah Gbowee, who campaigned for peace during the nation's brutal civil war and anti-government protester Tawakkul Karman of Yemen.
