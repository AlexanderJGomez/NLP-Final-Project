(CNN) -- A 19-year-old gunman who killed eight people and then himself Wednesday at the Westroads Mall in Omaha, Nebraska, left a suicide note, police said.
"We'll be here throughout the night; it's a very extensive crime scene," he said.
Hawkins said in the note he loved his friends and family, but "he was a piece of s--- all his life, and now he'll be famous," she told CNN.

"He just said he wanted to thank me for everything I'd done for him ... and he was sorry," Maruca Kovac said.
"I said, 'Come home and we'll talk about it,' " she said.
"He just kept firing," she said.
"It was just so loud, and then it was silence," she said.
Maruca Kovac said she was unaware Hawkins had any guns, although she said he knew a lot about them, as did his stepfather.
However, she said Hawkins and his girlfriend had broken up in the last couple of weeks, and he had taken it hard.
"My kids are devastated," she said.
Witnesses described chaos and frantic shoppers running away from the Von Maur store, where the shooting began just before 2 p.m.
