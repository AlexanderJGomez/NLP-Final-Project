Bowe Bergdahl was released from nearly five years in captivity, yellow ribbons and banners celebrating his release decorated the main street, red-bricked storefronts of his hometown.
"We stood by the Bergdahl family to get Bowe home but we need to move on."
Stefanie O'Neill, a Bergdahl family friend, spearheaded the letter campaign.
"It means that people all over the world cared about Bowe," O'Neill said.
The boxes are a symbol of how the story of Bergdahl's rescue didn't come with a triumphant homecoming.
But Bergdahl is also waiting to hear if he'll face any criminal charges in the military justice system.
The Army announced on Friday that Dahl completed the initial report on his findings in the Bergdahl case.
His father, Bob Bergdahl, has said he kept his clocks set to the time in Afghanistan.
In the days after his son's release, critics used those details to accuse Bob Bergdahl of sympathizing with the Taliban.
But the expected family reunion never materialized and the Bergdahl family soon stopped answering questions about why Bowe Bergdahl was refusing to see his parents.
Military officials have said Bergdahl has been given every opportunity to reunite with his family.
Kemery said Bowe Bergdahl was raised in an intensely religious atmosphere with a strict code of conduct.
Kemery said that as a child Bergdahl struggled to control his frustration and would often disappear for days at a time, building forts and hiking for miles into the Idaho wilderness.
Around Hailey, one often hears people asking the same question, will Bowe Bergdahl ever come back home?
Bergdahl's lawyer has said the soldier would like to continue his education.
We are going to talk about things around the fire," said Kemery.
