Last year, I was covering the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington when I came across a stall selling old political pins.
None of the young conservative activists had a nice word to say about Nixon and many were quite hostile.
But a common theme running through each of these battles is "inflexibility."
A lesson in the benefits of adapting to circumstances might be taken from the life of Richard Nixon.
In domestic policy, Nixon bowed to the liberal consensus of his era.
The Philadelphia Plan was opposed by many Democrats, not just by Southern conservatives but also by labor leaders who saw it as a challenge to seniority programs.
But Nixon won re-election in 1972 partly on a reputation as a peacemaker with whom the Democrats could not compete.
Nixon was his own worst enemy.
Had Watergate not reduced his political capital so early in 1973, there's a chance Nixon would have pushed ahead with his agenda of a New Federalism and undone much of the liberalism of his first term.
Nixon, then, was a mix of ideals and prejudices, but all tempered by a respect for the possibilities and limitations of power.
Nixon also did his best to court conservatives, but his instinct was always to anchor himself in the rhetorical center.
Today, it's difficult to talk about Nixon as a model for contemporary Republicans because his political reputation is so tarnished.
Considering that record, moderate Republicans in pursuit of the White House have every cause to get misty-eyed when they hear the name Richard Nixon.
