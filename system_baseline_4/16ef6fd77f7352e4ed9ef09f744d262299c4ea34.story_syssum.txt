(CNN) -- Jaycee Dugard will testify against the couple that allegedly held her captive in an elaborate compound hidden in their backyard for 18 years if there is a trial, a lawyer for her family said at a news conference Thursday.
But Scott said the family is trying not to focus on any of that  and instead work on building a new life together.
He said he had met with Dugard and her family twice for a couple of hours and was happy to see "how well they had been doing."
The family received medical attention and counseling beginning the day Dugard and her children were discovered, Scott said.
He said he knows there is a curiosity about where the family is, but pleaded that the public and the media give the family time to heal.
"To watch the interaction between Jaycee and her mother ... after 18 years is remarkable," Scott said.
