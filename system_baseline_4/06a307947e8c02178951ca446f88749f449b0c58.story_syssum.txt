That the revolution will succeed and that the legitimate leader will return," he said.
"This is a coup of the revolution, a coup on democracy, a coup on the constitution and the will of the people.
Interim Prime Minister Hazem El-Beblawi said that 70% of the choices for ministers and ministerial posts have been completed, according to the state-run al-Ahram news agency.
And history will never record it as a revolution.
Why?
"The Mohamed Morsy that I know is a point of pride as a son, so the Mohamed Morsy that would back down or flee would be shameful to me, even if he stayed president."
Former President Morsy is currently being held in an undisclosed location for his "personal safety," Egyptian armed forces spokesman Col. Ahmed Ali told CNN, but for a son missing his father, these reassurances are meaningless.

This time the revolution will confront the apparatuses of Mubarak, not just the man himself."
"Mohamed Morsy, even though he is the president and even though he is elected and the legitimate leader, and despite his international standing and his role in the revolution,n he is not more important than the people killed at the Republican Guard," Osama said, referring to the deaths of 51 people in clashes earlier this week.
We back any decision you take, even if you decided to leave the office.
