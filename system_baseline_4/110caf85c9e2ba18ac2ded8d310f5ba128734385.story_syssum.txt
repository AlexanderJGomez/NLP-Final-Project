What?
In a small but highly controversial way, Patton may be doing something similar for young women in college who want to get married and have kids someday.
While I understand Patton's desire to have young women feel more comfortable admitting whether they want motherhood in addition to (or in the absence of) a career, I wondered if her delivery, and her words, are doing more to set modern women back.
...
Many modern women like myself believe in empowering women to make the choices they want to make, and that many women would choose a career and marriage and motherhood, too.
...
Kelly: I don't know if people would say it's so retro.
...
Kelly: You say women should spend 75% of their time in college looking for a man versus 25% on their career.
Patton: I don't think it hurts them at all because you can make up lost time at work.
...
Patton: Right under the wire.
Kelly: You talk about "Marrying Smart" and spending more time in college to find that right person, but you have to believe it's also very important for women, at the same time, to be fulfilled and find what they want because their marriage could end; 50% of marriages end in divorce.
I am not saying a man is going to make you happy.
Happiness comes from within clearly, and obviously nobody knows better than a divorced person how happy a marriage can make you (or) not.
...
Patton: It's absolutely true.
Kelly: You basically say if you require major (cosmetic) bodywork, get it done in high school.
Patton: There's not a thing that I've said that they haven't heard me say for decades.
...
I'm just saying if you know this is what you want, plan for it because it doesn't just happen.
Patton: I'm not the one that's evil.
What do you think of Patton's argument that women who want to get married should look for a husband in college?
