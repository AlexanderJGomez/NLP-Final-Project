New Hampshire remains Clinton country.
Likewise, in 2008, after finishing a disappointing third in the Iowa caucuses, Hillary Clinton used her New Hampshire primary win to right her campaign.
Shumaker, who was with Bill Clinton when he filed his presidential bid papers in 1991, added: "As I caution all presidential candidates in New Hampshire, taking New Hampshire for granted is very dangerous.
When matched up against Jeb Bush, the former Republican governor, or Rand Paul, the senator from Kentucky, Clinton enjoyed a 8 and 7 point lead, respectively.
In a 10-person field that includes 2012 GOP Romney, Paul's the only other potential candidate to break double-digits, taking 11 percent support and coming in second to Romney's 30 percent support among GOP primary voters.
Paul's strength in the state comes as no surprise, as its libertarian-leaning population drove his father, former Rep. Ron Paul, to a second-place finish in the 2012 GOP presidential primary there.
The Bloomberg poll suggests, however, Christie remains competitive in his home region, and that the two will have a fierce fight for the all-important early primary state if they both decide to run, as expected.
