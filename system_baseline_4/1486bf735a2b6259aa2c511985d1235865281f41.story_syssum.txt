Henry Ford, pictured in 1942, unsuccessfully attempted to increase the rubber supply with a plantation in Brazil.
In 1927, Ford came up with a novel plan: He'd solve his rubber problem and test out his lofty theories about social planning.
In theory, this setup seemed like one of Ford's ideas that would shake out pretty well, and in 1928, Ford sent a barge full of supplies from Michigan down to his new plantation town, which was dubbed "Fordlandia."
Ford didn't check to see if the plantation was suitable for growing rubber.
Fordlandia's trees were no exception, and caterpillars and blight quickly decimated the fields.
The American managers and their families that Ford imported from Michigan weren't accustomed to the sweltering Brazilian heat and headed back north with an alarming frequency.
The catch here, though, was that the indigenous Brazilians who farmed the rubber weren't used to living in a stylized American community.
Ford's influence extended all the way down to the residents' diets, and while the indigenous workers weren't crazy about having to eat American foods, they were livid about having to eat in a cafeteria setting rather than enjoying the homestyle meals to which they were accustomed.
Another sticking point for the workers was Ford's insistence that his model community be entirely free of alcohol and tobacco.
Although Ford spent 17 years trying to produce rubber on the plantation, no Ford car ever rolled off the assembly line with a single bit of Fordlandia's rubber in it.
