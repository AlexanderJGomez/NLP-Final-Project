LONDON, England (CNN) -- Playing the Nintendo Wii Fit could improve balance and help avoid falls in seniors, researchers taking part in a new study suggest.
It is hoped that using the Wii Fit's balance board can improve elderly people's balance and confidence.
"What is great about the Wii is it also has an entertainment value.
A group of seven older people with and without the degenerative condition took part in the pilot project, and were put through an almost daily regime of playing the Nintendo Wii.
It leads to inertia and people become unstable on their feet," said Van der Zwan in a media statement.
Van der Zwan now wants to recruit 15 more research participants to broaden the study.
Among the Wii Fit fans at the home are 74-year-old Ian Fisher and 86-year-old Betty Dennis.
Her bowling partner Fisher told CNN he recently played the boxing game on Wii Fit with his four-year-old great-grandson.
