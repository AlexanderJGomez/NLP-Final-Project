They have grown up with "ice cream headaches" -- the painful ache when you eat something cold too fast -- they are the surfers from New Jersey.
As filmmaker Alex DePhillipo shows in his newly released surfing documentary "Dark Fall", not only is the surf good in New Jersey, but there are a lot of good surfers in the state.
"He has absolutely paved the way for any surfer that wants to become a professional from New Jersey," says DePhillipo.
Randazzo became a professional surfer in 1990, yet he still couldn't find a sponsor to support him.
"Dean has paved the way," DePhillipo says, "There's never been a surfer from New Jersey or the Northeast that's made the World Tour."
When Randazzo isn't in the water he uses his celebrity status along with the sport he loves to raise money for the Dan Randazzo Cancer Foundation.
Currently residing in California, Randazzo frequently returns to New Jersey.
But as Randazzo or actually any Jersey surfer will tell you, the passion doesn't waiver with the weather.
