Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- Tunisia's interim president and prime minister resigned from the ousted leader's ruling party, state TV said Tuesday, a move seen as a gesture to placate angry street demonstrators and keep the unity government afloat.
Three ministers have already stepped down, Al Ahwal said.
Another opposition leader, Mustafa Ben Jaafar, was to serve as health minister in the new government but suspended his participation in the united government, his spokesman, Abudallah Tif, told CNN Tuesday.
Weeks of demonstrations have left 78 dead and 94 wounded, the government said.
Ghannouchi -- who said the military didn't shoot people -- emphasized that he never gave any order for police to shoot people and only allowed tear gas and rubber bullets.
But many others remained angry about the country's new unity government, saying they don't want it to include anyone from the old administration, which fell apart after Ben Ali fled last week.
The new government will be tasked with leading Tunisia toward new elections, he said.
Among the holdovers from the previous government is Ahmed Friaa, the interior minister.
"There are still a couple of demonstrations because people are against the fact that older members of the political party (will remain) in power," she said.
Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia last week after ruling the country for 23 years, following weeks of protests over what Tunisians said were poor living conditions, high unemployment, government corruption and repression.
He died early this month.
"The United Nations stands ready to provide assistance to the Tunisian people," he said.
