The rover stands a chance of being saved as it is still alive."
The rover has over 300,000 followers on the Chinese Twitter-like social media site, some of whom celebrated the lucky robot's resurrection.
"China's first lunar rover, Yutu, could not be restored to full function on Monday as expected," the report stated.
