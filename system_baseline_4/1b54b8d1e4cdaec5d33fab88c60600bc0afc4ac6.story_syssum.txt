Now Nike is being reminded again that pinning your company reputation on star names is a risky business.
Pistorius, known as the 'blade runner,' is the man Nike called a bullet and who is now charged with shooting his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.
A bullet in the chamber still represents a gun and a gun represents a weapon."
He added that there would be clauses in the Pistorius-Nike contract that make clear when the athlete's behavior can allow the company to cut its ties -- and law-breaking would often be among the reasons.
That way, if the star derails, the wider campaign can continue.
Pistorius rejects the murder allegation "in the strongest terms," Van Zuyl said.
It is not the first time Nike has sponsored a scandal-hit star.
In this marketing world, Vorhaus said, with many athletes sponsored by and representing Nike, it is also easier to shake off the bad publicity when a star falls.
