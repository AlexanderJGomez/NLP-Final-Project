CNN recently spoke to writer Rick Remender on what to expect with this big change.
Rick Remender: I had been writing Steve Rogers for a little bit; he's this kid raised in the Great Depression, and I wanted to explore that.
Sam will not be working as closely with S.H.I.E.L.D.
Remender: Steve Rogers -- who has aged now; time has caught up to him -- will still be a tactician, providing his military experience.
Since he is incapable of serving as Captain America, he will be at the Avengers mansion at the command station.
One of the things we got were photos of kids holding the shield.
Remender: When I proposed it originally, it was seen as "You can't do it unless it's going to be a long-term change."
Remender: I wanted to put Sam into something that felt like a traditional "Captain America" comic book but wanted him to come up against an insurmountable wall unlike anything Steve has even faced.
That has implications we can appreciate in the world we're living in today.
