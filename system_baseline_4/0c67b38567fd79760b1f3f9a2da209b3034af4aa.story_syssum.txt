Police in France seized 12 people for suspected terrorist ties Tuesday, but it is not clear whether they are connected to the plot that prompted the warning.
French national police said the 12 suspects were seized in the south of France.
The nine other arrests happened throughout southern France, including some in Marseilles and at least one in Avignon, police said.
The man was arrested last month by Italian police in Naples, Italy, on a European arrest warrant requested by France, the chief prosecutor in Naples told CNN Monday.
Elsewhere, Pakistani intelligence confirmed that five German nationals were killed in a suspected U.S. drone strike Monday in the northwestern part of the country.
The militants killed are believed to have been members of the group Jihad al Islami, the officials said.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the FBI issued a joint bulletin Sunday warning of the potential attacks.
Jihadists from the German city of Hamburg are alleged to be at the heart of the suspected plots, European intelligence officials said.
Sidiqi's father, Mohammed Naim Sidiqi, said his son was on his way to the German embassy in the Afghan capital to get a new passport when he was detained.
According to Sidiqi's sister, her brother left Hamburg last year to start a new life in Afghanistan with his wife, an Indonesian citizen.
Sidiqi's father said he also did some work in Germany related to computers.
