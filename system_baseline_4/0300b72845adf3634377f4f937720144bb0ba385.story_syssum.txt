Let's cut to the chase: There would be no special prosecutor had thousands across the national not mobilized, organized and took to the streets to demand justice for Trayvon.
No.
No.
No.
Thank you!"
Justice is supposed to be blind, but for African-Americans, it has commonly been deaf, dumb and blind.
The main demand in the Trayvon Martin case from Day One was for Zimmerman to be arrested and for justice to be served.
It was about holding a legal system accountable that clearly gave more credence to a 28-year-old gunman than the 17-year-old, unarmed man who was gunned down.
It should pain our heart when the prosecution withholds evidence in a case that could exonerate someone.
That is a right that is afforded every one of us in the U.S. Constitution, be it the Tea Party, Occupy Wall Street or those demanding justice for Trayvon.
We all should call them exactly what they are: true Americans.
