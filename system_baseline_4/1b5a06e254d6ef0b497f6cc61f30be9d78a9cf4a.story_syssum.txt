(CNN)  -- Police from California's Bay Area Rapid Transit system have begun questioning witnesses to a confrontation that led to a BART police officer shoving an unruly man into a glass window, a top official said Monday.
Hartwig said investigators have asked the person who posted the video online for his help, but had not received a response.
In the video, the officer forced Gibson against the window, which shattered.
The officer was placed on leave due to his injuries, authorities said.
Gibson said her brother appears intoxicated in the video.
But she blasted the officer who made the arrest, saying, "Whoever this officer is shouldn't have a job.
