Gelbart died of cancer, Pat Gelbart said.
Throughout his career, Gelbart developed a portfolio of more than 40 works spanning radio, television, theater and film.
Barely out of high school, Gelbart began as a comedy writer for radio in the 1940s.
Not just because it got there first, but because it got there first with so much," Gelbart said.
In 1972, Gelbart helped create the Korean War comedy drama "M*A*S*H." The show went on for another 11 years, although Gelbart only wrote and produced "M*A*S*H" for the first four seasons.
For Gelbart, "M*A*S*H" mixed a bit of comedy with drama, allowing viewers to connect more with the story.
Gelbart continued steamrolling through the industry, with works including the 1982 hit film "Tootsie," "Oh, God!"
