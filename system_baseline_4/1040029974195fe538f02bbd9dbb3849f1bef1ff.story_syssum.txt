We love him, too.
It's Dad who takes the kids and goes searching with them for Mother's Day presents.
But Dad?
Or, if he's lucky, his young ones may do a handmade gift.
TV fathers have "evolved' from real people like Sheriff Andy Taylor, Beaver's dad Ward Cleaver and Heathcliff "Cliff" Huxtable, to cartoon dads like Homer Simpson, and Seth MacFarlane's caricatures in "American Dad!"
and "Family Guy."
And he never allowed his nine kids to forget.
And every once in a while, he gets to parent a "son."
It was in my family.
It's true you never know the full depth of a parent's touch in your life until they're gone.
My dad, Lionel, let me know how proud he was, even as he kept me from being too big for my britches.
On this Father's Day, I think of my Dad, my grandfathers, uncles and my two brothers who are good dads to their kids.
I think of all the fathers who've lost daughters and sons to illnesses, or accidents -- far too often a father's only child.
I also think of the fathers whose sons turned mass murderers, despite every effort to parent a son who'd make a good citizen.
There's no more important job than being a father.
