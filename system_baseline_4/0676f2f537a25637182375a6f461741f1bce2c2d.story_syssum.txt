(CNN) -- Hurricane experts are throwing cold water on an idea backed by billionaire Microsoft founder Bill Gates aimed at controlling the weather.
Hurricanes are fueled by warm water, and cooling the waters surrounding a storm would slow a storm's momentum.
According to the patents, many tub-like barges would be placed directly in the path of an oncoming storm.
It's very difficult to bring up enough cold water in two to three days to have much effect."
Even if the technology does work, Gray said it won't completely halt a hurricane.
And flooding and storm surges are determined by these outer winds, Gray said.
But the coldest water is usually at the rear of the storm, so sometimes it's too late to weaken [the storm], Emanuel said.
"The key is doing it a little sooner than the storm itself does it and make [the hurricane] weaker than it would have been," he said.
A spokeswoman for Intellectual Ventures, which holds about 27,000 technology patents, didn't elaborate on the cost associated with the patent.
"This type of technology is not something humankind would use as a 'Plan A' or 'Plan B,'" Paul "Pablos" Holman, an inventor in the Intellectual Ventures laboratory, wrote on the company blog.
Hurricane expert Gray agrees.
