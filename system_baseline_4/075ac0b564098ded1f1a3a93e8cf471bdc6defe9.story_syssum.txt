There is simply no substitute for plenty of training when running a marathon.
Ideally a marathon runner should be doing 40 to 50 miles a week for at least three or four months before race day.
However, I hit the wall in both my last two races, and I'm terrified it will happen again this Sunday.
The only real distances under my belt are the three miles that I walk each day from Victoria Station in London up to CNN's bureau in Soho.
But three demanding children and a house restoration project mean the only time I've had to run is late at night.
Last night I ran 17 miles and felt shattered.
After worrying that I hadn't done nearly enough training for Sunday's Brighton marathon, I finished in a creditable three hours and 35 minutes -- only a couple of minutes slower than last year's time.
It only really became an ordeal for the last two or three miles, when my legs and feet felt like concrete and my chest started to tighten.
I felt pretty rough straight after the race, but better than last year when I was sick after I crossed the line.
On Monday I went to work in London and my legs were more stiff but not painful, but I managed to walk three miles.
It certainly saved me a lot of time -- I always find the worst thing about preparing for a marathon is the monotony of running mile after boring mile for months beforehand
Sure, 26.2 miles (42 kilometers) is a long way, but as long as you have a decent level of fitness, you'll be able to run a fairly fast marathon.
