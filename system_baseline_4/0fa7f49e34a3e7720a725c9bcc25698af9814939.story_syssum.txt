Most of the people we train turn against us," Manchin said Tuesday on CNN's "New Day."
While lawmakers are expected to put off until after the November election a vote on direct U.S. military action in Syria, votes on arming Syrian rebels could come this week as part of a larger funding bill.
I will vote no -- absolutely no -- and stand tall in West Virginia to explain my vote," he said.
But at least one senator running for re-election has indicated opposition to arming the rebels.
Manchin also responded to lawmakers, including Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who are suggesting that the U.S. approach to ISIS go even further than what President Barack Obama has proposed and include U.S. involvement in a ground war.
"This has to be a ground game by the people of that region."
