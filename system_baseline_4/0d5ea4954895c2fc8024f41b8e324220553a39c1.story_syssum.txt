(CNN) -- The opening day of the World Cup brought joy and sadness to the host nation as Brazil won its first game, rallying to defeat Croatia 3-1.
With reporters descending on Sao Paulo for the opening match, protesters tried to make their way toward Arena Corinthians stadium and were met by tear-gas firing riot police.
The best kick of the day went perhaps two yards.
"We did it!!!"
That penalty that everyone is talking about, the one that should never have been given, well, it should probably have been stopped.
First, referee Yuichi Nishimura awarded Brazil an undeserved penalty kick.
Well, it appears from media reports that at least one -- possibly two -- didn't live to see themselves home.
It wasn't the first misstep of the day.
The United States, which plays it first match of the tournament on Monday, wanted to have a private scrimmage against Belgium on Thursday.
Perhaps they should have rescheduled and traveled during the Brazil-Croatia match; the roads of Sao Paulo were practically empty then.
