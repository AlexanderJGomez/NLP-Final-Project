London (CNN) -- When I was driving through Poland last year, all the talk was about a Chinese company's failure to complete a major motorway project.
What China does in Europe matters greatly, though rarely do I hear or read a positive story about China's influence.
The Chinese government's recent trip to central Europe revealed that the hiccup in Poland has not slowed China's plan to invest heavily in the former communist states.
But any attempt it makes to expand in Europe, United States or Africa is met with fears of technology transfer to a firm linked to the Chinese military through its founder.
A change of leadership in Beijing will not have much impact in Europe.
It also helps to expand China's middle class which appears to love European and American products.
But it did.
Europe can't assume the same will happen with China.
China needs to understand that it will take time for Europe to get comfortable with China's investments.
China has to make sure its investments and intentions are transparent.
