CNN justice producer Terry Frieden was part of the first-ever media tour of the U.S. Bureau of Prison's Administrative Maximum prison -- also known as "Supermax."
I've visited noisy, boisterous state and federal prisons, where inmates scream for a visitor's attention or proclaim their innocence.
Myths that particularly rile prison officials are reports that Supermax, southwest of Colorado Springs, is a dungeon where inmates are cast aside to rot and die, and that the prison is underground, which it obviously is not.
Prison officials also have been bugged by rumors that the penitentiary was not entirely safe and secure, and that the lack of adequate staffing and a perimeter fence were potential problems to the community.
Bureau officials insist allegations of inadequate security were fueled by corrections labor unions wanting more staffing, but complaints caught the attention of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and Colorado Sens.
But we've seen them in court, and they're not the guys you'd most fear.
Bureau of Prisons officials stressed that 95 percent of the Supermax prisoners are the most violent, disruptive and escape-prone inmates from other federal prisons, and they were transferred to ADX to help control those other facilities.
The one-on-one killers who slashed or strangled other inmates, earning a trip to Supermax, are the inmates one would most worry about.
He says Supermax is actually better than some places he's been.
"We are not really worried about a chopper escape attempt, but you've got to be prepared."
It will be 30 days before they finally have access to the 9/11 papers, and then they will find that all articles dealing with the anniversary or terrorism will have been excised.
But it's a start.
