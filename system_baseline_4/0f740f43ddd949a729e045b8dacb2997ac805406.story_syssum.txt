The company announced a new version of its popular Nexus 7 tablet during a press event Wednesday in San Francisco.
The higher resolution screen is now 1,920 by 1,200 pixels, packing in 323 pixels per inch.
The streaming-video company's new Android app will stream movies at 1080p on the Nexus 7.
The new version of Android 4.3 will have parental controls so you can prevent the little ones from seeing saucy content or inappropriate apps.
Many of those users are downloading content such as apps, music and movies from the Google Play store.
Older Nexus devices will also be able to test out the Android upgrade -- existing Nexus 4, Nexus 7, Nexus 10 and Galaxy Samsung devices will receive over-the-air updates for the operating system.
