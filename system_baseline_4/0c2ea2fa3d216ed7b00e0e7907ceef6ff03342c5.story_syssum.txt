(CNN) -- One Australian gold prospector has hit pay dirt.
The 47-year resident of Ballarat says that gold has been continuously found in the region since 1851, but technology has recently become an essential aid for modern prospectors.
A Minelab GPX Model 5000 metal detector was used to find the nugget, Kent says.
A nice, small nugget would already sell for 10% to 15% above its weight in gold."
While many people in the region have been searching for gold for decades, Kent's friend only started last year.
