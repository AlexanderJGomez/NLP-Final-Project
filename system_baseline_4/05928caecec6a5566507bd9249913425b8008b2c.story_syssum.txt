(CNN) -- Though Sir David Frost doesn't see his 1977 interviews with former President Richard Nixon as "an intellectual 'Rocky' " -- in the words of "Frost/Nixon" playwright and screenwriter Peter Morgan -- he does agree that the sessions had their "adversarial" moments.
Nixon famously let down his guard, a moment depicted in in "Frost/Nixon," the new Ron Howard-directed film starring Frank Langella as Nixon and Michael Sheen as Frost.
Frost and Nixon mostly sat together talking.

"It was amazing to discover how ... hopeless he was at small talk," Frost told CNN.
"For 20 minutes at his house ... my girlfriend and I saw a carefree Nixon," he recalled.
Frost once characterized him as "a living enigma," a term he comes back to.

"We've found that people are so interested in this film that they want to see, again, the original DVD of the Watergate [interview], so we've done that," he said.
Many reviewers have made much of a scene in which a drunken Nixon makes a late-night phone call to Frost, an event that never happened.
But what they got, they got ... absolutely right."
