"My son was murdered as he was leaving a bar in Greenville, South Carolina," the 48-year-old woman told CNN about her son, Sean, who was 20 when he came face-to-face with what she calls a hate crime.
He did not get far, she said.
Sean was taken to Greenville Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced brain dead 17 hours later.
Had hate crimes been a federal offense in 2007, the FBI would have been able to investigate the attack, and Sean Kennedy's killer might still be in prison, his mother said.
Obama is to sign the measure, which was added to a $680 billion defense authorization bill, on Wednesday.
"We are going there representing so many people," she said.
But Attorney General Eric Holder has said that any federal hate-crimes law would be used only to prosecute violent acts based on bias, as opposed to the prosecution of speech based on controversial racial or religious beliefs.
Opponents of the expanded hate crimes bill challenged the need to specify one particular community in federal legislation.
