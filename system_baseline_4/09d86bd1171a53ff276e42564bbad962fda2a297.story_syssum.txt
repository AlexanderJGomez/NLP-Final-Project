What does Al-Shabaab want?
Al-Shabaab is a Somali group that the United States designated as a foreign terrorist organization in March 2008.
In 2011, A U.S. official who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the information said Al-Shabaab was estimated to control up to 1,000 fighters.
And Al-Shabaab has links to other organizations.
It was, in part, funded by former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.
(Al-Shabaab means "the youth.")
And that move inflamed Al-Shabaab, which attacked Ethiopian forces and gained control of parts of central and southern Somalia, according to a 2011 case study by Rob Wise, who was then with the Counterterrorism Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
Analysts say tension appears to have been growing within Al-Shabaab between Somalis and foreign fighters, several hundred of whom are thought to have entered Somalia in recent years to join the group.
He was reportedly killed in Somalia by Al-Shabaab.
The once-ragtag al Qaeda affiliate has grown into an economic powerhouse, raising tens of millions of dollars in cash from schemes that have involved extortion, illegal taxation and other "fees," according to the 2011 United Nations report.

The United States has supported U.N.-backed African forces fighting Al-Shabaab and strengthened its counterterrorism efforts against the group.
But that didn't mean Al-Shabaab was calling it quits.
But there has been political progress in Somalia.
