"The islands are ours," he yells, referring to China's claim on what it calls the Diaoyu islands.
This is not just any day, it is the anniversary of the incident that set off the Japanese invasion of China in 1931.
The open displays of anti-Japanese fury, say some China watchers, is a convenient distraction for the Communist Party as it grapples with a fraught leadership transition marked by political scandal, murder, "disappearances" and infighting.
But this is not just about anger and pride, it is about money.
Chinese analysts like Guo Xiangjiang, the Deputy Director of the China Institute of International Studies, say there should be no question about who owns the islands.
China says its claim on Diaoyu extends back hundreds of years.
"We hope that the U.S. can earnestly honor its principle of not taking positions on the Diaoyu issue," he said.
Thousands marched outside the Japan embassy in China Tuesday.
Of course we will fight for Diaoyu," the protester asks.
China normally clamps down on protests like this.
