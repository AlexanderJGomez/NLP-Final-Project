California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom wore the specs on "The Gavin Newsom Show," and later told Wired about his brief experience with one of the world's most rarefied pieces of technology.
On the show, Brin also provided our first glimpse into how the Google Glass interface is navigated.
Newsom told Wired that he was impressed by the image quality of the display in the glasses.
After returning the glasses to his own face, Brin swiped down on the touchpad of the glasses and continued the interview.
Brin told Newsom that he brought a rough prototype.
The Google co-founder told Newsom that Google X is now his primary focus at Google.
To this point, Newsom told us that he was surprised by "how unremarkable the glasses are except for the remarkable feature."
