But Kagan displayed in her confirmation hearing Tuesday what those two men share -- a ready public wit and disarming sense of humor.
"It means I'd have to get my hair done more often, Sen. Specter," Kagan replied.
... We are looking for somebody who could moderate the court, and a little humor would do a lot of good."
Kagan found that in the folksy, clever phrasing of Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, who asked her about her 1995 statements criticizing past Supreme Court confirmation hearings as a "vapid and hollow charade."
On another occasion, Kagan was left giggling by an exchange between Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and committee chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont.
"All I can say about that paper is that it is dangerous to write papers about the law before you've spent a day in law school," Kagan said.
"I wrote that paper before I spent a day in law school.
"You know if I accept your answer, it is going to spoil a whole five minutes I had here," Grassley responded.
Late in the day, conservative Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, said he would ask Kagan a "softball" question.
"Sen. Graham, that is an undecided legal issue, which well, I suppose I should ask exactly what you mean by that," Kagan began.
To be fair, the members of the court usually labeled liberal -- Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor, and the retired John Paul Stevens -- all display great legal minds but not much sharp-edged humor or the willingness to engage in spirited debate for which Kagan is known.
Justice Stephen Breyer is equally smart and he too shares a sense of humor, but that tends to fall on the quirky, self-deprecating side.
Schumer paid Kagan a high compliment Tuesday, noting Scalia gets the most laughs during high court oral arguments.
