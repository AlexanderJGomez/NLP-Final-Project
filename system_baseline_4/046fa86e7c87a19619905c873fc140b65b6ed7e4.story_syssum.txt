(CNN) -- Since the July 3 military coup, Egypt has been witness to the rise of a new military dictatorship led by Field Marshal Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.
By pouring billions of dollars into Egypt's economy, the Saudis and Emiratis believe that they can appropriate the Egyptian army and use it as a Trojan horse in order to eliminate and crush Islamists.
Indeed, el-Sisi's Gulf counterparts view him as a "savior" not only from Islamists but more importantly from the very existential threat to their thrones: democracy.
The U.S. and the EU have failed miserably in pressuring the military to separate itself from politics and return to the barracks.
The U.S. policymakers believe that Egypt's military is the only force capable of retaining stability and maintaining security.
And despite the ruthless security campaign there, militant Islamists still pose a serious threat to Egypt's national security.
El-Sisi, Egypt's most likely post-coup president, will not be able to bring stability or security to the country.
Surely, el-Sisi's Gulf backers will likely continue their "lifeline" of support, at least for a while.
This money could buy el-Sisi some time but it will not certainly bring stability.
