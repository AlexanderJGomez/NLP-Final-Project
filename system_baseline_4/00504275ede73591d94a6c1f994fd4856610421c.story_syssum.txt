(Mother Nature Network) -- Mother's Day poems come in all shapes and sizes.

Here's a list of selected works to get you started with Mother's Day poems:
You too, my mother, read my rhymes For love of unforgotten times, And you may chance to hear once more The little feet along the floor.
And may you happy live, And long us bless; Receiving as you give Great happiness.
I know whose love would follow me still, Mother o' mine, O mother o' mine!
If I were damned of body and soul, I know whose prayers would make me whole, Mother o' mine, O mother o' mine!
