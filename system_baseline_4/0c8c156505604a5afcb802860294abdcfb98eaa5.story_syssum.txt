She said she feels like it will be easier to lose more weight.
But she found that those diets weren't sustainable.
Reaching this 10-pound milestone, from 190 to 180 pounds, makes her feel as if it will be easier to lose more weight, she said.
But she plans to resume working out soon and wants to take classes at her gym.
Often, the initial weight loss will seem the easiest, and then the loss slows somewhat over time, said Tara Gidus, dietician for the Orlando Magic NBA team and owner of Tara Gidus Nutrition Consulting in Orlando, Florida.
At that rate, someone like Kim could lose 50 pounds in six months, she said.
A pace faster than that -- such as 10 pounds per month -- would be hard to keep up, Gidus said.
"That's basically 2 pounds a week, plus 3 more," she said.
