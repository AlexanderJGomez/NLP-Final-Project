Square, which enables the virtual exchange of cash and goods, is designed to "give time back to our sellers, give time back to our merchants, so they can really focus on building their business up," Dorsey told CNN.
"What I think is great about technology, and every technology that exists, [is that] it increases the number of people who can participate, in our case commerce," Dorsey said.
Square is competing in a jammed arena -- mobile payments already exist via Paypal and others -- but Dorsey told CNN its pitch is different.
However, Dorsey said Square is an "entirely new canvas," dealing as it does with commerce rather than communication.
Both ideas are "fundamental to humanity....both are extremely complex and both companies are trying to make each simple."
