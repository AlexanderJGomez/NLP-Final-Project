Haifa, Israel (CNN) -- Israeli police said Friday that they suspect arson in the wildfire that has killed at least 41 people and injured 17 in northern Israel over the past two days.
A police investigative team and a fire expert team have been working to determine the cause of the fire, which started from a single location, said Dudi Cohen, Israeli police commissioner.
More than 15,000 people have been evacuated from villages and towns in the area, emergency officials said.
The fire, which began Thursday morning on Mount Carmel and spread through nearby areas, has triggered an outcry in Israel.
"On the way here, we flew over Carmel, where we heard and saw the Greek aircraft fighting the fire," Netanyahu said.
Chemicals to suppress the flames -- including 45 metric tons of fire retardant and 12,000 liters of foam -- will arrive this weekend through the U.S. Agency for International Development, that agency said, with teams of U.S.-based firefighting specialists also on their way.
"I appreciate this much in a time of a humanitarian and ecological crisis.
