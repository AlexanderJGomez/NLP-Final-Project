Hong Kong (CNN) -- This is the story of two entrepreneurs with two very different interests.
He was laid off and divorced that month.
He networked with friends, brainstormed and came up with a business idea that embraced his passion: martial arts.
He wanted to start a mixed martial arts company in Asia for Asian-Pacific fighters.
Those all sort of pointed in my mind to a much more favorable environment than ever before to start a sports media-oriented business," Haskamp says.
Maximilian von Poelnitz found a problem and started a business to solve it.
He and two friends came up with the concept for Secret Ingredient, a delivery service of fresh ingredients for ready-to-cook dishes with the cooking instructions included.
"The success of our business depends on logistics," von Poelnitz says.
After about 250 test meals -- mostly with friends -- Secret Ingredient launched last fall in Hong Kong.
It's the time question for me ... the price point is really reasonable," she says.
What made Haskamp believe investors would buy into the niche idea of setting up mixed martial arts fights and that the public would pay good money to see a fight?
One is a former lawyer and the other is a chef who used to run a private kitchen in Hong Kong.
Legend started out in Haskamp's small Hong Kong apartment.
"We don't have very much of an advertising budget," says von Poelnitz.
"Being in the food business, holidays are your big enemy which seems counterintuitive," says von Poelnitz.
I trusted myself and ultimately, I think it's paid off," says Haskamp.
