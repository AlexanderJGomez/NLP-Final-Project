When it was announced last year that we would be getting a Green Day version of "Rock Band," fans of the band (myself included) were pretty excited.
Playing songs like "When I Come Around" and "Pulling Teeth" brings back memories of college days, and yes, I will admit I wish they had put "All By Myself" in the game, because it's the only hidden track that Green Day has ever included on an album.
Most of the songs included in the game are ones that fans of Green Day can listen to again and again.

In the Oakland venue the band is decked out in waistcoats, trousers and pin-striped shirts to match the vibe of the album.
In this case, you get "cred" instead of "fans" and with that the ability to open up more sets with tougher songs like "Peacemaker" from "21st Century Breakdown" -- a fun, fast-paced song about death and destruction.
Sore arms and scratchy voice aside, "Green Day: Rock Band" is a lot of fun.
