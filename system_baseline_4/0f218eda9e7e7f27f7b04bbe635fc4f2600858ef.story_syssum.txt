(CNN) -- There is no evidence to suggest that the two men who used stolen passports to get aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 had anything to do with its disappearance Saturday as it was flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, an official said Tuesday.
They entered Malaysia on February 28 using valid Iranian passports.
To fly out of Malaysia, Reza and Nourmohammadi used passports that were stolen in Thailand, a booming market for stolen passports.
Authorities said they don't know how Reza and Nourmohammadi came to possess the passports.
While Ali made the initial booking by telephone, Ali or someone acting on his behalf paid cash for the tickets, police said.
The ticket for the holder of the Austrian passport ended in Frankfurt, Germany.
"If you read what the head of Malaysia police said recently, about (Nourmohammadi) ... wanting to travel to Frankfurt, Germany, to be with his mother, (this) is part of a human smuggling issue and not a terrorist issue," Interpol's Noble said.
"After the Green Revolution in Iran for human rights and democracy was crushed by Iranian authorities, there were many Iranians who fled to Malaysia," he told CNN's Kristie Lu Stout.
"A stolen passport can be one way to do it," Robertson said.
