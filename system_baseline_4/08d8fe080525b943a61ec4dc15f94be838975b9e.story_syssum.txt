(CNN) -- Khaldoon Khalifa Al Mubarak is CEO of Mubadala Development Company.
CNN's John Defterios met Mubarak in Abu Dhabi and began by asking him about Mubadala's recent purchase of a 7.5 percent stake in the U.S. investment firm, Carlyle Group for $1.35 billion.
Defterios: In the past we've talked about a return or a double-bottom line for Mubadala when you approach investments.
So it's a very good fit for us, it's a very good deal for Mubadala and I think it's the right step.
Mubarak: We've met with all the executives at Carlyle, we've looked at their track record.
Defterios: That's an understatement.
Mubarak: It's been a tremendous roller coaster ride over the last couple of years, and the growth in Abu Dhabi, the growth in the region and the growth that Mubadala has gone through is tremendous.
I mean how do we know that's not just a vanity investment for Ferrari?
Mubarak: Well Ferrari has been a very exciting and interesting investment for us.
Two years later, we have a Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi.
Mubarak: Mubadala now is focusing on creating a good corporate institution.
It's a totally different ball game than maybe 10 years ago or maybe 15 years ago, with the type of corporations and institutions that are now coming up in the region, and the approach they are taking in the investment strategies that they are pursuing.
Mubarak: Abu Dhabi has typically been very conservative in its approach.
