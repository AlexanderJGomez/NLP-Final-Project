Hue is, in many ways, a city of ghosts, of memories and spirits -- and we play on that in Sunday's episode.
It begins with a camera movement inside a "Spirit House" -- the dollhouse-sized shrines that many believers keep outside their homes and businesses.
In the weeks following the initial North Vietnamese taking of the city of Hue, many hundreds -- if not thousands -- of citizens, deemed dangerous or counterrevolutionary or otherwise undesirable, were summarily executed and buried in unmarked mass graves by the communist forces.
Many, many people were lost, their bodies never identified or recovered.
At one point, a young woman I'm having dinner with casually mentions that her mother doesn't like her to go out after dark.
It's not.
You will see me with some old friends -- and you will, as always in Vietnam, see me eating some amazing food.
