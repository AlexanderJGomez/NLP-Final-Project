Joel and Victoria Osteen appear on "Larry King Live" Tuesday night.
Joel Osteen: Well, I think he's doing a great job.
Victoria Osteen: I've been really impressed.
Joel Osteen: Well, it matters to me.
Victoria Osteen: It does.
...
Joel Osteen: It's a living translation of the Bible, which is an easy version to read.
Joel Osteen: You know, I don't know where it's all going ...
Victoria Osteen: We really want to see marriage between a man and a woman.
...
Joel Osteen: Yeah, exactly.
I know a lot of people raised by single parents.
Joel Osteen: I'm trying to think where he's coming from.
...
Joel Osteen: Well, he's a smart man and I respect him.
Joel Osteen: You know, it's really sad.
...
King: Do you pray for them, Victoria?
...
Victoria Osteen: I think it is.
And I think that if you don't watch it, you'll just spiral down and down and down.
And that is why we feel so strongly about just giving people hope.
Joel Osteen: Well, it's difficult.
...
...
And I believe that our spirit's on the inside.
