(CNN) -- Scores of people died Thursday in and around the restive Syrian city of Hama, activists said, corroborating reports of widespread casualties a day after the start of a new military clampdown targeting protesters.
The activist group, citing the medical source, said scores more were wounded.
One resident who spoke to CNN by satellite phone said some of the casualties who were taken to hospitals died there because the facilities were without electricity.
People who tried to leave, he said, were being shot.
One of the sources is a representative of the Syrian Revolution Coordination Union, an opposition group.
The men fired into the air and beat some of the worshipers as they left the buildings, the sources said.
The protesters were allowed safe passage out of the mosque after they promised to end their protests, the sources said.
The move came a day after the U.N. Security Council issued a presidential statement condemning the Syrian government's crackdown on protesters and calling for an immediate end to violence by all parties.
At the very least, its position must include imposing an arms embargo, freezing the assets of President al-Assad and other officials suspected of responsibility for crimes against humanity, and referring the situation to the ICC prosecutor," he said, in reference to the International Criminal Court.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said Syria's citizens should solve their problems themselves, state-run RIA Novosti said.
It said an opposition leader in the city reported that the government had launched a series of measures to punish residents.
Syrian lawmakers had already passed a law granting citizens the right to establish political parties with the aim of contributing to political life "through peaceful and democratic means," the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported.
