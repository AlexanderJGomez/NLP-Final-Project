The Duke of Cambridge was speaking just before the first official football match at Buckingham Palace.
Wearing boots given to him by Manchester United and England star Wayne Rooney, he joined members of the queen's household team in a training session.
This is a space normally graced only by family members and the odd garden party.
The groundsmen spent much of the morning cleaning up the football pitch with a vacuum cleaner.
Now the historic match is over (Polytechnic won 2-1) the corgis and geese have their garden back.
