HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- With polls closed for a Zimbabwe runoff that opposition politicians and international observers call a sham, alleged torture victims who support former candidate Morgan Tsvangirai said Friday that they back his decision to pull out of the race.
In the March 29 election, MDC officials said their polling showed Tsvangirai clearly defeating Mugabe, who at 84 is the only president Zimbabwe has had since it gained independence from Britain in 1980.
MDC supporters had already reported violence against them by police, military members and other supporters of Mugabe's Zanu-PF party.
"Mostly for the rural people -- the police would come in for the Zanu-PF, so the area was very tense," said a municipal worker at the hospital, who said he was kicked and had burning plastic poured on his skin about three or four days ago.
"Everyone was beaten.
It's very, very easy for anyone to stage-manage a demonstration, and a violent one at that."
Another man and a woman treated for broken hands at the hospital said they were tortured and had boiling water poured on their genitals for being MDC supporters.
"Very optimistic, upbeat ... and hungry," he said when asked how he was feeling.
