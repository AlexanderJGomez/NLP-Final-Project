Beijing (CNN) -- Han Junqian doesn't go outside very often.
Han is blind, and his life is similar to the roughly 120,000 blind massage therapists in China today, according to a 2012 report by Changchun University.
China's Ministry of Education decided to provide Braille or electronic versions of this June's "gaokao," China's brutally competitive national college entrance exams, effectively opening the door for blind citizens to access higher education.
"It's fairly meaningless," said Hallett.
When they are educated at all, blind people are shoved into segregated schools that are isolated from the rest of society.
"It's a kind of apartheid," said Hallett.
"We're not required to finish everything," said Ni Zhen, a former student of the Qingdao School for the Blind.
"It's not fair that blind people have so few opportunities," said an official from the association who requested anonymity.
The association, however, offered no solution to the problem of implementation that Hallett and others cited as crucial to the success of the new regulations.
With his best years behind him, Han has no plans to sit for the "gaokao," even if it is made available.
