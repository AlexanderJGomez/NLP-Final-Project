Over the last week, thousands seeking free medical care have turned up at the mobile health care clinic set up by Remote Area Medical, a non-profit organization founded by Brock.
Tuesday marks the final day of its eight-day operation in Los Angeles, which so far has resulted in the provision of at least $2 million in free health care services, according to Brock's early estimates.
On the final day of the Los Angeles operation, Brock said crowds were still gathering with the hope of receiving care.
It hasn't reached its target of treating 1,500 patients a day, but Brock still considers the operation a success.
While limited access to health care is often associated with developing countries, it's a problem that faces patients around the world.
The lack of accessible health care from an economic standpoint is a problem that has been going on for decades, Brock said.
RAM usually provides services in the Appalachia region of the U.S. where it's easier for volunteers to work, Brock said.
Unfortunately, he said, other states don't have similar provisions, making it difficult for RAM to recruit enough local volunteers to be able to deal with the demand if they were to set up in areas like New York or Washington.
