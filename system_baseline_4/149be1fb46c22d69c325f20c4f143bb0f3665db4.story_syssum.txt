CNN projects incumbent Sen. Pat Roberts has fended off conservative challenger Milton Wolf in the state's GOP Senate primary.
Wolf's campaign for months tried to portray Roberts as more in tune with Washington than Kansas, pointing to reports from earlier this year that the senator listed his voting address at the home of two longtime political supporters who rent a room to him.
Our republic needs us to stand up and fight and it is the greatest honor of my life to stand shoulder to shoulder with you," he said.
And it is the biggest honor of my life to say that I stood with you."
The Wolf campaign ran numerous ads attacking Roberts over his residency.
In the closing weeks of the primary campaign, Wolf highlighted what he said was Robert's refusal to debate him.
"You told Kansans you would give them your word and you would give them a debate," Wolf said to Roberts.
"This is not the time.
Let's just debate," Wolf continued as Roberts walked off.
Roberts' campaign was asked why he wouldn't debate.
Also in Kansas, Rep. Mike Pompeo beat former congressman Todd Tiahrt in the Republican primary for the state's 4th Congressional District, CNN projects.
In Michigan's 3rd Congressional District, the familiar 2014 narrative -- tea party challenger takes on establishment GOP incumbent -- was turned on its head.
Challenger Brian Ellis, a businessman who has support from the Chamber of Commerce, tried to unseat two-term Rep. Justin Amash, a libertarian who won his seat in the 2010 tea party wave that landed Republicans in the House majority.
