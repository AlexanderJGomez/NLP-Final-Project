The Florida Division of Law Enforcement will investigate Monday's arrest of Andrew Meyer, said University of Florida President J. Bernard Machen.
"The thing that I regret is that civil dialogue and civil discourse did not happen," Machen said.
"You will take my question because I have been listening to your crap for two hours," Meyer told Kerry, according to the police report of the incident.
Do you have this?
Organizers had cut off questioning before Meyer went to the microphone, she said.
One of the police officers on the scene observed that Meyer was "yelling as loud as he could as to sensationalize his presence," according to the police report.
Meyer responded, "What did I do?
You were just trying to do your job," Meyer said, according to the police report.
Meyer was charged with resisting arrest with violence -- a felony -- and a misdemeanor count of disturbing the peace.
But the arrest triggered a protest by a group of University of Florida students Tuesday.
Meyer was carrying a business card advertising "TheAndrewMeyer.com 'Speak My Mind,' " the police report said.
In a statement issued Tuesday, Kerry said he didn't know a Taser had been used on the student until after he left the event, and said he hoped no one was injured.
In addition, he said a student-faculty review panel will examine "all of our protocols relative to student dialogue and faculty interaction" in the wake of the incident.
