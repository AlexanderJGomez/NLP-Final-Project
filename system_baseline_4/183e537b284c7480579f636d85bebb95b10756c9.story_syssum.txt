Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Yemeni Vice President Abdurabu Mansur Hadi kicked off his presidential campaign Tuesday, announcing he will run in the February 21 election.
Under the plan forged by the Gulf Cooperation Council, Saleh -- who's been in office for 33 years -- will step down after the February 21 elections and will receive immunity from prosecution.
However, Hadi insisted on running for election, saying his presidency is not official unless he is chosen by the people.
"Hadi made it clear that the Saleh regime is over and he is seeking to be looked at as a president for a nation and not for a political party," said Abdul Salam Mohammed, director of the Sanaa-based Abaad Strategic Center.
"Our main goal during our revolution is to oust Ali Saleh from power.
This will be accomplished in two weeks, but his family is still in control of the country's military," said Sanaa youth activist Mohammed Hashem.
