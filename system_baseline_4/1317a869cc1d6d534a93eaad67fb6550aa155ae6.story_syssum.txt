Ruben Navarrette Jr. notes that immigrants have been criticized throughout history for not assimilating.
Yet, even as they look down on new immigrants, many Americans look back fondly upon their immigrant ancestors.
And even while Americans complain about how the current crop of immigrants aren't like their predecessors, they miss the irony: At the time, there were people who said the same thing about their ancestors; the Germans were thought to not be like the English, the Irish weren't like the Germans, the Italians weren't like the Irish etc.
The local newspaper would do a feature.
Far from discovering that recent immigrants are ducking the assimilation process, the study found that "immigrants of the past quarter-century have assimilated more rapidly than their counterparts of a century ago, even though they are more distinct from the native population upon arrival."
Chinese and Indian immigrants have low levels of cultural assimilation.
Assimilation happens, whether the immigrants are ready or not.
Of course, fear doesn't listen to facts.
