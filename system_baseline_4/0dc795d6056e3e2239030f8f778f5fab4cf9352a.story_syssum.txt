CAPE TOWN, South Africa (CNN) -- The girl sleeping in the bunk above me either had Swine Flu, SARS, Tuberculosis or some sort of perfect storm of all three, because she managed to hack and snort throughout the entire night in an almost exact pattern of: Hack.
The sharks arrived and disappeared quickly.
Nevertheless, I managed to get out of bed on time, and actually felt pretty decent as we drove two hours from Cape Town to some quiet fishing village where about 30 cold, tired backpackers squeezed onto an old boat and into the sea in search of great white sharks.
But just as quickly as the sharks arrived, they were gone.
Either way, I found it interesting that our friends across the pond were collectively becoming violently ill.
Of course, I chalk this up mostly to the early start and cold weather, but, even at its best, I've definitely had better times in my life.
Hack.
Snort.
