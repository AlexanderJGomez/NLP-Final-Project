One of the most urgent is child farm labor.
And unlike their counterparts in retail and service, child farm laborers can legally work unlimited hours at any hour of day or night.
Children 14 and older can work long hours at all but the most dangerous farm jobs without their parents' consent, if they do not miss school.
Sometimes they earn nothing.
In 2011 Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis proposed more stringent agricultural labor rules for children under 16, but Obama scrapped them just eight months later.
If this year follows trends, Curvin will be only one of at least 100 children below the age of 18 killed on American farms, not to mention the 23,000 who will be injured badly enough to require hospital admission.
Farm parents, their children, and the American Farm Bureau objected strenuously to the proposed new rules.
And until the economy stabilizes, the savings farms realize by hiring children makes it likely that even more of them will be subject to the dangers of farm work.
Second, the Department of Labor must institute age, wage, hour and safety regulations that meet the standards set by retail and service industry rules.
Unenforced rules won't protect the nearly million other children who work on farms.
Let's make sure it's not one our children have to die for.
