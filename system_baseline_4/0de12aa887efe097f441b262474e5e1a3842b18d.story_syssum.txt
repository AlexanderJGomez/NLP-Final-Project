Officials were no longer confident in his effectiveness, said Col. Jim Slife, commander of the 1st Special Operations Wing.
Slife said the new squadron commander has extensive history in the Osprey program.
The Osprey was assigned to the 1st Special Operations Wing, the Air Force said.
A redesign was ordered, and the craft resumed flights in 2002.
