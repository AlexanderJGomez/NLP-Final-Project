Intuit, which also makes TurboTax, maintains the two personal-finance tools in tandem, and recent updates to each, such as the free Mint iPad app that launched on Wednesday or the major new version of Quicken that hit stores last month, are indicative of how different their audiences think about their money.
Quicken comes in many flavors and can cost anywhere from $30 to $150, with one advertisement for a Quicken credit card shown infrequently.
Quicken has been around for nearly 30 years, whereas Mint was founded in 2006 and was acquired by Intuit just a couple of years ago.
At least three versions of Quicken 2012 appear in the top 50 for software sold on Amazon.com, but an Intuit spokeswoman declined to provide sales data.
About a third of Quicken customers buy a new version every year, and another third upgrade every three years, said Eddy Wu, an Intuit senior product manager.
"Most people don't like to do all that manual data entry," Wu said.
The Mint and Quicken teams keep each other informed about what they're working on for their respective software, but the development teams are separate, Wu said.
When it struggled to make inroads and then failed in its $1.5 billion bid to acquire Intuit in 1994 due to federal antitrust concerns, Microsoft retreated.
