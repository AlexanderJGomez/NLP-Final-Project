"The two raids over the weekend show that President Obama remains very comfortable deploying special operations forces in countries the United States is not at war with as a means to combat terrorist groups, just as he is comfortable with the use of CIA drones for the same purpose in countries such as Pakistan and Yemen," says CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen.
"Barack Obama has been a lethal president," says Fawaz Gerges of the London School of Economics and Political Science.
"The Obama Doctrine, when it comes to al Qaeda and its extremist allies, is really a kill strategy," Gerges says.
"Because the Obama Doctrine is to kill."
After a large-scale chemical attack which the U.S. blamed on al-Assad's regime, "it was all about the credibility of the president," Gerges says.
"In the sense that the word has typically been used to describe a president's vision for managing national security challenges around the world, I don't think Obama has a doctrine," says Pletka, who identifies herself as conservative.
No doctrine?
But if Obama doesn't have a so-called doctrine, that just might be a good thing, according to some analysts.
"Every American foreign policy 'doctrine' but one was formulated during the Cold War, for a bipolar world, when American policy toward one country -- the Soviet Union -- dominated all U.S. strategy and was the defining aspect of global affairs.
"Beyond al Qaeda, there is no Obama Doctrine," he says.
During a recent speech to the U.N. General Assembly, Obama did not mention East Asia except for a single reference to China in regard to Iran, Bremmer says.
