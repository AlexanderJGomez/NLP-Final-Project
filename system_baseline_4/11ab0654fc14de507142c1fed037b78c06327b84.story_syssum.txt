New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton said Tuesday he is disappointed in himself and feels regret over a scandal that has left him suspended for the entire 2012 season.
It also found that Payton lied about the bounty program.
The probe found that the Saints showed "a deliberate effort to conceal the program's existence from league investigators, and a clear determination to maintain the program despite express direction from Saints ownership that it stop as well as ongoing inquiries from the league office," the NFL said.
Asked whether anyone on another team was injured as a result of the bounty program, Payton said no.
With five days left to appeal his suspension, Payton said he will make a decision in the next two to three days.
Meanwhile, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said Monday he's focusing on punishments for players.
"When interviewed in 2012, Sean Payton claimed to be entirely unaware of the program, a claim contradicted by others," the statement said.
