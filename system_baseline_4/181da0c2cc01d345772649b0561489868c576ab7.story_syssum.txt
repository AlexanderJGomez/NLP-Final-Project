To entertain waiting passengers, Dalian International Airport recently recruited a squad of cheerleaders to perform kicks, jumps and splits in the airport's main hall.
It's also a way for the Dalian airport to "demonstrate spirit and shoulder social responsibility," according to an airport press release.
Dalian International Airport is the biggest airport in northeastern China and the fourth busiest in China (by international passengers).
Statistics from the Civil Aviation Administration of China had almost one in four flights suffering delays last year.
However, that only measures the time a plane's doors are closed, not when the aircraft actually took off.
