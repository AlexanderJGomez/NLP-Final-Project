The four underwater signals that search teams detected are still "the most promising lead" investigators have in the search for the Boeing 777, Angus Houston told CNN's Anna Coren on Monday.
"Analysis on all four detections is continuing," he said.
"Without that, we would be essentially searching the whole of the Indian Ocean, and I think the chances of finding the aircraft in those circumstances would have been slim," Houston said.
He said his greatest concern throughout the two-month search has been the families of those on board.
"I think some of the commentary about what the Malaysians have done, I don't think is as fair and objective as it might have been," Houston said.
Houston said he understands why many families are frustrated by the lack of information.
"I think that's something that we, as a world community, have to correct as soon as possible," Houston said.
On the same day that Houston spoke, a satellite communications company said it would begin providing a free global airline tracking service.
