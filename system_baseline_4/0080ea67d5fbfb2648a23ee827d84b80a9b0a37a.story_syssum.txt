(CNN) -- Announcement of a Nintendo 2DS handheld console is causing a collective "eh" among fans of the pioneering gaming company.
Some are asking why a 2DS model is needed when 3-D can be turned off on the current console, while others are calling for Nintendo executives' heads.
While the Nintendo DS can only play DS games, the 2DS and 3DS can play games designed for the DS or the 3DS.
Nintendo, for its part, has said the new device is designed for young kids, despite having promotional videos with adults using it.
The new console may appeal to "parents who want to buy their kids PokÃ©mon and a 3DS at an affordable price," wrote Haziq, a member of popular online video-gaming forum NeoGAF.
Twitter user @kellyherron27 wonders whether Nintendo is not happy with the 3DS market anymore.

"They're aiming at kids wanting the new PokÃ©mon game and if parents can get it cheap, it'll sell over a more expensive 3DS model."
