SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- The last bit of news I heard before boarding a plane to Seoul a few days ago was that North Korea had just fired 100 artillery shells into the sea near the border with South Korea.
Stories from refugees who have escaped from North Korea are a chilling reminder that the regime is not just a military threat, it is causing a terrible humanitarian crisis.
North Korea is a Riddle Kingdom that is simultaneously threatening, bizarre and brutal.
It may also have launched a torpedo that same year which sank a South Korean navy ship, killing 46.
The news from North Korea can be so disconcerting that spoofs and rumors regularly make it into the news and social media as if they were fact.
And, why not?
North Korean government researchers announced their country is the second happiest in the world -- second only to China.
The three generations of Kim men who have ruled the North are painted as supernatural to the local population.
The authorities have created their own reality, brainwashed the population to keep the state functioning and the regime secure.
By firing missiles, threatening neighbors and acting erratically, North Korea portrays itself as mysterious and volatile, and even that perception magnifies its ability to create fear, adding to its power and helping keep the despotic regime in control.
