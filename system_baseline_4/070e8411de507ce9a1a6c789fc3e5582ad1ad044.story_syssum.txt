Secretary of State John Kerry took his case on Wednesday to Capitol Hill, urging Congress not to impose new sanctions on Iran as talks with that country on its nuclear program heat up.
A member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Graham said he intends to propose a measure that would mandate more sanctions, aimed at forcing Iran to dismantle its nuclear program, a move that runs counter to interim steps sought by multinational negotiators earlier this month in Geneva, Switzerland.
Sanctions have long  been a tool for the United States, in coordination with other nations, to clamp down on Iran and compel it not to move toward developing nuclear weapons.
If Tehran defies any deal, sanctions can be ramped up again, he said.
Sen. Tim Johnson, a South Dakota Democrat and chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, won't decide whether he'll go forward with a proposal for more sanctions until after Wednesday's briefing and talks with his colleagues, a committee aide said.
Kirk pushed for strong sanctions.
"I think today is the day in which I witnessed a future of nuclear war in the Middle East in the future (that) someday will be part of our children's heritage," Kirk said.
"Punishing" sanctions "forced Iran to the negotiating table," he said.
"And those who take that position ought to be clear that they, in essence, are suggesting that war is the only alternative."
