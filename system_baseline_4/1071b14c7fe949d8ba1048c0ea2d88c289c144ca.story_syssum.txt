Of the 56 animals released Tuesday night, only a grizzly bear, two monkeys and three leopards were taken alive, Muskingum County Sheriff Matt Lutz said.
And with night falling Tuesday, he gave the order to kill the escaped animals.
Hanna, the zoo's director emeritus, said he was upset by loss of "precious" animals, but defended the decision to use deadly force.
He said the drugs take several minutes to subdue an animal even with a good shot, and one tiger had to be killed Wednesday afternoon when it turned on a veterinarian after being hit with a tranquilizer dart.

Zanesville Mayor Howard Zwelling said he received calls from people who were concerned that the animals had been killed.
"These are 300-pound Bengal tigers that we have had to put down," he said.
Authorities were waiting on the results of an autopsy to determine the exact cause of his death, but Lutz said Thompson shot himself just after releasing the animals.
"It was like a war zone," Kopchak said when authorities descended on Thompson's property, set off the road named after Kopchak's family.
Lutz said authorities found primates inside the house.
Warne said he had met Thompson a few times.
"Every month brings a new, bizarre, almost surreal incident involving privately held, dangerous wild animals," said Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of the Humane Society.
Douthitt said it is inappropriate for people like Thompson to keep dangerous animals as pets, just as it was to shoot so many of them.
Local governments, she said, ought to train law enforcement officers so they are prepared for bizarre cases such as the one that unfolded in Zanesville.
