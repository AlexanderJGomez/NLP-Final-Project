In the wake of criticism over a two-game suspension for Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice, the NFL has established a six-game unpaid ban for personnel who violate the league's policy on domestic violence, Commissioner Roger Goodell said Thursday.
The policy, which is effective immediately, also applies to other types of violence.
"We were informed today of the NFL's decision to increase penalties on domestic violence offenders under the Personal Conduct Policy for all NFL employees.
Rice resolved the charges stemming from the incident with his now-wife, Janay, and entered a pretrial intervention program in May, the NFL said.
The NFL's Personal Conduct Policy states that employees are "held to a higher standard" of conduct.
The NFL regular season is 16 games.
