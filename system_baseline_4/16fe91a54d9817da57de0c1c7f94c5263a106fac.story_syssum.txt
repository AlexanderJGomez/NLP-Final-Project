Forecasters said Boston will get 3 to 6 inches of snow and sleet before rain begins to fall Tuesday night.
This will keep overall snow totals down, but traveling will still be difficult," meteorologist J.C. Monahan said.
The New England mountains will get between 10 and 14 inches with snow falling at up to 2 inches per hour Monday night, forecasters said.
A tornado touched down Monday afternoon in Rutherford County near Nashville, Tennessee, county officials said.
The warning said there were areas where visibility was almost zero because of blowing snow, and there was significant ice on the highways and streets.
One highway was blocked because of snow drifts covering the road, CNN affiliate KXJB reported.
