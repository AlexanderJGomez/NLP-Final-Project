I'm not mad at Tiger Woods, or Nike.
Back in 2009, when Woods took his public plunge into disgrace by cheating on his wife with a long list of silicone-enhanced beauties, we criticized him for being a fake.
But I never thought it was Tiger's job to teach my son how to be a responsible, loving husband or father.
His wife and family -- and Tiger himself -- really were the only ones hurt by his actions.
And good for Nike for standing by him through what was in the end just a personal flaw.
Don't be mad at Tiger.
Tiger has nothing to do with my life or relationships.
How many times have we said to ourselves at work: "I can turn my career around with one success on my next project?"
Or, "One win will make my bosses happy and all will be forgotten?"
Just think of Super Bowl Champion Ray Lewis, who the NFL calls one of the best men to ever play the game.
Why?
Tiger got back up.
And I hope this time around he can relax, be himself and enjoy the game.
