Carey, 34, died after police shot her following a wild chase.
Authorities also found in the lockbox hospital discharge documents, keys, a lease agreement, various mail documents and a check for Carey in the amount of almost $1,800.
Police say Carey rammed barricades and police cruisers -- actions Washington police Chief Cathy Lanier said appeared deliberate -- and sped down Pennsylvania Avenue before crashing.
The boyfriend said she claimed President Barack Obama had placed Stamford, Connecticut, where she lived, under lockdown and that her house was under electronic surveillance, said a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation.
"We are interested in finding out what happened.
Police Chief Lanier has said that officers of the U.S. Capitol Police and Secret Service acted within commonly accepted use-of-force policies and practices in reaction to an intentional series of violent acts.
