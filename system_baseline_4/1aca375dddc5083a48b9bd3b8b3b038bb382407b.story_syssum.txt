What remains, however, rather difficult to predict is: what will an el-Sisi presidency bring to Egypt?
The last presidential elections resulted in a large number of candidates emerging, splitting the vote and leading to a run off between Ahmed Shafiq and Mohamed Morsy.
The question remains, however: how will el-Sisi govern?
Nor has el-Sisi himself been openly campaigning in rallies and so forth, with his team citing security concerns.
What seems to be clear, however, is that el-Sisi's most oft-repeated themes can be summed up in two: the Egyptian version of the "War on Terror," and an emphasis on the likelihood that Egyptians will not "rest" as the economic difficulties are addressed.
It is, however, unlikely such sentences will be carried out, regardless of an el-Sisi presidency, even though he announced in an interview that in his presidency there would be "no" Brotherhood.
Egypt's new authorities can count on the support of several Gulf countries, and the Egyptian military, as an institution, is expected to play a significant role in pushing forward on several projects designed to improve the Egyptian economy.
Be that as it may, however, el-Sisi will become president at a time when the Egyptian public is more tired than ever.
