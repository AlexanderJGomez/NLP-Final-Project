When the second tower collapsed, there was no place for me to hide.
Within minutes, a triage tag was forced around my neck and I was taken by ambulance to the hospital.
They weren't.
We quit jobs that weren't fulfilling; couples got married or divorced; and a lot of us got pregnant, choosing to double down on love instead of loss.
The National September 11 Memorial and Museum now has the rights to the book to support its programming and exhibitions in perpetuity.
The president called the museum a "sacred place of healing and of hope."
We were covered in the same ash and were choking on the same smoke.
And it's why I'm honored to have recorded my oral history for the museum and so deeply humbled that the triage tag that identified me as a survivor so many years ago will be on display.
Museum officials tell me it's one of several survivor artifacts and is displayed alongside a written portion of my story.
My hope is that by supporting the Memorial and Museum, I am, in some small way, honoring those who died and recognizing fully that I am still one of the lucky ones.
