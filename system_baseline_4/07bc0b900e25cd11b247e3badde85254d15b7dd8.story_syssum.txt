(CNN) -- Wildlife officials in Colorado say they have killed a bear believed to have been involved in an attack on a teenage boy Friday morning.
Officials had said earlier they would have to kill the bear, pointing to the bold and aggressive behavior it exhibited when it wandered into the site with so many campers.
Wildlife officials who responded to the scene determined that the black bear had been poking around the campsite before it attacked the teenage boy.
Investigators said they found a ransacked cooler and evidence that food had been eaten before the bear entered the tent.
If he didn't run for help ... luckily the bear chased him.
Earlier this month, a man was killed in a grizzly bear attack in Wyoming's Yellowstone Park.
