Mohamed Nasheed was the first democratically elected president of the Indian Ocean nation in three decades.
"This is a situation where the first democratically elected president in the Maldives is taken down by a former dictator and his supporters," the spokesman said.
Vice President Mohammed Waheed Hassan was sworn in as president shortly after Nasheed resigned.
Chakrabarti said he felt the coup was "the end of democracy in the Maldives.
The police officers appeared to have sided with the Progressive Party, which is loyal to former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who ruled Maldives for 30 years before Nasheed defeated him.
The coup signals a rise in extremism, Chakrabarti said.
In 2008, Nasheed became the country's first democratically elected president in 30 years.
Tuesday's events unfolded after about 200 policemen gathered in Republic Square in the capital, Male, according to Ahmed Rasheed, an executive producer at the state TV station.
Nasheed was arrested as a journalist several times and held as a political prisoner.
Maldives is also grappling with a very likely possibility that it will go under water if the current pace of climate change keeps raising sea levels.
