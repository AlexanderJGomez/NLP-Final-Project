Tyson's acceptance speech for best actress in a play was an emotional highlight of the American Theatre Wing's 67th annual Tony Awards broadcast live from New York's Radio City Music Hall.
Harris' opening number included scores of performers from current Broadway shows -- and a cameo by boxer Mike Tyson, who stars in his one-man show "Undisputed," singing and dancing in a white tux.
Harris ended the show with another trademark -- a closing "Tony hits lists" rap written as the show progressed.
One more great role, I said.
"Please wrap it up, it says," she said.
Some news reports put her age at 88.
"I want to thank Broadway."
If it had been a category, Porter also would have won for most excited acceptance speech, in which he said seeing "Dreamgirls" as a child was a big inspiration for his career.
While "Motown The Musical" lost out in all four categories for which it was nominated, the show likely gained fans with the musical medley performed by its cast during the Tony Awards.
