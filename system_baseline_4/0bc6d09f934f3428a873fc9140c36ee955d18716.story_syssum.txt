Israel's Cabinet on Friday approved the activation of up to 75,000 reservists, prime minister's spokesman Mark Regev said.
Also, the Israel Defense Forces reported earlier in the day that it is "mobilizing forces" in preparation for a "possible ground invasion of the Gaza Strip."
Meanwhile, the Israel Defense Forces, which has accused Hamas of turning Gaza into "a frontal base for Iran," said 97 rockets launched from Gaza had hit Israel since midweek, while another 99 were intercepted by a missile defense system.
Alarms went off, too, in Tel Aviv, prompting people to scurry off beaches and into safe locales, witnesses said.
Rejecting the idea of a temporary cease-fire Israel had requested because of the Egyptian prime minister's Gaza visit,  the militant group al-Qassam -- the military arm of Hamas -- reported on its Twitter feed that it had fired a Grad missile  Friday on the southern Israeli city of Beer Sheva.
In Ashkelon, about 17 kilometers (10 miles) north of Gaza, local officials said rocket strikes had increased dramatically in recent days.
Israeli authorities said the military campaign has hit more than 600 targets for what it calls terror activity and stifled rocket launches out of Gaza, a claim denied by al-Qassam.
At least 101 children and 96 women have been injured in Israeli strikes, a figure that does not include carnage from new attacks late Friday night, said Dr. Mufeed Mkhallalati, the Palestinian health minister.
Why?"
"This is an aggression against all Palestinian people," he said.
Egyptian Prime Minister Hesham Kandil got a firsthand look Friday at destruction while on a tour with Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh.
"Egypt will not leave Gaza alone, and what is happening there is a blatant aggression against humanity," said Egyptian President Mohammed Morsy.
His Cabinet chief noted, however, that Egypt's peace treaty with Israel is safe.
