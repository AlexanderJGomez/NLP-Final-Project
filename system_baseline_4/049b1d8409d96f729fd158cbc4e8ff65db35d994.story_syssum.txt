(CNN) -- Friends and family of Holly Bobo, last seen in 2011, waited three years for news.
"As this investigation continues, we are still asking for the public's help and support to help us continue to seek out justice regarding the disappearance of Holly Bobo," Mark Gwyn, director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, told reporters.
The Bobo case rocked the largely rural swath of central Tennessee, from those who knew the young woman to others who rallied behind the effort to find her.
Adams, who is being held at the Chester County jail, is set to appear in court on Tuesday.
"Obviously, they're devastated," Gwyn said of the Bobo family.
