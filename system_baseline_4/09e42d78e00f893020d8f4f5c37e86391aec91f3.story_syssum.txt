(CNN) -- A self-professed Apple fanatic, Jonathan Zufi was looking for a book of photography profiling the company's products through the years.
"
The book, currently available only through its website, sells for $75, or $300 for a special edition which, along with other extras, comes with a custom-fit book case designed in a retro style inspired by Apple products of the 1970s and '80s.
"I didn't want to take photos that you could find in marketing material," he said.
Zufi, who began sharing his images on the website Shrine of Apple, said he hasn't had any official communications with Apple about the book.
No less of an authority than Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak wrote a foreword to the book.
"Within these pages, Jonathan presents a thoughtful and artistic gift to Apple fans and employees alike; photographs of Apple products -- from hardware to packaging -- the likes of which I've never seen compiled before," he writes.
