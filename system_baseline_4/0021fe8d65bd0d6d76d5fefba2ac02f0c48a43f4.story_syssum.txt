Appearing Saturday morning on CNN's "New Day," Randy Zelin defended his client, Dr. Anthony Moschetto, who faces criminal solicitation, conspiracy, burglary, arson, criminal prescription sale and weapons charges in connection to what prosecutors called a plot to take out a rival doctor on Long Island.
Zelin said that his next move is to get Dr. Moshetto back to work.
And amazingly, his patients were flooding the office with calls, making sure that he was OK," Zelin said.
Many of the weapons were found in a hidden room behind a switch-activated bookshelf, according to prosecutors.
During the course of the undercover operation, however, Moschetto also sold the officers two semiautomatic assault weapons as well as ammunition, prosecutors said.
Kalamaras and Chmela are believed to have taken part in the arson, according to prosecutors.
"He was willing to pay $5,000 to have him beaten and put in a hospital for a few months, and then he said he would pay $20,000 to have him killed," said Assistant District Attorney Anne Donnelly, according to CNN affiliate WCBS.
