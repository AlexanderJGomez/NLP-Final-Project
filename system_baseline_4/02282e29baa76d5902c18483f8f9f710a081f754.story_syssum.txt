(CNN) -- A flat tire saw St√©phane Peterhansel's lead in the Dakar Rally cut to seven and a half minutes by American Bobby Gordon who finished second behind stage eight winner Nani Roma.
Peterhansel is a Dakar legend with three car titles and six on motorbikes, all coming before the grueling endurance event moved to South America in 2009 but he didn't enjoy his best stage on Monday.
It was a bad special, but that is the way it is.
"Gordon started three minutes before us, and 180 kilometres from here we had got to 30 seconds behind him.
Despres spent ten minutes trying to extricate himself from a patch of mud and cut a frustrated figure at the end of the stage.
"So I fail to see why I and the others should be the only ones to pay the price.
