Greg Bernal of Florissant, Missouri, and girlfriend Janet Momphard of St. Charles, Missouri, on Tuesday hauled what is believed to be a world record catfish into their boat while fishing on the Missouri River.
...
His head broke the water and man, that was it, I knew I had a record breaker," Bernal said.
Before the catfish was put on the scale, Momphard said it had to at least weigh more than 120 pounds, because it weighed more than the generator Bernal kept in the back of his truck.
"Back in 1995, I caught the Illinois state record catfish -- a blue that weighed 79.12 pounds," said Bernal.
Bernal is keeping the catfish, for the time being, in a friend's deep freezer.
I was just lucky, but I'm not going to argue with it, that's a world record," Bernal said.
