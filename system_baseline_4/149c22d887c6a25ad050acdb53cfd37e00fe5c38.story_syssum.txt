A warrant issued for Lindsay Lohan apparently stems from her 2007 drunken driving convictions, police said.
It apparently stems from Lohan's 2007 convictions for drunken driving, police said Friday.
Lohan "has the right to appear" at the hearing, said Alan Parachini, Los Angeles Superior Court spokesman.
"Since her case was resolved, Ms. Lohan has been in compliance with all the terms and conditions of her probation and all orders of the court," Holley said in a statement.
Mike Foxen said on Friday authorities were hoping Lohan would turn herself in.
A judge sentenced Lohan to three years probation after she entered guilty and no contest pleas to the charges.
Her last album was released in 2005.
