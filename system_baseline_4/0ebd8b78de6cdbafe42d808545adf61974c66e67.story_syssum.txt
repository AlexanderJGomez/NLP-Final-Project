Monday saw Portuguese and Real Madrid superstar Cristano Ronaldo crowned as winner of the FIFA Ballon d'Or for a second year in a row.
"I would like to continue the work that I have done so far.
I want to become one of the greatest players of all time."
On the other: Ronaldo.
The two couldn't be much more different, in style and, if you are to believe the majority of the media, likability.
That he has taken at least 10 shots at goal in nine matches doesn't exactly banish the perception.
But the stats don't lie, and with the phenomenal return of 61 goals from 60 appearances (42 in 30 La Liga games alone) during 2014, it's hard not to give credit to this year's winner.
He's also developed in leaps and bounds since his 2008 World Player of the Year trophy, refined his unquestionable talent since he first grinned on that FIFA stage.
He still takes a lot of shots, sure, but when "Ronaldo doesn't score," on the rare occasions that he walks away from a match without netting a goal is the headline, maybe he's right to do so.
But while he had a largely anonymous World Cup, it would be difficult to deny that, year round, it has been Cristiano's year.
And, like the man or not, no one should begrudge him his time at the pinnacle.
