"Gigi Jordan showed no mercy to her son, and should receive none at the time of her sentencing," Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said in a statement.
Prosecutors said Jordan, who testified that she killed the boy to prevent him from being sexually abused, forced many of the drugs down his throat with a syringe.
Defense lawyer Allan Brenner said the verdict was a victory.
To the extent that the jury has said this was not a mother viciously, violently, coldly doing away with her child, that's a triumph."
When police arrived at the hotel, they found Jordan sitting next to the bed where her son lay unresponsive, surrounded by pills and pill bottles.
The defense said one ex-husband had allegedly threatened to kill her, a crime that would have left Jude with her other former husband -- his biological father -- who she believed had sexually abused the boy.
The prosecution said there was no evidence Jude was ever sexually abused.
Jordan said the boy was physically and sexually abused not only by his biological father but also by others, including the woman who took Jude to school.
While on the stand, Jordan at first appeared calm as she described for a jury the last time she saw her son alive.
We were saying goodbye to each other," Jordan told the jury and then began to cry.
"A lot more of the Ambien," she said.
Some witnesses described how Jordan held the device in one hand while supporting and possibly guiding her son's arm with the other as Jude looked away.
Prosecutors said the killing was premeditated and Jordan expected to survive.
Jordan told the jury she planned on giving the money to charity before taking her life.
