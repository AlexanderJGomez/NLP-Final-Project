(CNN) -- The Davis Cup is the just about the only major honor in tennis to elude Roger Federer and the Swiss maestro took another big step to righting that omission Sunday as he led his country into November's final against France.
Fognini had four break point chances in the third set but could not take advantage and Federer moved clear in the closing tiebreak.
We couldn't be happier," he said.
Switzerland will have to travel to France for the final on November 21-23, with the venue still to be announced.
France is seeking a first Davis Cup triumph since 2001.
