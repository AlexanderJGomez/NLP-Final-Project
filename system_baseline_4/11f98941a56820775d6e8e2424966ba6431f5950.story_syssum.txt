Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN) -- Just taking a sip of water or walking to the bathroom is excruciatingly painful for 15-year-old Michael Brewer, who was burned over 65 percent of his body after being set on fire, allegedly by a group of teenagers.
"I would really like to stay away from that because that brings negative energy to me and I don't need that right now," she said.
The teen faces a lifelong recovery from his injuries, Schulman told CNN's Harris.
Valerie Brewer said her son's treatment is excruciating at times.
Heavy metal musician Ozzy Osbourne sent Brewer a CD, and he plays it on a boom box during the showers, she said.
Hospital officials have said Brewer can communicate only in one- or two-word answers.
Difficult for us to listen to," she said of the interview.
Detectives say eyewitnesses told them that Mendez used a lighter to set fire to Brewer after Jarvis allegedly poured alcohol over him.
Authorities have said Mendez admitted setting Brewer on fire.
He has not been interviewed by police or prosecutors, Schneider said.
He described his client was a good friend of Brewer, and said the boy is troubled by Brewer's injuries as well as by his brother facing criminal charges that could land him in an adult prison if convicted.
We don't need any negative energy coming into the recovery so we just stay away from it, period.
Her son's recovery has been filled with ups and downs, she said.
