Mexico is known for its oil production, but it could be its less obvious flats of arid and marginal land that will be the future of Mexico's energy resources.
Jatropha-based biofuels are being increasingly used in Mexico, and agave -- the plant from which tequila is made -- is being studied as a new source for ethanol.
"We returned to Mexico with a mission," Lopez told CNN.
When the standards for biofuel use in commercial flights was approved July 1, Mexico was ready to make the domestic Interjet and international AeroMexico flights a possibility.
By 2015, the goal is to have 1% of all jet fuel in Mexico be biofuel, and by 2020, 15%, he said.
"Mexico has made the very important first step to be in a very priviledged place," Lopez said.
Agave can grow in arid land, and produces less than half of the carbon dioxide emissions produced by corn-based ethanol, Oliver Inderwildi, one of the study's authors, told CNN.
For their study, the researchers did a life-cycle analysis for the production of ethanol based on a hypothetical plant in Jalisco, Mexico, where 90% of tequila is produced.
And unlike tequila, which requires the harvesting of the agave stem only, ethanol production would also require harvesting the leaves of the plant.
When that tipping point comes, Mexico will be ready, the experts said.
Without land reform, issues with land availability will continue, and Mexico will fall a decade or more behind other countries in the biofuels sector, Row said.
"Now is the time for Mexico to get its act together for biofuels," he said.
