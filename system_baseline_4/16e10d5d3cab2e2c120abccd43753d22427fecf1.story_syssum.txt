(CNN)An American missionary once held hostage by Colombian rebels has been accused by local authorities of collaborating with his former captors.
But his activities appear to have run afoul of Colombian authorities, who announced Thursday that they had arrested Stendal, accusing him of supporting the FARC.
"He also transported those wounded in combat and gave medical help to members of the guerrilla group," said the prosecutor's office in the Colombian department of Cundinamarca.
The judge said the prosecutor's case against Stendal was lacking in proof and underdeveloped, ruling there was no reason to keep him in jail.
"It leaves much to be desired of the intelligence department of the police of Cundinamarca to confuse evangelizing with rebellion," said the statement from the FARC, which is known in English as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.
After his release, he took part in evangelical campaigns across Colombia and set up radio stations to broadcast gospel preaching and music into the conflict zones.
