On Sunday, the Yankees will play their last game before the stadium is torn down.
Jim Bouton was photographed as a rookie in 1962 at Yankee Stadium, before the renovation of the ballpark.
The Yankee clubhouse in 1962 was like a large subterranean living room.
Everything was painted a muted gray green to match the carpet, including the exposed ductwork in the ceiling above.
I couldn't help smiling when I saw Whitey Ford's nameplate just one locker away.
He pointed to a locker across the room where he used to bring "a bi-carb and coffee" each day to the Babe.

After sitting in the dugout a few minutes, I trotted out to the mound.
My big chance came on May 7, 1962, in the second game of a double-header against the Washington Senators, in front of a real crowd that included my Mom and Dad, my brothers and a whole bunch of neighbors from New Jersey.
My next pitch was a little bit high and manager Ralph Houk stepped out of the dugout - either to calm me down or remove me from the premises.
After the game Houk said to me, "any more shutouts like that and we're going to need a new bullpen."
This is my favorite memory of Yankee Stadium.
That's the year I kept a diary that became Ball Four -- a book that also mentioned Mantle hitting a home run with a hangover -- which got me banned from Old Timers Day at Yankee Stadium for 28 years.
Inside, the grayish green carpet was now bright blue and featured a giant Yankee logo.
Raze the clubhouse where Pete Sheehy made coffee for Ruth.
Bulldoze the field where Mantle roamed and level the mound where Larsen pitched the only perfect World Series game.
