Alain Tremblay of the New Brunswick Royal Canadian Mounted Police said Wednesday.
Sometime before dawn, the snake came crashing through the ceiling of the apartment where they were spending the night.
The snake was found in the same room as the boys, Tremblay said.
He would provide no further details.
The necropsy showed the snake was in good overall health, Tremblay said.
The Humane Society documents 17 people who have died in incidents in the United States related to the snakes since 1978, 12 of them since 1990.
