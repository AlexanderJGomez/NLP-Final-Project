(CNN) -- Lampooning politicians in Kenya's The Nation newspaper has been cartoonist Godfrey Mwampembwa's job since 1992, but it was his vocation long before that.
Mwampembwa was the brains behind "The XYZ Show," Kenya's first satirical puppet TV show that aired earlier this year.
There was also the issue of keeping editorial control over the project.
We want it to be hard-hitting,'" Mwampembwa told Variety magazine.
But that "The XYZ Show" could be broadcast shows a freedom of media in Kenya that Mwampembwa appreciates.
"I think it's everybody's duty," he told the BBC.
