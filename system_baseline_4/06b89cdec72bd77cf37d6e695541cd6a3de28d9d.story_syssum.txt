Any sort of "Arrested Development" movie has yet to receive a green light, so Hurwitz is very reluctant to guess when it might see release.
I want to get a time and tell everybody when it's happening and not play with people.
"I was really aware that we were trying to do something that not only had nobody done before, but we didn't really tell anybody what we were going to do," says Hurwitz.

People responding quickly to the first episodes was akin to reading a couple chapters of a book and saying, 'I don't like this.'"
"I would oftentimes go there and see reactions to the previous night's show.
It doesn't matter what people like now.
