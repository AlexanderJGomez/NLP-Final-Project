(CNN) -- I was born in Tallahassee, Florida, in 1954, the year of the landmark school desegregation case, Brown v. Board of Education.
Forty-four years later, in 2002, my husband and I left Massachusetts and returned to the South -- initiating our family's reverse migration.
But 60 years after racial segregation was outlawed in schools, public education is again segregating along racial lines.
As school districts move back to "neighborhood school" policies, white students will likely have less school contact with people of color than their parents had.
At most highly segregated white schools, middle-class students are in the majority.
Conversely, academic performance is likely to improve if the student attends a middle-class school, even if his or her own family is poor.
In particular, white children will need to be in schools that are intentional about helping them understand social justice issues like prejudice, discrimination and racism, empowering them to think critically about the stereotypes to which they are exposed in the culture.
Children of color in under-resourced, racially isolated schools also need these same tools.
When we can answer that question, the promise of Brown v. Board of Education will be fulfilled.
