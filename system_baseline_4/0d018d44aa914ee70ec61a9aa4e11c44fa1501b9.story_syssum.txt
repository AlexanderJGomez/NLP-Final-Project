"Once the levee completely fails ... it is unknown how far south the flood waters of the Wisconsin River will travel," the Weather Service said Sunday night.
The levee is located on the south side of the Wisconsin River, just south of Portage.
Authorities in Portage worked to evacuate residents as the levee approached imminent failure after heavy rainfall soaked the Midwest last week.
The river at Portage is now expected to stay above flood stage -- 17 feet -- through Wednesday, Beghin said.
The Wisconsin River crested around 12 a.m. Monday at 20.56 feet -- roughly 3.5 feet above flood level, according to Beghin and the National Weather Service, putting major pressure on the Caledonia-Lewiston levee system.
But the levee system, built in the 1890s, was constructed from locally available materials -- mostly sand -- "without any engineering design or adherence to any standards," the Natural Resources department said in a statement last week.
Floodgates along the Menominee River in Niagara, Wisconsin, were opened in recent days to ease pressure on dams.
CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said Sunday that there's no immediate end in sight to the flooding.
