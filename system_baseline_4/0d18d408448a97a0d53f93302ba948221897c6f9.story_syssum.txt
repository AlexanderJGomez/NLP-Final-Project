ETA, blamed for more than 800 deaths and listed as a terrorist group by Spain the European Union and the United States, began campaigning for Basque independence in 1959.
Another unilateral cease-fire was declared in March 2005, with ETA raising hopes for a lasting peace by declaring it "permanent."
It was called off by ETA in June 2006 following numerous more ETA attacks.
Spain officially recognizes three Basque provinces, Alava, Guipuzcoa and Vizcaya.
The Basque people are the oldest indigenous ethnic group in Europe and have lived uninterrupted in the same region since the beginning of recorded history.
ETA and its demands for an independent Basque state arose in 1959 in the midst of this suppression.
ETA has focused its activities on the Spanish side of the border.
The Good Friday peace accord influenced ETA to call its cease-fire in 1998.
