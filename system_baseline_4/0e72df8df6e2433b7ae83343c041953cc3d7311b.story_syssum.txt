(CNN)  -- E. Lynn Harris, the author who introduced millions of readers to the "invisible life" of black gay men, was a literary pioneer whose generosity was as huge as his courage, friends said Friday.
Keith Boykin, an author and friend, said Harris encouraged the black community to talk openly about homosexuality.
Though Harris wrote primarily about black gay men, some of his biggest fans were black women.
Tina McElroy Ansa, author of "Taking After Mudear," met Harris at the beginning of his literary career when he was selling his first book "Invisible Life."
She came across a scene where Harris depicted two black men playing in the snow with one another.
"It was playful, loving, and it wasn't hidden."
''When I wrote "Invisible Life," it had to be the first book out of me -- it helped me to deal with my own sexuality,'' Harris said.
Harris was as generous with his fans as he was with his friends, some said.
She said Harris had been a cheerleader in college "and a spirit of joy followed him through his life."
He was born in Flint, Michigan, and grew up in Little Rock, Arkansas.
"He always said 'I'm not a James Baldwin,'" Boykin said, referring to the openly gay black author from the 1960s.
Boykin said Harris received most of his criticism not from outraged straight critics, but people within the black community.
Due said there has traditionally been a lot of pain associated with homosexuality in the black community.
Harris took a little of that pain away with his life and his books.
