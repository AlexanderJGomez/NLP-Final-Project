(CNN) -- Congolese rebels took control of the eastern city of Goma and part of the border with Rwanda on Tuesday after days of heavy clashes, a Congolese reporter there said.
The United Nations, the African Union and countries in the region are demanding that M23 immediately stop its attacks, Buey said.
An M23 rebel spokesman, calling his group the Revolutionary Army of Congo, went on the radio Tuesday afternoon to address the people of Goma.
Any remaining pockets of the army should join the rebels or the M23 will fight against them, Kazarama said.
Soldiers from the M23 group were part of the national army as part of peace negotiations brokered in 2009.
British Foreign Secretary William Hague condemned M23's advance into Goma and said anyone responsible for rights abuses would be held to account.
The International Crisis Group, an independent anti-conflict non-profit group, warned that the fall of Goma could lead to serious human rights abuses against civilians.
Rwanda will not engage in any talks with M23, Mushikiwabo said.
Mushikiwabo said Rwanda would close the border crossing if asked to by the Congolese government, but that such a move could have humanitarian consequences.
