I worried about her comfort, about how my dad would cope and how the grandkids would feel.
And thanks to the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) -- enacted 20 years ago this week -- I had a legal right to job-protected leave.
The FMLA, which grants job protection for up to three months of leave, applies only to enterprises with 50 or more employees.
Even among eligible workers, many cannot afford to take family or medical leave.
The labor force participation rate for mothers of young children stood at 70.6% in 2011, compared with 47% in 1975.
Studies from other countries have found that paid family and medical leave programs boost productivity.
One study of 19 developed countries found that paid parental leave had a significantly greater positive effect on productivity than unpaid leave.
Paid family leave has been shown to dramatically increase breastfeeding, such as in California, where the introduction of paid family leave doubled the median duration of breastfeeding for new mothers who used it.
The bottom line is that paid family and medical leave pays off.
Both New Jersey and California finance their programs exclusively through small payroll deductions for workers (with no employer contribution), and offer six weeks of partially paid leave.
Enhancing U.S. law to give all workers this kind of security would benefit not just workers, but businesses and the economy as a whole.
