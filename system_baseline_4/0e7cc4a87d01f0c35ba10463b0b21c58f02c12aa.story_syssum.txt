Moscow (CNN) -- Keen, bright-eyed and earnest, the little boy answers the Russian investigator's questions enthusiastically, as if describing a cartoon, not sexual abuse.
In Russia, possessing child pornography is not a crime and laws that govern child exploitation are weak.
The law can't come soon enough for victims.
According to Russia's Investigative Committee, more than 800 cases of sexual abuse were reported in the first three months of this year, an increase of 13%.
"A person who wants to find this content on the Internet, this person can do it pretty easily," said Mark Tverdynin, director of Saferunet.ru, an initiative that is trying to scrub the Russian Internet clean of child pornography.
CNN's Maxim Tkachenko has contributed to this report.
