NATO-led forces in Afghanistan and the U.S. military have repeatedly denied targeting civilians.
"I have a very, very good family that I love back home in America, and I miss them every day that I'm gone," he says.
I'm scared I won't be able to go home.
In a statement released Sunday through the Idaho National Guard, Bergdahl's family said, "We hope and pray for our son's safe return to his comrades and then to our family, and we appreciate all the support and expressions of sympathy shown to us by our family members, our friends and others across the nation.
Last week, the U.S. military distributed pamphlets in eastern Afghanistan in an effort to locate him.
The U.S. military said it believed Bergdahl may have been moved to various locations.
He acknowledges it, saying the move was accomplished "very easily."
They were made available to CNN by U.S.
Days after Bergdahl went missing, a senior U.S. military official said Bergdahl and the Afghan soldiers were captured by low-level militants and then quickly "sold" to the clan and network led by warlord Siraj Haqqani -- believed to be deeply involved in the action.
Sangeen said the soldier was taken to a safe place.
A source with the U.S. military denied the claim that Bergdahl was drunk.
