Jeb Bush's surprise announcement that he'll "actively explore" a presidential bid Tuesday morning did little to dissuade his potential Republican opponents from the race.
"I think the more the merrier — the public will determine" whether Bush could win.
And Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's spokesman, Alex Conant, said while Rubio has "a lot of respect" for Bush and thinks he'd make "a formidable candidate," Bush's decision has no bearing on his own.
Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, who recently left the door open to his own 2016 bid, said the Bush announcement was "kind of expected."
Bush would enter the race with his "contributors, his family name, a long record as very successful governor," McCain said.
Rob Portman, considered a possible vice presidential pick, told reporters he has talked to Bush recently about a potential campaign.
"Immigration will be a critical issue in this next election because we have a President who has been unwilling to work with Congress on common sense immigration reform," Cruz said, when asked how Bush's position on immigration would play out in the primaries.
New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, also seen as a possible vice presidential pick, noted Bush has yet to stop by her state — which hosts the first primary in the nation — to meet with grassroots activists.
"It will make a difference how hard the candidates work in terms of meeting the activists and answering the hard questions," Ayotte said.
