Wyshak was responding to a defense claim that one of the key witnesses in the case may have been involved in further criminal activity since his release from federal prison in 2007, and that a member of the Massachusetts State Police claimed the investigation into that defense witness' activities was compromised.
In court, Bulger attorney Henry Brennan said the state trooper who complained felt "undermined by one of his superiors, Steve Johnson."
Wyshak said the information was turned over to the defense in May.
Wyshak said the the internal investigation found complaints against Johnson were "unsubstantiated" and that the "real villain is the state trooper" who he says "went off the deep-end" and denied the allegations when confronted.
The Friday back-and-forth came as the two sides attempt to seat a 18-member jury, including six alternates, in the high-profile case.
Federal prosecutors say Bulger led the Irish mob from the late 1970s through the mid-1990s.
