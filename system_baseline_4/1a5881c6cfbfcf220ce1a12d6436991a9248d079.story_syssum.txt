There is little suspense as to the outcome: Every reliable source indicates that South Sudan will vote for separation, dividing Africa's largest country and taking with it some 80 percent of known Sudanese oil reserves.
While there are obviously differences, these situations in the Mideast and Sudan have more in common than the painful process of division.
But exactly how the North and South will simultaneously separate while remaining interconnected must be.
Millions of Southerners displaced by the war will continue to live in Khartoum, and Northerners will live in the South.
Earlier this year, then-Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair told Congress that, over the next five years, Southern Sudan is the place where "a new mass killing or genocide is most likely to occur."
Even as America asks how it can help Southern Sudan prepare for the likely burdens of statehood, it must also consider the Sudan that remains.
I have written legislation to put Congress on record to reinforce the American commitment to see the peace agreement through, to lay the groundwork for what will come and to reinvigorate the Darfur peace process.
Although the Sudanese themselves will own their future, America must now help North and South Sudan to find a peaceful path forward.
