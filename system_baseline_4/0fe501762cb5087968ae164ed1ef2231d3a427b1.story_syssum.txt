If you're now thinking to yourself, "Oh, no!
it's time to clean out your phone.

Now your BFF will never know (unless, of course, you're slow on the draw -- or you pass out before reversing the damage).

Of course, Weird Wally will still get the requisite email alert that initially requested his friendship, so the damage is not fully mitigated.
