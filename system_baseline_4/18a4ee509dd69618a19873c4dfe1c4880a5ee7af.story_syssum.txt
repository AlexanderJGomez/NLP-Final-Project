Who will take the best actor SAG trophy -- "Lincoln" star Daniel Day-Lewis or Hugh Jackman for "Les Miserables"?
A win by "Lincoln" or "Les Miserables" in SAG's top category -- officially known as "Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture" -- would create important buzz for the film in the Academy Awards best-pic battle.
"Lincoln" and "Les Miserables" also hold center stage in the race for best lead actor after the Globes.
Chastain and Lawrence won the best drama and comedy actress Globes, respectively.
Marion Cotillard -- "Rust and Bone" -- and Helen Mirren -- "Hitchcock" -- round out the SAG competition but were not nominated for an Oscar.
Anne Hathaway, honored with the Globe for best supporting actress for her performance in "Les Miserables," faces tough competition for the SAG and Oscar awards from Sally Field, who portrayed first lady Mary Todd Lincoln in "Lincoln."
