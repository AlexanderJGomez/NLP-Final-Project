(CNN) -- In BBC America's new prime time drama, "Copper," Irish-immigrant detective Kevin Corcoran roams from the filthy slums of Five Points to the glimmering sidewalks of Fifth Avenue -- all with a set of brass knuckles snugly resting on his fingers.
Historically accurate details, woven into the backbone of "Copper," transform it from period drama to believable reality.
For Anastasia Griffith, the world of "Copper" came to life as she was laced tightly into her corset, learning to breathe as her character, socialite Elizabeth Haverford, would breathe.
"It's about honoring the details," Griffith said.
"There is something very underdog-ish about all of the characters played by Kyle Schmid, Anastasia, Ato and I," Weston-Jones said.
The 10-part series, created by Tom Fontana (best known for "Homicide: Life on the Street" and other dramas) and produced by Barry Levinson (the acclaimed director of films like "Diner"), unfurls with Corcoran investigating a girl's death while trying to find his missing wife and solve his daughter's murder.
"To find humor in the darkness is a very Barry [Levinson] thing," Griffith said.
"Kind of the way Anastasia is bound by her clothes, station and by being a woman, I am bound by being a black man in 1864, where racism is rampant and pretty much the norm of society," Essandoh said.
Amidst the turbulence, "Copper" hopes to illustrate where America, and New York, came from by showing such a pivotal point in the city's history.
But you may have to wait until the DVD releases to see an extra when Griffith and Schmid drop it like it's hot to Sir Mix-A-Lot's "Baby Got Back" in period costume during a ballroom scene.
