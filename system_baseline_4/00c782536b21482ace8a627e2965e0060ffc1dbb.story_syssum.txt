Well, it seems the U.S. Navy finally got the memo: DON'T USE ALL CAPS!
"Lowercase messages are here to stay; they provide a more readable format," a Navy news release said, citing James McCarty, the naval messaging program manager at U.S. Fleet Cyber Command.
In it, the Navy said it is ditching its in-house Defense Message System in favor of e-mail.
And it gets them caught up with current Internet protocol.
Once it is, naval officers will no longer feel like they're being barked at.
