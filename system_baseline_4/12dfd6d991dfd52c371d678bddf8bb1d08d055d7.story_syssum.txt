Two goals from Steven Gerrard, both from the penalty spot and a Luis Suarez strike, condemned United to defeat and gave yet more credence that Liverpool is a serious title contender.
Liverpool, which sits four points behind leader Chelsea with a game in hand, was a class apart on an afternoon where United's deficiencies were laid bare for all to see.
The Manchester United defense will not have had a harder game than against our strikers today.
Last season, United finished 28 points clear of Liverpool on its way to winning the Premier League title.
Worse for United is the success of its greatest rival - Liverpool.
Liverpool dominated the opening 45 minutes and went ahead when Rafael, already on a yellow card, handled inside the penalty area.
Just 24 second had elapsed when Phil Jones clumsily bundled over Joe Allen in the United penalty area and Gerrard swept home the spot kick.
Suarez should have added a third after outpacing the United defense but David de Gea produced a sublime save to deny the Liverpool striker.
"We're going to win the league," sang the Liverpool supporters.
"Make us dream" read the banner -- those dreams could yet come true.
The victory moves Arsenal to within four points of leader Chelsea with a game in hand.
