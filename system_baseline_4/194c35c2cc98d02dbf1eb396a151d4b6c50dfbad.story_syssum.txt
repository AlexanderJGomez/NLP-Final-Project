(CNN) -- "Pulp Fiction."
No more.
"I can't do it," Weinstein said.
The co-founder -- with his brother Bob -- of Miramax Films and now the Weinstein Co. spoke days after announcing plans for a movie that will be critical of the National Rifle Association.
Weinstein recalled calls to action to address gun violence in the wake of such mass shootings, only to have that momentum seemingly fade after a few days.
That won't happen any longer, Weinstein said.
And as much as I want to ignore it, as much as I want to go on with my regular life, I can't shake it this time."
