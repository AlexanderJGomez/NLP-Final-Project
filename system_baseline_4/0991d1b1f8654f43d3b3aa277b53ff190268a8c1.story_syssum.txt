Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Members of Latin America's largest guerrilla group declared Thursday they will ask for an immediate cease fire when they meet with Colombian government negotiators for peace talks next month.
A possible peace deal will face many obstacles, including long-standing allegations that FARC guerrillas have enriched themselves with ransoms paid for kidnap victims and with drug trafficking.
Negotiations between the FARC and the Colombian government broke down over 10 years ago.
As part of a road map for a possible peace deal, the FARC has said the government will need to enact land reform for peasant farmers, help coca growers plant other crops and reintegrate thousands of FARC soldiers into Colombian society.
The issue could prove to be the first challenge to the talks, since the FARC named commander Simon Trinidad as a member of the team who will negotiate a possible peace deal.
"We have Simon Trinidad at the negotiating table," FARC negotiator Andres ParÃ­s said Thursday.
