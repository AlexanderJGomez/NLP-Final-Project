"This country sure as hell has gone down the drain," Williams sings in a tune posted Monday on his official website.
In the song, the 62-year-old son of the legendary country singer Hank Williams did not appear to accept any blame for his part in a recent controversy stemming from an appearance last Monday on "Fox and Friends," Fox News' morning show.
...
His song "All My Rowdy Friends" had been the "Monday Night Football" theme on both ABC and ESPN since 1991.
Williams sang that he'd keep his freedom, guns, money, religion and "my Christian name," among other things.
"Ask for my opinion, then twist it all around," Williams sang.
At the end of his song posted Monday, Williams urged people to "keep 'Fox and Friends' and ESPN out of your homes" in light of the flare-up.
