Johannesburg (CNN) -- Operators of a South African gold mine negotiated with about 15,000 striking workers Monday after they walked off the job the night before, a company official said.
The KDC workers join about 28,000 other miners who are already on strike at the Lonmin PLC platinum mine in Marikana, about two hours northwest of Johannesburg.
The violence in August erupted after negotiations between striking workers and Lonmin broke down and police decided to fence in the machete-armed miners with barbed wire, police said.
However, a national prosecutor has said that authorities would dismiss the provisional charges and release the miners, pending further investigation.
Clashes also erupted last week between protesters and security officers outside Gold One's Modder East gold mine in Springs, about 24 miles (39 kilometers) east of Johannesburg, police said.
The protesters had been fired for participating in an earlier illegal strike, the company said.
