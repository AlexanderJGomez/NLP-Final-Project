London (CNN) -- London's Heathrow Airport is "fully operational" and returning to normal after an emergency landing Friday forced the closing of both runways, the airport said -- but many travelers are likely to suffer delays anyway.
A British Airways plane bound for Oslo was forced to make the emergency landing "due to a technical fault," the airline said.
"Airline colleagues are now caring for customers in the airport terminal," said British Airways.
London Fire Brigade said one of its crews helped the airport fire service put out an aircraft fire.
"We believe the fire is now out," it said via Twitter.
"At first we were told ongoing incident and then emergency landing.
Emergency vehicles were quick to the aircraft I'm told."
