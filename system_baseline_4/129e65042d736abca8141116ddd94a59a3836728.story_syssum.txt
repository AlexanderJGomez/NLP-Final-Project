The first Iraq war combat veteran to serve in the U.S. Senate introduced legislation on Thursday aimed at reducing the number of military veterans who commit suicide.
"Far too often, we're leaving our veterans to fight their toughest battles alone," Walsh said.
The Suicide Prevention for America's Veterans Act is collaboration between Walsh and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.
The veterans organization is working on getting a similar bill in the House, said IAVA political director Kate O'Gorman.
Currently, when a service member separates from active duty -- whether they are transitioning to being a veteran or becoming a Reservist or a member of the National Guard -- they have five years to receive care from the Department of Veterans Affairs, O'Gorman said.
The legislation also seeks to improve the quality of mental health care providers by making their jobs more competitive with the private sector, O'Gorman said.
The bill will introduce a pilot initiative that would allow a student to have their loans repaid if they work for the VA, O'Gorman said.
The bill was introduced the same week that Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America held its annual Storm the Hill initiative.
Walsh is waiting for the Congressional Budget Office to provide a figure, she said.
But the senator stressed that it will cost far more in years to come if changes are not made soon to improve mental health care.
"There are difficult decisions ahead," he said.
President Barack Obama has said that the United States could withdraw all troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2014.
Walsh was sworn into the U.S. Senate in January after Montana Gov.
Walsh said lawmakers must also address suicides amongst military family members, too.
Warrior suicides and military family member suicides are "connected," Walsh said.
The relatives have made "enormous sacrifices," he said.
