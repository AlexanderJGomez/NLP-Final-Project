LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's memorial service will take place Tuesday morning in the Staples Center, the 20,000-seat coliseum in downtown Los Angeles where Jackson rehearsed his show the night before he died, according to a person who has been briefed by a representative of the family.
Katherine Jackson's 40 percent share would go to Michael Jackson's three children after her death, the source said.
A public viewing at the ranch on Friday also had been under consideration, law enforcement sources said.
On Wednesday night, a federal law enforcement official said Wednesday night that the Drug Enforcement Administration had joined Jackson's death investigation, once again fanning speculation that drugs may have been involved in the pop icon's passing.
Two law enforcement officials separately confirmed the DEA probe, saying agents would look at various doctors involved with Jackson, their practices and their possible sources of medicine supply.
"However, at this time, we have nothing further to comment about the death of Michael Jackson."
"Based on our agreement with Los Angeles investigators, we are waiting on real information to come from viable sources like the Los Angeles medical examiner's office about the death of Michael Jackson," the statement said.
"He said, 'I just want to get some sleep.
"
The will said Jackson "intentionally omitted" his former wife and the mother of his two oldest children, Debbie Rowe.
One is John Branca, who represented Jackson from 1980 until 2006 and was hired again before the singer's death.
The men said in their filing in Los Angeles Superior Court that control of the estate would allow them to tend to Jackson's numerous outstanding debts, legal cases and business obligations.
Another hearing has been set for Monday.
