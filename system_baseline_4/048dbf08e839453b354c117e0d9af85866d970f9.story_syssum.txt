(CNN) -- Beijing hosted one of the most memorable Summer Olympics in recent history -- now the Chinese capital is hoping to welcome the world's top Winter Games stars for the first time in a joint 2022 bid.
It is estimated the journey time will be just 40 minutes, but Li is wary of the cost to the local environment.
There is also the fact that Pyeongchang of South Korea will host the 2018 Winter Games -- making it unlikely that another Asian country would succeed in 2022.
Since Pyeongchang won the 2018 bid, Beijing as another Asian city will face a daunting task to beat the odds," Li said.
Japan is the only Asian country to have hosted the Winter Olympics, in Sapporo (1972) and Nagano (1998).
