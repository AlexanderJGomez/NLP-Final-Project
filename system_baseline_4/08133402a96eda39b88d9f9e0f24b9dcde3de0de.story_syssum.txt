On the one side of the federal government shutdown are the people whose job it is to run that government: the Congress and the White House.
Then ran for them.
We pay federal income tax with one solitary and bedrock expectation: We are handing our money over so that the federal government will run.
We had no choice.
We have paid for it to operate.
The people we have paid to operate it can blame each other all they want for what has happened.
So the refunds, for the portions of government operations that have been shuttered, are owed.
Well, many of the people who pay for the government to run are hurting for funds, too.
When it doesn't, the people who paid for it to do just that have a right to propose that they are owed -- for services not rendered -- their money back.
