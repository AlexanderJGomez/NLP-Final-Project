Regardless of the other candidates' performances in New Hampshire or even what happens in the South Carolina primary next week, Mitt Romney is extremely likely to be the Republican nominee.
From 1980 to the present, no candidate who significantly trailed in party endorsements has won the nomination.
A few candidates have been nominated in years when no candidate took an early endorsement lead.

On his morning show on MSNBC, former Republican congressman Joe Scarborough, who served with Gingrich in the 1990s, called him a "bad person" who "will destroy our party."
As chronicled by Nate Silver, Mitt Romney now has a big lead in Republican Party endorsements, giving him a huge advantage moving forward.
Consequently, Perry remains the only candidate who could somewhat plausibly challenge Romney in a drawn out fight for the nomination.
Tim Pawlenty and Perry.
Which brings us to the second candidate who could have won support from Republican elites: Perry.
Still, Perry remains the only candidate besides Romney with nontrivial support from Republican elites.
