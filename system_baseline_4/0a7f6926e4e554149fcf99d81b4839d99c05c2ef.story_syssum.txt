LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Michael Jackson's ex-wife and the mother of his two oldest children, Debbie Rowe, has agreed not to challenge the singer's mother for custody of the children, according to a joint statement from lawyers for Rowe and Katherine Jackson.
Rowe never publicly said if she would fight Jackson's 79-year-old mother for custody of her son and daughter -- ages 11 and 12 -- and a court hearing concerning custody was delayed several times this month while lawyers for the two talked.
Beckloff will also hear arguments Monday about Jackson's estate and who will control it.
"We were all united in our goals to do what is best for Michael's wonderful children, and both Mrs. Jackson and Debbie Rowe were on the exact same page," McMillan said.
McMillan, in a statement issued Wednesday, said Katherine Jackson was not disputing the will.
But, he said, she wanted the judge to order the executors to disclose information about what he said was "a suspicious circle of relationships" involving them.
Jackson's children have been living with their paternal grandmother at her Encino, California, home since their father's death on June 25.
The couple divorced in 1999 with Rowe giving Jackson full custody while she got an $8.5 million settlement, according to court documents.
Rowe gave up parental rights to Jackson in 2001, but she changed her mind more than two years later and sought temporary custody of the children.
