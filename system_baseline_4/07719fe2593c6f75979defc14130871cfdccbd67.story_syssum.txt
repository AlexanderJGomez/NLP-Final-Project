A persuasive argument can be made that, were it not for what Roosevelt did during a meeting in the White House toward the end of 1905, football as we know it today would not be a part of American life.
Early in the 20th century, football, as played on college gridirons, was something close to a street fight.
Remember, the NFL did not exist -- the college game was the top level of the sport.
Roosevelt, Miller told me, loved football, but had never played the game -- by the time he was president, Roosevelt cut a brawny, outdoorsmanlike, Hemingwayesque figure (well, Hemingway hadn't been heard of in those years, but you get the picture), yet as a boy he was small, sickly and wore eyeglasses.

According to Miller, Roosevelt told them: "Football is on trial.
Miller said that Roosevelt did not use the "big stick"-- he did not threaten and he did not pound the table.
"He was a great politician.
"It revolutionized the game," Miller said.
Football became more thrilling to watch; the college game boomed, the NFL was born.
There was no Internet when Roosevelt brought the football men to the White House; there was no television; there were no radios in American homes.
