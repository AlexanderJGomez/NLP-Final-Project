Tokyo (CNN) -- The meltdowns of three reactors at Japan's Fukushima nuclear power plant may have happened more than two years ago, but the disaster remains a giant, unresolved mess.
Data published in August shows 44 out of 216,809 children under age 18 in Fukushima prefecture were diagnosed with thyroid cancer or suspected of having the disease.
The most immediate problem for plant operator Tepco is the hundreds of tons of water poured over the damaged nuclear reactors every single day to keep the molten fuel cool.
If the fuel is not kept cool, it could cause another disaster.
Tepco is just days away from starting to remove 1,500 irradiated spent fuel rods from a pool in reactor number 4 to a safer location.
Critics fear the building is unstable and any mistake could cause a new nuclear disaster.
The radiation levels in reactors 1, 2 and 3 are so high that the area is inaccessible to humans.
Workers within the Fukushima nuclear power plant have a radiation exposure limit.
As time goes on, more experienced workers will reach their exposure limits, sparking concerns that available workers will have decreased skill levels.
