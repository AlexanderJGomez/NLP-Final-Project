Haneke also won the Palme d'Or at the festival in 2009 for "The White Ribbon."
Another contender for the top prize was "Moonrise Kingdom," a film by Wes Anderson that tells the tale of two young lovers who reunite and run away into the wilderness in 1965 after a year apart.
"My point of view about it was the memory of feeling that way is so strong for me," Anderson told CNN earlier this week.
A memory of an emotion that I was hoping to recreate in some way."
In addition, Kanye West also premiered a short film/art installation, "Cruel Summer," at the festival, which kicked off May 16.
Last year's Palme d'Or prize went to "The Tree of Life," a film from American director and writer Terrence Malick.
