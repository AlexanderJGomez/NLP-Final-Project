MOSCOW, Russia (CNN)  -- The Somali government has asked Russia to intervene against pirates who have seized a Ukrainian cargo ship, the Somali ambassador to Russia said Wednesday.

"For the safety of the crew members," Mwangura said, "let the ship owners talk with the pirates."
The Navy has not communicated with the Russian ship but will work out coordination when it arrives, Murdock said.
The essence of the mission is to prevent the seizure of Russian ships by pirates," Dygalo said.
Citing U.N. Security Council Resolution 1816, Handule said, "We are inviting all countries, all states who have possibility to support Somalia to fight against ... pirates.
The pirates hijacked the ship off the coast of Somalia September 25.
The Faina is owned and operated by Kaalbye Shipping Ukraine, and its crew includes citizens of Ukraine, Russia and Latvia, the Navy said.
The International Maritime Bureau said in April that 49 pirate attacks on ships were reported in the first three months of 2008, compared with 41 for the same period last year.
It recorded 263 pirates attacks last year, up from 239 the year before and the first increase in three years.
