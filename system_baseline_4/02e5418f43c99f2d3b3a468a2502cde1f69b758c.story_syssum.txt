Captured in waters off Washington State in 1970, Lolita is an orca -- a killer whale.
Lolita is still living in Florida at the Miami Seaquarium.
It's a crime," Kaamil said.
Like a second lump of sugar, a whale named Hugo who had been captured from the same free-living whale community two years earlier, shared Lolita's teacup for 10 years.
Free-living orcas never do anything self-destructive.
Unlike any other known creature, unlike elephants and humans, orcas like Lolita never leave their birth family.
Thousands of miles away, Lolita's family has been without her.
Before the captures they totaled about 120 whales.
But when the whales removed as babies would have been the next maturing generation, rebuilding hit a wall: too few females.
In some families, the only females are past reproductive age.
Palace Entertainment, owner of the Miami Seaquarium, claims Lolita can no longer survive in the wild.
There, she can be in vocal contact with her family.
Kaamil said.
