While other kids his age spent their Saturday shopping at the mall or tossing around a football, Tolbert traveled from Shippensburg, Pennsylvania, to Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington dressed in a navy blue Civil War reenactment uniform and armed with a brass bugle.
Taps, traditionally played at military funerals and also known as "Butterfield's Lullaby" or "Day is Done," were born during the Civil War along the James River.
Currently, taps are played at the cemetery about 30 times daily, most notably at the Tomb of the Unknowns.
Tolbert usually plays taps by himself but said it was a great opportunity to play with some of the best buglers in the country on the hallowed ground of the cemetery.
For those who did serve in the military, playing taps in Arlington National Cemetery is one of the greatest honors for a bugler.
Allison Cummings, a patrol officer from Hudson, New Hampshire, usually plays taps at law enforcement funerals and ceremonies in her home state, but said playing in Arlington was a unique experience.
Even from that age, I remember visiting here when I just started playing," said Cummings, dressed in a black uniform trimmed in gold with her trumpet hanging by her side.
"[Bugling is] just that final honor to someone who's served their country, and it's just such an honor to play that for them," Cummings said as she stood opposite the grave she was about to serenade, fingering a commemorative gold coin she would lay to rest on the white marble headstone after her performance.
