Officials revealed at the hearing that Ross Dunkley, the editor of the Myanmar Times, faces charges related to torturing and drugging a woman.
The woman making the allegations against Dunkley was at the hearing, and said the editor gave her a drug on two occasions that hampered her memory.
"The woman who had made allegations of physical assault against Mr. Dunkley told the court that she wanted to withdraw her complaint," David Armstrong, chairman of Post Media Ltd. and a friend of Dunkley's who is serving as his spokesman, said in a statement.
Officials from the Australian Embassy in Myanmar attended the hearing, Armstrong said.
"But what I can say, all the troubles came to Ross at an odd timing as there was a business negotiation with his local partner going on."
