But these wrist gadgets are nothing new.
Microsoft created a software platform called SPOT that delivered news updates to watches via FM radio waves for $59 a year.
LG and Samsung gave that category a whirl late last decade, but the devices were way too expensive and not nearly as functional as a traditional smartphone.
Tablets were nothing new when Apple introduced the iPad in 2010.
It seems like the public is finally ready to accept smartwatches the way they accepted Apple's iPad.
Pebble makes a smartwatch with a black-and-white screen similar to the E-Ink display on your Kindle.
According to an unscientific survey of users by mobile deals site BuyVia, the top five features respondents said they'd like to see in a smartwatch were e-mail and texting, phone calls, GPS, Wi-Fi and weather updates -- the same features people now rely on in their smartphones.
We weren't ready for smartwatches before, but now that smartphones are so ingrained in our lives, Apple and others appear smart to give wearable tech another chance.
