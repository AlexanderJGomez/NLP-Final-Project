HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN)  -- Deaths in Zimbabwe related to the cholera epidemic are approaching 2,000, the World Health Organization said Tuesday, and close to 40,000 people have been affected by the preventable water-borne disease.
On top of that problem, the waste-disposing system has collapsed.
Last month, Mugabe's government declared the cholera epidemic a national emergency.
Zimbabwean Health Minister David Parirenyatwa warned this month that the epidemic could get worse as the rainy season develops.
It was widely hoped that the deal would be the panacea to the humanitarian and economic problems bewildering the once-prosperous Zimbabwe, but the pact is yet to take effect.
