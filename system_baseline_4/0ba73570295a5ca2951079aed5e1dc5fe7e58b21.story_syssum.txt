(CNN)The sun hadn't risen at Garissa University College.
At one point, they burst into a room where Christians had gathered and took hostages, said lecturer Joel Ayora.
According to AFP, the gunmen separated the students by religion and allowed Muslims to leave.
Whatever their religion, hundreds of students managed to escape, said Dennis Okari, a reporter with CNN affiliate NTV.
It wasn't until about 15 hours after the attack began that the explosions and gunfire around Garissa finally ended.
Some of those students, at one point or another, were believed to be hostages in one of the four dormitories on campus.
"I am lucky to be alive, because I jumped through the fence with other students."
Such terrorism, sadly, isn't new to the people of eastern Kenya.
Needless to say, that aim isn't shared in most places -- particularly in Kenya, where more than 80% of citizens are Christian.
What makes Thursday's attack different is what was targeted -- an institute of higher learning, presumably filled with innocent students with no direct part in the Kenyan and allied governments' fight against Al-Shabaab.
It's too early to tell what the future now holds for Garissa University College.
