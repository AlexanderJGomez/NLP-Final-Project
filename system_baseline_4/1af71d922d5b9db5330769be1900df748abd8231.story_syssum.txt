A new app aims to help you find a lookalike for your departed or dream pet by using photo-matching software to find the closest match in your area.
It then tries to find you a pet available for adoption that is the closest possible match to the one you posted.
Of course, it's not perfect.
And, of course, we love our animals for reasons other than their appearance.
We tested the app with a photo of Cash, a gray-and-white Scottish Fold cat in Atlanta, and it returned matches of cats with similar coloring in Jefferson, Georgia; Knoxville, Tennessee; Huntsville, Alabama; Charlotte, North Carolina, and other neighboring states.
Now, it's planning to expand its item-specific offerings, with jewelry and furniture apps in the works.
