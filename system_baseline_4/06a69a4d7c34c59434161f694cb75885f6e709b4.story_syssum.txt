The Pentagon unveiled plans Tuesday for fully integrating women into front-line and special combat roles, including elite forces such as Army Rangers and Navy SEALs.
"I remain confident that we will retain the trust and confidence of the American people by opening positions to women, while ensuring that all members entering these newly opened positions can meet the standards required to maintain our warfighting capability," Hagel said.
Despite the past official ban on combat, some women who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan found themselves in firefights.
Military leaders released individual plans for the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines and special forces on Tuesday, and said they would spend the next year or so evaluating how they should be carried out.
I think we owe it to everybody," said Army Maj. Gen. Bennet Sacolick, the director of force management and development for the U.S. Special Operations Command.
"I just want to see what happens," he said.
In many cases Congress would be notified.
