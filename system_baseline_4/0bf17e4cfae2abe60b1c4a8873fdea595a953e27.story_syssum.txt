Joe Dinardo, left, and Clark Dever will be spending only 12 hours in each city before going to their next stop.
Dever, who was recently saving up money to be a professional photographer, quit his job, and Dinardo decided to use all of his accumulated vacation time from his job to take the trip.
They plan to make the most of the deal, hitting at least 29 cities in the 31 days by taking about 49 one-way flights.
The way they see it, if each flight cost $200, they're taking a $10,000 trip for only $600.
JetBlue suspended the deal two days early, saying they were sold out, though the company declined to specify how many people bought them.
She created a site where people are sharing their itineraries in an attempt to either travel together, meet up with Twitter followers in their cities or try to couch surf at other people's homes.
Krause plans to go to 24 cities, using about 45 different flights, to have both an enjoyable vacation and hopefully meet people who will donate to the school.
Though Dever and Dinardo may have the most exhausting schedule, they, like many others, think that if nothing else, the trip will be a true adventure.
We certainly don't want to be the stinky guys on the plane, especially for that many flights.
