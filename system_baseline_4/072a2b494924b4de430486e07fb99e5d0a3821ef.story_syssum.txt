The ruling that Kerviel must pay â‚¬4.9 billion (about $6.3 billion) in damages to the bank, Societe Generale, was also upheld.
"We had set ourselves the objective of defending Mr. Kerviel against an injustice that is absolutely lamentable," Koubbi said outside the courthouse, according to CNN affiliate BFM-TV.
The bank had previously indicated it might not require Kerviel to pay the damages, as it would be an impossible sum to shell out even in multiple lifetimes.
Metzner filed the appeal against the sentence, but Kerviel switched to Koubbi as his attorney in March this year.
Koubbi lamented that "despite the new elements added to his defense," Kerviel's appeal had failed.
Societe Generale, which said it discovered the losses in January 2008, said that at no time were supervisors aware of Kerviel's alleged unlawful activities.
