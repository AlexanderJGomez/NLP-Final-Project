The Naked Cowboy is part of the scenery at New York City's Times Square.

Burck sued Mars this week for $6 million in federal court in New York.
In order for him to show trademark infringement, The Naked Cowboy has to be trademarked; has to prove that Mars, without his consent, infringed upon the trademark; and has to show there's a "likelihood of confusion" between his trademark and the allegedly infringing mark -- in this case the naked M&M.
And this isn't the first time a pseudo-celebrity (sorry Cowboy) has sued and won.
I'm not.
I predict he will be able to afford some very nice duds.
