James headlines a list of marquee names who also are free-agents-to-be or likely free agents this summer, including Miami's Dwyane Wade, Toronto's Chris Bosh, Phoenix's Amare Stoudamire, Dallas' Dirk Nowitzki and Atlanta's Joe Johnson.
"I don't know to that extent, but it will be fun," James said.
James, a six-time NBA all-star, was named the league's MVP for the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 seasons.
He told King his goal is to be with a team that can win more than one NBA championship.
