Washington (CNN) -- A divided federal appeals court has ruled that federal regulators went too far with new rules to control air pollution in parts of the eastern United States.
Kavanaugh described a "Catch-22" scenario that would make it hard for states to comply with federal rules.
"EPA faults the states for not hitting that impossible-to-know target with their (State Implementation Plans) submissions," Kavanaugh said.
Under the Clean Air Act, the good neighbor provision requires upwind states to bear responsibility for what the appeals court said was their fair share of "the mess" in downwind states.
"The result is an unsettling of the consistent precedent of this court strictly enforcing jurisdictional limits, a redesign of Congress's vision of cooperative federalism between the states and the federal government in implementing the CAA based on the court's own notions of absurdity and logic that are unsupported by a factual record, and a trampling on this court's precedent on which the (EPA) was entitled to rely in developing the Transport Rule rather than be blindsided by arguments raised for the first time in this court," wrote Rogers, a Clinton appointee to the appeals court.
"Yet another federal court has reined in an overreaching EPA for violating federal law and intruding on Texas sovereignty," Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said.
The federal government now has the option now of asking the Supreme Court to accept the case for review.
Lawsuits over those new rules have been filed.
