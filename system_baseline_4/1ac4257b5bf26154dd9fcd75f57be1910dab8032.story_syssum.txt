This week, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission held a scheduled two-day public hearing on a nuclear power plant near Victoria.
The money spent on the plant would be nearly five times more than Victoria's yearly budget, said Don Pozzi, an administrative judge and lifetime resident of Victoria County.
And that's exactly what rancher David Huber is afraid of -- a larger Victoria with a nuclear power plant.
Huber, a 6-foot-2 rancher with a thick Texas accent and an affable personality, said he loves his land and his way of life.
His concerns over the dangers of a possible nuclear reactor so close to his ranch have increased since the nuclear disaster triggered by last week's quake and tsunami in Japan, he said.
"Nuclear power is a high risk, high stakes business," said Jim Blackburn with Texans for Sound Energy Policy at this week's NRC public hearing.
No new nuclear plant has won final approval in the United States since the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, although site work is being done at a couple of locations around the country.
The situation in Japan doesn't seem to have any effect on those who steadfastly support the proposed nuclear plant near Victoria, Pozzi said.
"I don't expect people will change their minds," he said.
There are car accidents, people continue to drive," Pozzi said.
Those who oppose the plant said the site where Exelon would build the plant lies on a "growth fault" which doesn't trigger earthquakes but can cause the Earth to shift.
Blackburn said Exelon has not addressed the growth fault issue in its filings with the NRC.
"They pose no seismic threat," said Frantz.
"We did find it and studied it," said Frantz.
"(What if) all of a sudden that (proposed) plant has a problem and there's an evacuation for a 10-mile radius?"
What do I do?
he asked, as he stood on the banks of the San Antonio River next to his ranch at sunset.
