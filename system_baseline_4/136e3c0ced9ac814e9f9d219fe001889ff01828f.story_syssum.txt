(CNN) -- Chicago police continued to search Friday for a suspect in the brutal rape of 15-year-old girl who was walking to school near one of the city's Safe Passage routes for children.
The 15-year-old girl was walking to her high school in predawn darkness when an assailant hit her on the head, dragged her between two houses to a yard and raped her, police said, with the assault taking place just a half-block away from one of the city's "Safe Passage" school routes especially for students.
This school year, city and school officials doubled the number of Safe Passage routes to accommodate more children being forced to walk greater distances because the school system closed a record 48 elementary schools amid a $1 billion budget shortfall.
A resident found the girl half-naked and bleeding from the head on a snowy walkway at the side of his home.
The snow outside his home was still stained Thursday.
