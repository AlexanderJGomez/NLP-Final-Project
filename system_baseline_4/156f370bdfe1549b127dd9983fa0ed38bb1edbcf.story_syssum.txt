In the opening scenes of "Safe House," you can tell what a good time Denzel Washington is having as Tobin Frost, an American spy in Cape Town, South Africa, who is five steps ahead of everyone else.
Very tricky!
As a crew of Langley officials (Vera Farmiga, Brendan Gleeson, Sam Shepard) purse their lips with importance, Frost is placed in a CIA safe house overseen by Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds), who's been twiddling his thumbs there for a year.
Some of this stuff is well-done, and some of it has been done a lot better.
Reynolds is physically impressive, even if his acting here consists of morphing from a deer-in-the-headlights look to a mean squint as the movie goes on.
Which is why the trickiness of Washington's performance begins to ebb, replaced by something somber that might even look tragic if this movie were actually about anything.
