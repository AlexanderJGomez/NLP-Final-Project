The comedian was quick-witted and sharp-tongued, known for standing on the red carpet or presiding over her show "Fashion Police" and, she said, saying the things that other people were thinking.
Rivers, the pioneering, sassy comedian whose gossipy "can we talk" persona led to a career as a headlining talk-show host, best-selling author and red-carpet maven, died a week after being rushed to the hospital after suffering cardiac arrest at a Manhattan clinic.
"I hate housework," went one of her jokes.
"My heart is torn in half," said Silverman in a tweet.
Her show would air opposite the "Tonight Show."
Rivers' Fox talk show was short-lived and its cancellation coincided with a dark period in her life, including the suicide of her husband-manager, Edgar Rosenberg, three months after the show was pulled.
The two Rivers became mainstays of awards season -- later for the TV Guide Channel -- with Joan known for mocking celebrities and their outfits there and on the show "Fashion Police."
Rivers attended Barnard College and had dreams of making it as an actress, a dream both parents discouraged.
A 1965 booking on Carson made her career.
She met Rosenberg in 1965, not long after the Carson appearance.
Indeed, she often took refuge in work, whether it was writing books, mocking celebrities, starring in Las Vegas or even appearing in a documentary about her life, 2010's "Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work."
She was well aware of her personality, once describing herself as "screaming her way through life."
In 1978, Rivers directed a movie, "Rabbit Test," starring Billy Crystal as the world's first pregnant man.
Rivers shrugged that off.
Rivers immediately struck back: "She has been touched up more than a choirboy at the Vatican," she told the New York Post.
Always, Rivers soldiered on.
She was nominated for a Grammy and a Tony, and won a Daytime Emmy for her early-'90s talk show.
