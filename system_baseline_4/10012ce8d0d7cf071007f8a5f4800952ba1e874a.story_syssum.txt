Mandela sits at the 6th Nelson Mandela Lecture in Soweto, Johannesburg.
Mandela joked, pretending not to realize it was his birthday.
Graca Machel, whom he married on his 80th birthday, sat nearby and Mandela was surrounded by grandchildren.
Mandela then lamented the gap between rich and poor in South Africa.
While he stayed out of the spotlight over the last four years, he has stayed busy with his charitable causes.
An exhibition of letters that children wrote to Mandela and the late U.S. civil rights campaigner Rosa Parks will be displayed at the Nelson Mandela Museum, a short distance from his house.
He spent the first 18 years at Robben Island Prison, off Cape Town, South Africa, and later spent time at Pollsmoor prison and Victor Verster Prison, closer to the mainland.
As South Africa's first black president -- he only ran for one term -- Mandela ushered in a democratic, multiracial society that is still going strong.
Mandela's recent birthday tribute concert in London's Hyde Park marked the 20 year anniversary of the Free Mandela event that was held in the same city to demand his release from prison.
"Where there is poverty and sickness, including AIDS, where human beings are being oppressed, there is more work to be done.
Proceeds from the London concert went toward the 46664 Campaign, which Mandela founded in 2003 to raise awareness about the impact of AIDS, especially in Africa, and to promote HIV-prevention measures around the world.
