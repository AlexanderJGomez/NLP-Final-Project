The Deep South joined most of the rest of the nation with sub-zero temperatures Friday as a fast-moving cold front knifed its way down to Florida.
An Arctic air mass over the Plains will cause severe wind chills through Saturday morning, the National Weather Service reported.
The South will also experience higher temperatures by the end of the weekend but that region, too, will shiver a while longer.
The citrus growing regions in Florida and Texas will have to keep an eye on their crops as the cold air remains in the area, Meyers said.
Saturday night is expected to be the coldest, with lows in the teens and below in some areas, the weather service said.
The most snow -- about 10 feet -- is expected to fall in Canada's Whistler Blackcomb, the venue for the Olympic Alpine skiing event.
