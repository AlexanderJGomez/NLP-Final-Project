(CNN) -- On Friday, Pope Francis announced the canonization of two of his predecessors: Pope John Paul II (pope from 1978 to 2005) and Pope John XXIII (1958-1963).
The Vatican verified his first miracle, the curing of a French nun of Parkinson's, from which he also suffered, just two months after his death.
A Vatican spokesman emphasized that because "no one doubts" John's holiness, Pope Francis has decided to move forward with the dual canonization.
Over the first 1,500 years of Catholic history, people generally became saints through popular acclamation rather than through a formal papal process.
Pope John Paul II, in fact, oversaw the canonization of more people (483) than had been canonized in the previous 500 years, in part to lend the weight of Vatican authority to saints that had emerged throughout the global Catholic world.
For example, Pope Celestine V may have become a saint, but he was recognized for his quiet life as a hermit, rather than for his brief life as pope (he was also an inspiration for Pope Benedict XIV's retirement).
John Paul II's sainthood has been promoted by many of the more conservative elements within the Catholic world.
