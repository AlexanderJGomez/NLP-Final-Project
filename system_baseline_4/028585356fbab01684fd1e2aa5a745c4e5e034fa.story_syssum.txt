President Barack Obama apologized Thursday to those Americans whose insurance plans are being canceled due to the federal health law he championed even though he said repeatedly they could keep their coverage if they liked.
Republicans have hammered Obama over the promise since insurers began discontinuing coverage for some of the 12 million Americans who buy individual policies on the private market that don't meet Obamacare requirements for more comprehensive care.
But House Speaker John Boehner said an Obama apology was in order and said the Republican-led House had its own plan in mind.
That's why the House will vote next week to allow anyone with a health care plan they like to keep it," Boehner said.
"Most of the folks who ... got these cancellation letters, they'll be able to get better care at the same cost or cheaper in these new marketplaces," Obama said, also noting that "we have to make sure" people do not feel as if they've been betrayed by an effort carried out with their best interests in mind.
The insurance companies are going to be hungry for their business.
About 95% of legal U.S. residents receive health insurance through private employers or the federal government, the Obama administration says.
"When you try to do something big like make our health care system better ... there are going to be problems along the way, even if ultimately what you're doing is going to make a whole lot of people better off, and I hope that people will look at the end product and they're going to be able to look back and say, you know what, we now have protections we didn't have before," he said.
A Gallup poll conducted just over a week ago showed 36% of Americans said they didn't think that in the long run the Affordable Care Act would make much of a difference to their family's health care situation.
Just over a third said the health care law would make matters worse, and one in four said that Obamacare would make things better.
