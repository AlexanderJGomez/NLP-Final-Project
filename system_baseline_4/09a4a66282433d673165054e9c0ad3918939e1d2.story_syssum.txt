Worldwide, investors put $263 billion into renewable energy projects last year -- a 6.5% increase over 2010 -- and the cost of producing electricity from solar power was cut in half, the study found.
"And we don't have that."
Solar, wind, biomass and small-scale hydroelectric projects installed worldwide had the capability to produce about 565 billion watts, or 565 gigawatts, of electricity in 2011, the report found.
The Germans added more than 7 gigawatts of solar energy capacity in 2011, while Italian investments grew by nearly 40% to $28 billion.
Germany and China have boosted their green energy sector "through consistent policies," by setting targets for new generating capacity, the report said.
And in the past year, the collapse of the solar energy firm Solyndra has cast a pall over alternative energy funding in the United States.
Cuttino said companies are going to fail as the renewable power industry grows, comparing it to the early years of the automobile industry.
