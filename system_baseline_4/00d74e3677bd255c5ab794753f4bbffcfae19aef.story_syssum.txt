(CNN) -- Comprehensive immigration reform.
Obama often talks about reform without even mentioning it.
What's the most important piece of comprehensive immigration reform you never heard of?
Many Americans think reform is about the 11 million unauthorized immigrants already living in the United States.
And they are sure to be the most contentious issue when the immigration debate resumes in months to come.
Exactly what is it about the broken immigration system that produced this vast underground world of workers and families -- a population the size of Ohio?
Many, if not most, of the 11 million already here would have preferred to enter the country legally if that were possible.
But we do.
Today, less than 10% of the native-born men in the labor force are high school dropouts.
And one of the fastest-growing occupations in America is home health aide.
No, we don't need as many immigrant workers in a down economy -- and far fewer want to come to the U.S. when jobs are scarce.
What's needed is to end illegal immigration by creating ways for needed workers to come legally -- creating worker visas and establishing a system that allows employers who can't find enough willing and able Americans to connect easily and quickly with lawful immigrants.
As long as there are jobs available, foreigners will want to come to work here.
Unless we create ways for the immigrants of the future to enter legally, we're going to find ourselves in exactly the same predicament a decade or two down the road -- wondering what to do about 10 or 20 million unauthorized immigrants living among us but beyond the rule of law.
Then we'd have some hope of getting somewhere as the debate resumes.
