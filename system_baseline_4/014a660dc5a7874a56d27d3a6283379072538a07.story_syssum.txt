But the Chilean capital, Santiago, is looking to do just that by encouraging travelers passing through on business to stay and uncover its potential as a hip South American destination.
"Hopefully by bringing out those business people that are coming here for a week to do their jobs (they will) stay for the weekend and enjoy the country," Pardo told CNN's Richard Quest.
With the Santiago business traveler in mind, CNN asked Lonely Planet's Bridget Gleeson, co- author of Lonely Planet Chile and Easter Island Travel Guide, to lend her expertise in selecting the city's best spots.
Touring the city's downtown district on foot is a particularly nice way to explore Santiago, she adds, while the nearby Centro Cultural Palacio La Moneda museum plays host to the finest Chilean modern art.
Vistors can "tour (the Chilean poet and author) Pablo Neruda's charming hilltop house, La Sebastiana" or "board one of Valparaiso's 15 antique ascensores (elevator cable cars) ... to take in vibrant street art and stunning views over the ocean," says Gleeson.
It is for this reason the country will host 68 percent of global astronomy infrastructure by 2018, according to the national government.
"Many travelers opt to visit a few wineries with a specialist like Uncorked Wine Tours," says Gleeson.
Those looking to go it alone on a wine-tasting odyssey meanwhile can reach some of the lesser visited wineries in the Santiago region by public bus in little over an hour.
