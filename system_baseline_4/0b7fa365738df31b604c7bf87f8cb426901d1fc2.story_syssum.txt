(Parenting.com) -- I am a 38-year-old father of two little boys living in Portland, Oregon, and I like my circumcised penis.
And the American Academy of Pediatrics's newly revised policy statement will not, in my opinion, make the issue any clearer for expectant parents -- it remains artfully ambiguous.
That's it.
Besides, my boys are lucky enough to be able to bathe in clean water just about every day.
Before the birth of my first son, most of the parental backyard barbecue banter dealt with either aesthetics or tradition.
Either the men were adamant that their son look like them or they just didn't care if they didn't.
I can't help but wonder if the practice of male circumcision, as with female genital mutilation, has something to do with a fear of human sexuality and a desire to control.
They went as far as to claim that there are as many good reasons for prohibition of male circumcision as there are for female genital mutilation.
I believe that he was solely motivated by pressure to look like his male peers.
I did not have any desire to subject my beautiful baby boys to excruciating pain, even with analgesia.
Besides, the perception of what a "normal" penis should look like is rapidly changing.
The day will come when one of my boys will want to know why his penis is different than mine.
