Ryanair has complained to OFT about its ongoing row with the UK's Advertising Standards Authority.
"It is very disappointing, but absolutely necessary, that we have had to take this course of action," said ASA director general Christopher Graham, whose authority last referred a company to OFT in 2005.
Last week, Ryanair complained to OFT about its treatment by the ASA.
A Ryanair spokesman said the airline was not forced by the OFT to shut down its system as a punitive measure.
Aer Lingus met the new deadline, the OFT said, but Ryanair did not.
