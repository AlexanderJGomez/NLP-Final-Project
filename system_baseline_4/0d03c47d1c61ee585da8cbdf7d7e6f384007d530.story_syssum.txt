(CNN) -- Meat is murder?
"Cultured meat would have a lot of advantages," said Jason Matheny of research group New Harvest.
And when we grow only the meat we can eat, it's more efficient.
Conventional meat production is also hard on the environment.
In-vitro meat is made from samples of animals conventionally slaughtered.
The factor that could take the research from the lab to the store and into refrigerators around the world is its remarkable commercial potential.
The Netherlands' Government has also invested around $4 million in Dutch research into in-vitro meat production.
"We think that a technology to produce cultured ground meats -- burgers, sausages, nuggets, and so forth -- could be commercialized within ten years," said Matheny.
Both conventional and cultured meat is made of muscle tissue.
"If cultured meat looks, tastes, and costs the same as regular meat, then I think acceptance will be high.
In any case, it's not necessarily the case that cultured meat would involve GM foods.
If cultured meat looks, tastes, and costs the same as regular meat, then do we care that it's produced in a steel tank, rather than in an animal farm?
The more we learn about how meat is produced now, the more in-vitro meat looks like a better alternative."
Lab-produced meat also raises some ethical considerations.
Gillian Madill, Genetics Technologies spokesperson for Friends of the Earth, thinks that clear parameters for in-vitro development need to put in place: "If we can successfully develop these products, what is the defining line between lab-grown meat and natural animals?"
"With India and China doubling their meat consumption every decade, there's no sustainable way to satisfy the growing global appetite for meat without a significant improvement in technology," said Matheny.
