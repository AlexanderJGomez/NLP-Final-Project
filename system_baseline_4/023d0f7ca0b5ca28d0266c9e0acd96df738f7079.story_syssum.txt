Atlanta (CNN) -- One of the countries hard hit by the Ebola outbreak in West Africa is not able to cope, a health worker said, calling on the international community to step up support.
Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia are at the center of an Ebola outbreak that has already killed more than 800 people.
"It will take many months, and it won't be easy, but Ebola can be stopped," he said.
A Nigerian doctor has been diagnosed with Ebola nearly three weeks after a Liberian-American man with Ebola died after traveling to Lagos, Nigerian officials said Monday.
The Ebola virus causes viral hemorrhagic fever, which affects multiple organ systems in the body and is often accompanied by bleeding.
It helped create an isolation unit at Emory University Hospital, which is being used to treat American doctor Kent Brantly, who contracted Ebola in Liberia and was evacuated to the facility in Atlanta over the weekend.
But in the nations hardest-hit and not as prepared, the reality is grim.
Ebola spreads through contact with organs and bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, urine and other secretions of infected people.
In Sierra Leone, where government officials have asked citizens to stay away from work, the military has deployed at least 750 medical officials to 13 locations, military spokesman Col. Michael Samura said.
On Tuesday, Liberia responded to British Airways' decision to suspend service to Monrovia because of the outbreak.
