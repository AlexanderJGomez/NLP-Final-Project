Sarah Palin hit the campaign trail Friday, delivering the keynote address at a Washington  fundraiser for an anti-abortion group supporting socially conservative women running for office in the upcoming midterm elections.
"We won't forget," she promised.
Palin said national media coverage of the pregnancy "kind of made it rough" on Bristol and sent a not-too-subtle message to other young women that it's easier to choose to have an abortion.
In addition, she will travel South Carolina to endorse GOP state Rep. Nikki Haley for governor.
"Sarah Palin has energized the conservative movement like few others in our generation."
Palin has also endorsed, among others, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina in California's GOP Senate primary.
In addition to being an author, Palin has become a sought-after speaker and a contributor on Fox News.
