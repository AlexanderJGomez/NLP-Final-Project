Although a judge has found two Steubenville teenagers guilty of raping a 16-year-old girl in a case that showcased jaw-dropping examples of teenage alcohol use and tawdry text messaging -- all wrapped in allegations of a cover-up -- Ohio's attorney general said Monday it's now time for a grand jury to look at whether anyone else should be charged.
"We hope that from this something good can arise," she said.
The girls -- one 15, one 16, both from Steubenville -- were in a juvenile lockup Monday night, awaiting an appearance before a judge Tuesday morning, Jefferson County Sheriff Fred Abdalla said.
But 16 people who may know something about what happened that August night have refused to talk, he said.
DeWine's announcement of the grand jury came shortly after Judge Thomas Lipps found Trent Mays, 17, and Ma'lik Richmond, 16, guilty of rape.
Authorities accused Mays and Richmond of putting their fingers in the girl's vagina while she was too drunk to consent, an act that constitutes rape under Ohio law.
Richmond received a minimum of one year.
Richmond's attorney, Walter Madison, said his client would appeal in an attempt to avoid that designation.
"She continues to be a victim and be victimized ... over and over," he said.
Nevertheless, "They're going to have to answer to it," he said.
"I hope this sends a warning," he said.
The ensuing ire over the case brought national attention and criticism to the city from around the country, leaving city officials struggling to defend the community and residents weary of the media spotlight.
"It's not.
DeWine said.
"And there were precious few people that night that were doing what was right."
