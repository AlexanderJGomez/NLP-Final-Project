Beijing (CNN) -- Demonstrators braved a heavy police presence and the threat of arrest by massing Thursday in the streets of Kunming, China, to protest the planned construction of a chemical plant, they said.
"Every Kunming person cares about this issue," said another Kunming native, a 50-year-old man who said rows of police thwarted his efforts to reach the heart of the protest.
"The police kept blocking off the protest, block by block."
"The government will call off the project if most of our citizens say no to it," said Mayor Li Wenrong, according to Xinhua.
The provincial general manager of China National Petroleum Corp. has said the refinery will not use the chemical.
As part of the interrogation, she said, police took her to the print shop where she had made copies of her fliers.
Finally, she said, they threatened her and banned her from attending Thursday's protest.

An executive from Yuntianhua, which also has a major stake in the chemical plant, told journalists that an environmental impact assessment for the project had not been completed, Xinhua said.
China now burns 3.8 billion tons of coal each year, nearly as much as the rest of the world combined.
Pollution and dust generated in China have been found as far away as California.
China has already tried to boost the use of alternative sources of power, setting standards for solar energy installation and switching from coal to gas in some cities.
