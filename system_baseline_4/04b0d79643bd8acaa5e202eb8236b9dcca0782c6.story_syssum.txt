Paris, France (CNN) -- French lawmakers Tuesday recommended a partial ban on any veils that cover the face -- including the burqa, the full-body covering worn by some Muslim women.
Such a resolution, if passed, would not make the wearing of a full veil or burqa illegal, but it would give public officials support when asking people to remove it.
By recommending a ban on full veils in public places such as hospitals and schools and by anyone receiving public services, the commission members said they wanted to assist those working with members of the public when asking that full veils be removed.
Any law directed at full veils is likely to be challenged in the courts both in France and at the European level.
That's despite government estimates that less than 2,000 women in the country actually wear the full Islamic veil.
Those who advocate the ban say women are often forced to wear full veils by the men around them -- husbands, fathers or brothers -- and that it is a sign of subjugation.
She said she believes a law against full veils would take away fundamental rights of Muslim women.
He said it is ridiculous to do so in France.
France already has a law against Muslim girls wearing headscarves in state schools.
