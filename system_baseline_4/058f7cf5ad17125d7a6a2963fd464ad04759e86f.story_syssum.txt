"Over the last 30 months, we've seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created," Democratic incumbent Barack Obama said.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics confirms that a lot of jobs have been created under Obama's leadership -- 4.4 million by the bureau's latest count.
What Obama did not say, however, was that the nation shed 4.3 million jobs during the early days of his term, and that the net gain since he took the oath of office in January 2009 is just 125,000 jobs.
Look at the evidence of the last four years.
That means that, while the nation has replaced lost jobs, many of those new jobs pay less than the old ones did.
In August, the U.S. unemployment rate was 8.1%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
No president has been re-elected with an unemployment rate above 8% since Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s, during the Great Depression.
