(National Geographic) -- Miles from the main roads, in rural Africa, soccer balls bounce unevenly.
Some feet are bare, others shod in fraying sneakers, boots, rubber sandals.
Each might last days or months on a field of gravel or hard earth.
Wherever Hilltout went, she swapped the store-bought balls she kept in her car for these "ingenious little jewels," most of which were made by children.
