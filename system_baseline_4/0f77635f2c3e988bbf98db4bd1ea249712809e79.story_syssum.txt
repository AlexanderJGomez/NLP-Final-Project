Eileen Brennan, who earned an Oscar nomination for her hilarious turn as the exasperated drill captain in 1980's "Private Benjamin," has died, CNN has confirmed.
She will be greatly missed by all of us."
The latter earned her an Emmy nomination, one of seven she earned in her career -- including one that resulted in a win, a supporting actress-comedy pick for "Private Benjamin."
In 1982, Brennan was involved in a horrific accident, struck by a car as she exited a restaurant with "Benjamin" co-star Goldie Hawn.
"It was my only hope," Brennan told People magazine in 1985.
I say birth rather than rebirth because I feel born new.
Brennan also survived a bout with breast cancer in 1990.
She is survived by two sons, Patrick Brennan and Sam Lampson.
