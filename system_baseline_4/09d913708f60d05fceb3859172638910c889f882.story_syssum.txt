A pair of New York brothers will appear in court Tuesday on charges of running a multimillion-dollar ring that peddled fake products distributed up and down the East Coast, authorities said.
Law enforcement authorities seized four tractor-trailers filled with knockoff health products from five locations on Long Island on Thursday.
The fake products included ChapStick, Johnson's Baby Oil, Vicks VapoRub, Vicks Inhaler, Vaseline and Always sanitary pads; the producers of the real products include major international brands such as Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble and Unilever, prosecutors said.
Other products, including over-the-counter cold medicines and painkillers, also were recovered, officials said.
The prosecutor's office is trying to determine the chemical makeup of the products and the health risks, if any, associated with them.
Counterfeits will not have the same quality or consistency of real products.
