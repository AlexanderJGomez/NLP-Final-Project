A Middlesex County Superior Court judge sentenced Mark Kerrigan to 2.5 years after a jury convicted him Wednesday of assault and battery.
Mark Kerrigan was taken into custody immediately, said Cara O'Brien, spokeswoman for the Middlesex County District Attorney's Office.
"My family has never believed at all that my brother had anything to do with my father's death," Nancy Kerrigan said outside the courthouse.
Kerrigan's family has said Daniel Kerrigan had a heart condition.
