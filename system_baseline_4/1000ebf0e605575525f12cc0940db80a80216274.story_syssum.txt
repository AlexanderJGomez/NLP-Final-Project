For the past six seasons of "Lost," every single episode has brought us at least one new oddity to ponder.
Now we are down to the final episode.
So, guys, here are 10 questions we need the answers to on Sunday.
What the heck is the island?
Or is it a hiding place for the world's life source, as Jacob and the Man in Black's mother proposed?
Jacob has been tasked with guarding the white light for forever, and in this week's episode, Jack volunteered to take over the job -- which makes sense, as Jacob tells him that the light is near the bamboo field where he awoke in the show's first seconds.
Why are the characters' lives in the "sideways" universe different from what they were before the crash?
Why?
Because of the explosion, or has the island always been his destiny too?
How will he play into whatever is coming?
Why can't women have babies on the island?
How will Jack try to kill the Man in Black?
When Jack took over for Jacob, Jacob said Jack must "do what he couldn't -- kill him."
In last year's season finale, the Man in Black convinced Ben to kill Jacob.
I'm worried that in the final showdown between Jack and the Man in Black, Jack might not come out alive.
Why was the island underwater?
Why?
