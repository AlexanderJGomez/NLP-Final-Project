(CNN) -- Decked out in voluminous Victorian-style dresses, complete with horn-shaped headgear, the Herero ladies of Namibia have held on tight to a piece of 19th century history.
Blogger Mwalimushi Kamati-Chinkoti of My Beautiful Namibia website says wearing the dresses often symbolizes a woman's place in the society.
He explains that the style of dress has become an important part of the Herero women's identity.
"It also provides a sense of cultural identity in general, in the historical context and in the context of modern-day Namibia," he added.
The Herero and Himba people are a pastoral, cattle-breeding tribe who migrated to Namibia several centuries ago.
The Herero women take enormous pride in their outfits and have also developed a sideline in making and selling dolls wearing exact replicas of the dresses to tourists.
