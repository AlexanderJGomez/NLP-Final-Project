Jones, who is originally from Stourbridge in the West Midlands, England, appeared on stage in front of a studio audience with a partner 40 years her junior.
Jones, whose real name is Sarah, told the local Stourbridge News that she was stunned by her newfound fame.
The Stourbridge News reported that Jones was a professional dancer in her youth.
She now lives in Gandia, near Valencia in Spain and is said to have taken up salsa dancing five years ago to keep herself entertained.
From there, the routine becomes even more physical and ends when Nico flips Jones upside down and over his shoulder, drawing a standing ovation from the judges and the crowd.
Before finding fame, the unmarried 48-year-old lived in a modest home in a small town in Scotland with her pet cat.
