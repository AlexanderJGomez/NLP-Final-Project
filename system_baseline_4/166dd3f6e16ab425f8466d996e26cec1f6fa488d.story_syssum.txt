"I left Iran with the hope of maybe one day creating music that can connect with the entire world, music that can show another dimension of my culture, and my history," Nazeri says.
"To be number one, this means the world is now listening," Nazeri says.
Nazeri's father Shahram Nazeri, who also performs on the album with his son, is one of Iran's most beloved and famous classical singers, and Nazeri says, one of his greatest teachers.
He broke a lot of Persian classical singing rules and he created his own style by incorporating Rumi's poetry in Persian classical music for the first time 40 years ago."
If you really hear music," says Nazeri.
And his album is merely the beginning, Nazeri says.
And I would love for that message to be the sound of us in this modern time."
