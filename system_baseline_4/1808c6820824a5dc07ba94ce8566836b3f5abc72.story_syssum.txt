Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Campaign workers distributed campaign leaflets and plastered candidate posters along the Iranian capital's tree-lined streets in the final days before Friday's parliamentary elections.
For example, someone says 'I like the system.'
And that's why."
Scores of high-ranking opposition campaign workers and political activists fled to exile to neighboring Turkey, where some claimed in interviews with CNN that they endured torture in Iranian prisons.
But at a campaign rally for candidates from the conservative Principalist Front on Wednesday, one lawmaker running for re-election offered a decidedly different account of the aftermath of the 2009 vote.
Instead, Iranian political analysts describe Friday's vote as a contest between rival conservative factions within the government.
Ahmadinejad disappeared from public view for 11 days after Khamenei over-ruled his decision to fire an intelligence minister.
Iranian analysts said the Principalist Front represents one of the leading groups of candidates.
At the Principalist Front rally on Friday, where candidates took turns addressing several hundred people seated on the floor of a mosque, candidate Zohreh Elahian sought to downplay previous divisions between pro- and anti-Ahmadinejad conservative factions.
At a speech before thousands of supporters on Wednesday, Ayatollah Khamenei accused the United States and its allies of trying to stop Iranians from voting on Friday.
Others pointed to the recent series of assassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists, which the Iranian government has blamed on foreign agents.
Almost as an afterthought, he added, "Death to America, death to Israel," before politely shaking hands with his interlocutor and saying goodbye.
