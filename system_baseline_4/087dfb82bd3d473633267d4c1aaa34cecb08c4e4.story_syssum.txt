Lawyers for McDonnell and his wife met with prosecutors in the city of Alexandria on Monday as the Justice Department sought clarity over previously undisclosed gifts given to the governor and his family by the chief executive of a troubled dietary supplement company.
It's between Republican Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, who has his own ties to the man behind the McDonnell scandal, and Democrat Terry McAuliffe, a heavyweight political fundraiser, businessman and close friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton.
It has been a stunning turn of events for McDonnell, a well mannered former star in Republican politics who rose from state legislator to Virginia attorney general to governor.
He was mentioned as a possible running mate for Mitt Romney.
McDonnell maintains he didn't know about the gifts or the stock and has denied wrongdoing.
McDonnell has reported other gifts from Williams, including a stay at a lake house and private plane travel.
Williams has also given generously to McDonnell's political organization.
An ethics investigation of Cuccinelli's relationship with Williams cleared the attorney general of any wrongdoing but revealed that Cuccinelli put the executive in touch with an attorney who could help him win grants from a state agency.
