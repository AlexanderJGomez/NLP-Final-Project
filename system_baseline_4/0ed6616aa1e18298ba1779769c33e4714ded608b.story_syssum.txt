(CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama arrived in South Korea on Wednesday, where the leaders of top global economies will convene at the G-20 summit to try to stabilize the world's financial markets.
Tensions about currency and trade are likely to run high at the G-20 meeting, which will be held Thursday and Friday in Seoul, the South Korean capital.
But the president focused on the two countries' shared principles of unity and tolerance when he delivered a highly anticipated speech at the University of Indonesia right before he left for South Korea.
Noting that Malay is one of hundreds of languages of the archipelago nation, Obama lauded Indonesia for its spirit of inclusiveness despite its diverse population and history of dictatorship.
Obama said he returned as president of the United States seeking "a deep and enduring partnership" with Indonesia.
"We see the G-20 as fundamental not just to our international economic agenda, but to our ability to have a lasting recovery at home, because fostering balance, global growth is essential to fostering growth here in the American economy," Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications said ahead of Obama's Asia trip.
The G-20 includes industrialized nations and developing economies, which focus on economic issues and economic policy coordination.
"Further economic integration [and] trade liberalization in Asia Pacific is vital to our own interests and our ability to export more and grow our economy here at home," National Security Advisor Mike Froman said ahead of Obama's Asia trip.
The president is scheduled to return to the United States on Sunday.
