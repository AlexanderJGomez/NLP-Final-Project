KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The soldiers had barely arrived in Iraq before they got new orders -- get ready for Afghanistan.
The soldiers hadn't even finished painting their emblem outside their tactical operations command when the move began.
The battlefield in Afghanistan is very different than Iraq.
"In Iraq you are looking at more close-quarters combat in an urban environment, but in Afghanistan the area is only sparsely populated and we are looking at much more of a linear battlefield," said Lt. Matthew Fitzgibbon.
As the United States shifts its focus from Iraq to Afghanistan, the military has deemed route clearance so important to the operations in the Kandahar area that it is airlifting the entire battalion to the new battlefield.
Lt. William Hutaff, one of the first soldiers to leave for Afghanistan as part of an advance party, had his flight delayed several times and waited almost two days before he could board one of the cargo planes.
But none of that seemed on the soldiers' minds as the plane took off from Baghdad International Airport for the four-hour flight to Afghanistan, and many of them went to sleep shortly after takeoff or listened to music on their iPods in the dark and loud hull of the giant plane.
Leaving the aircraft, the soldiers said they were tired and looking to get into their new housing units.
"There is still a lot of work to be done here," said Fitzgibbon.
"right now our motor pool, the place we're supposed to park our vehicles, is a lake."
