But for hundreds of children in the rural villages of Colombia, Luis Soriano is far from a clown.
Soriano, 38, is a primary school teacher who spends his free time operating a "biblioburro," a mobile library on donkeys that offers reading education for hundreds of children living in what he describes as "abandoned regions" in the Colombian state of Magdalena.
Do you know a hero?
To help bridge the learning gap, Soriano decided to personally bring books to the children.
Every Wednesday at dusk and every Saturday at dawn, Soriano leaves his wife and three young children to travel to select villages -- up to four hours each way -- aboard a donkey named Alfa.
"It's not easy to travel through the valleys," Soriano said.
The books they do not have access to ... they get from the biblioburro."
Soriano has spent nearly 4,000 hours riding his donkeys, and he's not traveled unscathed.
They also run a small community restaurant.
That's how a community changes and the child becomes a good citizen and a useful person," Soriano said.
