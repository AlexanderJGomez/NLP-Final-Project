ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Taliban militants made their deepest incursion into Pakistan this week, seizing control of areas that are a short drive from the capital city.
Those warheads, however, are unassembled and scattered about Pakistan in areas that are not under the control of the Taliban, several analysts said.
"But, no, we do not have a situation in which the government or the country of Pakistan is about to fall to the Taliban."
Krepon, who studies Pakistan's and India's nuclear programs, said tensions between those two countries could prompt Pakistan to move its weapons components.
"Only a few people in the army know about it," he said, noting that the Pakistani army would defend their control of the nuclear weapons until the end.
Commentators and politicians in the West have long harbored concerns that Pakistan's nuclear weapons could be stolen by Islamic militants.
At the briefing, Lt. Gen. Khalid Kidwai -- head of the army division that controls Pakistan's nuclear sites and weapons -- said the country's weapons were protected by a "fool-proof" security system.
"In Pakistan we have been extremely conscious of our responsibilities and obligations in this regard and we have instituted command and control structures and security measures in a manner so as to make these fool proof," Kidwai said.
