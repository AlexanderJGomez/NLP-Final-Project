Sixteen years after her affair with President Bill Clinton became public knowledge, she's returned to the limelight with a campaign against cyberbullying -- of which she claims to have been "patient zero."
Lewinsky has decided to revisit his cause in 2014, suggesting that the timing may have less to do with him than it does with Hillary Clinton.
And, of course, this will be embarrassing for Hillary Clinton.
The right won't have to waste its own resources reminding people of the seedier side of the Clinton years -- Lewinsky can do that now.
Imagine that your husband was caught cheating and the contents of your marriage were discussed every night on television.
But what she did all those years ago and what she's doing now makes her a perfect candidate for a good, old-fashioned shaming.
