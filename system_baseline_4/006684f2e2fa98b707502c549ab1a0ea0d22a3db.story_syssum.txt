The Late-1980s pop culture relic "21 Jump Street" was a primo specimen of a TV police procedural with a catchy hook: A team of fresh-faced cops work undercover as high school kids, reporting back to their tough/earnest boss at the address listed above.
It jokes about high school but is also a sensitive sociological study of those crucial years.
On the surface, "21 Jump Street" follows the crime-fighting antics of odd-couple cop partners Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum).
Their wonky dynamic is established in a perfectly placed opening flashback to 2005, when the two were real high school students -- Schmidt the klutzy, anxious nerd with a brain; Jenko the athletic, academically challenged coolio.
And by the way they get to bust a drug ring fronted by a smart and popular guy played with oddball charisma by Dave Franco.
Underneath, "21 Jump Street" is a riot of risks that pay off, the biggest of which might be handing Tatum funny business.
Also, Tatum can sustain a great, I mean great, Dumb Face.
