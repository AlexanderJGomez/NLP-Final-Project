For the third straight year, U.S. diplomats on Thursday joined envoys from several other nations in walking out during the Iranian president's address at the annual United Nations gathering in New York.
Representatives from the United States, Britain, Spain and other nations walked out while Ahmadinejad asserted that the U.S. government either participated in the 9/11 attacks or let them happen as an excuse to wage war in Iraq and Afghanistan.
He blamed a few world powers for the world's problems, and defended his country's nuclear activities as peaceful.

he said.
On Iraq, Ahmadinejad said the United States, whom he called "the occupiers," is "incapable of establishing security," and scores were dying daily as a result.
Ahmadinejad in 2005 told the General Assembly that Iran had a right to operate a nuclear energy program.
He said it was unfair that some nations were allowed to make nuclear fuel while others are condemned for it.
