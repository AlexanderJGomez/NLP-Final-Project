(CNN) -- As America grapples with a crisis of children on its southern border, another image from another time seems inescapable: that ship full of Jewish refugees off our shores as World War II approached.
But the U.S. political climate had turned hostile toward the growing number of European Jewish immigrants.
Seventy-five years later, we are faced with a new group of desperate people hovering in our midst -- this time children from Central America escaping escalating levels of violence few of us can fathom.
This is a story of three countries with levels of violence comparable to a war zone.
It is also the story of three broken states where the police are infiltrated by street gangs (some copied on U.S. models) and governments -- corrupt from top to bottom -- are helpless in their fight against organized crime.
One immigration rights advocate recalls a mother telling her, "I would rather see my child die on the way to the United States than die on my doorstep."

Estimates vary on how many will qualify.
Unless circumstances change, many forced to return to their cities will likely perish.
--First, we should respond generously to those children who have already arrived or will soon.
-- Second, we should push to establish "safe zones" -- operated by the United Nations, supported by the U.S. -- for returning children and their families in their native countries and work with those countries to reduce their violence and expand hope.
The United Nations has successfully established such protected areas in two major instances: to protect refugees in the Indochinese crisis of the 1970s and to shield 2 million Kurds from slaughter by Saddam Hussein's troops after the 1991 Gulf War.
And it's true: the only way this crisis ends well in the long run is if these Central America governments successfully fight back against gang violence and corruption.
Will we turn our backs, as we did so shamefully to those Jewish refugees years ago?
That is the choice we now face.
