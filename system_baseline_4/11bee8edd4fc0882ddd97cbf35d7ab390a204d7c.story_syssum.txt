(CNN) -- Dr. Mehmet Oz is being sued for injures sustained by a New Jersey man.
Because, the plaintiff claims, he was injured when he tried Dr. Oz' home sleep remedy known as the "Knapsack Heated Rice Footsie."
And then there was the lawsuit filed last year against the Dallas Cowboys by a woman claiming she sustained burns on her legs.
More?
And that brings us to Dr. Oz.
However, Dr. Oz expressly warned viewers, "Don't get it too hot, just warm."
How?
The plaintiff also claims that Dr. Oz should have offered a specific warning to avoid using this remedy to people who, like him, have diabetes and hence less feeling in their feet.
So, understandably, people flock to these lawyers with complaints about every imaginable wrong seeking a payday.
But it's easy for even a non-corporate lawyer to see that these ridiculous lawsuits give the reputable plaintiffs' attorneys -- and, frankly, all lawyers -- a black eye.
I can understand the lure of taking a questionable case that will reap you some media coverage and money.
And this will make it even more challenging for lawyers to earn a living.
As for Dr. Oz, I hope that he doesn't settle quickly out of court.
