(CNN) -- Amtrak Train 91 was way behind schedule.
"The dining car developed axle problems that disabled the train 2 miles north of the Staples Mill Road Station in Richmond around 5:30 p.m. Sunday," said Amtrak spokeswoman Kimberly Woods, via e-mail.
During the delay, passengers were free to move around inside the train, and they had access to food and water, bathrooms, and heating and air conditioning, she said.
Smith didn't fault the Amtrak employees on board, calling them fellow victims of the delay.
Woods encouraged passengers to call 1-800-USA-RAIL for information about refunds and credits.
