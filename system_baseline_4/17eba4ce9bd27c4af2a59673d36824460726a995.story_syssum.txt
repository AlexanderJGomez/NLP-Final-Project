(CNN) -- Any minute, the Duchess of Cambridge will birth a new heir to the British throne.
Will you be the first to know?
This will be the first chance for the nation and those watching around the world to find out whether the new baby is a boy or a girl.
Speaking of the grand gender reveal, if you placed bets on pink, you might win that office pool.
Scientists say the baby is slightly more likely to be a girl.
Rules dating back centuries decreed that the crown passed to the eldest son and was only bestowed on a daughter when there were no sons.
But first, the child will be ... well, a child.
"I imagine and hope that its early life, until it's at least in its teens, will be just a jolly, happy, ordinary child's life," said Rhodes, who still periodically has "a nice little drink and a chat" with her old friend after church.
This baby might win the day all around because its mother is the first commoner to marry into the royal family since the 17th century.
"It freshens up the gene pool."
