By 2007, the Colorado-based company was selling 50 million pairs a year, reaching $850 million in sales.
There were too many Crocs in too many stores, and some people had grown weary of the comfortable, but not exactly fashion-forward, design.
"We had to innovate our way out of the situation we had put ourselves in," McCarvel said.
While Crocs clogs were undeniably popular, they were also scorned by fashionistas and people tired of seeing the colorful plastic shoes nearly everywhere.
But within the company, there was a notion that perhaps even critics could find something to love about Crocs.
So the company set out to create a new line of shoes -- flats, wedges, sneakers, boat shoes, even winter boots -- that would be as comfortable as the clogs, but would appeal to more style-conscious consumers.
That's the normal reaction we get from people," she said.
To showcase the new shoes, Crocs has opened 120 stores in the United States and hopes to open another 100 stores this year.
With the new designs leading the way, Crocs is back in the black.
