Two French aviation design studios are betting on gambling in the air.
The idea of in-flight gambling may seem like a new one, principally because no airline is currently doing it.
In the 1990s, Swissair installed gambling software that allowed passengers to bet up to $350 on a variety of casino classics, including poker, keno and blackjack.
However, the idea of in-flight gambling re-emerged a few years ago.
"Casinos were just an idea, along with many other ideas we talked about a few years ago," a Virgin spokesman told CNN.
Ryanair announced in 2004 that it would introduce gambling through an in-flight entertainment system, though this too has yet to come to fruition.
For starters, as more carriers are unrolling Wi-Fi on their flights, passengers could feasibly just gamble online from their mobile devices.
Houssard and Alfano also don't see online gambling as competition to their own concept.
It's difficult to imagine that airlines would be willing to give over potential passenger space (and the fares that come with it) to a social arena, but Alfano says if designed properly, there shouldn't be a conflict.
The biggest obstacle to in-flight gambling, however, is a legal one.
A lot of things are changing."
