You can take one home to your son,'" Knight said in an interview broadcast Tuesday on the syndicated "Dr. Phil" talk show.
And it wasn't long, Knight said, before he trapped her in an upstairs room and tied her up with an extension cord.
"I want my son to know me as a victor, not a victim," Knight told host Dr. Phil McGraw.
Castro lured Knight into his vehicle from a Family Dollar store in Cleveland in 2002, promising to give her a ride.
"After 11 years, I am finally being heard, and it's liberating," she said in a powerful statement at Castro's sentencing, describing the abuse she endured.

"That's where I tried to get out," Knight said.
"He took a pipe and he held it ... over my head, and he said, 'If you scream, I'll ram this down your throat and I'll kill you,'" Knight recalled, describing what she said was Castro's response after she used a pair of pliers and a wire cutter to remove a chain around her neck.
Knight, 32, was 21 years old when she was reported missing in 2002.
"I begged him not to bring any more there to suffer the hell I went through," Knight said.

Knight told McGraw that her son was taken away after her mother's boyfriend abused him.
"I did all I could do."
...
She made sure I was dumber than a doorknob," she said.
"What I have heard that she said about me breaks my heart.
I pray that someday she will heal enough to know that again."
