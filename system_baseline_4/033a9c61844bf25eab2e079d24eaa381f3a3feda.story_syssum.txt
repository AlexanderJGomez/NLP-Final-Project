Speaker Nancy Pelosi says House Democrats will return to their districts ready to defend the bill.
The prospects for health care reform in the full House, however, remain unclear.
The fate of health care reform also remains uncertain in the Senate, where the Finance Committee recently postponed its long-awaited vote on a bipartisan compromise plan until after the August recess.
On Thursday, 57 members of the House Progressive Caucus sent a letter to Pelosi and others complaining that the agreement with the Blue Dogs weakened language creating a government-funded health insurance option.
The agreement with the Blue Dogs, estimated to lower the cost of the House plan by $100 billion over a decade, would also exempt businesses with payrolls below $500,000 from having to provide health coverage to employees.
Opposition from progressive Democrats and some conservative House Democrats who want additional cost cuts could defeat the bill.
She also pointed out that the bill could change when the House and Senate negotiate a final measure in coming months.
On Thursday, Grassley said pressure from the White House and Democratic leaders to speed the process didn't help.
Democrats had hoped the Finance Committee could finish its work before the August break to show progress toward health legislation.
