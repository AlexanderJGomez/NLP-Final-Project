With the English Channel tunnel, trains speed from Big Ben to the Eiffel Tower in about 2.5 hours.
More travelers now connect London and Paris by train than by air -- and high-speed rail between these two cities may get even faster and cheaper in the near future.
In the 15 years that the bullet train has been running, not much has changed except London's Eurostar station -- it's now St. Pancras International (in Paris it stops at Gare du Nord; in Brussels it's Midi Station).
In January, Eurostar's monopoly on using the Chunnel -- the tunnel beneath the English Channel -- expires.
Fares can change without notice, but typically a one-way, full-fare ticket (with no restrictions on refunds) runs about $425 first-class and $300 second-class.
Cheaper seats come with more restrictions and can sell out quickly (figure $80 to $160 for second-class, one-way).
When you're ready to ride, you'll find the process is similar to an airport check-in -- without all the drama, sole-baring shoe inspections, and waiting.
Since the days of Napoleon there had been talk about a tunnel under the English Channel, but it wasn't until 1986 that the two countries finally reached an agreement to build it together.
The tunnel was complete.
High-tech know-how, a shared European vision, and people's love of travel have created incredibly fast trains that crisscross, link and strengthen Europe.
