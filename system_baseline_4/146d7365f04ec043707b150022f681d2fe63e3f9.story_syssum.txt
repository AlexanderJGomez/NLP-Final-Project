(CNN) -- Sara lives in Sierra Leone and just wants to go to school.
Sara is the exception among girls in Sierra Leone.
If they have the money to pay school fees, many girls still miss out on an education simply because a family usually will choose to send a boy to school before a girl.
The nonprofit Plan International USA  is one group working with girls in Sierra Leone and other West African countries.
If you do that through the radio, I think people deep in the village will open their ears and hear something about it," Sara says.
These online booklets are designed to help people of all ages understand the challenges that many girls and women face around the world.
