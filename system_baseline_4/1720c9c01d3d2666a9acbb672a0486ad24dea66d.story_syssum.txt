Wenger and Arsenal, though, ventured into the market Thursday and landed Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona.
The 25-year-old agreed to join the Gunners from Barcelona on a "long-term contract" for an "undisclosed fee," Arsenal said on its website.
"I'm so happy to be joining Arsenal, a club which has a great manager, a fantastic squad of players, huge support around the world and a great stadium in London," Sanchez told Arsenal's website.
Arsenal hasn't won the Premier League title since going unbeaten in 2003/2004 and only narrowly ended its nine-year trophy drought by beating Hull in extra time in May's FA Cup final.
"FC Barcelona thanks Alexis Sanchez for his professionalism and dedication for the three seasons that he has been in the first team squad, and wishes him all the best for the future," Barcelona said on its website.
