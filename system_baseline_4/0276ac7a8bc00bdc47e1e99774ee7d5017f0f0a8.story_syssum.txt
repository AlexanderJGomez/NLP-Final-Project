(CNN) -- Myanmar announced Tuesday it will grant amnesty to 6,300 prisoners on Wednesday, one in a series of recent moves that could help the isolated nation normalize relations with Western nations including the United States.
"What's very clear is that (President) Thein Sein is willing to make more concessions in order to get sanctions lifted and get more international legitimacy," Farmaner said.
Myanmar, ruled by generals since 1962, denied for decades that political prisoners even existed.
"Now I think it would be fair to say the elections themselves were flawed in many critical ways, and we have continuing concerns about a number of developments inside the country," Campbell, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, said Monday in a lecture in Bangkok, Thailand.
Tint Swe, the head of Myanmar's state censorship, called Friday for greater press freedoms, saying his own office should be shuttered as part of government reforms, reported Radio Free Asia.
Myanmar and Western nations have been at odds for years because of Myanmar rulers' ongoing clampdown on their political foes, most notably Suu Kyi.
Farmaner of Burma Campaign UK said the government's talks with Suu Kyi are also about self-preservation.
However, he said he is taken with the scope of the latest developments.
"It's important to them," Kurlantzick said.
Until they are included in dialogue, he said, Myanmar cannot make progress.
Lift some sanctions if you want to send a message of encouragement, he said.
