Russia maximized its deliveries of men and arms to East Ukraine in August and September to coincide with one peak of the crisis in Iraq.
It produced something resembling a plan for ISIS, and some palliatives for the next possible crisis in Eastern Europe by beefing up security in Poland and the Baltic States.
The threat of jihadis returning home, especially to the likes of the UK, is rightly of paramount concern.
And Russia's entire modus operandi, of which its current actions in Ukraine are only the most visible part, is not only a challenge to the European order, but a challenge that is dangerously exploiting the many existing problems within the EU.
Russia also wants Ukraine to fail.
But Russia clearly does not want that to happen.
And if Ukraine does fail to transform itself, it will be only one in a string of dysfunctional states ringing the EU.
Russia and Ukraine are locked together in a spiral of economic decline.
Ukraine also has a humanitarian crisis; the official estimate for IDPs by the UNHCR was already 445,000 by 10 November.
What happens in Ukraine is also crucial for what happens beyond Ukraine.
Russia Today's motto is "question more" -- not believe everything we say about Russia.
Specific propaganda messages about Russia or Ukraine are then buried in the post-modern melange.
But Ukraine has to get there first, with the risk of further crises and renewed conflict very real.
