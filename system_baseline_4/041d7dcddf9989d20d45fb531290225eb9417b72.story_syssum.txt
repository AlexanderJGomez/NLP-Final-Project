This time it's a hacker attack on various websites associated with Sony Pictures.
The attack, part of a campaign known as Sownage, was announced on Twitter and on the LulzSec website.
The accounts, presumably associated with any sort of registered activity on SonyPictures.com (or its subsidiaries or partners), contain information like passwords, email addresses, dates of birth and other Sony opt-in data.
LulzSec says that all of the information it took was unencrypted.
We can only hope the most recent cyber attacks convince executives to think seriously about investing in online security.
