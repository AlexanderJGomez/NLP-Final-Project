Geoffrey Portway pleaded guilty in May to distribution and possession of child pornography and solicitation to commit a crime of violence, according to court documents.
Portway went by the moniker "Fat Longpig" during his online chats, according to court documents.
Authorities also found a locked basement, court documents show.
But he added, "There's no evidence at all of Geoffrey being involved with any child or harming any child."
"Geoffrey lived in a fantasy world where he did live-action role playing, did things online unrelated to child porn and cannibalism.
Photographs reviewed by CNN show handcuffs, rope intended for bondage, mouth gags, and castration tools.
"Portway's collection is truly chilling and demonstrates a real risk based upon which the Court should sentence Portway to a substantial term of years in order to protect the public," prosecutors said.
