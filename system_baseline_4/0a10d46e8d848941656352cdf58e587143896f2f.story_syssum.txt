KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai said Sunday that his country would join the strategic review of the U.S.-led war on terrorism.
"President Obama and Secretary Clinton and the United States government were very gratified to hear President Karzai reaffirm his support of the August 20 decision," Holbrooke said.
"U.S. forces will not be able to leave soon in Afghanistan because the task is not over," Karzai said.
At the same time, Karzai said the actions of troops currently in Afghanistan have turned some of the public against them.
"We'll continue to be a friend.
What should have happened early on didn't unfortunately happen," Karzai said.
Defense Secretary Robert Gates has said the original mission in Afghanistan was "too broad" and needs to be more "realistic and focused" for the United States to succeed.
Speaking via satellite from Kabul, Karzai called former President George Bush "a great person," but said he can work with Obama -- despite the president's comments as a candidate that Karzai had "not gotten out of the bunker" to improve security and infrastructure in Afghanistan.
"Sure, corruption in the Afghan government is as much there as in any other third world country," he said.
He said a government department has been created to deal with corruption and that corrupt judges, administrators and other officials are dismissed "daily" over corruption charges.
