(CNN) -- Shortly after President Obama tapped Stanley McChrystal in June 2009 to be the top commander in Afghanistan, CNN reported that McChrystal would never let a reporter in the room during classified morning meetings he led among senior military officers.
On Tuesday, McChrystal flew from Afghanistan to Washington.
The journalist writes that an unnamed aide to McChrystal mocks Vice President Joe Biden.
"Who's that?
McChrystal hasn't denied the article's accuracy.
In 2009, Defense Secretary Robert Gates asked for the resignation of Gen. David D. McKiernan, the former U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan.
McChrystal would have "fresh eyes on the problem" in Afghanistan, Gates said at the time.

And that is why I say you have to immerse yourself in it and understand it before you can confidently assess it," he told Time.
The Times reported that McChrystal thrives on a few hours of sleep a night and often eats only one meal a day.
He said he was sorry for his role in the way the Pentagon handled Pat Tillman's death.
Tillman's mother said last year that McChrystal knew at her son's memorial service that he had died of friendly fire, but did not tell the family.
She said McChrystal was "lying."
The Army did not take action against McChrystal.
