Atlanta, Georgia (CNN)  -- The next time a married man or woman glances your way, you might think twice before acting on impulse and frolicking between satin sheets.
They're known as "alienation of affection" suits, when an "outsider" interferes in a marriage.
"If your spouse is going to cheat, you really would like them to cheat with somebody who has a lot of money," says Lee Rosen, a North Carolina divorce attorney who deals with alienation of affection cases on a daily basis.
It doesn't matter that Woods lives in Florida, a state where the suits aren't allowed, legal experts say.
"If he had been dating a married woman, there could be the potential for a lucrative recovery," Rosen says.
"When folks are getting divorced, the threat of having the person's new boyfriend, girlfriend, husband or wife dragged into court and the dirty laundry aired ... causes enormous pressure," says Matt Steffey, a law professor at Mississippi College School of Law.
He's married with five children.
The real doozy came July 14, when Leisha Pickering filed the alienation of affection suit against her husband's alleged lover, a socialite named Elizabeth Creekmore-Byrd.
Most states have abolished alienation of affection lawsuits.
But, Steffey and Rosen say, alienation of affection suits do just the opposite: They result in already contentious divorces getting even more heated, and they leave behind a public trail of personal shortcomings and wild tales of infidelity.
"It's a very delicate matter legislatively," Steffey says.
There is one way to avoid such suits: Respect marital vows.
