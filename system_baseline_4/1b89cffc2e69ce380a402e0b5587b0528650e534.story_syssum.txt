At the front of this particular line Thursday, Steve Wozniak sits in a Pico armchair, sipping Diet Dr Pepper and scanning e-mails from his white iPad.
"I'll be taking a thousand pictures," Wozniak whispered with a smile.
"Now your phone is not going to be worth as much when you sell it," Wozniak said to one woman before signing her iPhone 4.
Wozniak acknowledged that he could have easily made one phone call to Apple and gotten the phone he's waiting in line for, but he didn't.
"I want to get mine along with the millions of other fans," Wozniak said.
Wozniak said that he is usually further back in line at these events but that fans in front of him insist that he get his devices first.
Wozniak arrived about noon, and he plans to stay overnight in order to get the new iPhone first, he said.
He first met Wozniak last year in line at a nearby store during the launch of the original iPad.
Wozniak said he had already ordered two iPhones to be delivered to his home; he's in line to buy one for his wife.
"The line is doing nicely," Wozniak said after surveying the area.
David Gandy, a furniture designer who is looking to change jobs, said he came to soak up some inspiration from Wozniak.
" said one fan, who had her picture taken with Wozniak.
Wozniak quipped, "It's the one show I like on TV."
