(CNN)When photographer Fabio Bucciarelli first visited South Sudan, he found a nation filled with hope.
Instead of jubilant faces of hope, he saw defeated faces haunted by a return of ghosts of past wars.
He described the violence in South Sudan as an "invisible" conflict.
"It's hard to find front-line war photography of the kind we've seen in Libya or Syria," Bucciarelli said.
"The images in South Sudan are different.
"South Sudan's war represents one of the longest and most forgotten African conflicts," he said.
South Sudan split from Sudan in 2011 as part of a peace deal that ended decades of war in Africa's largest nation.
Concerned neighboring nations have stepped in and urged warring parties to sign ceasefire deals, but the weapons have not gone quiet.
Fabio Bucciarelli is an Italian photographer whose work focuses on conflict and war.
