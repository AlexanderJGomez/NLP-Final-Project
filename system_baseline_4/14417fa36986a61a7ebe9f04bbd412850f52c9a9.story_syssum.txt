Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Thousands packed Havana's Revolution Square on Saturday for International Workers' Day, drawing hordes of Cuban demonstrators, spectators, and trade unionists from around the world -- including the United States and the United Kingdom.
Since then, neither Castro has made a major speech on May Day.
In February, dissident Orlando Zapata Tamayo, who was jailed in 2003 during a crackdown on political opposition, died after a hunger strike that lasted for more than 80 days.
Saturday marked the second International Workers' Day since U.S. President Obama took office.
Saturday's May Day march began around 8 a.m. and lasted roughly two hours without incident.
