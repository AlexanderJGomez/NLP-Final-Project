This comes on the same day that astronomers and news reporters alike were turning their attention to a 40 meter asteroid -- known as 2012 DA14 -- which is due for a close approach with Earth on Friday evening.
And yet it just goes to show how much space debris exists up there above our heads.
But some are known to move away from this region, either due to collisions with other asteroids or the gravitational pull of a planet.
Traveling through the sky at a few kilometers per second, friction with the air can cause the meteor to break up into several pieces.
If any of the fragments make it to the ground, only then are they called meteorites.
The Earth is sprinkled with around 170 craters also caused by debris falling from space.
It is precisely this sort of work that led to the discovery of asteroid 2012 DA14 last February by a team of Spanish astronomers.
This latest meteor over Russia just goes to show how important such work is and how crucial it is that we keep our eye on the sky.
