At last, with "Brave," it's the girls' turn to shine -- a bit behind the curve in this year of the Warrior Princess.
Merida (voiced by Kelly Macdonald) is the eldest child to Fergus (Connolly) and Elinor (Emma Thompson).
Merida fits right in line with the dynamic damsels we have seen recently in warring "Snow White" films, "John Carter" and "The Hunger Games."
But Merida has her own ideas about that, and storms out in search of some means to change her mum's mind.
Appealing as this left-field plot twist is, it's also daft.
Pixar likes to boast that it's all about the story, but this tall tale has more holes than a draughty sporran.
It's sure to appeal to the wee bairns -- and their mams too.
