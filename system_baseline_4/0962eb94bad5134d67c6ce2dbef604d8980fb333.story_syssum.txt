"She was very pleasant, very nice, very friendly and quiet," Cattaneo said, looking across the street.
James Clark, homicide commanding officer, said at a news conference Tuesday morning that Ketunuti, a 35-year-old physician, apparently was strangled.
It was her dog walker, police said, who discovered her smoldering body.
In 2008, Ketunuti moved from Washington to Philadelphia, where she was a pediatrics resident at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.
Across the street from Ketunuti's house, another neighbor who did not want to be identified was visibly upset at the news of her death.
the neighbor said.
The neighbor said Ketunuti was often seen running long distances, and returning home with groceries, that she had very few visitors, and that Ketunuti spent a significant amount of time at the hospital.
"It's very unfortunate that she died in this manner."
She had been at the hospital for five years, the statement said, and had also served as a resident in the Department of Pediatrics.
Her death will have a profound impact on those who worked with her and we will all miss her deeply."
