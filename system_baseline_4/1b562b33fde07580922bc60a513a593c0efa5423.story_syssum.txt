(CNN) -- Since a temporary radiologic technologist was accused of stealing drugs from a New Hampshire hospital and giving patients hepatitis C through infected syringes, troubling reports of his past have emerged -- casting a spotlight on the staffing industry as a whole.
The health care industry was especially affected by the economic downturn in recent years, said American Staffing Association spokesman Steve Berchem.
"Many health care professionals were seeking the flexibility that contract work allowed and were leaving hospitals with vacancies," Berchem said.
But those temporary employees play an important role in hospitals, Berchem said.
Berchem said hospitals that do not use temporary workers tend to have more negative patient outcomes because they have fewer staffing resources overall.
Cullen reportedly was hired at a number of hospitals during his career in spite of what officials said was a questionable employment record.
And the director of the Arizona Radiation Regulatory Agency said officials stopped their investigation when Kwiatkowski moved out of state.
Scott Schnierer, vice president of business development for Comforce Staffing Services, said that most staffing firms conduct a seven-year background check on potential employees.
If there is a problem with an employee, hospitals are asked to report it to the staffing firm, he said.
Either party can take disciplinary action.
And it's not just a problem for staffing firms.
"Many employers are fearful of litigation and will verify employment dates only," Berchem said.
