Philip Seymour Hoffman was an actor who could be anybody.
...
Hoffman was found dead Sunday.
For years, Hoffman was the kind of anonymous character actor who earned critical raves but was often unnoticed by the general public.
"One of the finest actors of his generation," he wrote in his review of the 2012 staging of "Death of a Salesman" -- even while finding Hoffman miscast in that production.
Character actors -- and Hoffman, for all his intensity, was a character actor -- support movie stars.
In some respects he followed the path of one of his heroes, Paul Newman, who had looks and magnetism to burn but wasn't shy about taking "character" parts, such as a broken-down lawyer in "The Verdict" or a ne'er-do-well in "Nobody's Fool."
The latter featured Newman acting opposite Hoffman, as did the HBO miniseries "Empire Falls."
Where Johansson is relaxed, Hoffman is intense; where Johansson is helpful, Hoffman is wily.
If I talk about them in the press, I'm giving them no choice.
Wright worked with Hoffman in "Moneyball" and the forthcoming "A Most Wanted Man."
"Great" is an all-too-appropriate word, as Hoffman himself used it when expressing his goals.
Given his work and the circumstances of his death, a line from the 2008 New York Times Magazine profile seems more haunting today.
