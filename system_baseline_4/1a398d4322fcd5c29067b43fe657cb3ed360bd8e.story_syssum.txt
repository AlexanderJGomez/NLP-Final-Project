To be fair, Christie faced a dilemma: Either admit to creating a climate of bullying, intimidation and political payback that led to the George Washington Bridge scandal, or claim that his staff and appointees disrupted traffic on the world's busiest bridge as political punishment without his knowledge.
Schnook.
A schnook is a victim, and Chris Christie is not convincing playing the victim.
It won't.
But not with the Chris Christie bridge-closing scandal: This one's gonna stick.
This is the most important factor in determining whether a miscue becomes a scandal and whether a scandal becomes a permanent taint.
Every public figure has a master narrative.
As The New York Times reported, as governor, Christie has a remarkable pattern of bullying: stripping former Gov.
If, as it appears, Christie's appointees and staff forced New Jerseyans to suffer through a four-hour traffic jam because their mayor -- a Democrat -- had the temerity to back the Democratic candidate opposing Christie's re-election, it doesn't just feed the image of a bully; it cements it.
More important -- and more ominous, for Christie -- she declared, "I am waiting -- and hopefully with the support of Assemblyman (and Deputy Speaker John) Wisniewski -- that the subpoena power will continue."
There are almost certainly going to be lawsuits from aggrieved commuters, which will put folks under oath.
If the governor of South Dakota closed the Chief Standing Bear Bridge, which connects South Dakota to Nebraska, most of the national media would not know or care.
The truth is there is not much Christie can do about these three dynamics.
Soon he will return to attacking the press and Democrats.
If you believe Bullygate is going away anytime soon, there's a bridge in Fort Lee I'd like to sell you.
