WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Obama declared Monday that his stimulus plan is "starting to work" and that 2,000 transportation projects -- costing much less than expected -- are under way.
"Our recovery dollars can go further, and we can do more projects," said Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said.
"Some may have thought it would have taken months to get to this point," Obama said, "but we have approved these projects in just 41 days."
Obama said the highway projects from the stimulus bill will create or save 150,000 jobs by the end of next year.
"Today, I think it's safe to say that this plan is beginning to work," the president said.
