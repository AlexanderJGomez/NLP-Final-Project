Natalie Dylan, 22, said she has put her virginity up for auction through the Moonlite Bunny Ranch.
But as to why men would bid so much money on virginity, she said she has no answer.
"I honestly don't know what they see in it," she said.
There's no right or wrong to this."
In early civilizations, women were also considered the property of men, said Laura Carpenter, assistant professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee.
Today, about 95 percent of Americans have sex before they're 25, Carpenter said.
Dylan said she was inspired by a report of a Peruvian woman who put her virginity up for sale.
Some think Dylan's auction may be indicative of a shift in the way society treats sexuality.
Kiara Daines, a 17-year-old from Detroit, Michigan, said she's saving herself until marriage for personal and religious reasons.
Many people say losing one's virginity has different implications for men than women.
The importance of a woman's virginity may vary in different cultures, but generally there's not the high value there used to be, Ray said.
Dylan, who said she was raised in a conservative, non-Christian religious household, said although her mother doesn't agree with her, she still loves her as a daughter.
Honestly, even if I didn't do this, I'd always be the girl who thinks prostitution is OK," she said.
