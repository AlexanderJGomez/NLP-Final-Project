"The crickets have been thick for a couple of days now," he said Wednesday.
It's pretty gross."
"There are always a few crickets around in the summertime, but never a swarm like this," he said.
Got crickets?
"I suppose if you have 10,000 dead crickets staring at you, they might seem like a plague," he said.
This year, Grantham said, a weather pattern of prolonged dryness followed by rainfall in July and August may be to blame.
While the crickets are not considered an agricultural pest, Grantham said they are definitely a problem when they swarm, especially in commercial areas with bright security lights.
The chirping bugs may have appeared a few weeks earlier this year than last, said Brian Jervis, Tulsa County Extension Horticulturalist.
He knows because he has personally observed them.
Jervis said he is seeing an increase in calls from people wanting to know what to do about crickets.
Grantham said crickets will eat just about anything, including plant material and each other.
Grantham said to give it another week, but some Oklahomans would say the sooner, the better.
