These are some of the hard-to-stomach images that the Obama administration has shown a select group of senators in closed-door briefings to make the case that a limited military attack on Syria is justified.
CNN was the first to obtain the 13 different videos seen by members of the Senate Intelligence Committee that depict the gruesome scene of an chemical weapons attack in Syria on August 21.
"That video will sensitize the American people that this isn't just an intervention, that this is a military strike to stop that type of atrocity," the former congressman told CNN.
Hours after CNN obtained and broadcast portions of the videos, the Senate Intelligence Committee posted them on its website for public viewing.
"There's no question about that.
The availability of these videos obtained by CNN means that anyone can see at least part of the administration's evidence and come to their own conclusions.
The video captures at least six rows of adults with no less than four bodies each.
CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the videos.
