When Barack Obama was a newbie president, there was no shortage of ambition or lack of confidence in the government he was about to lead.
President Obama was convinced he could change all that with programs that would deliver for America—such as health care reform—and the public would be grateful.
All of which makes you wonder: Does the President himself trust government anymore?
"If people can't trust not only the executive branch but also don't trust Congress ... to make sure that we're abiding by the Constitution ..." he said, "then we're going to have some problems here."
Indeed.
What seems to be  missing is the in-between: the continual monitoring and early warning system that avoids presidential blindsiding.
That's the area in which most of the business of government actually gets done.
Government is unwieldy and difficult and hard to tame, sure.
He's top dog, he's not negotiating with anybody, and he's not trying to get people to do things they don't want to do.
And if a chief executive isn't careful, it's an energy-sapping (and legacy endangering) vortex that sucks you right in.
Does he still feel that way today?
"I can't go back to yesterday," she said, "because I was a different person then."
