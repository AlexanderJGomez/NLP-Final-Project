(CNN) -- How much is playing the same video game for a month worth?
2K Sports, the publisher of the game, said they verified more than 2,500 perfect games and used an algorithm to rank perfect games based on degree of difficulty and perfection.
Chavarria said he played the game for about 30 days before finally getting a perfect game that qualified him for the playoffs.
Chavarria, who was a pitcher in high school and for one year in college, said having a pitcher's mentality helped him devise a game plan against the batters.
"They've got guys who can hit home runs against lefties and righties," he said.
"Their pitching is not bad."
Chavarria added another home run later in the game, and his pitching kept Holland's A's off balance as he won 3-1.
"Just keep playing.
You just never know."
