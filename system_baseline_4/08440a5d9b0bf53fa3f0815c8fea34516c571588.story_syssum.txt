Only women will be allowed into the distributions sites to collect the food, WFP said.
The distribution sites will be set up with proper security, making it difficult for those not entitled to receive food to enter, he said.
"It is the most complex challenge we have ever confronted, but this distribution system will not only allow us to reach more people, it will give us the qualitative step we need to facilitate the delivery of all kinds of humanitarian assistance in the weeks and months to come," WFP Executive Director Josette Sheeran said in a statement from Rome, Italy.
The distribution will begin early Sunday.
Multinational troops, including the U.S. military, will help secure food convoys and the distribution sites, Prior said.
