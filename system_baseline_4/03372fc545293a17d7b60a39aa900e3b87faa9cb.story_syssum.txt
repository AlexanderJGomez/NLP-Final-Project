Lidia Schaefer sold her house and car and set aside tips and part of her salary to raise money for the school.
Do you know a hero?
"I don't work with my head," she says.
The motivation to fulfill her promise came with the news of Medhine's death.
"That really pushed me to do it," she says, "to build a school so that wouldn't happen again."

But Schaefer realized it wouldn't be enough.
"I want [the children] to learn, to get something out of their life."
Schaefer ultimately raised more than $250,000 for the school, which was completed in 2006.
Though she'd hoped to name the school in memory of Medhine, the government -- which runs the school -- instead named it the Lidia Secondary School, telling Schaefer, "We want it to be your name so that more people [will] be like you."
Schaefer still sets aside her tips and wages to support her school and has kept up her fundraising efforts to buy supplies.
Her colleagues and clients say Schaefer serves as an important reminder that people don't need money or power to make a difference.
"I've learned from Lidia that even if the project is big, if your heart is in it, you can do it."
