Wishing Merry #Christmas to those celebrating, esp Iranian Christians," said a tweet from the official account of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.
However, Israel and some U.S. legislators warn that Iran was manipulating President Barack Obama's administration and its allies in the talks without intending to truly give up its quest for a nuclear weapon.
Merry Christmas," said a post on his account.
Iranian leaders have offered Christmas messages in the past citing the teachings of Jesus, who is considered a prophet in Islam.
At the opening of the U.N. General Assembly that same month, Rouhani promised that Iran had the political will to reach nuclear agreement with the United States and its allies.
The Christmas tweets continued the Iranian outreach, this time joined by Khamenei , whose account included multiple tweets that implied Jesus might side with Iran against what he has in the past criticized as Western imperialism.
Just the existence of official accounts for Rouhani and Khamenei makes them authoritative in a nation where Twitter and other social media websites such as Facebook and YouTube are controlled and limited.
In an interview with CNN in September, Iranian Tourism Minister Mohammad-Ali Najafi said he expected more openness to social media under Rouhani, a close political ally.
