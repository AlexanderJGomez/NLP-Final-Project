NEW YORK (CNN) -- Ben Folds didn't realize how great his music was until he heard a bunch of college students singing it.
And so an idea was born: Folds would travel to university campuses around the country and record an entire album of a cappella covers.
"It's a completely different point of view," says Folds, 42, of the students' renderings of his tunes.
Ben Folds spoke to CNN about his youthful-sounding new release, why being married four times isn't much of a drama and why he faked an album leak.
Ben Folds: I think it naturally kind of is.
...
I mean these guys, they'd just do a live take and they just don't know that the pros don't do it that way.
Folds: We kept them in what I would say is their natural habitat.
Folds: I'm not sure what that is.
There's always something new.
Folds: Well, I think that we get very uptight when it comes time to record because there's a process, an imminent process that has to do with just selling the record, mostly.
So while I thought it was funny, I really liked the idea of going into the studio and making six songs in one day.
I think things were kind of cool.
Folds: Well, it wasn't a lot of drama, really.
...
Folds: Yeah, that's heavy, dude.
Folds: Oh, that too.
