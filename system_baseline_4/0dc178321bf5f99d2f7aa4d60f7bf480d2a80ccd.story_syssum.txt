"Being responsible - that's going to be the most difficult fight in my life," Tyson told CNN's Rachel Nichols for her Unguarded series.
"I've never been responsible before.
Tyson, who is married to Kiki, his third wife, and has fathered eight children, is determined to focus on his family and a new generation of young boxers after a high-profile and controversial career.
A teenage Tyson, by now spending time in a reform school, found an exit when his talents in the ring were spotted by respected trainer Cus D'Amato.
"I don't like that time in my life," Tyson continued.
During the duo's second heavyweight title bout in 1997, Tyson chewed off a chunk of Holyfield's ear.
Commenting on the so-called "bite fight" Tyson said: "Even though I was an undisciplined it was the only way I could get any kind of relief.
"I'm accomplishing so much and getting so much done now as a human being, than I could've ever done back then in the prime of my fighting career," he explained.
Tyson, under the umbrella of Iron Mike Productions, is now working as a promoter for a batch of promising young boxers.
"I'll give them the best advice I possibly can," said Tyson.
Out of the ring, Tyson, with his trademark black tattoo arcing over his left eye, is looking for responsibility and perhaps even redemption at last.
