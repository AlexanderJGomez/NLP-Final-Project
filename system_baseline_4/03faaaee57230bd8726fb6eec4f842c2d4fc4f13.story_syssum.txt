(CNN) -- Wednesday's decision by the U.S. Patent Office to repeal six federal trademarks of the Washington Redskins on the grounds that the name is "disparaging to Native Americans" is, of course, a victory for the Native American community and our allies.
Should team owner Dan Snyder's appeal to the U.S. Patent Office fail, then we can celebrate even louder -- and even louder when the name is changed.
Members of Congress, local D.C. officials, celebrities, media commentators and even former Washington Redskins like cornerback Champ Bailey have spoken out against the team name and urged Snyder to relent and change the name.
On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, speaking on the capitol floor in response to the trademark repeal, said, "This is extremely important to Native Americans all over the country that they no longer use this name.
Yet this issue is bigger than the Washington Redskins.
The Washington team may be threatened by the very real possibility that it will have to change its name in the near future, but that doesn't let the Cleveland Indians off the hook, or the Atlanta Braves, for that matter.
Empirical study has proven that Indian mascots harm the mental health of Native American children.
But that's not quite accurate.
Harjo and even the late American Indian Movement leader Russell Means fought against the name as well as all manner of Indian mascotry for decades.
It's not that names matter more, it's that when we talk about death rates, rape and epidemics in Indian country we don't always get a response.
