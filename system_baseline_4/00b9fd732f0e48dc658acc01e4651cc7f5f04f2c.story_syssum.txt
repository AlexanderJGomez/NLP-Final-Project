(CNN) -- Jeff Yeager says the economic downturn is an opportunity for people to simplify their lives and be content with less.
Yeager talked with Heidi Collins on Tuesday on "CNN Newsroom."
Collins: All right.
Yeager: You are a sister of the cheaphood.
And again, I don't really talk about a life of sacrifice.
I'm not saying that's unimportant.
Collins: OK. Wow.
Yeager: If these things apply to your family.
Collins: OK.
Yeager: Give up the cellulite life.
I've got to push back for a second, because a lot of people will tell you you can be happier with a cell phone because you're out of the office and you're with your family more, still able to still do business.
Yeager: We can debate all that, but 10 or 15 years ago, none of us had it, and nothing awful happened.
Collins: Wow.
Collins: OK. Give up meals prepared outside your home.
You can cut that by 80 percent by cooking those same meals at home and you know, maybe recapture some family time around the dinner table.
All right, you also say quit shopping for new clothes.
Yeager: Yes.
Yeager: And again, less than 2 percent of the clothes we throw away are worn out.
Collins: All right.
Yeager: This is a big one, you know?
Now, of course, most kids go away to school, take out student loans.
Let's skip the money step!
