(CNN) -- Citizens of the Ivory Coast headed to the polls Sunday for a repeatedly delayed presidential election -- the first in a decade for the top cocoa-producing west African nation.
The election also features the nation's first female presidential candidate, Jacquline Oble, who was the youngest minister in the previous Cabinet.
U.S. President Barack Obama said the nation's citizens are entitled to a fair election.
