The battle over health care reform has energized people on both sides of the debate.
Acknowledging the skepticism at a town hall meeting Tuesday, Obama tried to alleviate fears that reform would take something away.
You will have not only the care you need, but also the care that right now is being denied to you, only if we get health care reform.
"I think that's the fear," said Diana Owen, an associate professor of political science and the director of American studies at Georgetown University.
And those who have sufficient health care coverage worry they'll have to foot the bill for reform, echoing concerns heard during the presidential campaign that Obama would "spread the wealth around."
"I really do think that it was an issue, and I think the opponents of the health care plan, by bringing that back up again ...
"It's not anti-reform -- it's anti-bad reform," Cannon said.
Obama's health care battle has been compared to former President Clinton's failed effort more than 15 years ago, but lawmakers didn't experience the same backlash during the Clinton years.
Coming out of one of her town hall meetings Monday, Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, said that "people are just getting information that's flat wrong."
"I don't think that this is debate that is going to go away," Owen said, noting that given the outpouring seen at the town hall meetings, Congress can't just pick up where it left off when it returns from break.
