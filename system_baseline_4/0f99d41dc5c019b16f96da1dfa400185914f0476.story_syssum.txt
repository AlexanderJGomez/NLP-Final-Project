"The discrimination we're talking about has been well-documented," said attorney Stephen Hill, who represents the Latino farmers.
The class could have included 20,000 farmers, the government said in court.
The Justice Department also is not interested in settling the case, government attorney Lisa Ann Olson told a federal district court judge in an August hearing.
The Latino farmers note that African-Americans who filed an identical discrimination lawsuit against the government in 1997 were granted class-action status and have been awarded about $1 billion in settlements to 15,000 farmers.
The farmers also point out that former Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman testified before Congress in 1997 that the USDA had a long history of discrimination.
Carillo said he applied for a USDA loan after devastating floods in 1995 but was denied.
