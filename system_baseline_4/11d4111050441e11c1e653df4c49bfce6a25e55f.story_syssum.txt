The wireless giant announced a multibillion-dollar deal to purchase rights to largely unused spectrum, which is like an open lane on the congested wireless Internet highway.
AT&T made a similarly surprising move in March, declaring its intention to buy T-Mobile, in large part to get access to T-Mobile's underused spectrum.
Unlike the proposed AT&T/T-Mobile merger, Verizon's acquisition doesn't involve taking millions of subscribers from a competitor, thereby increasing concentration in the wireless market.
If Washington were so inclined, it could free up a ton of spectrum for more valuable uses.
(We're talking tens of billions here.)
So AT&T and Verizon, the No.
The upshot is that it's far from self-evident that AT&T would remain first in subscribers for long in a post-merger market.
And neither apparently puts much weight on AT&T's need for additional spectrum if it is to offer viable competition for Verizon in a 4G world.
AT&T and Verizon are living in uncertain times in which they must run to stay in place.
The first is to limit what firms like Verizon and AT&T can do to improve their service offerings, slowing the rollout of 4G.
Does that mean giving AT&T and Verizon free passes?
