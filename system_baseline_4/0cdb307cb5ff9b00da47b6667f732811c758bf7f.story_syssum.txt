(CNN) -- The ambulance sped toward Baton Rouge, Louisiana, from the New Orleans airport, overrun with refugees from a drowned city.
Five minutes into the ride, Prepas delivered the first twin with no problem.
Today, five years after delivering those twins in the midst of the chaos that Katrina wreaked, Prepas dwells -- not on the death and destruction that was so well-documented -- but on the life that emerged.
She went to Ghana, Namibia and Zimbabwe in the 1990s to teach midwives in those African countries how best to deal with emergencies.
"I had never in my life seen such a disaster as I had in New Orleans," Prepas says.
"There were two policemen and two security guards," Prepas says.
"There was no organization.
Prepas set up a privacy sheet in the tent and prepared a cot.
On that same day, the woman pregnant with twins was brought to the airport.
Prepas still doesn't know how the woman got there.
The paramedics radioed a hospital in Baton Rouge to let them know they were bringing a woman in labor with twins.
Two more weeks passed before that mother and her babies were reunited with the rest of their family.
Prepas has curtailed most of her overseas humanitarian missions; she now flies mostly to places in need within the U.S. -- the quake in Haiti being an exception.
"Women are going to have babies out of place," especially during disaster, she says.
It drives me to keep wanting to do all this stuff.
