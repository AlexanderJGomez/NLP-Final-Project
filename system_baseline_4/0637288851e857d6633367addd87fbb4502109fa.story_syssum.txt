Maharaj."
It was October 1986, when police arrested Maharaj -- an international food importer and newspaper owner -- in the shooting deaths of his business partners, Derrick Moo Young and his 23-year-old son.
Despite having an alibi, Maharaj was charged with murdering the Moo Youngs because they allegedly had cheated him out of more than $400,000.
A hearing was held in November to determine whether new evidence from Maharaj's lawyers "undermines confidence in the verdict," according to court documents.
"The Moo Youngs were laundering money for the Colombian cartels," the defense motion said.
An ex-cartel member confirmed that "Maharaj was not involved in the murders of the Moo Youngs, and that they had to be eliminated because they had lost Colombian drug money," according to the defense motion.
Maharaj said he was there for a meeting, but departed before the Moo Youngs were killed.
Maharaj told CNN's "Death Row Stories" that he left the hotel and drove 25 miles to Fort Lauderdale to have lunch with one of his newspaper employees.
Five other witnesses came forward saying Maharaj was with them on the day of the murders, "Death Row Stories" reported.
