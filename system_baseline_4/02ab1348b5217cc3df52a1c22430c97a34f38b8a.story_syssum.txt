While Kerry has made the peace process his priority since taking office, his focus has been challenged by the civil war in Syria, nuclear negotiations with Iran and, now, Russian moves against Ukraine.
"There are limits to the amount of time and effort that the United States can spend if the parties themselves are unwilling to take constructive steps in order to be able to move forward," Kerry said.
Kerry said "neither party has said that they've called it off."
Even if both sides are willing to mark time for another month, it's clear the peace process is on life support.
While Kerry isn't ready to pull the plug entirely, he said the United States would "evaluate what is possible and what is not possible," suggesting Washington may recalibrate its role as broker of the peace process as a result.
