Harry Nicolaides was arrested last August over a 2005 book called "Verisimilitude," which includes a paragraph about the king and crown prince that the authorities deemed a violation of the Lese Majeste law.
"It's been an ordeal for months.
After hearing his verdict Nicolaides said: "I wish my family the best."
CNN has chosen not to repeat the allegations made by Nicolaides because it could result in CNN staff being prosecuted in Thailand.
"I think there are individuals who have exploited an obscure law for their own self-interest," he said.
The law Nicolaides was convicted of breaking is section 112, known as the Lese Majeste law.
"There are cases in the past where this law has been abused for political purposes, and I agree this has to stop," he said.
