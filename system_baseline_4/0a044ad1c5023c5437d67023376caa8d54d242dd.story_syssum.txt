Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Protests broke out Friday throughout Northern Ireland against a decision by Belfast City Council members to stop flying the Union flag year-round.
Amid rain and temperatures just above freezing, police brought in two water cannon, deploying one of them to push back the rioters.
In all, four police officers were hurt, with one requiring hospital treatment, and two people were arrested, police said.
It was lowered at the end of the day.
Northern Ireland authorities have accused loyalist extremists of exploiting the decision by Belfast officials to end the century-old tradition of flying the Union flag over City Hall 365 days a year.
The majority of Ireland gained independence in 1921 following two years of conflict.
Under the terms of the accord, groups on both sides dumped their weapons, and members of Sinn Fein, the political affiliate of the IRA, now work with pro-British politicians in Northern Ireland's power-sharing government.
