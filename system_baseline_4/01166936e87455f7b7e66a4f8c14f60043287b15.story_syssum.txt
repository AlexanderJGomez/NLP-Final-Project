"Yes, it is for sure, the promoter will not get a permit to hold the concert," National Police spokesman Saud Usman Nasution said Tuesday.
The report said that Indonesian Council of Ulema chairman Cholil Ridwan was urging Muslims not to attend the overtly sexy and controversial singer's upcoming concert in Jakarta.
Newspaper reports said more than 25,000 tickets were sold in the first two hours after the concert went on sale in March.
Ahead of the concert in late April, detractors called it "pornographic" and a promotion of homosexuality.
"Even adults can't see her performance, which is too homosexual and pornographic."
