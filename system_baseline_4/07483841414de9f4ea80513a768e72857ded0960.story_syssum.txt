(CNN)French police say two suspects in Wednesday's terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine are still on the loose after escaping onto the streets of Paris.
Police fanned out across France in an intense manhunt for the suspects, who were masked and dressed in black when they burst into the satirical magazine's office Wednesday, killing 12 people.
"Everything will be done to arrest (the attackers)," French President Francois Hollande said in a speech Wednesday night.
It's too soon to say whether the suspects were operating alone, CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said.
These developments come after at least two heavily armed men entered the Charlie Hebdo office in Paris' 11th district, close to Place de la Bastille, and opened fire, Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said.
"We were all evacuated to the roof.
Charlie Hebdo editor and cartoonist Stephane Charbonnier, known as "Charb," is among the dead in the attack, a police spokesman in the district where the office is located told CNN.
"Parisians will not be afraid," Klugman said.
Prime Minister Manuel Valls raised France's security to its highest level -- "attack alert" -- after the Charlie Hebdo bloodshed.
That means there will be reinforced security at media company offices, major stores, religious centers and on public transport, his office said in a statement.
Investigators will do a complete DNA work-up on the Citroen, including soil signatures that might suggest where the gunmen came from, a Western intelligence source briefed on the probe told CNN.
Thursday will be a national day of mourning for those killed in the attack, Hollande said.
Earlier cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed spurred protests and the burning of the magazine's office three years ago.
The attack on the magazine spurred a wave of support for the publication and its practices around France and the world.
