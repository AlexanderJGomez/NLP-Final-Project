(CNN) -- A body was recovered in the vicinity of a boat accident in the Delaware River, a Coast Guard spokeswoman said Friday.
We've never had a problem with this boat," said Chris Herschend.
Officials said people reacted quickly after the collision.
Police and Coast Guard vessels searched the river Thursday.
While the boat was in the river and waiting for help, it was hit by a barge, he said.
Alcohol tests on crew members came back negative, Sumwalt said.
Herschend said the company is investigating and assisting fire and police officials.
Herschend said the company is checking on whether the captain told people to jump off the boat moments before impact.
"Our first priority is the people on board," Herschend said.
The boat is upright on the bottom of the river, Blackburn said.
One passenger suffered a broken jaw, Gaitlin said.
In the interim, we have voluntarily suspended our Ride The Ducks operations nationwide.
