Thanks to improved technology, turning ocean water into freshwater is becoming more economically feasible.
Even in the United States, demand for water in drought-ravaged California and the desert Southwest is outpacing supply.
Most desalination technology follows one of two methods: distillation through thermal energy or the use of membranes to filter salt from water.
The amount of desalted water produced around the world has more than tripled since 2000, according to the Center for Inland Desalination Systems at the University of Texas at El Paso.
Israel, in an arid region with a coastline on the Mediterranean, meets half its freshwater needs through desalination.
One entrepreneur has even built an experimental solar desalination plant in California's San Joaquin Valley.
"When other freshwater sources are depleted, desalination will be our best choice," said Davis, a UTEP professor of engineering.
"The key question with ocean desalination is how much are you willing to pay for it?
"The cost for this water will be about double what it costs us to import water into San Diego," Yamada said.
Ultimately, experts say, municipalities will need to balance desalination projects with conservation and water from more traditional sources, such as rivers, reservoirs and recycled wastewater.
It's dependent on water to sustain that economy.
