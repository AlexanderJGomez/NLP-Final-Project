He also accused the Damascus regime of collaborating with al Qaeda militants against opponents both in Syria and in neighboring Iraq.
"I was at the top of the Syrian regime," Fares said in his first interview with a U.S.-based TV network since his defection.
"I tried during the last year and a half to convince the regime to change its treatment of the people," Fares added.
Photographs on Syrian government websites as well as from Fares' personal collection show that on more than one occasion, this native of the eastern city of Deir Ezzor reported directly to the Syrian president.
"The regime in Syria is a totalitarian regime and a dictatorship.
Syrian opposition leaders applauded the very public departure of such a high-ranking Syrian official because it clearly embarrasses and weakens the Damascus regime.
"But we cannot put him in a political position (in the opposition) ... no one will accept Tlas or Fares at the head of the movement," Ghalioun added.

"The Syrian regime felt threatened and felt that it, too, might fall," Fares recalled.
"The secret police were encouraging enthusiastic young people in Syria to go for jihad in Iraq and join al Qaeda," Fares continued.
One of these "safe havens," Fares said, was the Syrian border village of al Sukariya, near the border city of Abu Kamal.
Four years later, however, Fares claimed the American forces had in fact struck an al Qaeda training camp run by one of al-Assad's close relatives by marriage.
"This was a hiding place for al-Qaeda on the border with Iraq, and it was under the control of Assif Shawkat, the brother-in-law of the president," Fares said.
Fares went on to repeat a long-stated Syrian opposition accusation: that the Syrian government is staging al Qaeda-style attacks in Syria as a fear-mongering tactic.
There is still time," Fares said.
... History will curse you for the crimes you committed in Syria."
