"The confidence of the markets had been rattled," former BP CEO Tony Hayward said in his first interview since he resigned, indicating how close the company was to collapse.
"These were frightening days," current boss Bob Dudley told the BBC, which aired "BP: $30 Billion Blowout" on Tuesday.
"It is very difficult to hate a company," said Hayward, conceding BP contingency plans were inadequate.
Hayward said the company can restore the environment and jobs, but not the lives of those who died on the Deepwater Horizon.
Referencing his own earlier remarks about "culture of complacency," Reilly said, "all three companies we heard from displayed it," Reilly said.
On Monday, the commission reported that workers aboard the Deepwater Horizon were pushing to complete the well, but no "conscious decision" to cut corners on safety had been discovered.
The disaster began April 20 with an explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drill rig, which was completing the well for BP at the time of the blast.
"There seemed to be a compulsion to get this rig completed in that April 19, April 20 time period," Graham said Monday.
Charlie Williams, well engineering scientist, said his company uses at least three plugs during such a process, as compared to BP's one.
Its executive said the company learned some lessons from the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska and other situations.
BP and Halliburton have drawn criticism about flaws in cement that was poured to reinforce the well.
