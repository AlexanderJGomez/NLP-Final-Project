FORT CAMPBELL, Kentucky (CNN) -- The 101st Airborne's senior commander in effect ordered his soldiers Wednesday not to commit suicide, a plea that came after 11 suicides since January 1, two of them in the past week.
After nearly one soldier per week committed suicide at the post between January and mid-March, the Army instituted a suicide prevention program that "seemed to be having good effects" until last week, when two more suicides occurred, he said.
"Suicide is a permanent solution to what is only a temporary problem," Townsend said.
"Do not wait," he said.
But Townsend's message -- called a Second Suicide Stand-Down event -- is likely to be ineffective, said Dr. Mark Kaplan, a professor of community health at Portland State University in Oregon, who has researched veterans' suicide and served last year on a Veterans Administration blue-ribbon panel on suicide risk.
"It sounds like an order," he told CNN in a telephone interview.
Soldiers who acknowledge they are considering suicide can suffer severe repercussions, such as losing opportunities for promotion and access to firearms, he said.
The role of alcohol too must be addressed if the rate of suicide is to be lowered, he said.
Screening techniques that involve a series of questions are available to identify people at risk for suicide, he said.
The problem is not limited to Fort Campbell.
