They ought to put up a plaque where Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid delivered the tea partying Republicans their worst whipping in a generation.
The 15-day shutdown saw a deadly shooting at the Capitol, a self-immolation on the National Mall, a citizen waving the Confederate battle flag in front of the White House and World War II veterans storming one last barricade.
And, while our President undoubtedly triumphed -- showing a steely resolve that critics thought he lacked -- the undisputed heavyweight champion of the shutdown showdown is Reid.
While the House GOP conference exploded like the finale of a fireworks show, Reid held together a Senate Democratic Caucus that is significantly more diverse.
In the gym at Basic High in Henderson, Nevada, Reid learned to box.
Reid, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Obama are three very different kinds of leaders.
To be sure, no victory is ever final.
Reid understands that.
Then begin training for his next fight.
