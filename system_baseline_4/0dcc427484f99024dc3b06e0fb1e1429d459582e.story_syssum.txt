Babylon, Iraq (CNN)ISIS has smashed priceless ancient statues in Mosul, bulldozed the ruins of Nineveh and Hatra, and dynamited centuries-old churches, mosques and shrines.
One of Hussein's former palaces still peers down over the city.
"This wasn't Saddam's," said Adnan Abu Fatima.
Why?"
Why did you do that?"
Baghdad's museum was plundered, during a lapse in U.S. security, and the priceless artifacts were smuggled around the world.
Safa ad-Din Hassan and other parents took Iraqi scouts on a camping trip near Babylon to teach them about their history and make ancient artwork with them.
Iraq will defend its heritage against ISIS, said Mohamed Hattab from Iraq's Antiquities Department.
One man fired shots into the rubble toward Hussein's grave site.
It was a piece of history they were glad to part with.
