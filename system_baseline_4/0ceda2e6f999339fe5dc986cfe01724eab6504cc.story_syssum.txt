(CNN) -- Willie Nelson is the latest act to cancel a concert at Orlando's SeaWorld in the wake of CNN's "Blackfish" documentary.
SeaWorld spokesman Nick Gollattscheck confirmed Nelson's decision not to sing at SeaWorld, but he cited reasons other than the documentary and petition.
A park spokesman told CNN that the Barenaked Ladies show had been taken off the theme park's concert schedule.
Fans launched an online petition asking the Barenaked Ladies to cancel.
"We here at Barenaked Ladies have made a decision based on what we feel.
It's not about money, or petitions, or press...
Acts that are still listed on the calendar include Cheap Trick, REO Speedwagon, Martina McBride, 38 Special, Justin Moore and Scotty McCreery.
