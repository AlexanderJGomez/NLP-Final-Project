Many made political hay with the remark.
All mothers work, nearly all of the time.
Contradiction #1: Everyone seems to agree that women and men should have equal rights.
It is true today that sometimes, men do become stay-at-home dads, but even in the consciously feminist families I wrote about in my book, "Gender Vertigo," men share the "work" of raising their children; I didn't interview one man who described fatherhood as a career.
But research published in this month's American Sociological Review shows that women who breast-feed for six months or more pay a mommy penalty in wages for the rest of their lives because of the lack of work policies that protect employed women's right to breast-feed on the job.
Contradiction #4: Everyone seems to agree that when women married to men of means choose to be stay-at-home moms, they are doing so for the good of their children.
Why all these contradictions?
We have inherited both workplace cultures and beliefs from a time in our past when successful men had wives to take care of their homes and children.
Let's call a truce on the fictional mommy wars and start a war on workplaces that don't allow mommies and daddies to live full lives, on the job and at home.
