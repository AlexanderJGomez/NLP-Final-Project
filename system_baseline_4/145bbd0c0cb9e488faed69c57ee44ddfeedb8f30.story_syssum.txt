Jiverly Wong included photos of himself along with a letter, his gun permit, and driver's license.
The package was postmarked April 3, the day of the shooting at the American Civic Assocation in Binghamton where Wong parked his car blocking a back entrance and entered through the front door, shooting two receptionists and then more people in a classroom.
But the letter was dated more than two weeks earlier, March 18, indicating a troubled Wong had considered the act for some time.
And 32 times, he said, police drove in front of him and abruptly stopped.
He demanded that an "undercover cop" be held responsible for whatever happened and ended with "You have a nice day."
