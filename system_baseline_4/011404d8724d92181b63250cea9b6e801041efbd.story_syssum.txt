While President Obama has reignited a national conversation over rising college costs with his new proposals, those suggestions are unlikely to dramatically lower costs soon.
Students at prestigious schools like Oxford and Cambridge receive their degrees in three years, and they still get first-class jobs.
A less cost-saving variant of the three-year plan would keep the degree at its traditional 120 semester hour length, but have students go to school year-round for three years.
Faculty usually will teach additional courses for far less than the average pay per course taught regularly.
Second, make it possible for students to use MOOCs (massively open online courses) and other low-cost, online options, allowing for lower cost "blended" degrees combining perhaps two years of traditional classroom experience with an equal amount of online training.
Students need to be examined on the online material, with safeguards assuring the registered student is actually being tested.
Third, offer a traditional residential degree for 40% less by dramatically reducing labor and capital costs.
Why not create new universities with staffing near the 1970 norms -- a university without sustainability and diversity coordinators or an army of public relations specialists, where faculty teach extensively rather than do trivial research that no one reads, and where there are no expensive intercollegiate athletic programs for the amusement of non-students.
Do we really need courses on "Lady Gaga and the Sociology of Fame" taught to students who are clueless about  Beethoven, Shakespeare and van Gogh?
Fourth, create a National College Equivalence Test similar to the high school GED.
Fifth, get the federal government out of the student financial aid business.
If we implement the first four reforms, the need for student financial assistance will dramatically decline.
Ending these inefficient federal programs would save tens of billions annually.
