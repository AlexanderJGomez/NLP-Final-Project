Nicknamed the "accidental millionaire," Hui "Leo" Gao made headlines three years ago after he and his girlfriend fled the country when he accidentally received access to $10 million New Zealand dollars (U.S.$7 million).
In April of that year, Gao applied for overdraft financing for the gas station he co-owned with his mother in Rotorua, New Zealand, according to court records.
The next day, Gao discovered the error in his bank account and told his girlfriend, Kara Hurring that he was "fâ€”ing rich" and had millions of dollars, according to court documents.
After two and a half years on the run, Gao was arrested in Hong Kong in September 2011, and extradited to New Zealand in December.
Westpac, the Australian bank, recovered about $2.9 million from the couple's New Zealand accounts, but has yet to recoup the remaining $3.8 million.
The bank had no comment.
