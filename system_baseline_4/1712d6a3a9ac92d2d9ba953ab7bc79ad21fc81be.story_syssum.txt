Madeline Loftus, 24, was killed aboard Flight 3407.
She was returning to Buffalo State College to play in a reunion hockey game on Saturday, to meet up with her old classmates to play the game she loved so dearly.
Breaking down in tears, she said the game was filled with sadness because "Maddy wasn't here."
Her teammates said they decided to play the game out, because Loftus would've wanted them to play on.
Loftus, 24, of Parsippany, New Jersey, played two seasons at Buffalo State from 2002 to 2004 before transferring to St. Mary's University in Minnesota after her sophomore year.
She will always hold a special place in my heart," said Terry Mannor, St. Mary's women's hockey coach.
About 1,000 people gathered at a church in western New York Monday to remember the crash victims.
The community memorialized the 50 victims, with religious leaders from Christian, Jewish, Muslim and Hindu communities offering words of sympathy to the community.
• Beverly Eckert was the widow of Sean Rooney, who died in the World Trade Center in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
• Co-pilot Rebecca Shaw's father said she loved to fly and "couldn't believe she'd get paid" when she took the job.
On the ice rink in Buffalo Saturday, Loftus' friends played with a heavy heart.
Everybody loved being around her," said rink manager Jim Fowler.
"Her classmates were always eager to work with her on projects," said Thomas Marpe, dean of St. Mary's School of Business.
