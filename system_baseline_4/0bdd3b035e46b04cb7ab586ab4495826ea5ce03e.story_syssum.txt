Mutual assured destruction.
And as the political world shifts its focus from one national convention to the other, a sentiment has been building that this year's presidential campaign may turn out to be the dirtiest ever.
Jim Rutenberg, in The New York Times, under the headline "The Lowest Common Denominator and the 2012 Race for President," wrote last month: "The thinking was that the two presidential candidates, both with Harvard degrees, would finally use their intellectual prowess to discuss the nation's challenges seriously."
That, he wrote, is looking like an unrealistic expectation, and thus "Strategists on both sides are pondering which campaign is best served by the vitriol."
... One effect of such early negativity is that both candidates figure to be battered by November, and voters could become fatigued earlier."
Some of the findings of the poll: Voters are critical of both candidates for making unfair attacks on each other.
When, in 2008, potential voters were asked if both candidates would make good presidents, 25% said yes.
A willingness to use any means to win an election will inevitably, in the end, produce a president.
The editorial recalls John Adams, who "could just as easily have been talking about today when he wrote in 1776 of his fears that the Continental Congress' decisions would be dictated 'by noise, not sense; by meanness, not greatness; by ignorance, not learning; by contracted hearts, not large souls.'"
In popular government, this is our only way.'"
