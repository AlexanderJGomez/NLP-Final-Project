"It isn't true that the strikes are helpful," the Syrian President said.
Yet al-Assad said in his Paris Match interview, which took place on November 28 in Damascus and will be published in full Thursday, that the U.S.-led military campaign has limited use because "you can't end terrorism with aerial strikes.
Addressing reporters in Brussels, Belgium, after a meeting of representatives from the 60 members of the coalition, Kerry said various efforts -- from more than 1,000 airstrikes to sanctions -- have significantly hampered ISIS in the Middle East.
U.S. Central Command said that between Monday and Wednesday of this week, there were 14 coalition airstrikes in Syria -- all of them near Kobani, the city near the Turkish border that in recent weeks has become a key battleground in the ongoing fight -- in addition to 11 such strikes inside Iraq.
Asked by Paris Match if he'd survive this war -- or if he would have the same fate as once entrenched but later deposed leaders Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Moammar Gadhafi in Libya -- al-Assad said, "The captain doesn't think about death or life, he thinks about saving his ship.
"Regardless (of) what happens, we as Syrians will never allow our country to become a toy in Western hands," he said.
