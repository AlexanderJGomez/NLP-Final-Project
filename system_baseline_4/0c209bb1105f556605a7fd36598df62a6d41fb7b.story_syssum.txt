The EU and U.S. have condemned Russian annexation of Crimea as illegal and stepped up their rhetoric towards the Kremlin, but whether they are willing to put more economic pressure on Russia is unclear.
Here's why.
The EU is Russia's largest trading partner, and there are deep economic links between the two.
Russia, in turn, is the third biggest trading partner for the EU, with $169 billion in imports.
Germany, the eurozone's biggest economy, imports around 40% of its gas from Russia.
The economic relationship between Russia and the U.S. is more unbalanced.
Clark told CNN the U.S. could get greater leverage over Russia from financial sanctions aimed at the country's banking system and stability of the ruble.
But again, the financial links between Russia and the west would mean huge losses for European banks which have lent billions to Russia.

"Restricting access to foreign capital and the international banking system could prove very damaging indeed because Russia's economy is stagnating and it needs inward investment," Clark said.
