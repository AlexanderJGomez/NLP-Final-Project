(CNN) -- This week's devastating crash of a high-speed train in Spain, which left nearly 80 dead, has drawn renewed attention to rail safety at a time when the Obama administration has prioritized the construction of fast new rail links.
So far, the Obama administration, thanks to support from congressional Democrats, has distributed more than $10 billion to begin investing in faster train service.
The trains will be fast.
According to a National Safety Council review of 10 years of transportation fatalities, for every mile traveled, car drivers and passengers are more than 10 times as likely to die in accidents as passenger rail riders.
Other countries' experience shows that high-speed rail can be even safer than the much slower U.S. trains.
Improvements in the design of German trains and a review of maintenance operations in China have also prevented repeats of previous train accidents in those countries.
Modern train control equipment is designed to brake trains automatically when they travel too quickly or come too close to another train.
The international record shows that high-speed rail is very safe to use.
No more sitting in traffic, grinding teeth at the wheel.
Train service similar to that already offered in European and Asian countries would require a significant investment, but for many routes, an improved rail system is a worthy endeavor.
