(CNN) -- Humans can see 3-D images with only one eye, according to new research, suggesting a future in which the technology could become cheaper and more accessible.
"Now we have shown that it is in fact real, and the perceptual results are exactly like stereoscopic 3D, the kind seen in 3D movies."
The St. Andrews researchers say that, with the approach they explored, people with only one eye or those with problems watching 3-D with both eyes could still experience its "compelling" effect.
"Many of these people don't know what it means to see in 3D because they have never experienced it," Vishwanath said.
That method would also decrease eye fatigue and some of the other side effects people report from wearing 3-D glasses.
