The irritating glare won't, of course, affect the way we navigate our way to London's Heathrow Airport; a complicated and well-engineered computer system using GPS positioning provides information to air traffic controllers.
That was a question facing pilots in airspace over the United Kingdom on Friday, when Shanwick Oceanic, a part of the UK's NAT system of air traffic control, developed a computer glitch.
But while a malfunction affecting the flight of objects hurtling through the sky at 600 mph might sound scary, rest assured that Mom and Dad celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary aren't at any risk of colliding with another airliner en route.
Radar signals don't have the capability of traveling out to the middle of the ocean, so before airplanes enter the North Atlantic track system, from either east or west, a specific speed is assigned along with a specific altitude.
Before the latest computer technology became prevalent, oceanic controllers would track airplanes manually based on verbal pilot position reports at designated degrees of longitude.
When the current technology system breaks down, the solution is either to increase separation limits or just wait until it is fixed.
This of course raises the question of whether the global air traffic control system has become computer dependent.
With all that in mind, we are just going to have to suffer through the compromise of inconvenience when the technology breaks down.
