Just weeks before the tournament kicks off, president Jose Manuel Barroso has rejected an invitation to attend the final in Kiev -- citing concerns over the treatment of imprisoned opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
Officials have denied the allegations.
UEFA president Michael Platini last month complained of "crooks and bandits" hiking hotel rates in Ukraine, while last Friday bombings in the city of Dnipropetrovsk raised security fears ahead of the tournament.
The attacks cast further doubt over Ukraine's's ability to stage such an event, and UEFA has taken the unprecedented step of raising political concerns with the East European nation.
