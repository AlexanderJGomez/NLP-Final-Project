Vicksburg, Mississippi (CNN) -- Early signs of recovery mixed with stormy forecasts Friday, as residents struggled to dig out of the most significant flood to hit the lower Mississippi River valley in more than 70 years.
Severe storms are likely Saturday and Sunday in the Mississippi River, Ohio River and Tennessee River valleys, said CNN meteorologist Sean Morris.
The rain could lead to secondary crests and higher crests along the Mississippi from Memphis, Tennessee, southward, he said.
It was a big success, he said.
"(I'm) just here to celebrate the river cresting," Roland said.
"Hopefully, it'll start going down soon."
This is where our stuff is."
Residents who live along the river should be vigilant, said Marty Pope, a senior hydrologist with the weather service.
Warren County, which includes Vicksburg, has "several hundred homes that have water" and about 2,000 residents have been displaced, Sheriff Martin Pace said.
The river stood at 61.9 feet Thursday night, and the crest isn't expected till Saturday.
A slide was detected on the mainline Mississippi levee at Albemarle Lake, the Corps of Engineers said Thursday.
So far, the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development has delivered nearly 150,000 sandbags, 30,000 cubic yards of sand and 33,000 linear feet of fabric-lined baskets, the governor's office said.
By Saturday morning, "the area will be secured and no one will be allowed to enter," the parish said in a news release.
About five miles of the Mississippi River at Baton Rouge were closed Friday after four barges broke loose from a towboat, said Seaman William Benson of the U.S. Coast Guard.
