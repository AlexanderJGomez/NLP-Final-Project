(CNN) -- The federal prosecution of former U.S. Rep. Rick Renzi of Arizona will continue, a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled Thursday.
He is also accused of misappropriating money from his family insurance business to fund his campaigns and for personal benefit.
"The Supreme Court has made equally clear that the Speech or Debate Clause does not make members of Congress supercitizens immune from criminal responsibility," said the appeals court.
Renzi could now appeal his case to the Supreme Court.
The case is U.S. v. Renzi (10-10088).
