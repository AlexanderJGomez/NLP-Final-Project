Liberia has reported 16 new cases with nine deaths.
WHO says there has been a reduction in the number of new cases reported in Guinea.
With their countries facing an Ebola epidemic, the health ministers of 11 African nations have agreed to a joint strategy to try to stem its deadly advance.
"It's time for concrete action to put an end to the suffering and deaths caused by Ebola virus disease and prevent its further spread," he said.
The disease's spread "is in great extent associated with some cultural practices and traditional beliefs" that run counter to preventive health measures, he said.
"These are very high-risk practices leading to extensive exposures to Ebola virus in the community," the statement said.
Rugunda said Uganda, which has experience in dealing with Ebola outbreaks, most recently in 2012, had been asked by WHO to provide technical assistance in the latest battle to contain the virus.
As a result, patients often suffer internal and external hemorrhaging.
A patient isn't contagious -- meaning they can't spread the virus to other people -- until he or she is showing symptoms.
"One, (this is) the first time in West Africa that we have such an outbreak," he said.
There is no cure for Ebola, but in theory, the disease should be easy to fight since close contact is needed to become infected, Piot said.
"Fear of the virus, and the lack of trust in government, in the health system, is as bad as the actual virus."
