China will have a major leadership change soon when the current leaders, President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao, bow out.
After three decades of reforms, China's social economic landscape has been transformed.
China is in urgent need of a soul, a set of dominant ideas, as the efficacy of the Chinese Communist Party's official ideology -- emphasizing "harmonious society" and "scientific development" -- diminishes.
Dominating the debates and ideological clashes are the neoliberals and the neo-Maoists who occupy the leadership, while neo-Confucians, popular as they may be among some common folk and patriotic youths, have yet to find their strong advocates among top leaders.
The implications of this ideological debate are enormous and will likely determine the future of China.
Unlike leaders like Bo Xilai who used iron-fisted measures when dealing with social discontent, Wang has a reputation for listening to netizens, including their criticisms of the government.
In a subtle rejection of the "fairness and justice" advocated by neoliberals, the neo-Maoists see the state as a beneficial force and the market as an evil one.
Bo's "Chongqing experiment" provided China's neo-Maoists with a set of ideas that could compete against the neoliberals' advocacy of the market and democracy.
But ideological orientation will surely be one of the considerations in the jockeying for power.
How he and other key leaders take up stands in this struggle for ideological dominance will be immensely important for China and its direction in the next decade.
