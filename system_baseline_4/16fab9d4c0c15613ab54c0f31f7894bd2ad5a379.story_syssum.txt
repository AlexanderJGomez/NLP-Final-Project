ET to "Campbell Brown" over the next two nights to find out who else will fill the slots.
Officials say Joe Saenz is thought to be linked with Mexican drug cartels.
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Detective Traci Gonzales knew there were drug and gang ties to the slaying, so she showed the videotape to Los Angeles Police Department Detective Ron Chavarria, a veteran on the gang beat.
Saenz is the newest person on the FBI's Most Wanted List, after three fugitives on the list were recently caught.
"Just gruesome, gruesome, cold-blooded," Chavarria said.
Within days, Saenz -- also known as Jose Saenz, Louie Louie and more than two dozen other aliases -- was wanted for a third murder.
And from that point on he became a fugitive for the next 10 years," Gonzales said.
"We heard rumors that not only citizens were afraid of him, but also his own gang members were afraid of him," Chavarria said.
The chilling video, Chavarria said, shows why Saenz is so dangerous.
