Facebook, or "FB" as it's now known to investors, may have made amateur analysts on the Web go wild.
But 'friending' both started and ended the day at just over $38 a share.
Business Insider posted a poll (obviously not scientific) asking readers where they thought the $38 stock would be by the end of the day Friday.
(15% said $40 to 45, another 13% said $45 to 50 and, yes, yet another 12% said $50-55).
On rival network Twitter, many observers seemed to be rooting against Facebook and its early investors, finding a measure of glee in the fact that the price didn't skyrocket as some had predicted.
Keeping $FB over 38 or trying to get hired at Facebook being over 38?"
"Rooting against Facebook stock price > [is greater than] rooting against LeBron," wrote a user named Jay Kang.
Serious matter!"
Making the list?
