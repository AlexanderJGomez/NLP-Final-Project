"He is happy to be reunited with his family," said Chris Garrett, a spokesman for Vick.
Vick is a native of Newport News, Virginia.
The original plan called for Vick to come up with $750,000 to $1 million in cash to be paid to creditors, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Frank Santoro said, but he said he saw no evidence Vick could come up with that much.
In testimony, Vick acknowledged committing a "heinous" act and said he should have acted more maturely.
After his release, Vick will work with the Humane Society of the United States on anti-dogfighting campaigns, Humane Society President Wayne Pacelle told CNN Tuesday.
Pacelle said the Humane Society was approached by Vick's representatives.
More attention has been paid to dogfighting as a result of Vick's case, Pacelle said.
