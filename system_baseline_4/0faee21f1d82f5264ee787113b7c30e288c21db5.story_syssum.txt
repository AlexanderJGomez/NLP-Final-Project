President Barack Obama announced Friday that the vast majority of the more than 39,000 U.S. troops now stationed in Iraq, including about 3,500 from Fort Bliss, "will definitely be home for the holidays."
"It was very emotional."
Young said there are plenty of headaches and heartache for her and the couple's children every time her husband sets off for such countries as Iraq and Afghanistan.
That would have marked 12 months after the husband was first deployed to Iraq.
The campaign has claimed more than 4,400 American lives and has cost upwards of $700 billion, according to the Department of Defense.
"It's been eight years, so I feel like it's about time," she said of the Iraq war.
But she and other Fort Bliss families know, too, that while their loved ones may not head back to Iraq, that does not mean they won't face more danger.
Trapnell said that she's heard some Fort Bliss troops might go from Iraq to Kuwait and eventually end up in Afghanistan.
But she said that, for now, she is trying to enjoy the fact that her husband will be home, and cannot bring herself to consider yet that he may be in harm's way again, this time in Afghanistan.
