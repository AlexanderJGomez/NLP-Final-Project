(CNN) -- Forces loyal to Alassane Ouattara, the internationally recognized president of Ivory Coast, attacked the residence of disputed incumbent Laurent Gbagbo and took control of state-run TV early Friday morning, a spokesman for Ouattara told CNN.
Ouattara on Thursday declared a curfew in Abidjan as forces loyal to him moved closer to taking control of the city.
The curfew, Ouattara said, will remain in effect until Sunday.
It will be only "hours, maybe days" before Gbagbo falls, Achi said.
Residents in Abidjan told CNN that people were frightened at the prospect of an all-out war and were huddled in their homes Thursday.
"We are watching to see what will happen next."
Choi Young-jin, head of the United Nations' mission in Ivory Coast, said on France Info radio that U.N. peacekeepers have taken the place of army and police who abandoned Gbagbo on Thursday.
Achi said it was a sign that the armed forces now stand fully behind Ouattara.
"In order to end the escalating violence in our country, the Republican Forces of Ivory Coast have started to put in place, in accordance with their missions, the protection of people and their property against the militia men and mercenaries paid by Laurent Gbagbo," Ouattara said.
Many residents in Abidjan fear Gbagbo will not go down easily.
The U.N. resolution demands that Gbagbo step down immediately and that all state institutions, including the military, accept Ouattara as president.
