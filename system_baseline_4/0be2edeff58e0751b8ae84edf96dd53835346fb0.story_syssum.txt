Chen Guangcheng is now in the U.S. embassy in Beijing, and American and Chinese officials are scrambling to resolve his situation, his friends and supporters have said.
Outside a busy Beijing subway station Monday, CNN randomly asked more than three dozen people about Chen -- only two had heard of him and his escape.
They also get creative in Chinese cyberspace to evade censors, especially on the popular Sina Weibo site, where a third of China's more than 500 million internet users share news and information.
Then people tried Abing, the famous early 20th Century Chinese musician who was also blind.
CNN, like most other international news media, has followed Chen's story for years and provided extensive coverage on his situation since his escape.
One of the tags for the video was "Chen Guangcheng."
I took a screenshot of the webpage showing Chen's name and posted it on my Sina Weibo account.
By Monday afternoon, "StevenCNN" -- my Weibo name -- has become a banned search term.
