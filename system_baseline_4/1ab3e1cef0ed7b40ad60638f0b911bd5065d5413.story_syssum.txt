Now they don't know what the future holds after Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday signed a controversial law that bans the adoption of Russian children by American families.
"We told her we were going to be back for her and she said she would wait for us," he said.
The couple already has one adopted child, 4-year-old Jack from Ethiopia, and two biological children.
"We knew that there was an overwhelming need for children to be adopted, especially children with special needs," Josh Johnston said.
They first saw Anastasia from a distance in the audience of a talent show and later met her face-to-face accompanied by a nurse and doctor, Josh Johnston said.
Americans tend to seek adoptions abroad because of the perception that it's easier and that there are more children in need in other countries than in the United States.
U.S. citizens adopted 17,416 children from foreign countries in 2008, accounting for 13 percent of adoptions that year compared to approximately 136,000 children in the United States, according to a 2011 report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Children's Bureau.
"Generally, it's perceived that orphans have far greater challenges abroad than they do in the United States, so when it comes to adopting a child, families typically want to raise a child out of a desperate situation," said Kim de Blecourt, founder of Nourished Hearts, a faith-based support network for those connected to adoption and foster care.
When Dominique Love found out she couldn't have children, she and her husband started looking abroad to avoid potential conflicts with birth parents.
He knows he is adopted and where he's from, she said.
It's part of his story, and we don't want to erase that," she said.
She sympathizes with Russians who want their children to stay in the land where they born but thinks the children are the ones who will suffer.
"Our son had been in that baby home for 12 months when we came along," she said.
