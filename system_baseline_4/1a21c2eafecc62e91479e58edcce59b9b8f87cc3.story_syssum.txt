(CNN) -- The International Criminal Court swore in Gambian lawyer Fatou Bensouda as its chief prosecutor Friday, the first woman to assume the top job at the world war crimes tribunal.
Her appointment comes amid fierce criticism against the court -- which has a heavy caseload of Africa investigations -- that it disburses justice selectively by focusing on the continent.
Critics have said the court targets Africa and bypasses opportunities to investigate abuses in various nations, including Afghanistan and Iraq.
Supporters of the court applauded her appointment and said the court provides justice to victims of nations where the legal system is not efficient.
"We look to Bensouda's leadership to advance cases, build bridges with victims, and push countries to support its impartial application of the law to get the job done."
