(CNN) -- Egypt's revolution has made life tougher still for Cairo's 80,000 taxi drivers, struggling to make a living on the city's chaotic, congested and potholed streets, says the author who has written a best-selling book about them.
"My taxi drivers are among the 55% of the population living under the poverty line of $2 a day," said AlKhamissi.
AlKhamissi said it was too early to tell if life was improving for the middle classes who took to the streets during the revolution.
"Every night I want to write because it is my only job, my only happiness," he said.
He said: "Some journalists have said that about my book, but it's nonsense to say that one book or 10 books can change reading habits.
AlKhamissi said he dreams of an Egypt where taxi drivers could have the time and education to read his -- or any other -- book.
I'm not interested in whether they read my book, I just hope they will read anything."
"Twenty years ago there was nothing for 16, 17, 18-year-olds to read," said Towfik.
Towfik said that despite Egypt's revolution, he still fears the scenes in his book, first published in Arabic in 2009, could come true.
He added: "After nine months, nothing has been accomplished except getting rid of Mubarak.
