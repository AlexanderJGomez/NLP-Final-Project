(CNN) -- Climate scientists are getting desperate.
Burning fossil fuels and deforestation have caused most of the increase.
The immediate trigger for the letter Virginia State Attorney General Kenneth T. Cuccinelli's recent demand that climate scientist Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State University, produce a large volume of paperwork related to his scientific research and communications with fellow scientists during his years at University of Virginia from 1999 to 2005.
It's also made Mann a target for those who don't want to admit that global warming is a real problem.
In 1995, a group called Global Climate Coalition, composed of the American Petroleum Institute and a host of fossil-fuel dependent corporations, attacked Benjamin Santer, a scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory who had done key work demonstrating the human "fingerprint" on climate.
Without any substantive evidence, the group accused Santer of committing "scientific cleansing" of the IPCC's Second Assessment Report by removing mention of uncertainties to make global warming appear more certain than it was.
Perhaps no scientific name is more associated with global warming than Roger Revelle, mentor to Al Gore, who first warned of the risks of human-caused climate change in the 1950s.
But it isn't just climate scientists who have been vilified, personally attacked, and threatened with lawsuits and congressional investigations.
One doesn't have to be a conspiracy theorist to see the pattern: People are loath to admit that our free market system has created problems that the free market has proved ineffectual to solve.
If you tried to argue that global warming is not a market failure, you'd just look silly.
Science is arcane and scientists are frankly often incomprehensible.
The real crime is not to be found in some pile of obscure scientific documents or the e-mails of harassed scientists.
