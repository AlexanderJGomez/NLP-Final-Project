In September this year, Xi disappeared.
Mike Chinoy, a former CNN correspondent and now a senior fellow at the University of Southern California's U.S-China Institute, has seen China's leaders come and go but concedes Xi is difficult to read.
He's risen to the top of the Chinese system by being very careful not to disclose what he really thinks," Chinoy said.
The modern Chinese Communist Party is run by a small collective, the nine members of Politburo Standing Committee of which Xi is expected to be the next leader.
The 18th Communist Party Congress will come together on November 8 to chart a new course for the country, say farewell to the old leadership and usher in a new generation.
Every ten years it selects the new leadership.
It could be seen as a mark of shame in Communist Party history," said Zhang Ming, an analyst from China's Renmin University.
"I once told someone in the party, 'if your party is to fail one day, when they look for the reason of their failure, this period would be a main part,'" he said.
The purge of party power broker, Bo Xilai, sparked China's biggest political scandal in decades.
To some China watchers, Xi is going to need to be a traitor to his own class if he is to succeed.
Critics say the party and China's elite have lost touch with the people and are facing a crisis of legitimacy.
What happens in China no longer stays in China.
Internal strife and external tensions -- this is the China that Xi stands to inherit.
Yet Xi remains largely unknowable, a man who could disappear without explanation.
