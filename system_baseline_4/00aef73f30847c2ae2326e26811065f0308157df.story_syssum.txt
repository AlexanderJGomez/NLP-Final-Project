Workers next to the spot where subway trains will one day emerge from the tunnel.
Too bad traffic often moves at a snail's pace.
The "radical system" city planners embarked on five years ago involved construction of a new subway tunnel beneath the Bosphorus Strait, the spectacular body of water that cuts this city in two.
"We will connect two continents, Asia and Europe," said Nusret Ilbay, one of the many engineers working on the $3 billion Marmaray Tunnel Project.
Today, engineers face equally daunting challenges building a tunnel beneath one of the world's busiest shipping channels, at depths of up to 55 meters, in an active earthquake zone.
First they dredged a trench on the bottom of the Bosphorus.
As a precaution in the event of a catastrophic flood in the tunnel, engineers constructed an emergency bunker on the bottom of the sea.
In Yenikapi, a neighborhood of textile factories and seedy hotels where one of the main transit stations for Istanbul's new subway and commuter rail system was to be built, archaeologists discovered the lost Byzantine port of Theodosius.
"At around one meter below sea level, we started finding the remains of ropes.
The scale of the excavation is unusual in modern-day archaeology, says Cemal Pulak, an anthropologist from Texas A&M University's nautical archaeology program.
In one tent, two workers carefully uncover the ancient wooden beams of a 40-meter long merchant vessel.
Historians say the new discoveries include the first examples of ships being built using the beginnings of the "skeleton approach" to constructing the vessel's hull.
It is the beginning of engineering.
"The first man, about 8,400 years ago, came and started to settle here," Yilmaz said.
Plans to travel beneath the Bosphorus have been delayed at least four years by the excavation of the Theodosious Port.
In the rush to move forward, the residents of Istanbul have accidentally uncovered a valuable piece of their city's ancient past.
