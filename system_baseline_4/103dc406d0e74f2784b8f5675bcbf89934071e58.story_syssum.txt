"In this case, my office examined newly discovered scientific evidence that was not available at the time of the trial," Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth P. Thompson said in statement to CNN.
Yarbough and Wilson were already incarcerated when the 1999 rape and murder occurred, according to Adam Perlmutter, Wilson's attorney.
According to Margulis-Ohuma, this case was "easy" with such "obvious evidence of innocence."
Brooklyn detectives placed Yarbough and Wilson into separate interview rooms and coerced false confessions from the two teens, who were later convicted in separate trials.
Yarbough's attorney and the district attorney's office began revisiting the case in 2010.
"I'm feeling really blessed right," Yarbough said.
When asked about his relationship with Wilson, Yarbough said he has no animosity.
At this time, after years behind bars, Yarbough is happy to move on.
