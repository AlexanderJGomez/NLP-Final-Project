"Well jeez," Jobs said, struggling to get the spanking new iPhone 4 to do much of anything without a connection to a Wi-Fi network.
Many tech bloggers and writers have called for Apple to open the iPhone to other networks, including Verizon Wireless.
Any AT&T customer eligible for a phone upgrade this year can get the iPhone 4 on its debut date at those subsidized prices, Jobs said.
After the event, tech industry analysts warned against reading too much into the network glitches during Jobs' presentation.
Analysts said Jobs was having trouble connecting to a Wi-Fi network during his presentation, not AT&T's troubled 3G network.
Van Baker, research vice-president for Gartner, said the "Verizon!"
Some 570 Wi-Fi stations were clogging up the connection he needed to complete the presentation, he said.
