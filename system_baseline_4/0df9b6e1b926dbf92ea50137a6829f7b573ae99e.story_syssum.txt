(CNN) -- A driverless taxi is waiting for you outside your house.
Instead, this is how your airport travel experience will be in just 10 years from now-- according to Skyscanner.
In 10 years' time airports will be intelligent spaces that will allow travelers to enjoy an automated and stress free journey.
Future travelers will take complete control of their journey, which will be free of check-in desks and long queues.
Biometric check-in software will eliminate the need for boarding passes and passport checks, while X-ray machines will also become a thing of the past thanks to sensors capable of scanning big groups from a large distance.
If you don't feel like delving into the world of art, amenities ranging from rooftop swimming pools and 3D cinemas to gyms and open-air parks will offer a pleasant distraction before boarding your flight.
In cabin smart lighting will make jetlag a thing of the past, while seats that mold to the passengers' body shape will come with pre-loaded films and music according to their tastes.
"That seat will become your home, in a way, in the air," says Filipov.
