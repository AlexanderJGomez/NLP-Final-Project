(CNN) -- Sweden's Princess Lilian, the Welsh-born model who lived with her lover Prince Bertil for 30 years before they were married, has died at the age of 97, the Swedish Royal Court said in a statement.
Born in 1915 in Swansea, Wales, Lilian May Davies was a Vogue model and married to British actor Ivan Craig when she first met Prince Bertil, the current king's uncle, in 1943.
With a strong possibility that Prince Bertil would have to act as Regent to the present King Carl XVI Gustaf, who was less than a year old when his father was killed, the couple did not marry.
He himself was married to a commoner and the couple were finally permitted to marry 33 years after they first met, on December 7, 1976 at Drottningholm Palace Chapel.
Princess Lilian remained active in public life until her early 90s, attending the Nobel Prize ceremonies adorned in royal jewels.
She was the oldest member of the Swedish royal family at the time of her death and, despite the problems that led her to wait more than 30 years to get married, was a fully integrated member of the Swedish Royal family.
