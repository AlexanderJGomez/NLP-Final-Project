I'm going to look like a complete fool, she thought.
Tomsche's first class was hard.
But she came back the next day.
Tomsche was an overweight child, but it wasn't until her best friend committed suicide when she was 16 that she started packing on the pounds.
She indulged in chips and ice cream, and drank soda by the gallon.
But overeating had already taken its toll.
Instructor Maria Venegas remembers when Tomsche first tried her Zumba class.
"She would go and sit down about a third (of the) way into class," Venegas says.
"But it has been my venture to become a Zumba instructor that has (been) the fountain of youth, for myself and many others."
"Every class is always different," Tomsche says.
"Now (she) walks in with a big smile ... shoulders back and head up high," Venegas says.
Tomsche does Zumba five to six times a week and tries to stay active the rest of the day.
She says Tomsche has inspired their small community.
Tomsche is just happy she's gotten her smile back.
