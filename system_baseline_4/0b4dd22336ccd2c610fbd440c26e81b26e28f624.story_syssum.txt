"Most of us believe that the decision as to major reform of how Americans get their health care in this country deserves at least as much time and deliberation as it would take to select a puppy to live in the White House," he said.
Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, speaking on conservative Hugh Hewitt's radio show recently, was asked about whether his party had enough votes to block health care from going forward.
"If he is unsuccessful, which I anticipate and will predict he is, on getting a vote prior to the August recess, then I would say there's no way in the world they're going to get this done this year," he added.
"When the Democrats say we don't have a plan ... where's their plan?
And that's going to be a huge gain for those of us who want to turn this thing over in the 2010 election," Inhofe said.
Last week, Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, was quoted as telling the group Conservatives for Patients' Rights, which opposes Obama's health care plan, that "if we're able to stop Obama on this, it will be his Waterloo.
Another Republican senator said that defeating health reform is about 'breaking' me," he said.
Politically, I actually appreciate what they said."
