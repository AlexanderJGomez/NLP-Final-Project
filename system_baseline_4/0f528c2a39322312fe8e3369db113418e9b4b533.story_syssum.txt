Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected an appeal from a North Carolina county that had regularly opened its public meetings with Christian prayers.
Court records show that 26 of 33 invocations given at the council meetings in 2007 and 2008 contained references to Jesus Christ, the Trinity, or other Christian symbols or names.
The high court also turned aside a pair of student speech cases involving off-campus activity in the digital age.
Court records show the posting was widely circulated at the school among students and faculty, and the principal eventually suspended the girl for 10 days.
But a separate appeals court had given a West Virginia school district a legal victory after a high school senior was punished for creating what officials called a targeted "hate website."
"Now is the time for the Supreme Court to resolve the question of whether and to what extent school districts have the authority to discipline students for off-campus speech," said Francisco Negron Jr., of the National School Boards Association.
The current cases are Blue Mountain School District v. J.S.
