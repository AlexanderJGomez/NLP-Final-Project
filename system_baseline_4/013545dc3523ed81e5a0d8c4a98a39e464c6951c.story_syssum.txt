A safe distance from Nairobi's Westgate Mall, several Kenyans stare through a stand of trees at the site of one of the nation's worst terrorist attacks.
It will take a long time to return to any sense of safety or normalcy.
On the day of the attack, my cousin, Charles Mugo, and his two daughters, ages 6 and 3, found themselves with about 40 other shoppers in the mall parking garage.
Mugo came face-to-face with one of the terrorists, a lanky, 6-foot man, wearing a black scarf-like cloth on his head and magazines of ammunition around his waist.
When the gunmen demanded to know if they were Muslim, Mugo hesitated just long enough for the attackers to turn their attention to a man nearby.
They waited, and waited.
By then, the gunshots did not sound as close.
"Westgate bad, blood," the younger daughter told me later.
Terrorism experts say the attack bears eerie similarities to the 2008 siege of a hotel in Mumbai, India -- another upscale target with Western appeal.
The Nairobi attack targeted non-Muslims at a stylish mall.
Four days after the attack, Mugo is still trying to sort out his feelings.
What if I had not gone to that mall.
At the time, all I kept thinking was I just couldn't let these girls die."
Never, ever, ever."
