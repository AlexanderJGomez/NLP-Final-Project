New Delhi (CNN)If there were an annual prize for the "World's Most Hopeful Economy," it would likely go to India.
Modi has fashioned a role for himself not only as CEO of India Inc. but also as its global ambassador, with blockbuster speeches promoting India in New York, Tokyo and Sydney.
Modi's greatest accomplishment in 2014 was to offer promise: He energized weary Indians.
That suggests 2015 will be a defining year for India.
At the start of Modi's term, Brent crude was trading at about $110 a barrel.
India's government will look to use that money well.
And Modi will need another important currency: cooperation from his lawmakers.
Can Modi legislate as well as he can campaign?
These are all questions that Modi will need to answer in 2015.
Obama will be the first sitting American president to visit India more than once.
The great unknown is how he will respond to a major foreign policy crisis, the likes of which he largely escaped in 2014.
Will Modi develop a values-based vision of India's place in the world?
Recent events are cause for renewed worry.
In 2015, Modi will need not only to be a voice of reason, but he will also have to rein in radical fringe elements of his Hindu support base.
The sad reality is that Modi will probably make the same comment at this year's speech.
Most Indians who discover the Internet will discover it on a cheap smartphone, not a PC.
So, expect India to start leapfrogging many of the problems the West has spent decades dealing with: India has never had a real database of its citizens, but soon it will be the first country to have an entirely digital biometric ID system.
This will be India's real revolution, and it is already underway.
