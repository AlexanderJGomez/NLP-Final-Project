After the meeting a visibly angry Mugabe said talks faltered after Tsvangirai, head of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), presented proposals which differed from recommendations by the 15-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC).
... MDC have a proposal which is in conflict with the SADC and we opposed it and then the talks broke down," Mugabe said.
Tsvangirai blamed Mugabe for the failure of the talks.
The MDC has not been able to settle with Mugabe since signing a power sharing deal in September.
Tsvangirai accuses Mugabe of keeping the most powerful portfolios in the government for his party.
