"Women here were empowered a long time ago, but haven't had a chance to tell our story," said Ghubash.
The museum is the culmination of five years' work for Ghubash, who financed the museum with $3 million of her own money.
In searching for a home for the museum, Ghubash turned down a free site in Dubai's official heritage district for an old house in the historic Gold Souk neighborhood she grew up in.
I want them to enjoy their culture and heritage," said Ghubash.
Ghubash, 56, has undertaken the museum project while taking a sabbatical from a career that led to her being listed 36th on Arabian Business magazine's "100 Most Powerful Arab Women" in 2011.
"My journey in life is very interesting," she said.
She is already working on her next project to compile an encyclopaedia of women of the United Arab Emirates.
