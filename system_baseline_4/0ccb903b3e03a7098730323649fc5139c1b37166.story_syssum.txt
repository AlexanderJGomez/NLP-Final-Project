Rodriguez, who had to leave the game, was awarded first base after being hit, but there were no other penalties to Hernandez, who, on a night when his control was off, hit two other Yankees (three of the last five batters he faced) before giving way to a relief pitcher in a game that ended with a 4-2 Seattle victory.
There is no meaningful penalty in baseball for a pitcher hitting a batter with the ball.
By contrast, Major League Baseball appears to have learned nothing fromÂ history when it comes to rules for protecting batters.
In 2000, New York Mets catcher Mike Piazza was forced to miss the All-Star game as a result of the concussion and headaches that followed a beaning by the New York Yankees Roger Clemens, a notorious brushback pitcher, whom Piazza had tagged for a grand-slam home run a month earlier.
Major League Baseball's substitute for rules that penalize a pitcher for hitting batters has been equipment, namely the plastic helmet.
What is needed to make pitchers avoid brushback pitches along with the beanings that come with them are a series of rules with penalties that send a clear message: Major League Baseball is serious about protecting its players.
A pitcher who hits a second batter in a game should face automatic ejection and a fine of $10,000, no matter where his pitch lands.
Rule 3: Make a team, not just an individual pitcher, accountable for hit batters.
Rule 4: Increase pitcher liability for a hit batsman.
A few batters might take advantage of them and try to get hit, but given the dangers that come from a pitch traveling upward of 90 mph, most batters are not likely to risk their careers just to get on base.
