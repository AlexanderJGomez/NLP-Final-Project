"No, no.
Beautiful white robes.
Just bed bugs.
Which is why, the other day, almost eleven years later, I was delighted to learn that the United States finally invaded Denmark, set it on fire, and raised the American flag.
There's a wildly popular computer game called "Minecraft" where, as best I understand it, players build highly imaginative environments and constructions using 3D cubes.
But, from what I can tell, part of the fun in "Minecraft" is creating these new virtual worlds and exploring those of others.
So, the Danish government sanctioned the creation of a replica version of their country within "Minecraft" to use as a progressive teaching tool for schoolchildren, educating them about Denmark's geography.
Somehow, these vandals were able to infiltrate virtual Denmark while sneaking in virtual dynamite, at which point they virtually demolished parts of virtual Copenhagen.
But through their virtual sneak attack invasion, the vandals proudly constructed virtual American flags all over town, and built virtual signs reading: AMERICA.
Though the Danish Geodata Agency was quickly able to fully "repair" the "destruction," there was no fixing the psychological damage.
The whole thing was just so absurd and wonderfully American.
