(CNN) -- Apple appears to be testing out motion control features that will let people control their iPhones by moving their heads.
The left or right head movements can be assigned to different tasks, including returning to the main home screen, displaying notifications or activating voice assistant Siri.
The head-movement feature is meant as an accessibility option, but it's easy to imagine similar motion control features becoming more commonplace on devices in the future.
In a pinch, regular smartphone cameras can perform some minor motion detection features, but they are still in the early stages and need work before they are good enough to be practical tools.
If you look away from a video while it is playing, it can automatically pause.
