(CNN) -- Manchester City's misfiring start to the English Premier League season continued on Saturday with a 2-1 loss to West Ham United at Upton Park.
"We had a lot of chances to score but it is difficult to win if you don't take them," City boss, Pellegrini said.
The win keeps West Ham in fourth place with 16 points, one point behind City who failed to make up ground on league leaders Chelsea.
The win gave Arsene Wenger a first league win in four matches and lifts the Gunners up to fifth with Swansea City one place behind following a 2-0 win at Leicester City.
Borussia Dortmund's nightmare start to the Bundesliga season continued with a fourth straight league defeat on Saturday against Hannover 96.
There was little to lift the gloom at Werder Bremen either as their manager Roger Dutt was shown the door on Saturday following Friday's 1-0 loss to FC Cologne.
Bremen are without a win this season and are currently anchored to the foot of the table with four points from nine matches.
At the business end, Hoffenheim move up to second after a 1-0 win over Paderborn while Leverkusen's 1-0 victory over Schalke lifts Roger Schmidt's side to fourth.
