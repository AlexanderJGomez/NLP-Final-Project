Prosecutors claim he wanted to kill her; Pistorius said he mistook her for an intruder and her killing was a tragic accident.
The appeal doesn't necessarily mean either the verdict or the sentence against Pistorius will be thrown out, said CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps.
In explaining her sentence, Masipa concluded that Pistorius did not intend to kill Steenkamp.
In their appeal of the sentence, prosecutors would have to prove the five years given by Masipa is "shockingly inappropriate" in light of sentencing guidelines and similar cases, according to Phelps.
