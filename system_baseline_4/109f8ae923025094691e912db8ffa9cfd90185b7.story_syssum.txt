Lewis, 26, allegedly committed at least six sexual assaults in various states since fleeing Massachusetts in September, according to the Massachusetts State Police.
Police said that when New York state troopers tried to pull over the vehicle Lewis was driving for a missing license plate, he fled, crashing into a river.
Lewis was arrested on August 5 and charged with raping a 14-year-old girl in Southbridge, Massachusetts, police said.
After fleeing Massachusetts, Lewis first traveled to Charlotte, North Carolina, where he allegedly kidnapped, assaulted and robbed a woman on September 23, police said.
Two days after the North Carolina assault, police said, Lewis returned to his family's home in Massachusetts, where he allegedly beat and robbed his stepfather.
Carlos Dingui said Lewis handcuffed his stepfather to prevent him from calling police.
He also took approximately 200 rounds of ammunition.
