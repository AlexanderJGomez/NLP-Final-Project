Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Taliban militants beheaded two children in southern Afghanistan, a provincial governor's office said.
He said Taliban fighters would never do such a thing, but said the group's civilian casualty commission would investigate.
The Taliban said the attack was intended to target Americans in Kabul International Airport, one part of which is used by military forces and another by civilians, the officials said.
In eastern Afghanistan, a service member with NATO's International Security Assistance Force died in a bombing on Monday, the latest in a string of coalition deaths.
