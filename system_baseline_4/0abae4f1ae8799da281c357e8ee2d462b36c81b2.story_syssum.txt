(CNN) -- At least 26 people were killed Monday in the Syrian government's ongoing crackdown on dissidents, the pro-democracy group Local Coordination Committees of Syria said.
The number of people killed in unrest in Syria since mid-March has reached at least 2,600, the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said Monday.
Mattar was "a symbol of what the Syrian revolution should be -- peaceful and nonviolent," said one of Mattar's friends.
"His death is an attack by the regime on peace.
Both men asked not to be named for fear of retribution.
Unrest has plagued Syria for more than six months, as protesters demanding more freedom, democratic elections and an end to al-Assad's regime have been met by brute force.
The group, citing reports from Mattar's fellow opposition members, said he was tortured to death.
The Syrian Observatory has said more than 2,000 people -- mostly demonstrators -- have died since the uprising began in mid-March.
Mattar's colleague said that Syrian security forces fired on mourners, and that one man was shot and later died.
