But Fahey dismissed the six-time grand slam winner's comments as unhelpful and said it was up to the sport to do more to fight against doping.
Roger Federer, winner of 17 grand slams, said more testing needed to be done within the sport and also said players should give a sample when requested.
But when asked if he knew how widespread doping in tennis was, Fahey replied: "No I don't and nor do I think tennis knows how widespread it is.
Fahey also said the fall from grace of cyclist Lance Armstrong had been the best anti-doping message since he became WADA president in 2007.
"What that said to me and the rest of the world was no matter how big you are, how tall, how successful you are, you can get caught and be dealt with.
As for athletics, Fahey acknowledged that doping is "widespread" and said part of the reason might be that there are different resources available to tackle the problem in different countries.
Fahey said doping is not just a problem in successful sporting countries like Kenya and Jamaica, but rejected the notion performance-enhancing drugs were beginning to ruin sport.
