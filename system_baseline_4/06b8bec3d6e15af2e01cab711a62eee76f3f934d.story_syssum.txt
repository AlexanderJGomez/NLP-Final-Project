The $165 million animated film topped the chart with $49.1 million out of 3,752 theaters — the strongest debut ever for a Walt Disney Animation production (i.e., not including Pixar titles).
"There really are few things for families in the time between now and then," says Dave Hollis, Disney's Executive Vice President of Domestic Distribution, who cites DreamWorks' "Rise of the Guardians" and Disney's own 3-D re-release of "Monsters, Inc." as the only animated competition for the rest of 2012.
The Robert Zemeckis-directed drama "Flight" soared in second place with $25 million from just 1,884 theaters, giving the $31 million Paramount film the strongest per theater average in the Top 20, with $13,275.
Fellow adult-targeting drama "Argo" opened substantially lower (with $19.8 million) in substantially more theaters (3,232 to be exact), and, as you'll read in a moment, is headed past the $100 million mark thanks to slim declines.
That last Ben Affleck vehicle to gross $100 million was 2003′s "Daredevil," which earned $102.5 million.
Fortunately, Universal spent only $15 million on the film, which was directed by RZA.
Though Fox's $45 million sequel will finish a tad below the original "Taken's" $145 million domestic finish, it has more than made up for that fact overseas, where "Taken 2" has grossed $210.8 million (the original "Taken" found $81 million internationally).
"Flight" -- $25.0 million
"Argo" -- $10.2 million
"Taken 2" -- $6.0 million
"Skyfall's" best market was once again the United Kingdom, where it fell only 21 percent in its second frame to $25.7 million, good for an $85.8 million total.
