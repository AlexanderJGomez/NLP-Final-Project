(CNN) -- Convertibles are selling well at the Mercedes Benz dealership in Sendai in North Japan.
Thanks to an influx of construction workers, evacuees and government compensation money, Sendai has become the hub of Japan's recovery economy, the outlier in the midst of struggling coastal towns that are just beginning to rebuild.
"People used to try not to spend so much and save money, but after the quake, (they) spend more on luxurious cars, also because the stock market and exchange market are not doing well now."
Analysts say much of Japan's trade deficit comes from increased importation and prices for natural gas and oil, which has increased in use since much of the nation's nuclear power supply has been taken offline.
"One year on from the earthquake, Japan's economy remains deeply affected by the disaster," Takehide Kiuchi, chief economist of Nomura Securities, wrote in a recent research report.
"Looking back at the progress made with reconstruction over this last year, we get a clear sense of the strength of Japan's private sector," Kiuchi said.
One of Japan's wealthiest men and the founder of retailer Uniqlo, Tadashi Yanai, feels the events of March 11 served as a wakeup call to the Japanese about the precarious state of the economy.
He hopes the rebuilding will not be a return to the old ways, but an opportunity to reform the government and make Japan's economy more integrated with the outside world.
"My phone didn't stop ringing."
The manager of a capsule hotel in downtown Sendai says his business is twice what it was a year ago, with no shortage of men willing to pay around $45 to use the baths and occupy a tiny room for the night.
"We used to think, 'let's wait' even though we wanted to buy," says one shopper, carrying a bag from Louis Vuitton.
