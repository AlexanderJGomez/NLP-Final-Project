Susie Wolff became the first female since 1992 to take part in an F1 weekend, but after just four laps at Friday's British Grand Prix practice session the 31-year-old Scot had to retire because of an oil pressure problem.
Claire Williams -- deputy team principal of her father's eponymous race team and another strong female role model in the sport -- explained the team did not need to judge Wolff's driving abilities during her practice debut.
Williams' deputy team principal praised Wolff for her diligence ahead of the session.
Wolff, who competed for six years in the popular German touring car championship before joining F1, has been up against it both on and off the track.
He would have loved it if I'd have done the session and done a good job."
Williams' deputy team principal has also had to deny employing Wolff as the team's development driver was just a publicity stunt.
"It's really cool to see her in a Formula One car.
Susie was one of the very few, if not the only one, I raced against.
"I've still got one more shot at it," said the 31-year-old Wolff.
Asked why it had taken more than 20 years for a female racer to be given another opportunity in a competitive F1 session, Wolff told CNN: "Firstly, if there is no role model out there doing it, for all the little girls who come to the tracks and watch on TV, if they don't see a girl on track then they're not inspired to want to do that themselves.
Of the seven women to join the F1 world championship, only two have ever qualified to start a race.
The late Maria de Villota, who died in October last year, also began her F1 career along with Wolff when she was signed as a development driver by the Marussia team in 2012.
