A spectacular closing ceremony brought an end to the 2014 Sochi Paralympic Games Sunday.
International Paralympic Commitee president Philip Craven told spectators at the stadium: "The Paralympic Spirit has united and infected us all.
Russia's hero of the Games was Roman Petushkov who won six gold medals -- the most by any individual at a single Paralympics.
The 34-year-old visually impaired cross-country skier, competing in his fourth Paralympics, won three gold medals in Sochi and could yet defend his titles at Korea 2018.
"Attitudes toward people with an impairment have changed among Russian society.
The Paralympic Winter Games have become a catalyst for our efforts to create a barrier-free environment in Russia.
