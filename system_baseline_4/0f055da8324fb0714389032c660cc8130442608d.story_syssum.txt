A new story about some New Jersey hospitals seeing a spike in births nine months after Superstorm Sandy has sparked talk that there just might be a post-Sandy baby boom.
"We think we have a Sandy baby," Rubino's patient Meredith Swormstedt and her husband Hank told CNN.
"You may run out of power, but you're not running for your life.
But some hospitals in the area struck by Sandy are not reporting any increase in birth rates nine months after the storm.
Snopes.com, the online myth debunking site, says the baby boom reports that inevitably follow nine months after crises "typically prove to be nothing more than natural fluctuations in the birth rate," or, in many cases, no variation in the birth rate at all.
When post-storm baby booms are reported, they're usually by individual hospitals, not broad regions, he said.
Nine months after the New York City blackout in November 1965, The New York Times reported on a sharp increase in births.
But for the couples CNN spoke with, what matters is the baby boom at home.
