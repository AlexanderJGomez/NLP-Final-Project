Smoke stacks and exhaust pipes around the world are blasting greenhouse gas emissions to a new record annual high.
In the West, emissions contributing to global warming even dropped last year.
The international agreement is designed to decrease emissions contributing to global warming by holding its signees to reduction goals.
But the world's largest carbon emitter, which wrested the dubious title from the United States in recent years, pumped 5.9% more into the atmosphere in 2012 than in the previous year.
In 2012, the largest contributors of greenhouse gases were China with 27%, the United States with 14% and the European Union with 10%.
On an individual basis, China and the EU were at the same level, with 7.7 tons of carbon gas emitted per person and year.
