Earlier this week, CNN spoke to four protesters about their hopes, demands and expectations, from a veteran demonstrator in Cairo who has marched in crowds since the beginning of Egypt's revolution in 2011 to a first-time protester in the port city of Alexandria.
[The] square exploded with joy once protesters knew that Morsy was no longer the president.
I was happy that Morsy was toppled, but I was concerned, too.
I would personally prefer that we achieve our goals and demands without any interference from the military.
Those in power [now] should stick to the demands of the people.
[The] people must keep a close watch on those in power and take action if there's any deviation from their demands and goals.
I sat down in a corner of the square and observed people celebrating and tried to capture it on camera.
This army made it clear, by choosing a civilian to lead the interim process ... that the masses of people would not revolt back at the army as before.
Those in power now should focus on economic reform to reach the demands of the lower income brackets.
Morsy should step back, and face legal matters if there any [and] we [will] steadily build our country.
The people can do a lot to support their leaders -- they just need a guide, and the people will do miracles.
I'm one of the people who does not want the army to rule the country, so the interim president is the most suitable solution to avoid having the army ruling.
Whoever is in power now should prepare fast for presidential elections and complete the transitional period as early as possible.
