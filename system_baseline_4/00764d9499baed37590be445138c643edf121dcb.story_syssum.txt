(CNN) -- Attention white Anglo-Saxon Protestants: Your days of running things are over.
But it's over.
Even some of the keynote speakers at the Democratic and Republican conventions were not WASPs.
Neither the current Speaker of the House (John Boehner: Catholic) nor the Senate majority leader (Harry Reid: Mormon) is WASP.
The demographics of our nation are changing and, by 2042, minorities are expected to become the majority in the U.S.
There's little doubt that we will see more diverse presidential candidates.
And we will likely see in the not too distant future a president who is Latino, Asian, Jewish, Sikh or Muslim.
So, how did we get to where we are today where the white Protestant establishment seems to be losing power?
Back in the days when our nation was founded, only white men who owned land could vote.
In our first presidential election in 1789, no women, no blacks, no poor white men, and in many states neither Catholics nor Jews, were permitted to vote.
And it took all the way to 1920 -- more than 100 years after our first president was elected -- that women were finally given the right to vote with the passage of the 19th Amendment to our Constitution.
So WASPs, you've had your great run.
And there is no doubt that another white Protestant will rise up one day against the growing odds and win the White House.
