York County Prison correctional officers David Whitcomb, 28, Mark Haynes, 26 and Daniel Graff, 37, were charged with official oppression and harassment on Friday after a state police investigation, Pennsylvania State Trooper Robert Hicks told CNN.
The state police report also said that officers also told Wright that they would give him lounge food if he permitted them to punch him in the leg and arm.
Like Wright, James Hicks also was given food in exchange for letting the officers punch and choke him, police said.
They controlled the distribution of the food and the coffee, and they were using them to entice the inmates to engage in these activities," Trooper Hicks said.
All three correctional officers have been placed on administrative leave, Trooper Hicks said.
