Washington (CNN) -- The chairman of the Republican Party and a leading GOP senator called on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to give up his post Sunday, following the publication of remarks he made about President Obama's race in 2008.
The Congressional Black Caucus has accepted Reid's apology and is dismissing calls for him to step down as majority leader.
Tim Kaine of Virginia, chairman of the Democratic Party, said "the case is closed" following Reid's round of apologies.
Democrats rejected the calls for Reid's dismissal, and Reid's office made clear he has no plans to step down.
I was a proud and enthusiastic supporter of Barack Obama during the campaign and have worked as hard as I can to advance President Obama's legislative agenda," Reid said.
"I have worked hard to advance issues important to the African-American community," he said.
"Harry Reid called me today and apologized for an unfortunate comment reported today," the president said.
Steele, the GOP's first African-American chairman, was asked about the remarks on both "Meet the Press" and "Fox News Sunday."
"As we await his explanation, Sen. Reid should do the right thing, follow the example that he himself set in 2002, and step down as majority leader," Cornyn said.
"Anybody looking at Trent Lott's statements praising somebody who had been a pro-segregation candidate for president will see that there is no comparison between those comments and those of Sen. Reid," Kaine told NBC.
Nevada state Senate Majority Leader Steven Horsford, who is African-American, affirmed his support for Reid in a statement Saturday.
I wasn't intending to say a racial slur at all," Steele said.
