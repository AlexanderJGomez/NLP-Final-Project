For many that realization has been brought about by the Guantanamo detainees themselves, who unable to voice their despair in any other way are now on hunger strike in large numbers.
Even the U.S. military now admits that more than 50 of the 166 detainees in the camp are now involved.
Yet he is still in Guantanamo, more than a decade on from being taken into U.S. custody.
I want to carry my kids when I get home."
Nabil has been cleared for release since 2007 -- yet over five years on from U.S. authorities deciding that he is no threat to anyone, he still languishes in Guantanamo.
He too has joined the hunger strike.
Like Shaker and Nabil, Younus has never been given a trial or charged with any crime, and has been cleared for release by the U.S. authorities.
On Thursday the European Parliament tabled an urgent hearing on the hunger strike in Guantanamo.
There is much to welcome in the motion: a call for Europe to re-engage, to demand the closure of Guantanamo, and, crucially, to offer to resettle the dozen or so prisoners who have been cleared for release but cannot go home because of the risk of torture.
If Europe follows through on this, there will still be hope that one day soon, men like Shaker, Nabil and Younous will be reunited with their families.
