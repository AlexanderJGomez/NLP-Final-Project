Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- A battle raged in a strategically located Libyan city Saturday as state television showed a fist-pumping Moammar Gadhafi visiting a school, his first public appearance in days.
NATO said in the past 24 hours its aircraft destroyed loyalist ammunition stockpiles east of Tripoli that were supplying troops shelling Misrata and other cities.
Opposition spokesman Shamsiddin Abdulmolah told CNN that rebels flew two attack helicopters from Tobruk to join the fighting in Ajdabiya.
The South African government also said NATO has granted the committee permission to meet with Gadhafi in the Libyan capital, Tripoli.
The United Nations said Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will travel to Cairo Thursday to head meetings on Libya at the Arab League headquarters.
State TV also aired images Gadhafi visiting on Saturday what appeared to be a primary school in Tripoli.
Weldon visited Libya in 2004 when he was a Republican congressman from Pennsylvania and said he was invited this time by Gadhafi.
Peace efforts seemed distant Saturday in Ajdabiya, where Gadhafi's forces attacked with a barrage of artillery fire at the city's western gates.
But loyalist forces have steadily pushed the rebels back and now stand poised to run down the highway to Benghazi, the opposition's capital.
"The troops of Gadhafi have good weapons and have training and have leadership and have experience," one rebel fighter said.
