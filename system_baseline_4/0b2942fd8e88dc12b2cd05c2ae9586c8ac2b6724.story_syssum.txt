(CNN) -- House Speaker John Boehner's threatened lawsuit against President Obama has elicited scorn from the right and blistering attacks from the left.
Boehner's not a bad guy.
Highly influential conservative blogger and pundit Erick Erickson calls the Boehner lawsuit "taxpayer-funded political theater" and notes that some of Boehner's complaints about Obama are political, not legal or constitutional.
A second way Boehner is being hypocritical is his support for robust executive authority when George W. Bush was exercising it.
Now, here's the depressing part: Boehner's sue first, ask questions later strategy just might work.
Obviously, I can't get into Boehner's head.
Perhaps his lawsuit is just one strand of a handful of spaghetti he's throwing against the wall just to get through the day and survive the latest tea party onslaught.
Perhaps realizing that shifting demographics and a divided GOP will make it difficult to put a Republican back in the White House, they may seize on Boehner's lawsuit and use it to further crimp the power of the chief executive.
