"In the first three months, I saw such a fast improvement, now I'm worried about plateauing," said Jason Dinant.
Since January, Dinant, an iReporter, has tried to get  six-pack abs in time for his 10-year high school reunion in June.
His car is to be accompanied by rows of shirtless men who also have six-packs.
With the parade only two months away, Dinant said: "Now I'm in high drive.
To get in shape, he works out four to five days a week, performing a combination of core exercises, dumbbell curls and pull-ups.
"You can't see a six-pack through fat," Dinant said.
Body builders try to offset the weight loss by consuming protein powders and supplements, Dothard said.
"It's hard to eat that much protein," Dinant said.
My whole body has become healthier and better."
While pleased with the results, Dinant worried that with two-thirds of a six-pack, his body will begin to plateau.
"Jason has to do something different or harder to maintain results to keep on the track that he's on," Dothard said.
Nothing's wrong.
