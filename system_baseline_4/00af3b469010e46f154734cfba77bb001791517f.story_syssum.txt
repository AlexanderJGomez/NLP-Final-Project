(CNN) -- A Florida exterminator and father of four children adopted from Florida's foster care system has told police that a body found in the pest-control truck he was driving is one of them -- his 10-year-old daughter, authorities said Wednesday.
After Barahona and his son were taken to a hospital, a worker decontaminating the truck discovered the body of the girl, wrapped in a plastic bag, the document said.
Barahona said he didn't go through with his suicide plan because his son was with him, the document added.
Mary Olsen said.
Scott said the chemicals were so potent that staff caring for the boy at the hospital became ill as well, he said.
Olsen said police would decide how to charge Barahona further once the autopsy on his daughter determines her cause of death.
Florida's Department of Children and Families had opened a child protection investigation within the past few days to look into a complaint involving the Barahona family, and it wasn't the first such complaint, spokesman Mark Riordan said.
The story was corroborated by interviews with the other two children in the home, officials said in court.
However, a spokesman for the department, John Harrell, said it is the job of investigators to follow through immediately or refer to someone else in the department to follow through when a matter is urgent.
