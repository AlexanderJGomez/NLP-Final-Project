Well, that's what I'm doing right now," said John Berlin, staring into the camera with moist, red-rimmed eyes.
Well, my son passed away ... and we can't access his Facebook account.
His name's Jesse Berlin.
As Berlin listened, stunned, they told him would indeed make a personalized "A Look Back" video for Jesse, using posts he had made public on Facebook before his death in 2012 at age 21.
"These (Facebook) videos really touched me.
A Facebook spokesperson said Berlin's video came to the attention of a staffer Wednesday, who shared it on an internal network.
Facebook realizes that by granting Berlin's wish, they risk being deluged with similar requests from other users wanting to see video highlights of their deceased loved ones.
"This experience reinforced to us that there's more Facebook can do to help people celebrate and commemorate the lives of people they have lost," he said.
John Berlin said his son Jesse died of natural causes in his sleep on the morning of January 28, 2012.
"Jesse was all about having fun," his father said.
John Berlin posted Jesse's "A Look Back" video on Friday to YouTube and his Facebook page, where it's been liked and shared thousands of times.
"I can't express how much this means to me."
