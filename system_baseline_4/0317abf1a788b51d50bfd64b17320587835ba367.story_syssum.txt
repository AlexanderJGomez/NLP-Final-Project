KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A New York Times reporter who was kidnapped last week was freed Wednesday in a pre-dawn military raid in Afghanistan that left a British commando, an Afghan journalist and several others dead.
Sultan Munad, an Afghan journalist accompanying Farrell, also was killed in the raid, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said.
Farrell called the newspaper's foreign editor before dawn and said he was "extracted" in a commando raid after a fierce firefight, according to a report on the Times Web site.
but dropped in a hail of bullets, Farrell said.
He didn't know whether the shots came from allied or militant fire.
"The obvious link for us is that Farrell is a British national.
Local Afghans provided information and helped the commandos locate where Farrell was being held, said another British official who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.
The operation to rescue the hostages happened after extensive planning and consideration, Brown said.
Ten weeks earlier, another Times reporter escaped after months in Taliban captivity.
The death toll in the Kunduz airstrike, which Farrell was covering when he was kidnapped, has varied, depending on the source, but local Afghan officials have said at least half of those killed were civilians.
Farrell, who joined The New York Times two years ago, also was briefly kidnapped in April 2004 in Falluja, Iraq.
In a separate incident Wednesday, a suicide attack killed at least two civilians and injured several others, including NATO personnel, near the main British military base in southern Afghanistan, the ISAF said.
