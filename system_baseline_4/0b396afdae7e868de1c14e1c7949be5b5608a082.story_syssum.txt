Washington (CNN) -- Ralph Nader floated the idea this week that a primary challenge to President Obama will help the president and the country.
In 2000, he siphoned enough votes from Al Gore in Florida to swing the election to President Bush.
If Nader were being honest with himself, he'd look to 2000 as an example of what the consequences can be for the country and progressive causes when progressives don't stick together.
Look at the record: Bush took President Clinton's budget surplus and squandered it.
Wall Street bankers got the green light to play by their own rules.
Bush policies cost millions of Americans their jobs.
And Nader thinks a primary challenge is a good idea?
Nader knows there is another progressive activist: Cornel West, who also seeks to stir a primary challenge against Obama.
Here's "the myth": Nader's and West's advocacy of primary challenges is based on the premise that Obama neither speaks to nor fights for progressive ideals.
Obama repeatedly called for a tax system in which all people pay their fair share, including the wealthiest Americans.
He outlawed the use of those so-called pre-existing conditions that forced many Americans to go without health insurance or pay exorbitant premiums.
The question facing progressives is not whether Obama should have a primary challenger.
Rather, it is: Do they want to return to the disastrous economic and social policies advocated by the tea party and the Republican presidential candidates today?
