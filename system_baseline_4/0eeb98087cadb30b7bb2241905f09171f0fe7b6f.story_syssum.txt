Martin O'Malley is laying the groundwork for a presidential campaign with the intent of being ready should Hillary Clinton not run, a source close to the governor told CNN.
O'Malley is angling to be the person who could step in should Clinton decide to forgo a second White House candidacy.
And that may be with good reason, as an O'Malley vs. Clinton race would likely be an uphill slog for the governor.
Instead of stoking speculation, the source said O'Malley is being a good party man.
Looking more closely, here how it breaks down for O'Malley and what's likely influencing his thinking around Hillary Clinton and a presidential run.
In a November 2013 CNN/ ORC International Poll, 2% of Democrats said they would like to see O'Malley nominated for President in 2016.
In a Washington Post poll early last year, only 8% of Maryland Democrats -- people who likely know the governor's record -- said they would back him in a hypothetical nomination in 2016.
For example, Ready for Hillary -- a super PAC urging Clinton to run -- raised more than $4 million in 2013.
For the past eight years, O'Malley has led Maryland as a proud liberal.
And while Clinton would support most -- if not all -- of the proposals O'Malley has pursued, new polling shows the space for a liberal alternative to Clinton isn't that big.
During the 2008 primaries -- which pitted Clinton against then-Sen. Barack Obama -- O'Malley was outspoken and raised a substantial amount of money.
The point of all this: Should Clinton run in 2016, O'Malley would likely be a supporter.
