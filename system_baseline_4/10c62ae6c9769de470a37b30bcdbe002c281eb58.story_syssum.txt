The package originated from Yemen -- the source of last week's thwarted bomb plot -- said New York Police Department Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne.
The package was addressed to a New York destination, a law enforcement source said.
FBI agents, Port Authority police and U.S. Customs and Border Protection had inspected the package "out of an abundance of caution," New York FBI spokesman Rich Kolko said.
Senior law enforcement officials said the package was one of the more than a dozen packages from Yemen that investigators had been looking for since Friday.
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, meanwhile, talked about cargo screening with top representatives of global shipping companies including DHL, FedEx, TNT and UPS, her department said.
Yemen said Monday that it is tightening security at all of its airports.
U.S. authorities are said to be also looking at al-Asiri because the parcel bombs used the same explosive, PETN, as last year's foiled underwear bomber, also linked to him.
After last week's incident, the TSA and U.S. Customs and Border Protection took immediate steps to enhance measures for screening inbound cargo, including grounding packages originating from Yemen destined for the U.S., the TSA said.
