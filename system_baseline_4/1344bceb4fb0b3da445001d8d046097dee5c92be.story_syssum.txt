Tata Group Chairman Ratan Tata, whose company owns the Taj hotel, discusses this week's attacks in Mumbai.
But Tata Group Chairman Ratan Tata said those measures, which were eased shortly before this week's terror attacks, could not have prevented gunmen from entering the hotel.
However, Tata said the attackers did not enter through the entrance that has a metal detector.
All of our arrangements are in the front," he said.

Bullet holes and scars of grenade blasts marred the restaurant walls in the Taj Mahal hotel, Tata said.
As an example, Tata said it took three hours for firefighters to get water to the Taj after a blaze broke out in the oldest part of the building.
"They seemed to know [the hotel] in the night or in the daytime," he said of the attackers.
"We've been very complacent, because we've really not had this kind of terrorism inflicted upon us," he said.
Tata said he derived those sentiments from members of his staff, who have pledged to stand behind him and restore the Taj to its former grandeur.
"The general manager lost his whole family in one of the fires in the building," Tata said.
We will not let this event take us down.'"
