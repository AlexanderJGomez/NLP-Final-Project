Washington (CNN) -- When you consider the array of public men who have been forced, in one way or another, to come clean on their bad behavior, the list is not insubstantial: a president (Bill Clinton), presidential candidates (John Edwards, Gary Hart), governors (Mark Sanford, Eliot Spitzer), senators (John Ensign, David Vitter).
Or both.
Just ask Bill Clinton, now serving as philanthropist to the world.
But here's the rub: Cain also tells us that the National Restaurant Association investigated the charges against him and found them to be "baseless."
And there's another plus: The partisans and the interest groups will have to start dealing with the facts.
Recall back in the day when Clinton was in the middle of the Lewinsky mess.
Feminist groups are outraged by the charges against Cain and lots of Republican partisans are defending him, choosing to level their scrutiny on the women instead.
"For we who led the charge against Bill Clinton on a number of related issues to continue to blame the media or other campaigns or say it simply doesn't matter makes us the hypocrites as well," he wrote on CNN.com.
Then take a turn, and start decrying "anonymous" charges.
And the fact that Hillary was right about those who were "out to get" Clinton does not mean he was in the clear.
The bar may be set low for the politicians, but the public somehow manages to rise above it.
