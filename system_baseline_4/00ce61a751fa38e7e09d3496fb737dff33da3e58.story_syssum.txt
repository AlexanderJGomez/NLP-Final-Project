(CNN) -- The melting glacial ice in places like the Alps, Greenland and the Himalayas is a dramatic visual document of how our planet's climate is changing.
Balog says putting the documentary together has changed his initial skepticism about climate change.
A landscape that is now gone and will never be seen again in the history of civilization."
Climate scientists have previously predicted the Arctic could lose almost all of its ice cover in the summer months by 2100.
While accepting that glacial ice melting has happened many times before in human history, Balog says what he is documenting now can no longer be considered a natural process.
We're now at 395 ppm and adding more every year.
I believe that this film can help shift public perceptions by telling people a story that is real and happening now," he says.
