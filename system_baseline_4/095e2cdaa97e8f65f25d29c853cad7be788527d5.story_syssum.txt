Khan said he boarded a New York-bound plane in Toronto on Friday when two U.S. immigration officials asked him to step outside.
I mean, it was so ridiculous, I didn't even know how to answer it."
He has two more fund-raisers on the schedule, in San Francisco and Los Angeles, before he returns home to Pakistan, Khan said.
Khan has been a fierce critic of U.S. policy in Pakistan and the use of drone strikes, calling them a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and a strategy that stokes militant anger toward Washington.
Khan says people he has spoken to in the tribal region say most of the people killed are innocent civilians.
