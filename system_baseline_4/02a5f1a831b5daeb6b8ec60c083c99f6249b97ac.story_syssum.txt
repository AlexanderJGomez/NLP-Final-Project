For their wedding, they received several antiques that they often spent weekends fixing up.
By 2008, when recession caused many small businesses to close shop, the Scotts left their day jobs to grow the business, Barn Light Electric Company.
Last year, Scott reported, the company pulled in $10 million in revenue.
I didn't know if it was going to last," he said.
They've been married for 29 years, Scott said, and building Barn Light made them stronger.
"First, have a passion for what you're doing and don't approach it as a money-making opportunity," he said.
The company bought the patents of old lighting businesses, including Benjamin Electric Manufacturing Company, and allows employees and customers to suggest ideas for new styles.
Johnny Bragg, manufacturing general manager for Barn Light and Bryan Scott's uncle, calls Barn Light the best job he's ever had.
Bragg thinks of his fellow employees as close friends, he said.
The company pays well, employees said, and has a sense of humor, too.
Locals may see a new building and go "Oh, its Barn Light, they're getting bigger again," Barn Light's communications coordinator Betty Lynne said.
"It speaks to his heart," Lynne says of Bryan and the work ethic of the couple.
