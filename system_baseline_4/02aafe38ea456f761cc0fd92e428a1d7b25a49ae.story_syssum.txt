(CNN) -- New Sunderland owner Ellis Short insists that he will not interfere on the football side following his takeover of the English Premier League club.
"Niall is a very smart footballer, very smart about the Premier League and is a wonderful chairman of the club who knows more about football than I ever will, so I will be in the background and Niall will be running the show.
With me coming in, you get all of these other good ingredients that are already in place at the club and can add to that a streamlined decision making process, a streamlined board and with some financial ability to make some moves -- and we think that is the missing piece that this club has needed."
I fully expect that Niall will be able to make good personnel decisions going forward."
Meanwhile, prospective Portsmouth owner Al Fahim has told fans he intends to build a "great football club" once his takeover is completed.
"Everything I have seen makes me sure that we can build a great football club in the years to come," he told arabianbusiness.com.
