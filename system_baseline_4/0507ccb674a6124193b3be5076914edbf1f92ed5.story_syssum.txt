PostYourTest.com is an educational tool that lets students anonymously upload materials and tests from their previous and current classes, said Demir Oral, creator of the site.
"For my classes I always write new exams every time, and I wouldn't object because I have some old exams up online that I've posted myself," Bojan said.
Currently, there are no tests online for Penn State University, because the site was developed on the West Coast, Oral said.
While she said she wouldn't go through the trouble of posting a test herself, Cozier said she didn't think students posting old tests online would be a problem.
"Most teachers give out practice exams and old exams anyway," she said.
She said the site might be OK only if students get permission from their teachers to post exams online.
Students shouldn't have to rely on old tests online to prepare for an exam from a new teacher, Hall said.
"One problem is old tests may not be the most effective study tool," she said.
