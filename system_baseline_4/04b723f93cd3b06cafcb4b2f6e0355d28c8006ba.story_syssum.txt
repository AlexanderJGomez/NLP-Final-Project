Christopher Coleman sits in the back of a police car after his arrest Tuesday in the slayings of his wife and two sons.
Coleman was arrested Tuesday at his parents' home in Chester, Illinois.
Coleman said he was calling the house to make sure the boys were waking up for school, Connor said.
The message in the Coleman home was written in paint of a similar color, the article said.
Coleman previously worked in the security department for Joyce Meyer Ministries, an evangelical Christian organization based in suburban St. Louis, said spokesman Roby Walker.
Neither Coleman nor his attorneys have commented on that report, the Post-Dispatch said.
