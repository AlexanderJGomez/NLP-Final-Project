(CNN) -- With extreme heat and the worst drought in half a century continuing to plague the farm states, there are important lessons to be learned for all of us -- farmers, consumers and the world's poorest populations alike -- about the effect of climate change.
About 90% of the corn acreage is backed by a generously subsidized federal insurance program, described by Steven Colbert as "Obamacare for the corn," so crop farmers will be just fine.
Will high commodity prices affect the prices of food you eat?
Commodity prices account for just a tiny share of retail food prices.
People in rich countries like the U.S. are not going to eat much less or much differently as a result of modestly higher prices.
In 2008 and 2011, when corn prices went up to levels nearly as high as today's, the world saw a sharp rise in food riots.
In 2011, about 40% of U.S. corn crops were diverted to ethanol (a quarter, if we take into account that nutritional content is recycled back into feeds for animals in the form of distiller grains).
This summer's extreme heat may just become typical in 15 years.
Farmers can adjust to earlier planting times, perhaps avoiding some extreme temperatures during the sensitive flowering period, and lengthening the growing season.
And farmers planted much earlier than usual, many using new drought-tolerant varieties.
In the long term, a warming world will be a difficult challenge for our crops and all of us.
