Copenhagen (CNN)Denmark was on edge Tuesday, as it emerged that the suspected gunman in the weekend terror attacks in Copenhagen apparently swore allegiance to ISIS' leader, and armed police responded to a bomb scare at the scene of one of the shootings.
News that the suspected gunman swore fidelity to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a posting made on what's apparently his Facebook page just before the shooting spree began Saturday will also disturb many.
While police haven't formally released the name of the gunman, they said he was a 22-year-old man born in Denmark.
Police also said he was "known in connection to gangs."
Charges have been filed against two men who are accused of helping to hide the gunman, the men's attorney said Monday.
"An attack on Denmark's Jews is an attack on everyone," she said.
We will stand together and continue the everyday life we know.
The Danish Film Institute said he was director Finn Noergaard.
He is due to be laid to rest Thursday at the Mosaiske Vestre Jewish cemetery, the society said.
CNN's Karl Penhaul and Dominique Van Heerden in Copenhagen contributed to this report, as did CNN's Ralph Ellis, Holly Yan and Hamdi Alkhshali.
