A petition created a few years ago calls on Amazon to change the name of the program from "Amazon Mom" to "Amazon Family."
In 2013, Miller called on men and women to sign the petition to get Amazon to change the name of the program.
Why is that?
They are ruled by a freakin' queen!
he wrote.
Mike Heenan, a stay-at-home father of two in Northern California and founder of the blog At-Home Dad Matters, never got to meet Miller but says that when Miller welcomed him into his community of dad bloggers, it changed his life.
"We are continuing a cause that was once championed by the creator of the Dad Bloggers Facebook group, Oren Miller," wrote Bishop.
Amazon has not commented on the movement.
Do you think Amazon should re-name its "Amazon Mom" program "Amazon Family"?
