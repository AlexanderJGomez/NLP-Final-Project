(CNN) -- Call David X. Cohen a nerd all you like, but never call him a geek.
I'd rather be called a nerd.
"Family Guy's" ratings and DVD sales convinced Fox to give it a second chance, and the rest is history.
Finally, in 2007, fans had their "Futurama" back, in not one, but four direct-to-DVD movies.
The most exciting new thing about this season of "Futurama," according to Cohen, is that it's, well, new.
"I want to reassure our fans that this will be the real classic 'Futurama' back to its original form.
Gore will make his record-breaking fourth guest appearance," Cohen said.
"Our tenth episode of the new season is written by Dr. Ken Keeler, and it involves the characters switching minds, and it becomes very complicated due to the nature of this to work our way back to the original body, and requires solving a mathematical problem," Cohen explained.
Fans of "Futurama," nerdy or otherwise, wouldn't want it any other way.
