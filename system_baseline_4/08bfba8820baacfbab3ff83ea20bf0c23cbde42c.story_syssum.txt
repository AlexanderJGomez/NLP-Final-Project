Philadelphia (CNN) -- For many families, a night at the ballpark is a treat.
"They're frustrated and they're scared and they're just overwhelmed," said Debra Forman, whose 8-year-old son, Adam, has autism.
Dr. Wendy Ross was heartbroken to hear stories like this from families.
So in 2007, Ross set out to do just that.
Today, her nonprofit, Autism Inclusion Resources, helps families affected by autism navigate challenging social situations, such as airport travel, sporting events and museum visits.
"You can't turn down the volume of the world," Ross said.
"I don't expect the staff to be experts, just to be aware of it and (be) understanding," Ross said.
Ross also helps prepare the families for the event.
Ross hopes that this supported experience will give families the confidence to return on their own.
Ross has also found her airport travel program to be successful for families.
Soon she wants to partner with the city's public transportation agency.
Ross also hopes that the tools she gives families can help them explore other settings on their own.
"Hopefully, there will be zoos in our future, and aquariums," Forman said.
