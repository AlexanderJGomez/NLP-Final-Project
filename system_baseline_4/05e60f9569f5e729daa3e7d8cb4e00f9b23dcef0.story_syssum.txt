(CNN) -- The Pentagon must hold down its spending and make choices that will anger "powerful people" in an era of economic strain, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in a weekend speech in Kansas.
Nearly 50 years later, Gates invoked that history to warn that the cuts on the way "will displease powerful people, both inside the Pentagon and out."
Since taking office in 2006, Gates has managed to cut some of the Pentagon's major weapons systems, but efforts to kill other programs have been defeated under heavy pressure from military contractors and members of Congress.
Gen. Mark Kimmitt, a former U.S. military spokesman in Iraq, told CNN that Gates is trying to preserve U.S. combat power in the face of increasing costs.
Gates asked.
Is it a dire threat that by 2020 the United States will have only 20 times more advanced stealth fighters than China?"
