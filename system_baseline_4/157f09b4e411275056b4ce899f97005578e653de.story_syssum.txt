He was even on the short list to be Romney's running mate.
"I'm announcing today a change of heart on an issue that a lot of people feel strongly about that has to do with gay couples' opportunity to marry," Portman told CNN.
That I want all of my children to have, including our son, who is gay," said Portman.
"My son came to Jane, my wife, and I, told us that he was gay, and that it was not a choice, and that it's just part of who he is, and that's who he'd been that way for as long as he could remember," said Portman.
Portman says his son, now a junior in college, helped him work through his decision to announce his change in position on gay marriage and blessed the idea of publicly announcing Will Portman's sexuality.
"I told Mitt Romney everything," said Portman with a laugh.
"Well, because they told me," said Portman.
And it forced him to re-think the issue too, and over time, he changed his view on it," said Portman.
You know, I followed my heart," he said.
Portman admitted that when the protest occurred, he already knew his own son was gay.
Look, and to be honest with you, it didn't affect that decision-making much, because it was, I didn't think it was appropriate," Portman said.
Again, my focus has been on other issues over my public policy career," said Portman.
"Well, I would say that, you know, I've had a change of heart based on a personal experience.
To be sure, Portman was anything but comfortable discussing something as private and personal as his son's sexuality, even noting how foreign it felt for someone with his Midwestern upbringing and sensibilities to talk publicly about such issues.
"He wanted to tell us that there's something about him that we didn't know," Portman said, reflecting on the day two years ago his son Will first told his parents he was gay.
Did it change the way you think about same-sex marriage or gay men, lesbians or bisexuals in general?
