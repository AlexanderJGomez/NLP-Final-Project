For Wang is one of the few insiders who dare to speak publicly about something most people in China only whisper about: the fall of the man once touted as a potential Chinese president.
This is sad."
Wang says it all leads back to Bo Xilai, a man known in China as a "princeling," the son of a communist revolutionary hero.
Bo saw Chongqing as the place to make his stand.
The insider, Wang, says the crackdown went too far.
Wang says Bo tried to recreate the Mao era and frightened communist reformers, making new enemies.
Going back to Mao's path is definitely not an option.
Diplomatic, political and business sources now paint a picture of a man fearing for his life after linking Bo's own wife to the murder of a British businessman.
Heywood, who was married to a Chinese woman, then befriended Bo and his wife Gu Kailai.
But they are explosive: now police suspect Bo's wife had Heywood killed.
"It somehow became impossible for Gu to end this relationship with Heywood.
But from this rundown hotel, to the corridors of the Great Hall of the People, the downfall of Bo and his wife is not just about a family in disgrace.
One leader has fallen, but Wang says China may have taken big steps to saving itself in the process.
