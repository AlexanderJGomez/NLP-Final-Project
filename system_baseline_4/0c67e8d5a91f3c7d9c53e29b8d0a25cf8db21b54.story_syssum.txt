In his veto message, President Bush calls on Congress to extend funding for the current program.
The president had proposed adding $5 billion to the program and said the version he vetoed would have encouraged families to leave the private insurance market for the federally funded, state-run program.
House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Democrats were more interested in scoring political points with the veto than in reaching a compromise with Republicans.
Meanwhile, Bush called on Congress to extend funding for the current program to keep the 6 million now covered on the rolls.
