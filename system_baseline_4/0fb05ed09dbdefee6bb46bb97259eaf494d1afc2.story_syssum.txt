Although the company's primary business remains aircraft storage, it has stripped 12 planes completely since its inception
All parts that are saved can be sold on by the aircraft owners.
With Tarmac's parent company, Airbus, predicting that more than 9,000 aircraft will be retired or withdrawn from service over the next 20 years, there's a clear need for aging planes to be disposed of in an environmentally friendly manner.
While the efficiency savings this process brings are obvious, Tarmac also believes that dismantling old planes will allow engineers to better design more efficient aircraft in the future.
As it stands, Tarmac's site in southern France can cater for 20 aircraft at a time, the company says.
It will also ensure aircraft are disposed of in a way that is efficient and makes the most of valuable materials.
