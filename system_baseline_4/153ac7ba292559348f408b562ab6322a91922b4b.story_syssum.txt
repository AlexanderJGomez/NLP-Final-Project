Fukushima, Japan (CNN) -- Mikio Watanabe's Fukushima home is contaminated with radiation and filled with the nightmares of his wife's horrific suicide.
As evacuees from last year's Fukushima nuclear disaster, Mikio and Hamako lost everything: their home, their jobs, and any hope for the future.
In a landmark case, Watanabe filed a lawsuit last month against TEPCO, blaming the utility company for his wife's suicide.
Watanabe wants TEPCO to compensate and treat victims for a man-made accident, which would expedite how the company cares for evacuees.
Watanabe says his wife's depression happened gradually, after they evacuated out of their home into a cramped temporary housing unit.
"We talked a lot then," recalls Watanabe.
Watanabe went to bed with his wife, feeling happier and more comfortable than he had in many weeks.
When I got to the corner of the house, I saw a fire go up at about human height.
Watanabe continued to weed around his house and went inside to take a shower.
Watanabe says it's strange what you remember in trauma.
This wasn't supposed to happen, says Watanabe.
"We lost everything," he says.
I lost my wife in such a terrible way.
Across Fukushima prefecture, crews are scraping away contaminated soil, acre by acre.
"I feel an unspeakable rage," says Watanabe.
