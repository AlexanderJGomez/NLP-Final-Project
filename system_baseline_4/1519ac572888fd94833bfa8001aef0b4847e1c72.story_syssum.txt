Supermodel Natalia Vodianova was discovered in Moscow in a classic rags-to-riches tale.
I go to very remote parts of Russia that are far from Moscow and it gives these children an extra message of love," she told CNN.
Vodianova was born on February 28 1982 in Nizhni Novgorod, the fourth largest city in Russia.
When Vodianova was 11 she began to help out on the family's fruit stall, and at the age of 15 she had moved into her own apartment with her best friend.
I appreciate what she has done for me and the way she raised me"

Vodianova lost a huge amount of weight after the birth and just a few weeks later at the castings for Paris Fashion Week she was the clear favorite among the designers.
Vodianova still found time to walk the runway for the world's great fashion houses, including Chanel, Givenchy, Versace, Balenciaga, Prada, Ralph Lauren, Christian Lacroix, Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci and her good friend Diane Von Furstenberg.
Afterwards, Vodianova took Valentino for a well-deserved holiday to her much-loved city of Moscow.
It would be my dream" Vodianova told CNN.
It's really about people in general -- I really love people and I try to never say no if someone needs my help."
