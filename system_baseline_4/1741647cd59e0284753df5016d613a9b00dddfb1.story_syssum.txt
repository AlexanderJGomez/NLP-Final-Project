It was also the year of the shooter (and the number 3) as "Battlefield 3," "Gears of War 3" and "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3" brought players into combat zones with new and creative gameplay.
As with any top 10 list, many good games did not make the cut.
Not only does the story take a look back and reveal how Drake got started on his quests, but it also tied up many loose plot lines very well.
Players will come away feeling like they've been on a grand adventure, which they have.

"Saints Row the Third" uses them as the canvas of a hilariously funny and sexually charged romp that also offers excellent game mechanics.

An independent title that shows what the "little guy" could do, "Bastion" is a surprisingly stunning game with original weaponry, an environment that players put together as the game progresses and narration that literally tells the story of what you are doing at that time.
It's a game that's fun to play but never takes itself too seriously.
"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim" is an open-world, role-playing game that literally has more than 100 quests to complete.
(PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Windows PC)
His new adventures, "Batman: Arkham City," expand the playing field dramatically and take the insanity into the open world.
This "Batman" game was difficult to put down, even after the main story line (which was highly dramatic) was finished.
(PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Windows PC)
Great dialogue?
Everything you'd expect from a "Portal" title returns in "Portal 2," with some great additions.
If that isn't enough, a new co-op mode allows players to play as test robots that act like Abbott and Costello.
