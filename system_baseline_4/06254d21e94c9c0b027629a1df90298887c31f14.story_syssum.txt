Angelina Jolie has been working to focus attention on problem of refugees in Iraq.
A goodwill ambassador for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Jolie wants to find ways to help the agency be more active inside war-torn Iraq.
More than 4.2 million Iraqis have fled their homes, around 2 million to neighboring states, mostly Syria and Jordan, and another 2.2 million displaced inside Iraq.
"How Iraq settles in the years to come is going to affect the entire Middle East," said Jolie.
In August, Jolie first visited Iraq and Syria to get a sense of the problem.
Jolie said it was crucial that the government prepare a plan to deal with refugees who return home from Syria and Jordan and find that their homes are "occupied" by others or "bombed out."
International agencies, such as the United Nations and the Arab League, and many countries in the region and in Europe are addressing the refugee and the internally displaced persons' crisis, and money is being allocated to Iraq and host countries to help clothe, feed and house people.
It is also attempting to help 41,000 non-Iraqi refugees in Iraq, such as Palestinians and Iranians.
Officials in Iraq and the coalition have been heartened by the fact that some refugees are starting to trickle back home.
