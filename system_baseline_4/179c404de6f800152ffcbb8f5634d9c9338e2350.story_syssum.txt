"There are thousands of tons of medical supplies thrown away every day that are unused or clearly reusable," said Dr. Bruce Charash, a cardiologist in New York.
But one Ugandan hospital, CURE Children's Hospital in Mbale, has been able to operate on Priscilla and more than 1,100 other kids thanks to its partnership with MedShare, a nonprofit that collects surplus supplies and equipment from the U.S.
In the United States, surgical supplies aren't the only useful medical items tossed away.
Richard St. Denis, one of the Top 10 CNN Heroes of 2011, collects discarded wheelchairs through his nonprofit, World Access Project.
"We want to distribute the more than 75,000 wheelchairs we estimate get thrown away in the U.S. every year," he said.
"At the end of a surgical procedure, our staff surveys the scrub table where the kit items remain and segregates all the materials that have been unused," Rosenblatt said.
Charash said.
Occasionally, a hospital will simply switch brands and get rid of an entire line of unused items.
"On my first trip to Africa, the hospital director showed me a patient dying of malaria," Charash said.
But while unused medical equipment is saving many people around the world, only a small percentage of hospitals ever actually receive these items.
"If we can do this with the help of just two U.S. hospitals, imagine how many more could be served if others got involved," Weaver said.
