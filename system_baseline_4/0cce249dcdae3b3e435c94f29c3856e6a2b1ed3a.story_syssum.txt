(RollingStone.com) -- Cee Lo Green, Blake Shelton, Adam Levine and Christina Aguilera -- all four coaches of "The Voice" -- joined producer Mark Burnett, host Carson Daly and the show's social media maven Christina Milian for a press conference Sunday night at Burnett's Malibu home.
Last season there was shock among fans when singer Jesse Campbell, one of the favorites to win the title, was eliminated by coach Christina Aguilera.
The new opportunity for poaching has added a lot to the show, the coaches told Rolling Stone.
"There's nothing that's more nervewracking than knowing, 'Okay, both these singers did really good and I gotta pick one and I know damn good and well one of these other three are gonna steal the person I don't pick,'" he said.
I want to look brilliant."
"It's going to be so exciting for people watching at home," Shelton said.
For the four coaches, though, the biggest strength of this season is their bond.
"Over time we see how each of us react as coaches, giving such heartfelt advice and attention to these up-and-coming young fresh talents and it's so nice to see," she said.
So there's just a magic, there's a bond there that's unbreakable at this point."
But all friends go through that I think and you either go through it and you never speak to each other again or you go through it and your relationship is even stronger.
The show will run this year in both the fall and spring seasons, which could result in one or more of the coaches having to take a sabbatical to go on tour.
Although Burnett said the coaches have their "chairs for live," the assembled journalists were keen to speculate on who the replacement coaches might be.
