(CNN) -- Scores of people who had been without bread for days were killed when Syrian warplanes bombed a bakery in the western village of Halfaya, opposition activists said Sunday.
At least 25 more bodies were still at the site, but hospital workers said the roads were cut off and they were unable to reach the bakery, he said.
It was chaotic," Mahmoud Alawy said.
The town has lacked the ingredients for bread for about a week until an aid group delivered provisions Saturday, Alawy said.
He scrambled toward the scene when he heard cries of "Emergency!
he said.
About an hour after the bakery attack, 15 shells were fired into Halfaya from a nearby town, Al-Rajb said.
Twenty-five people died there, the LCC said.
