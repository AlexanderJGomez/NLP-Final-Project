Foreign ministry spokesman Abubakar Al-Sidiq said that he is not aware of any plans to release Mariam Yahya Ibrahim before a ruling from an appeals court.
Some Western media outlets have reported that Ibrahim would be released in a few days, but her husband said that only the appeals court could free his wife.
The court convicted her of apostasy and adultery two weeks ago.
"
Wani said his wife is a practicing Christian, more so than him, and even had their son baptized.
"
A CNN request for an interview was denied, and the justice minister said they don't comment on such matters because a final judgment has not yet been issued.
His wife, he said, was raised a Christian by her mother, an Ethiopian Orthodox, after her Muslim father deserted the family when Ibrahim was 6.
It is illegal for a Muslim woman to marry a Christian man, therefore we were brought before the court."
In addition to the emotional turmoil resulting from the conviction, the couple also have to worry about their children, Wani said.
"She's in a bad mood," he said of his wife.
In addition to the death sentence, the court sentenced Ibrahim to 100 lashes for the adultery conviction.
Wani said he was optimistic the appeal their lawyers have filed would lead to the court's ruling being overturned.
Perhaps it will result in the judgment being overturned."
"The fact that a woman could be sentenced to death for her religious choice, and to flogging for being married to a man of an allegedly different religion, is abhorrent and should never be even considered," said Manar Idriss, Amnesty International's Sudan researcher.
Foreign embassies in Khartoum, including those of the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, urged the Sudanese government to reverse course.
The last time Sudan executed someone for apostasy was in 1985 when a man criticized Sharia law.
