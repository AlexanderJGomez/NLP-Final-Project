(CNN) -- The shooting death of a 21-year-old Mississippi State University student in a campus dorm room is thought to be an "isolated incident," and there is no indication others are endangered, the school's president said Sunday.
Bill Kibler, vice president for student affairs at the Starkville, Mississippi, school, said Saturday the victim was shot more than once.
Campus police stepped up patrols, Keenum said, assisted by officers from Starkville and the Oktibbeha County Sheriff's Office.
Keenum said he could not release many details because of the ongoing investigation, led by university police and assisted by authorities from the city, county and the Mississippi Highway Patrol.
"Mississippi State University's main campus is located in a rural, low crime area," the university website said.
