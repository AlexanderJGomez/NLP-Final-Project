A U.S. sailor stands accused of ringing doorbells in the middle of the night and breaking into a 72-year-old woman's property while drunk, say police in Yokosuka, Japan.
Being off-base without permission could put Silva in breach of a standing curfew for all U.S. military service members in Japan.
"The U.S. Navy takes this incident seriously," said USS George Washington spokesman Derrick Ingle.
Relations between the Japanese and the U.S. military also suffered in 1995 when a U.S. sailor and two U.S. Marines were convicted of raping a 12-year-old girl.
Tens of thousands of Okinawans took to the streets at the time demanding that the United States leave the island.
