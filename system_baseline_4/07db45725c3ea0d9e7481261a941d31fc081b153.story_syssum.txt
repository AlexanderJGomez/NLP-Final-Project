(CNN) -- No one may ever know for sure whether Ohio's execution of Dennis McGuire -- in a procedure during which he reportedly gasped, snorted and struggled -- was inhumane, but his family and medical and legal experts said Friday the ordeal points out fundamental flaws in the use of lethal injection.
"This one was different," he said in a posting on the newspaper's website.
He said the family plans to file a lawsuit next week in federal court seeking an injunction against the state's use of the drug combination, alleging that it represents cruel and unusual punishment and, as such, violates the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution.
"The family will be satisfied if this process stops," Rion said.
The family's concern that other people should not have to endure such treatment makes "a nice political statement," Berman said, but may not be enough to file a claim related to the fait accompli.
"What happened to Dennis McGuire is consistent with what a number of prominent medical experts said would happen," she said.
Previously, Ohio used a single drug, pentobarbital, for many of its executions, but the manufacturer has said it did not want its product to be used in executions and the state's stockpiles of the drug had expired, Dieter said.
As different states begin to use different drug combinations, "some of this is a bit of an experiment," Dieter said.
And then that's all."
The description of McGuire's final moments "sounds like suffering to me," he said.
The compounds used by Ohio are in short supply, and their diversion from use in treating people to use in execution is questionable, he said.
But the medicalization of the procedure has been perfunctory, he said in a telephone interview, noting that neither of the two drugs used on McGuire appears to have been tested in animals for lethality.
"I think they take about 10 seconds," he said.
