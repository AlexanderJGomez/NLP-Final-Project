But his invitation to testify before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on immigration was the real joke.
Does anyone believe that the real problem with immigration is a lack of attention to the issue?
In the 21 months I have served on the Immigration Subcommittee, we have met 11 times.
Although I have sponsored and co-sponsored more than a dozen bills and resolutions on immigration none has ever been given time before the subcommittee.
Instead, the Democrats brought in Colbert.
The entire fiasco only highlights the fact that during a time when Democrats control the House, the Senate and the presidency, the Subcommittee on Immigration has done virtually nothing.
Most of us on the subcommittee would agree that we need to fix legal immigration.
They deserve leadership in Congress that will take the issue of immigration seriously instead of turning it into a comedy bit.
