Tavis Smiley, talk show host and author, has always used his platform to discuss the issues of the black community and the country as a whole.
President Obama said during the 2008 campaign that we should be able to disagree without being disagreeable.
Smiley has accused the president of ignoring the issues of the black community.
They ignore the positive moves Obama has made to benefit -- in real ways -- the black community, the poor, the disadvantaged, and the country as a whole.
No longer will there be kids fresh out of college starting in entry level positions walking around with no health insurance.
Then there is the Children's Health Insurance Re-authorization Act, signed into law by Obama, which provides health care to millions of kids .
President Obama signed The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which invests $5 billion in early childhood programs like Head Start.
There's more.
Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, restoring basic protections against pay discrimination
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, about 45 million Americans live in poverty.
If West and Smiley would like Obama to do more, that's valid.
His campaign adviser, David Axelrod, says Obama will soon announce a jobs plan that is expected to include an extension of payroll tax cuts, new revenue for transportation projects and an extension of emergency unemployment benefits.
I'm not saying that President Obama should be exempt from criticism, nor do I believe it is some act of racial treason for a black person to hold our president accountable for his actions.
We must not forget the mess that President Obama walked into.
Our climb will be steep.
