If you get bored easily, have many interests, like to take risks and prefer to make your own rules, then you may be one of them.
In his new book "Make Your Own Rules: A Renegade Guide to Unconventional Success," Rogers details how he was able to triumph in such a wide variety of business endeavors, all of which were independent pursuits.
Not so, says Rogers.
While many would see a lack of experience as a deterrent to entering a particular business, Rogers saw it as a benefit.
"Your ability to comply with the blizzard of paperwork and reports required by various rules that come down from Washington, D.C., your state capital or your local zoning board may mean the difference between success and failure," Rogers says.
"Size is not efficient," Rogers says.
Keep your business small, and you keep your business innovative, he says.
Work with good people: Choose the people you bring into your business wisely, Rogers says.
"I have found that it is always easier for me to understand someone who operates outside the mainstream and who looks at things differently from others in his field," Rogers says.
