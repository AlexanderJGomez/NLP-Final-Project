Angelina Jolie said that sheltering countries can learn from the way refugees survive their difficulties.
Tears flowed as refugees and displaced people shared their harrowing experiences and advocates related what they'd seen in refugee camps.
Jolie spoke of her visits to refugee camps in Tanzania and Pakistan.
According to a U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees survey of displacement trends in 2008, there are 42 million uprooted people -- 15.2 million were refugees, 26 million were internally displaced people and 827,000 were asylum seekers.
Jolie recounted her meeting with a pregnant Afghan refugee.
He said internally displaced people "face the same plight [as refugees].
They have lost the same as refugees.
She spoke at the event and described her ordeal.
Soon after her gesture toward the prison commanders, her family was freed after their 16-month ordeal.
"I want to encourage the refugees don't give up," she said.
