Its patented "breathable shoe" technology -- a combination of a membrane insole that absorbs sweat and lets it out through an outer sole filled with holes -- has turned the company into a multi-million dollar shoe empire.
When Polegato returned to Italy he started to develop a shoe with holes in the sole that let air in and perspiration out.
In every factory where we produce there is an Italian technician, a shoemaker, that controls shoe by shoe," said Polegato.
Polegato says the solution is to look further afield than Italy and its neighboring countries: "Our strategy now is to invest more in some countries with economic growth, like the Asia Pacific area, Eastern Europe, India and Turkey," he said.
"Our program now is to open 300 Geox stores in China," he added.
