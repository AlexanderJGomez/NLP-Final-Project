The likes of Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) and Domino's pizza are opening up in African growth markets from Nigeria to Angola to give consumers a taste of U.S. cuisine.
And with growing political and economic stability, Western fast food brands are approaching the region with a renewed sense of optimism, according to Schulze.
In May, Burger King opened for business in South Africa and last year Domino's -- the U.S. pizza chain -- opened its first African store in Nigeria, the continent's most populous nation.
He added: "To compete in the market we have very competitive prices.
However, the cost of Western fast food brands in many parts of Africa relative to wages remains high, excluding many people, who simply cannot afford it.
A McKinsey & Company 2012 report on African consumers projects $410 billion in growth for consumer-facing industries across Africa by 2020; of this roughly 45% or $185 billion will flow from apparel, consumer goods and food businesses.
The report also found Africans remain "exceptionally optimistic about their economic future" and very brand conscious in purchasing decisions.
