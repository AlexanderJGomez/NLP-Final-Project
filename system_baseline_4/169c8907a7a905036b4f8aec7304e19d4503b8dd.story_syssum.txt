Emma Sullivan, 18, said late Sunday that a Brownback staffer had notified her school's principal about the tweet, and the principal told her she had to write an apology to the governor.
"My staff overreacted to this tweet, and for that I apologize," the governor said.
"I had no idea what it was about or why I was being called into the office," she said.
"He said I was an embarrassment to the school and the school district and that I had been disrespectful," she added.
The principal then asked her to write a letter of apology to Brownback and his staff.
"The district acknowledges a student's right to freedom of speech and expression is constitutionally protected," the district said in its statement.
Sullivan said she had not heard from the governor's office directly.
"I hope there won't be any consequences and that my principal and the governor's office can move on," she said.
"The issue has resulted in many teachable moments concerning the use of social media," the district said.
