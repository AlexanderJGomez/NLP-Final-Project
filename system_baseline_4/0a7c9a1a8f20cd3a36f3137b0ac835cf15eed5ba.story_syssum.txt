(CNN) -- Help trickled in Thursday, three days after a magnitude-7.7 earthquake struck off Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that has killed at least 311 people and left more than 400 missing.
The hard-hit Mentawai Islands region is among Indonesia's myriad islands.
Urgent needs are expected to include clean water, food, blankets, clothing, medical attention, emergency shelter and hygiene kits, said Ita Balanda, a program manager for the World Vision aid organization in Padang, Indonesia.
Monday's quake generated a "significant" tsunami, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said.
At least one village with a population of about 200 people was swept away, with only 40 people recovered, Satoko said.
Preliminary report indicates the destructive waves hit the Mentawai Islands after five minutes.
... For Mentawai villagers, the warning is late, as they are very close to the tsunami source," said Sanny Jegillos of the U.N. Development Programme.
A tsunami generated by that earthquake killed more than 225,000 people in 14 countries -- mainly India, Indonesia, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand.
