(CNN) -- Immigrants in Illinois without a valid visa or green card could soon carry one form of state-issued documentation -- a driver's license -- thanks to a law signed Monday by the governor.
"Illinois is moving forward," the governor said.
The statement issued by Quinn's office touts the positive effect the new law will have on undocumented immigrants -- and, it argues, on the state's economy as a whole.
Access to driver's licenses is also important to immigrant rights groups, who see it as a sign of inclusiveness and perhaps a harbinger of broader immigration reform that will keep more families together.
The only other state to allow undocumented immigrants to get driver's licenses is Washington.
Utah issues driving privilege cards to undocumented immigrants who live in the state for more than six months.
NumbersUSA, a group seeking to reduce U.S. immigration, called the senators' plan an attempt to "out-amnesty Obama" and said it will urge its 1.3 million members to push to fight it.
