(CNN) -- Oprah Winfrey has regained the top spot on Forbes magazine's annual most powerful celebrities list.
However, despite not being the highest earner on Forbes magazine's list, "her money, mixed with strong fame scores in metrics like press mentions and social networking power, pushed her to the top," said Forbes writer Dorothy Pomerantz.
The eccentric star's social media success and press influence pushed her up the list, aside from her $80 million earnings.
Ellen DeGeneres was also named in the top ten, coming in just behind Bieber.
Oprah is one of three celebrities who have been featured on the list every year since 1999.
