Naturally, California has many such hotels, but movie star hotels are scattered all over the world.
The hotel turns 125 this year, and completed an $8 million renovation in 2012.
Over its long history, the Victorian hotel, noted for its wraparound porches (highlighted in the film where rows of men wait to watch for Monroe's character, Sugar, to return to the hotel), has been the site of many films, including 1915's "Pearl of the Pacific" and 1924's "My Husband's Wives."
The movie is based on the Stephen King novel of the same name, inspired by King's stay at Colorado's Stanley Hotel.
The hotel was used in 1994's "Dumb and Dumber" and called Hotel Danbury.
The hotel went through a similar renewal, with a $25 million renovation completed in 2012 that included a new restaurant, bar and guest rooms.
Another Beverly Hills hotel featured in movies is the Beverly Wilshire, just around the corner from Rodeo Drive.
The hotel is so associated with the film that many Los Angelenos simply point it out as the "Pretty Woman" hotel.
Occupying the top 14 floors of the Shinjuku Park Tower, the sleek Park Hyatt Tokyo boasts commanding views and was a hotel of choice for director Sofia Coppola before the film.
The movie uses the hotel's rooms and views beautifully, with vistas of the verdant landscape and beach.
The 1930 Hotel Palacio reportedly did just that for author Ian Fleming.
While many remember dramatic Swiss Alps ski scenes with machine guns setting off avalanches, "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" opens on the beaches of Portugal, with James Bond staying at the Hotel Palacio overlooking the Bay of Cascais.
