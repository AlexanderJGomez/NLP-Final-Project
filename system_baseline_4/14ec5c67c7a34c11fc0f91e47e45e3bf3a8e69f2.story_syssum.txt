At a New York press conference, the company also introduced Nintendo TVii, a free TV and movie service that utilizes the Wii U's handheld controller, with its built-in screen, as a remote control and tablet-of-sorts for additional content.
"We've come here today not just to make news, but to give you a better sense for how Wii U will change the way you play games, how it will connect your gaming friends and how it will change the way you watch television," he said.
While it's not certain how many new titles will be available at launch time, at least 50 games will be available for the Wii U by March, Fils-Aime said.
"The Wonderful 101" and "Bayonetta 2," both from Platinum Games, will be exclusive to the Wii U.
Richard George, an executive editor at gaming site IGN who covers Nintendo, said Thursday's presentation may have been the moment the company finally hammered home the value of the new system.
"Loyal Nintendo fans will snatch this up like crazy," he said.
