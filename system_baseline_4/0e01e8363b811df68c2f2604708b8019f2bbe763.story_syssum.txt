(CNN) -- No budget for a new computer in this recession?
Like any machine, a well-maintained car or computer will surprise you, no matter its age.
In our modern consumer culture, it's not surprising that many people are under the impression that newer always means better.
Check for driver and version updates either at your computer manufacturer's Web site or through the list of software you use frequently; see if new drivers or versions are available.
Many of today's Web sites are built with rich JavaScript frameworks, which enable amazing in-browser experiences for everybody.
If you use more than one computer on a regular basis, this is likely what you're doing anyway.
If you're still using Internet Explorer, stop!
Another option takes us back to the Web -- you can often get an online backup plan that will remove your valuable data not only from that main hard drive, but also from your computer's immediate vicinity.
There'll be less data bogging down your computer, less stuff for you to manage, and you'll have access to so much more content.
Your old computer, treated with care and respect, can still make that pan-global road trip on the Information Superhighway.
