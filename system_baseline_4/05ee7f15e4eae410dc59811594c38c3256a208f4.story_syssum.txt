As Sony Pictures struggles to recover from one blow after another related to the devastating cyber attack, one may overlook the fact that its parent company in Japan has been a popular target of hackers for years.
Asia Strategist Keith Henry says Sony was taken by complete surprise last month when the cyber-terrorists successfully stole massive amounts of data and used it to devastate the company.
Immense amount of damage to corporate America," Henry says.
Nishimoto says a devastating hack like the one on Sony Pictures can penetrate even the best cyber-defense.
He says the Sony network may be more vulnerable because of the large amount of users with varying degrees of access.
But he suspects it is a more widespread problem in Japan.
This is a huge vulnerability.
