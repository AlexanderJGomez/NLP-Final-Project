Realizing that the guy you've wasted time on for years is a vacuous, pretentious douche nugget is actually kind of funny, and Marx proves it.
A satirist who writes for the New Yorker, she's confessed that the book -- about an unnamed, neurotic college girl who spends 10 years pining for a pretentious PhD student -- is based on her own experience with her own unnamed douche nugget, which is probably why it feels SO right.
It's snappy and fun to read, and the final story will remind you that men need to realize they're assholes before they become non-assholes, which sometimes takes awhile.
Now go change out of those sweatpants, muchacha.
Remember how content Kermit was, just strumming his banjo on a tree trunk in the swamp?
Kermit never appreciated what he had in Piggy, because she was just one great thing about his awesome life.

Sure, he also happened to be the most powerful guy in the free world, but the story is more relatable than you might think.

It's a chilling book but showcases the resilience of women, even those trapped in unbearable circumstances, in a really powerful way.
Not as bleak as "Ethan Frome," but similar deal, except the female characters are more human and complex.
"The Position" by Meg Wolitzer
LeBlanc, a journalist, captures the tiniest aspects of the lives of two teenage Puerto Rican girls as they grow up in a bad neighborhood, have kids young, and one ends up in prison for working as a mill girl for her flashy heroin-dealing boyfriend.
(At the end of the book, they're in their late twenties and mid-thirties; LeBlanc spent 10 years basically living with their families.)
Crosley is like your smartest, funniest female friend, who articulates all the delights and inconveniences about being a young, ambitious woman in a big city that you've always felt but never known how to explain it.
