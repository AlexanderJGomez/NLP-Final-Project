(CNN) -- New Zealand may have retained rugby's Sevens World Series in fine style, but Fiji's Samisoni Viriviri claimed the honor of being named the competition's leading player following the finale in England.
Despite Viriviri's individual brilliance, Fiji could only finish the season in third place, trailing second-placed South Africa and champions New Zealand.
The dramatic turnaround ended Australia coach Michael O'Connor's dream of finishing with a title in his last match in charge of a Series event.
"We have worked so hard as a team to get things right and it has paid off this year," Mack said on the World Series website.
Next season's series starts in October, with Australia hosting the opening round, prior to its climax in London in May 2015.
With rugby sevens making its Olympic debut in two years' time, extra incentive will be added by the knowledge that the top four-ranked nations will qualify directly for the 2016 Games in Rio.
