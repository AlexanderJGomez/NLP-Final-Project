(CNN) -- The news that NBC plans to dump Jay Leno -- again -- lifts the curtain on a dark corner of the media business.
Leno has the top-rated show at 11:30.
What??
Time to wheel the old guy off the stage.
But here's the thing: Leno doesn't appeal to anyone but the viewers.
Does the 62-year-old comic skew old?
The critics made the same mistake last time around.
Leno has been punching back in his monologue, likening NBC suits to "snakes" and saying that the network's motto is "The Biggest Loser."
And indeed, Jimmy Fallon makes sense as Leno's eventual heir.
Fallon's a young guy.
The critics, of course, won't be happy until Leno is working the comedy clubs where he spends his vacations (and possibly competing against NBC from Fox).
