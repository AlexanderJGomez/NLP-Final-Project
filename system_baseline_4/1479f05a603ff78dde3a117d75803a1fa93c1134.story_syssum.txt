(CNN) -- Zara Phillips is not one to rest on her laurels.
But come back quickly she did.
Eight and a half months after Mia Grace Tindall -- the 16th in line for the throne in Britain -- was born on January 17, her mother placed 11th in the eventing at the Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games in Normandy, helping her nation to silver and Olympic qualification.
"I always wanted to get back for the Worlds at the right time," Phillips says.
"When you come out of the Olympics you just go, 'Let's just do it all again,' " Phillips says.
Come 2016, Mia -- who will be superseded as the youngest member of Britain's royal family when William's wife Catherine gives birth for the second time -- could be watching her mother's bid to win gold, having already spent time on the equestrian circuit.
"We're lucky because we can ride and go back and forth a bit, it fits in really well.
Having admitted to not feeling maternal before Mia's birth, Phillips has since treasured the experience of becoming a mother for the first time.
I'm lucky, she's really good."
"I've had him since he was a five-year-old," Phillips says of High Kingdom, now 13.
Phillips' equestrian career, though, has not come without its setbacks.
"You would hope that you would notice before anything went too wrong.
It was great fun, you know," Phillips says.
"Horses mean everything to me," Phillips adds.
