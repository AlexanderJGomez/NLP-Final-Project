But for other runners, like Salina Jimenez, it's about something larger than herself.
David Jimenez Almazan, a combat medic from Van Nuys, California.
"Every mile is a memory," Jimenez said.
Like many of her teammates, Jimenez ran with a photo of her husband pinned to the lapel of her jersey, one that she carries for every race.
Minutes before Jimenez approached the starting line, she shared her angst about the course, which ends with a final hill up to the finish line near the Iwo Jima Memorial.
It's considered the final challenge of the runner's journey.
In the final leg of the race, Jimenez said she thought about the day she found out her husband was killed.
Like most runners, she admitted to she doubts as she approached the last few miles: "I said, 'I don't know if I can do this, David.
"It was phenomenal."
