Heather Cho was working for Korean Air on December 5 when, as a first-class passenger on an international flight, an attendant served her macadamia nuts in a bag.
Cho had the chief steward removed from the flight after the plane had left the gate.
But the flight attendant testified that she was pressured by another Korean Air manager to keep quiet about Cho's behavior.
There is growing resentment over the perceived privileges and nepotism for the families that control the country's top companies.
Park and Kim Do Hee, the flight attendant who served the nuts, had knelt in front of Cho in apology.
When the flight arrived in Korea, the flight attendant said another airline manager, Yeo Woon-jin, pressured her not to talk to investigators about Cho's physically abusing her and Park.
