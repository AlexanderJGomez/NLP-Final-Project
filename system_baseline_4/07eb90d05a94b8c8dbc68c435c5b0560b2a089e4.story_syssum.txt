Isinbayeva reclaimed the women's pole vault title in front of her adoring public on Tuesday, then two days later defended her country's anti-gay propaganda law after receiving her medal.
She criticized two Swedish athletes who defied the anti-gay law by sporting what could be seen as "propaganda" under the new regulations.
"It's unrespectful to our country," Isinbayeva told reporters.
"What I wanted to say was that people should respect the laws of other countries particularly when they are guests.
U.S. President Barack Obama spoke about the issue last week, saying that "nobody's more offended than me" by the anti-gay legislation "you've been seeing in Russia," and some bars around the world have also stopped serving Russian vodka in protest of Russia's stance.
"It blows my mind that such a young, well-traveled, well-educated woman would be so behind the times," said Symmonds, who spoke out against the law after winning a silver medal in Tuesday's 800 meters event.
Kenya's Ezekiel Kemboi claimed his third consecutive world title in the 3,000-meter steeplechase -- adding to his two Olympic gold medals -- with a time of eight minutes, 6.01 seconds.
