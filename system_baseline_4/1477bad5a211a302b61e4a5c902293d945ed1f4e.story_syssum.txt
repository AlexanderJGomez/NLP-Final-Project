(CNN) -- President Obama's Ambien finally wore off, and thus he began the second presidential debate with Mitt Romney.
He lacked passion in the previous debate, but when answering the first question from the audience Tuesday night, Obama brought the heat.
Right away we knew this was a different Obama.
I teach my debaters that you've got to make your best arguments early in the speech.
Here are some examples of Obama quoting Romney.
Moving further forward in the debate, Romney used the same technique responding to the sixth question, when asked what the president had done or accomplished to earn our vote.
It was Romney's best moment of the debate.
Because of the primacy effect, undecided voters won't likely remember the stuff in the middle of the debate as much as the points at the beginning.
It's good for Romney that this wasn't the first debate, because Obama's performance was much stronger Tuesday night.
