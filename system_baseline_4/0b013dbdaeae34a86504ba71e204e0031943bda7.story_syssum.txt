(CNN) -- Bayern Munich dropped their first Bundesliga points of the season under new manager Pep Guardiola Tuesday -- frustrated by a late SC Freiburg equalizer in a 1-1 draw.
An unbeaten Bundesliga run of 29 games, dating back to last season was also extended, but there was a worrying development for Guardiola when captain for the night, midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger, limped off with an ankle injury near the end.
Meanwhile, Bayern's Bundesliga rivals Schalke 04 secured their passage to this season's Champions League group stages with a thrilling 3-2 win in Greece over PAOK Thessaloniki.
The score stood at 1-1 at the time, but Schalke pulled ahead for the second time when Julian Draxler scored in the 79th minute, a crucial second away goal.
Steaua Bucharest, Austria Vienna and FC Basel will also go into Thursday's draw.
