January 23, 2012, may well come to be remembered as the crucial date when Samuel Huntington's "clash of civilizations" thesis, which many of us believed discredited beyond repair, was reaffirmed.
Future historians might call January 23 the day when Europe irreversibly alienated not one, but both, pivotal powers -- Iran and Turkey -- that in all probability will dominate the political landscape of the Middle East for several decades.
The EU sanctions attempt to hit the Iranian economy where it hurts most: Europe imports about a fifth of Iranian oil.
The issue of Armenian genocide touches a very raw nerve in Turkey, which denies the scale of the killings -- Turkey maintains that roughly 500,000 Armenians were killed -- as well as the claim that it was planned.
Harsh sanctions on Iran are seen as an attempt to prevent a Muslim country from developing deterrents to attacks from Israel and the United States, both nuclear powers hostile to the Islamic Republic.
For many in the Muslim world, double standards explain why France singled out Turkey, and didn't criminalize the denial of other nations' crimes against humanity.
Most pertinent of all, Muslims ask, why not criminalize the denial of the genocidal Spanish Inquisition that led to the extermination, expulsion or conversion of the entire Muslim and Jewish populations of the Iberian peninsula?
Many Muslims perceive these moves as the West targeting Iran and Turkey in an attempt to prevent important Muslim countries from achieving the military capacity -- Iran -- and the political stature -- Turkey -- they deserve.
