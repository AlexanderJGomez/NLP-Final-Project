BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN)  -- After 17 hours, Kerri Gannon and her husband were still stranded in an airport in Bangkok, Thailand, Wednesday, trying to find a way home to the United States after the facility was occupied by crowds of protesters and closed.
"The upper level outside is really crowded with protesters and for the most part they're kind of quiet and polite," Gannon said from the airport.
The People's Alliance for Democracy , which is leading the protests, said it will not end its occupation of the airports until the prime minister resigns.
Protesters blockaded people trying to get to one of the airports.
Gannon said the situation started off fairly relaxed, but tensions were escalating.
"As more and more tourists leave [the airport], the fact that we don't have any information and there's no one to give us information, now we feel stranded here and we don't know where to go," Gannon said.
The airlines have also been mum on the situation, Gannon said, making it difficult for them to decide whether to wait it out at the airport or try to find a hotel.
One traveler said the wait was frustrating.
Gannon said she and her new spouse just hope to get home sometime in the near future.
