The Coast Guard first encountered Baluchi on Wednesday after receiving a report about a man in a bubble off the coast of Miami, disoriented and asking for directions to Bermuda, a Coast Guard press release said.
A Coast Guard cutter found Baluchi.
The Coast Guard monitored his progress and on Saturday morning  an exhausted Baluchi activated his personal locating beacon, the Coast Guard said.
There were no reported injuries, the Coast Guard said.
The CNN.com story quoted Baluchi saying he'd run across the United States twice and around its perimeter once.
Now he is an American citizen.
It's almost biblical.
