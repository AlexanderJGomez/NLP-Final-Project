Phillips' longtime kidney issues plagued his run on "Idol," causing him excruciating pain and preventing him from participating in various "Idol" duties, like the weekly Ford music video shoots.
Phillips' mother, Sheryl, went on to request prayers for her son on Facebook:
I just wish he felt good.
Phillips was reportedly scheduled to go under the knife last week, but due to a fever and sinus infection, the surgery had to be delayed.
Our get-well-soon wishes go out to Phillip; he's got a whole lot of fans hoping to hear him sing again soon.
