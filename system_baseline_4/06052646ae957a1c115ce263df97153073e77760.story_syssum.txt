Prosecutors say Komisarjevsky is one of two men who broke into the home of Dr. William Petit and raped and killed Petit's wife, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her two daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, before setting fire to the home.
Earlier in the Komisarjevsky trial, Dr. Petit, the lone survivor of the attack, testified that he was awakened after being hit by a baseball bat.
Petit said that's when he knew "I had to get out."
Bansley said Komisarjevsky did not have a weapon.
Hayes thought that the Petits needed to be killed, Bansley claimed, but Komisarjevsky refused to kill anyone.
