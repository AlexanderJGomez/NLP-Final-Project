(CNN) -- Devastated, but grateful to be alive -- soccer player Fabrice Muamba announced his retirement on Wednesday, five months after suffering a cardiac arrest on the playing field.
"But the news I received was obviously not what I had hoped it would be and it means I am now announcing my retirement from professional football.
"I would also like to thank everyone who has supported me throughout my career, and the Bolton fans who have been incredible.
Bolton chairman Phil Gartside was saddened by the news, but insisted Muamba must now focus on his life outside of soccer.
"We have spoken with Fab and he knows we will always support him in whatever he wants to do and that we will always be here for him," said Coyle, whose team begin life in the second division on Saturday after being relegated last season.
