While America lost much of its love for streetcars as public transportation during the 1960s, a few cities have kept the romance burning.
Other cities have plans and other funding for streetcar projects, too.
"Streetcars certainly create jobs, but they are a poor investment and create little lasting value," he said.
"Sure, Portland paid incentives to businesses to build along the streetcar (line)," he said.
Portland's streetcar system attracts about 12,000 daily riders at an average ticket cost of $1.47.
Becich said he rides his city's system so often he's considering selling his car.
"If you count the time from point A to B, it is slower to ride the streetcar," Becich said.
As many as 2,250 people were projected to use the system daily, according to a city study.

"Based on recent decisions by party members at the state and national level, that will mean a renewed emphasis on roadway projects and less proposed funding for transit."
