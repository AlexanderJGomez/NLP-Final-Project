Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Search-and-rescue efforts at a supermarket in Haiti's capital have ended after teams determined no one else was alive beneath the rubble, an official told CNN Wednesday.
But at 11 p.m. Tuesday, the teams determined there was no one else alive under the rubble, and they called off the rescue mission, Renou told CNN Wednesday.
At one point, he said, a female Mexican rescue worker was trapped under the rubble and teams had to work to save her life.
Caribbean Supermarket was the scene of a number of rescues after the earthquake, including the rescue of five people in one weekend.
