"It's not done," Dr. Luke, co-producing the album with longtime Britney collaborator Max Martin and Montreal dance-pop songwriter Billboard, tells Rolling Stone.
Spears' new single made its debut on the pop charts in mid-January at No.
"We had it for a while.
I wanted to make sure it didn't sound like everything else I've done.
"It feels like a really obvious, easy-to-listen-to first single," says John Ivey, program director for KIIS in LA, which played the song once an hour the first day it came out.
"[Circus] ended up doing well, but we were a little cautious about it -- a little tense comeback issues were going to be relevant," says Mark Hudson, music buyer for Trans World Entertainment, who predicts the new album could sell 500,000 copies in its first week.
"Britney's really fast," Dr. Luke says.
