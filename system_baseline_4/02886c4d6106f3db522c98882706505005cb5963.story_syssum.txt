The video sparked protests worldwide, starting in Egypt and Libya, and then spreading to other countries.
As things become clearer, it seems that the video was created and promoted by members of the American Coptic Christian community -- a community with its roots in Egypt.
These people within the Arab world began blaming the Coptic community -- a community whose very name means "Egyptian."
It also said that the video does not in any way represent the view of the Coptic community.
Sadek's personal actions have nothing to do with the Coptic Church or the Coptic-American community.
It is a mark of Christian value for the Coptic Church to condemn the video and its filmmakers.
The violent actions of a comparatively small number of individuals do not represent all Muslims, just as the video does not represent the views of all Coptic Christians.
The video did not appear in a vacuum.
Whether it's through legal channels or social pressures, they must be dealt with.
The least we can do now is to make sure not to blame the wrong people for the vile actions of a few individuals.
Hellyer.
