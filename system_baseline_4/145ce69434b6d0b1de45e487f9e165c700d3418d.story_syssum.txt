Fourteen people were killed when the plane slammed into a cemetery March 22 in Butte, and investigators immediately began focusing on why the pilot asked to divert the flight from Bozeman, Montana, to Butte, 80 miles to the west.
The pilot left Oroville at 12:10 p.m. local time, with Bozeman as the destination and Butte as the alternate, according to an instrument flight rules flight plan the pilot filed.
The report said that at 2:27 p.m., controllers asked the pilot whether he had the airport in sight and "the pilot indicated he had one more cloud to maneuver around."
One witness with aviation experience reported that the airplane was west of the runway centerline and appeared too high to land on the runway," the report said.
Although there is no air traffic control tower at Butte, the local fixed base operator lineman was monitoring the radio as the airplane approached the airport.
The preliminary NTSB report said "visual meteorological conditions prevailed" at both Bozeman and Butte.
