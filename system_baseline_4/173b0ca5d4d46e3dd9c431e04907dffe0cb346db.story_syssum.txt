Washington (CNN) -- Public schools in Western states can continue teacher-led reciting of the Pledge of Allegiance, after a federal court ruled against a group of atheist parents.
The same appeals court also ruled separately Thursday, upholding the use of the words "In God We Trust" on U.S. money.
Newdow said he would appeal Thursday's decision but acknowledged his dim prospects going forward.
Newdow said he'll ask for a rehearing and, if that fails, will appeal to the Supreme Court.
The same court in 2002 agreed with Newdow and other atheist parents.
The Supreme Court previously has ruled the mere mention of God or religion by the government in a public setting does not necessarily mean a violation of the "Establishment Clause" of the Constitution, which ensures the separation of church and state.
It was originally worded: "I pledge allegiance to my flag and the republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."
"Today, the court got it absolutely right: Recitation of the pledge is a patriotic exercise, not a religious prayer.
The case is Newdow v. Rio Linda Union School District (05-17257).
