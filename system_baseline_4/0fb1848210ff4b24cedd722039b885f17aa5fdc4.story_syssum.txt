Davern offered a new account in November about how Wood's death was reported, saying that Wagner waited hours to call the Coast Guard after Wood went missing off Catalina Island, near the California coast, following an argument the couple had.
Whitmore declined to reveal whether detectives plan to talk with Davern, saying he would "not get into the specifics" of the investigation.
It's possible we could yield new information that changes this case," the sheriff's spokesman said.
"This new information is substantial enough to make us want to take a new look at the case," Lt. John Corina said at the time.
Authorities haven't gone into specifics about who they've interviewed, but did say when they reopened the case that Wagner wasn't a suspect.
In 2010, Lana Wood told CNN she believes a highly charged argument between her sister and Wagner on the yacht's back deck preceded Wood's drowning.
"I just want the truth to come out, the real story," she said.
Davern has said he believes Wood's death was a direct result of a fight with Wagner.
Wagner admitted his jealousy in his book "Pieces of My Heart," also published in September 2009.
After Wagner argued with Walken and broke the wine bottle, Wood left in disgust and went to her stateroom, Davern told CNN.
A short time later, Wagner, appearing to be distraught, told Davern he couldn't find Wood.
Wagner shrugged and poured them both drinks, Davern said.
Wagner writes that he went to check on Wood, but she wasn't there.
The dinghy was found about a mile away from the yacht, and a mile from where Wood's body was found.
Wagner's striking good looks landed him roles in dozens of films in the 1950s and '60s before he hit it big in television.
