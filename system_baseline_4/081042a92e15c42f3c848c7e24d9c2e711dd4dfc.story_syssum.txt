However, a U.S. military official has now confirmed to CNN that Stevenson was the only U.S. casualty of a brutal two-day firefight against an al Qaeda-related group that erupted when U.S. and Afghan troops attacked an insurgent encampment, killing nearly 80 foreign fighters.
That single piece of information is a rare glimpse into the world of U.S. special operations forces who have done more tours than most in the last decade.
Stevenson was part of a U.S. and Afghan special operations mission that went in to attack the area in Afghanistan's Paktika province.
A second U.S. military official tells CNN that the US is seeing the Haqqanis increasingly turn to foreign fighters they bring into Afghanistan.
Airstrikes were called in using missile-equipped helicopters, fighter jets dropping precision weapons and unmanned drones.
