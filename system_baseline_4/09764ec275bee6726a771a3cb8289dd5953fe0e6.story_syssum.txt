Police said one of the bikers -- Robert Sims -- also stomped on the driver's head and body, according to a detective's criminal complaint.
His wife said he is paralyzed.
The other biker who turned himself in, Reginald Chance, is also suspected in the beating of driver Alexian Lien.
Chance's lawyer, Gregory Watts, said his client didn't take part in the beating.
Lien was in his Range Rover on his way back from an outing to celebrate his wedding anniversary with his wife and their 2-year-old daughter.
Lien pulled to a stop, and angry bikers surrounded his vehicle, hitting it and spiking its tires, police said.
A man, who police say was Sims, got off his motorcycle and opened Lien's door, police spokesman Sgt.
Afterward, some of the bikers dragged Lien from the vehicle and beat him, police said.
An off-duty New York police officer was riding with the bikers Sunday and saw much of the confrontation that ended with five injured.
He has hired a lawyer and is being investigated by the New York Police Department's internal affairs unit.
His license was suspended, and he was ordered to surrender his passport.
He never tried to assault him in any way.
A second biker, who was in custody, was released Wednesday, when authorities determined that he may have been trying to help.
Mieses' wife, Dayana, told CNN affiliate WBZ that he got off his bike to help the SUV driver.
"My husband was forced under the circumstances to take the actions that he did in order to protect the lives of our entire family," his wife said.
Bikers have called for Lien to be charged.
I think we need to charge him immediately."
