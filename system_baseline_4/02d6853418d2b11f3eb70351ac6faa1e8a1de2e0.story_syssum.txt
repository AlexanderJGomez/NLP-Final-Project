Sollecito and Knox were convicted of Kercher's murder in 2009 but set free on appeal in 2011.
Sollecito's book draws heavily on diaries he kept and letters he wrote to friends, family and his hometown newspaper during his years in prison, the preface says.
While maintaining his innocence, he says he does not clearly remember even if Knox spent the night with him.
Neither he nor Knox had solid alibis for the night of Kercher's murder, Sollecito writes.
Sollecito describes his doubt about Knox's innocence at times, referring to the night the two were arrested.
They were intent on getting Sollecito to abandon Knox and accuse her of the murder, he wrote.
At one time after the first conviction, Sollecito's father sought the help of a private lawyer not connected to the case, who spoke to Perugia prosecutor Giuliano Mignini about striking a plea deal to cut Sollecito's sentence in exchange for evidence against Knox.
He wrote that he believed he was arrested as a way to get to Knox.
Sollecito condemns his treatment by Perugia police who, he says, would not give him food or access to a lawyer during the questioning, even though it was clear to him that they were treating him as a suspect and not just a person informed of the facts of the case.
Guede is writing a book but does not have a publisher, according to his lawyers.
Knox's book is due to be released in the spring.
