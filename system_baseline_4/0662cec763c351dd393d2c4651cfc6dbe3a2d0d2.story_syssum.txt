The First Observer program was introduced to parking lot professionals at a Las Vegas, Nevada, convention in May, days after a vendor in New York's Times Square spotted a suspicious vehicle and helped thwart what could have been a deadly terrorist attack.
He and a team of Transportation Security Administration officials trained some 60 parking lot officials and representatives on how to spot suspicious vehicles carrying hazardous materials or other activity that may signal the planning phases of a terrorist attack.
He called the police, and they moved in quickly," Beatty said.

For parking lot employees who cannot attend the seminars, First Observer encourages individuals to go to its website where they can take an online training course.
Still in its infancy, the First Observer program has resulted in around 80 calls that have provided valuable information to law enforcement, Beatty said.
"It's not illegal for someone to take pictures of an underside of a bridge or of a chlorine tanker," Beatty said.
