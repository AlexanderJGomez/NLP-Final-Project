(CNN)  -- President Obama said in an interview aired Sunday that the hardest decision he's made since taking office was to send more troops to Afghanistan.
Obama was responding to comments Cheney made to CNN's "State of the Union" on March 15, when he said the president is making the nation less safe by closing the Guantanamo prison and ending interrogation practices that Bush administration critics consider torture for terror suspects.
Coming off a tumultuous week over the millions in bonuses paid out to employees of AIG, Obama said Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's job is secure despite critics calling for his resignation.
"As a general proposition, you don't want to be passing laws that are just targeting a handful of individuals," Obama said.
