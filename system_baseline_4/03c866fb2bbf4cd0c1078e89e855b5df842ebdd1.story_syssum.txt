"He was just everything," said T.J. Jackson, who shares guardianship of Michael Jackson's children -- Prince, Paris and Blanket -- with their grandmother.
"Do you believe your uncle was murdered?"
T.J. Jackson had earlier testified that his mother, Delores Jackson, was the victim of murder 19 years ago.
"My mother was murdered for money, too, so I don't put that past anyone," he said.
He said he was at a loss for words to describe what Paris is going through.
Blanket, who was 7 when his father died, "was always wrapped around his leg, very shy," T.J. Jackson said.
"Right now, I don't know if Blanket realizes what he lost," Prince said.
"He was very mature for his age, very smart.
As a guardian, T.J. Jackson said he must constantly deal with paparazzi stalking the children for photographs.
"I know it's making everything harder for the kids to grieve and to recover and to progress," he said.
