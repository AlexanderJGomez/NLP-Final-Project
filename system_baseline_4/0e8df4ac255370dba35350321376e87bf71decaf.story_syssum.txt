I firmly believe that all children have a right to an education free from fear of being bullied.
The impact of bullying for students and for our nation are severe.
I am particularly disturbed by stories of bullied youth who feel powerless to change their situation and who choose not to seek help from adults.
Recently, I reintroduced bipartisan legislation to help prevent bullying and harassment -- the Safe Schools Improvement Act.
A new study found that the psychological side effects of bullying can extend up to a decade after the harassment has ended.
I applaud those who are already working to make schools a place where all children can achieve their full potential without fear of being bullied, and I urge my colleagues in Congress to work with me in passing the Safe Schools Improvement Act.
