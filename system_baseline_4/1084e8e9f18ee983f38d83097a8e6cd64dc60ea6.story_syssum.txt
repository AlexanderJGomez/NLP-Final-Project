Christian Lusardi, 42, of Fayetteville, North Carolina, flushed $2.7 million worth of counterfeit poker chips down the toilet in a room at Harrah's Resort and Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey state police said.
"This was a very unusual occurrence.
"We are very pleased that the New Jersey State Police Casino Gaming Bureau has apprehended a suspect," Lupo said.
Police say Lusardi introduced the counterfeit chips into the tournament on multiple occasions.
When it was canceled Friday, 27 people remained in the tournament.
