Two hit-and-run drivers ran over Yueyue, one after another, after she wandered into the alley outside her father's hardware store.
But there was one thing more shocking than the double hit-and-run: the seeming apathy by pedestrians, cyclists and drivers—18 of them—who did not stop to help.
The incident has also prompted widespread soul-searching in China about the state of the nation's morality and civic-consciousness.
Some blame it on the lack of laws and regulations.
"It's funny how many people read into this, to the point that anti-Chinese sentiment arises," he wrote me.
Psychologists, Hing tells me, have dubbed this phenomenon the 'bystander problem'—the one factor that would predict Good Samaritan behavior was how many witnesses there were to a tragic event: The more bystanders, the less likely someone will step up to help.
One factor is the district where it occurred, which has a concentration of hardware stores like the one Yueyue's father owns.
In the 'strangers' society' it is characterized by estrangement, distrust, and independence.
A joint survey by three universities in Beijing revealed that the root cause of people's reluctance to help others in need is a lack of trust among residents.
Only about 8% surveyed said they still strongly trust other people.
"There must be something wrong when it is considered risky to be a Good Samaritan," China Daily wrote in an editorial this week.
Peking University's Xia Xueluan calls this the "interpersonal trust crisis".
As a netizen puts it, it's not that the good people can no longer be found in our society.
That is a question many in China are now asking themselves.
