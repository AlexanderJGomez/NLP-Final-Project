Officers detained Michael Lohan after his girlfriend, Kate Major, said he violated terms of his release from jail earlier this week by calling her, the Tampa Police Department said in a statement.
Lohan called his girlfriend again while she was talking with police, and she put him on speakerphone, it said.
Police responded to a domestic violence call at Michael Lohan's home Monday and arrested him for the battery of his live-in girlfriend, police said.
Lohan also said he never was served with a restraining order to stay away from the woman.
