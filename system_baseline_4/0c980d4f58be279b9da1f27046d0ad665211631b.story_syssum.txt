The advent of Bitcoin ATMs is seen as a step towards bringing the digital currency into the real world.
"It removes all the pain and barriers of entry to buying Bitcoin on an online exchange," said Robocoin chief executive Jordan Kelley.
Let's say you want to make a withdrawal from your Bitcoin wallet.
Following a confirmation from the Bitcoin network to your phone, you can then scan the code on the receipt at the kiosk, which then prompts the ATM to spit out the allotted amount of cash.
Not every government in Asia is ready for a Bitcoin ATM.
"Bitcoin is not real currency and banks cannot receive or provide it.
While it did not outlaw individuals from owning Bitcoin, it specifies that it is not to be considered a currency.
Kelley revealed that Robocoin has begun talks with several operators in China that are reaching out to the government and local regulators to "educate" them about the value and potential of the Bitcoin market.
