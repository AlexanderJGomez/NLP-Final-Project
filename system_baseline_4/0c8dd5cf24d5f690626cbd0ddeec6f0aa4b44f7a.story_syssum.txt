Washington (CNN) -- Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan received critical cover from moderate Republicans on Thursday on two issues likely to dominate her upcoming confirmation hearings: gays in the military and judicial experience.
Massachusetts GOP Sen. Scott Brown -- who broke the Democrats' 60-member filibuster-proof majority by winning the late Ted Kennedy's seat in January -- said after meeting with Kagan that he is satisfied she supports members of the military.
While dean at Harvard Law, Kagan said she "abhorred" the military's "discriminatory recruitment policy."
She also said she didn't see any "extraordinary circumstances" that could lead her to join a potential filibuster against Kagan.
Specter said Kagan may be open to the idea of allowing television coverage of Supreme Court hearings.
"She said it'd be helpful to the public and to the court," he said.
Specter has not said how he will vote on her Supreme Court nomination.
Obama nominated Kagan on Monday to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens.
If confirmed, she would become the third woman on the current nine-member bench and the fourth woman in the court's history.
