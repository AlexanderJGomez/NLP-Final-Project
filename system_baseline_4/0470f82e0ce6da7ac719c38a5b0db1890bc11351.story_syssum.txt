Why?
The shooter, apparently picking the victim at random, shot the San Francisco State University student in the back.
"Some are no more than two to three feet to him," said San Francisco District Attorney George Gascon "We're seeing people that are so disconnected to their surroundings.
People are being robbed, people are being hurt, people are being run over by cars because they're so disconnected because of these phones."
I think I would," Gascon said.
At one point, he even wipes his nose with the gun.
This is different, especially for San Francisco State University students.
The other day at the same train stop where Valdez boarded for the last time, a group of college students milled around, most of them too focused on their phones to notice a CNN camera focused on them.
