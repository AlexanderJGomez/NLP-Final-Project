From bragging "mommyjackers" and smug "sanctimommies" to pictures of poop-smeared kids and placenta art, blogger Blair Koenig has seen it all.
I had no idea back then just how much parents truly overshare about their kids.
But a couple of years ago, I started getting a lot of submissions from parents, many of whom have parent friends that they find annoying.
More often than not, the person does know the "offending" parent and has been pushed to the edge.
Koenig: The aforementioned poop pictures are probably the most common type of submission I receive.
Koenig: I get e-mails from parents who say they're "reformed" and submit old examples of their oversharing ways.
Koenig: If there's a backlash, it's not really from parents.
It's more general, like people who just disagree with the blog's existence.
Koenig: Social media is the gateway drug to oversharing.
Koenig: That answer depends on the person, because some people don't find poop disgusting but are completely repulsed by vomit or long strands of green snot.
It's all pretty gross.
It's like a funny field guide to parent overshare, and I think it'll be an essential baby shower gift.
Koenig: There are two kinds of people on social media: those who post too much information and those who don't.
I've been collecting pet examples for over three years, and I can report that "pet parents" can be just as bad as human parents.
Some people even take pictures of their pet's poop.
