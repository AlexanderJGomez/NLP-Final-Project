(CNN) -- It was Tuesday afternoon when I found a trending article through Digg that seemed to explain why I'm not reaching my full potential for joy.
The article that was actually trending came from LiveScience, and the premise was that morning people are generally happier than night people.
Conversely, by age 60 most people have lost their affinity for staying up late.
Advantage: Night people.
Even my dog knows that if you get out of bed before, say, noon you're going to have a bad time.
Apparently society's expectations don't include midnight ping pong.
"No.
And that's where I found the Optimal Light Therapy System.
I have no idea what a lux is, but I've always said 10,000 is the optimal number.
Unfortunately, to reap the benefits of the Optimal Light Therapy System, you have to spend 30 minutes with your face in front of a blinding, bright light.
So, for now I guess I'm just going to stay a miserable night owl.
