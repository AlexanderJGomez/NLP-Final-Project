Hong Kong (CNN) -- Eight Chinese officials have been fired or suspended after five boys died in a rubbish bin after suffocating on fumes from charcoal they burned to stay warm, according to state-run media.
One user on Sina Weibo, China's version of Twitter, wrote: "China is supposedly an intermediate developed country but still can't protect its own children.

Persistent truants, the boys were said to have been missing for three weeks before they were found dead.
However, Dale Rutstein of UNICEF China said up to 1.5 million children were thought to be fending for themselves across the country but, given the fluid nature of homelessness, it was hard to keep track.
It's estimated there are 55 million "left behind" children in China, the sons and daughters of 200 million migrant workers who have moved to the cities for a better life.
"We would say in UNICEF that that's one of the most significant challenges for China right now, because all the data shows these children have lower nutrition, suffer a higher rate of accidents and injuries and are at greater risk of abuse and exploitation," Rutstein said.
Once sent back, the children would be placed in government-run shelters, according to Xinhua.
This would enable them to have their children live with them," it said.
The plight of the dead children in Guizhou has been compared on social media to the tale of the Little Match Girl, a Hans Christian Anderson story of a girl ignored by the rich who froze to death after trying to warm herself with a lit match.
