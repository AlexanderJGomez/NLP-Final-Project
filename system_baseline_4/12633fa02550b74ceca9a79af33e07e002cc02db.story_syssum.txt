The original show ran on ABC in 1990 and 1991 and spawned a 1992 theatrical film directed by Lynch, "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me."
Lynch and Frost will write and produce each one and Lynch will direct all nine.
The tone was set with Angelo Badalamenti's ghostly theme music.
Despite diverse reviews, the show remains one of the most influential in television history, with its involvement of a noted movie director, its willingness to take audiences to far-out places, its deliberate pace and its obsessed-about plot points and character tics.
Showtime plans to show the entire run of the TV series before the premiere of the new "Twin Peaks" episodes.
"To quote Agent Cooper, 'I have no idea where this will lead us, but I have a definite feeling it will be a place both wonderful and strange.'"
