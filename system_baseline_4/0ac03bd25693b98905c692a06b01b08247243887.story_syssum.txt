Although many of us tend to take ours for granted, campaigners hope that World Toilet Day 2012 will draw attention to what they're calling the "global sanitation crisis," with over a third of people worldwide living without a clean and private place to go.
The majority of those without access to a toilet live in sub-Saharan Africa or Asia, with over half of people in Asia not having proper sanitation, according to the UK-based charity, WaterAid.
It's difficult for old people to go and it's hard to go at night.
WaterAid says women are most vulnerable because they're not only exposed to disease, but also have additional shame, harassment and risk of attack when they go out in the open.
People get killed.
The United Nations says more than 2.7 million people die each year due to lack of sanitation.
The program's study of 18 African countries found that even the time it takes people to find a discrete location to use the toilet accounted for almost $500 million in economic losses.
In fact, according to the World Toilet Day organization, every dollar invested in sanitation yields a return of five dollars.
Campaigners for World Toilet Day will be hoping that these words resonate with today's leaders.
