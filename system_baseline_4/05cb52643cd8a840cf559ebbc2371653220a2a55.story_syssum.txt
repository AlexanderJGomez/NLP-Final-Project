Realizing he needed to be strong for himself and his children, he began an intense workout regimen in the hospital -- then found his own brand of rehab in an unlikely place: a surfboard.
"I wanted to prove that I was whole, and one of the ways to do that was to learn to surf," Cummings said.
Do you know a hero?
Cummings co-founded AmpSurf with his prosthetist and two other amputees, including Rodney Roller, the man who taught Cummings how to surf.
Seventy percent of participants are veterans.
But the clinics aren't just about surfing, Cummings said.
"For me, this was the biggest mental rehab I could have ever had."
"Surfing makes me feel like I'm flying," Davis said.
"I'm missing my leg and there are days I don't want to get out of bed," Cummings said.
More than 300 people have taken part in AmpSurf clinics, including Brian Ruhe, 35, who lost both legs above the knee when he was 18.
For Cummings, AmpSurf will always be about more than just surfing; it's about happiness, not just for the participants, but for him and his volunteers.
You can't help but be happy,'" he said.
