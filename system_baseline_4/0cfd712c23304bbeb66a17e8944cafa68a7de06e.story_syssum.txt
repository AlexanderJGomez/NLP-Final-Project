Almost 20 years later, that stupid "French girls" line has become a bit of a catchphrase, and if you Google it you'll find countless images of people unintentionally, yet seductively, sprawled out like Kate Winslet.
Taking it a step further, now there's even a portrait-sketching mobile app called French Girls that has also clearly borrowed from "Titanic."
(For instance, as I write this, the current most popular post on Reddit is a video of a girl dangerously falling off a diving board.
Now, the basic idea of French Girls is that users anonymously post selfies and then other users draw them from within the app.
But mostly, it's easy.
When I first learned of French Girls and downloaded it, I immediately served up a selfie and eagerly awaited someone turning me into art.
So, I added another selfie - one where it looks like I'm grasping at the air -- and somebody actually did turn me into a nude.
Alas, not everything turns out a masterpiece in French Girls.
Because here's how the app works: When you want to start drawing, you are given a choice of nine different images.
So, I drew her.
Anyway, despite a severe lack of artistic ability, drawing my blue girl was a creative way to kill some time when I could've dangerously been interacting with other actual humans.
Because next thing you know a friend invites you to get outside and go to the pool.
