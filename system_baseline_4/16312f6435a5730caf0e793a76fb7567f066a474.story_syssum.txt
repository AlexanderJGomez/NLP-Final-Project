London (CNN)British Prime Minister David Cameron formally asked Queen Elizabeth II to dissolve his country's Parliament on Monday, opening the way for campaigning ahead of the May 7 general election.
"The next Prime Minister walking through that door will be me or (Labour Party leader) Ed Miliband," he said.
"There are two futures on offer at this election," Miliband said.
Cameron and his Conservative Party won the last election in 2010, but not by enough to go into government alone.
Nick Clegg, Liberal Democrat leader and deputy prime minister, has mostly backed Cameron in parliamentary debates against Labour's Miliband.
It is unclear how UKIP will perform in the May 7 UK general election.
"The general election on May 7 is a fantastic opportunity for Scotland to make Westminster sit up and take notice," Sturgeon said Monday.
Eligible Britons must be registered by April 20 to vote.
