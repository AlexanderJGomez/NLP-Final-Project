"Things like this rarely happen here," said Yadira Abigail Flores Delgado, who works at a nearby private security firm.
In a strong blow to one of Mexico's most notorious drug cartels, Mexico's navy killed Arturo Beltran Leyva, head of the Beltran Leyva cartel and one of Mexico's three most wanted criminals.
Six other cartel members and one naval petty officer also died in the raid.
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration said that its cooperation with Mexico played a role in Wednesday's action.
On Thursday, authorities presented to the media two women and a man who were arrested in the raid.
The man's name was not immediately released.
On December 11, the navy got into a firefight in Cuernavaca with gunmen of the Beltran Leyva cartel.
Three military personnel posted themselves inside the hospital hours before the shooting started, saying only that they were in the middle of an operation, said Dr. Antonio Villa Montiel.
Three navy personnel were wounded by hand grenades, one fatally, the navy said.
The death of the leader of a major drug cartel is a victory for the government, but it could also spur more violence, said Payan, an expert on drug trafficking in Mexico.
Beltran Leyva and his organization rose in the Pacific state of Sinaloa, home to a powerful cartel of the same name.
One of the Beltran Leyva brothers, Alfredo, was arrested by Mexican authorities last year and remains imprisoned.
The Beltran Leyva cartel is known for air transportation expertise, Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Michael Sanders said.
Arturo Beltran Leyva was already identified as a kingpin in May 2008.
"Calderon has finally understood two things: that the army is susceptible to corruption, and that the army is not sufficient," Payan said.
