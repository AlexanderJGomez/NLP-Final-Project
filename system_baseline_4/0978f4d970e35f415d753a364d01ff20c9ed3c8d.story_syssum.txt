Boston (CNN)The death penalty trial of accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev -- long delayed by painstaking jury selection, crippling snowstorms and last-ditch appeals to move the case someplace else -- is on track to get underway here next week.
The jurors first will decide whether Tsarnaev is guilty of using weapons of mass destruction to kill people at a large public event.
Many said they thought Tsarnaev was guilty of the April 15, 2013, bombings, which killed three people near the finish line.
The defense, claiming it couldn't find an impartial jury in Boston, tried three times to persuade O'Toole to move the trial.
An appeal is pending before the 1st U.S.
But this case is being tried in federal court, and 17 of the 30 counts against Tsarnaev include the death penalty as a possible punishment.
It is almost certain that the trial, which will include wrenching testimony and video footage of the bombing victims, will be well underway during the running of this year's Boston Marathon on April 20.
No cameras are allowed at the Tsarnaev trial.
