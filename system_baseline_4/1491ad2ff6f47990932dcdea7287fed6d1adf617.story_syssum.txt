(CNN) -- A British couple kidnapped by Somalian pirates in the Indian Ocean have issued another desperate plea, saying they are being badly treated and need urgent help.
In a video filmed on Thursday in Somalia by the French news agency AFP, Rachel Chandler begged the British government to help secure the couple's release.
The medic found Rachel Chandler in poor mental health, calling out for her husband, AFP reported.
Paul Chandler said his conditions were poor and also pleaded for help.
Pirates have been very active off the east coast of Africa in the past several years, operating out of lawless Somalia.
Piracy on the high-seas reached a six-year high in 2009, according to the International Maritime Bureau, which monitors shipping crimes.
