Teutonic endorphins are on parade.
Then there's Sister Doris.
The local beer culture notwithstanding, Sister Doris is living proof that women are destined for a higher calling than simply serving beer and starring in Germany's retrograde beer ads.
Only a small handful of women brew beer in Bavaria.
Like many monasteries back in the day, Mallersdorf Abbey became a magnet for pilgrims seeking blessings from saints' relics on display in the abbey church.
What sets Mallersdorf apart from the handful of other surviving abbey breweries is that Sister Doris is the only remaining nun brewmaster -- in all of Europe.
She gives a thumbs down to Bavaria's favorite weizen beer and doesn't bother to brew it.
In what must be the most unusual career move ever made by a nun, when Sister Doris took the veil she became a brewmaster instead, succeeding the elderly Franciscan sister who had been operating the abbey brewery since the 1930s.
"Beer brewing is women's work," she says, adding that female brewers were common in the Middle Ages.
Or to put it the other way around: the smaller the brewery and the closer the brewer is to the brewing process, the more flavorful the beer is likely to be.
To say that this is infinitesimal by industry standards is an understatement.
Not only is Sister Doris's beer -- luscious as it is -- not exported.
This means beer lovers in the United States, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand and other countries experiencing the craft beer revolution won't be tasting Sister Doris's beer locally anytime soon.
The tourist infrastructure in the immediate area isn't well developed.
Mallersdorf Abbey has a "brand" and her name is Sister Doris.
