NEW YORK (CNN) -- Richard Serra stands in the Museum of Modern Art's Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden, his hair as white as the marble floor.
So as you walk out of one, you're not thinking about the other."
Made to be entered, explored, felt in terms of how they divide and define space around you, these gentle, giant landmarks of a 40-year career place Serra today at the very heart of the Museum of Modern Art's mission and capabilities.
For a long moment, Serra takes in his own work.
Serra smiles.
Until then, MoMA's new exhibition, "Richard Serra Sculpture: Forty Years," reveals that sense of humor along with the sophisticated spatial concepts the Californian explains as he leads you, glad for your interest, across a terrain all his.
No guarded maestro, hiding methods and intentions, Serra is ready with virtuosic metaphor when given a chance to explain the torus of "Torqued Torus Inversion," gesturing, pointing, doubling back to be sure you follow.
When Yoshio Taniguchi designed MoMA's soaring new $890 million building between Fifth and Sixth Avenues for its opening in November 2004, this exhibition was already in the works.

"I think welding is a form of stitching," Serra says.
"There was a need for me to get back to the process in relation to dealing with matter," says Serra, who is very clear on the point that his work is not Minimalist.
In something like the way the stages of Serra's career have evolved, the sixth floor and garden somehow prepare you for the second floor's majestic march of new, eerie, defining works.
"Sequence," "Torqued Torus Inversion" and "Band" don't seem to quite touch that reinforced floor.
He moves from work to work, consciously tracking himself in these pieces, intrigued, especially, when he can't fully grasp a work's effects on him.
"There's a redundancy in this piece," he says of the new "Band," happily intrigued.
