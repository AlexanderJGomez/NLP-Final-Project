(CNN) -- The Chinese-French painter Zao Wou-ki once told me that painting expresses the thoughts we struggle to put into words.
Encouraged by the French-educated Chinese artist Lin Fengmian, his teacher at the prestigious Hangzhou National College of Art (today the China Academy of Art), he relocated to Paris in 1948.
For Zao and his contemporaries, Paris represented the source of modern art.
At first he made a determined effort to distance himself from ink painting -- the medium most closely associated with the Chinese painting tradition-- and subject matter that might be construed as overtly Chinese.
In the decades that followed, Zao committed himself fully to abstract painting, rarely using even figurative titles after 1959.
The apparent disorder of his paintings concealed an underlying structure, sometimes described as Daoist in nature, which bore striking parallels to a similar balance between order and chaos found in Chinese traditional painting.
No single phrase better encapsulates the union in his person and art of the two often disparate cultures and aesthetic visions of France and China.
"Zao Wou-ki," he mused, "his work isn't representative of either Chinese or French art."
"Yes," I answered.
