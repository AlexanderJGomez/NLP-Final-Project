(CNN) -- Josep Guardiola has confirmed he is to step down as Barcelona coach at the end of this season, saying four years in charge of one of the world's biggest clubs is an eternity.
"I want you to understand this is not a simple decision for me.
"I had to announce this today because I didn't want to continue with the confusion.
Guardiola joined Barcelona as a 13-year-old and won six La Liga titles and one European Cup as a player with the club.
He won the Champions League again last season and also a third successive Spanish title, followed by success at the Club World Cup for a second time in December 2011.
"Because of the emotions I feel I preferred not to be present at Pep's press conference and to stay away from the press because I know they will look for the pain on the players' faces.
"It would have been a bad decision to continue.
I'm satisfied beyond the results in the way we've done it.
Day by day for so many years they made it possible."
"I need to recover that feeling," he said.
The one that will replace me (Villanova) is very able to take this on."
