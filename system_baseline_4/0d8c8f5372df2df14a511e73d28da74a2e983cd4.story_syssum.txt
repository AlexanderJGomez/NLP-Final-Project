But even though I take steps to keep my old electronics out of landfills and environmentally disastrous overseas disposal doesn't mean I'm willing to spend large amounts of time and effort to figure out what to do with them.
Since then, my two-year-old iPhone 3G has been gathering dust on my dresser.
(Cult of Mac, Wall Street Journal and many other venues are reporting the same problem.)
In less than a minute Gazelle.com agreed to buy my old iPhone for $93.
Admittedly, $93 is less than half of what people here in the Bay Area are asking today for an 8GB iPhone 3G on Craigslist (although that may not be the price they're actually getting).
So yes -- if I want to sell my old iPhone, I definitely could make more money elsewhere.
Frankly, if I had to deal with the hassles and risks of selling this phone myself via Craigslist or eBay, and also reverting it back to an older OS so it's bearably functional again to assuage my conscience, that iPhone would keep sitting on my dresser until the next electronics recycling drive.
For instance, before the iPhone 4 was unveiled June 7, Gazelle.com was getting about 25 used iPhones per day.
But as soon as iPhone users knew when they could get their new model, trade-ins on the site soared to 1500 units per day for two weeks.
The Gazelle.com site did not ask me which operating system is on my iPhone 3G.
I asked Kennedy whether, given the widely reported troubles with iOS4 on the iPhone 3G, they'd start taking that into account into the price they offer on trade-ins.
Also, remove your SIM card (if your phone has one).
