Receivers dotted around five major cities, including Mexico City and Acapulco, will sound the alarm if they detect an earthquake.
With roughly 21 million people living both formally and informally in and around Mexico City alone, that means many will not be aware the alarm is sounding until the ground begins shaking.
He moved to Mexico City after working in Haiti and witnessing the devastation caused by the 7.0 magnitude earthquake that struck the Caribbean island in 2010 killing more than 230,000 people.
It's called the Grillo (the Spanish word for cricket) early warning system.
"This is the most affordable and the most direct way for the Mexican public to connect to the early warning system," Meira says of the product, which also became Mexico's most successful ever Kickstarter campaign.
Meira also hopes versions of the Grillo system could be introduced elsewhere in the world where earthquakes are a real risk -- like in Nepal, India, the West Coast of the U.S. and along much of the Pacific Coast of South America.
Then there is the fact that only a handful of early warning systems like SASMEX exist anywhere in the world.
He speaks of the next stage of the Grillo project which will see hundreds of specially developed sensors placed all over Mexico, feeding into an algorithm that will provide early-warning alerts to apps and smartphones.
"The real test of a good infrastructure is the density of sensors," Meira said.
Given that the devices can be produced cheaply and located anywhere with an internet connection, the potential for Grillo to be used in a variety of vulnerable areas around the world is very real.
The first small batch of Grillo boxes produced have been sold, although they haven't yet seen any action in the field.
"We have tested it out in two earthquakes and they worked just fine.
