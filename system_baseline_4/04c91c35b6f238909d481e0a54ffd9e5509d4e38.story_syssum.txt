(CNN) -- Some years ago, I interviewed a pair of farmers selling pastured, hormone- and antibiotic-free turkeys for $4.75 a pound.
They were neither cuddly nor well-behaved.
I thought of those birds recently when College Board President and CEO David Coleman explained sweeping changes planned for the SAT exam.
And, the SAT word will be no more, Coleman said.
Just like those old-timey turkeys, it seems there's limited use for the $5 words we've come to expect from the SAT.
You probably still use a number of them: "threatened," "vigilant," "predicting," "ousting" and "strengthened" all appeared on an SAT test in 2013.
"The SAT will honor the best work of our classrooms -- reading widely and learning how words work in their different contexts," he said.
The SAT wasn't keeping them alive, he said, and flash cards weren't doing justice to many words, anyway.
Sure, those quick definitions did well enough for a multiple choice test.
"Under the guise of providing more user-friendly, fair tests, they're merely substituting one set of SAT words for another," Nunberg said.
Regardless, the test will never get much credit; if you memorize a word and use it often enough, he said, you're unlikely to be able to pinpoint that you learned it for the SAT.
"Everything is an SAT word to somebody," he said.
Any of them could be called an "SAT word."
The SAT word is dead, long live the SAT word.
