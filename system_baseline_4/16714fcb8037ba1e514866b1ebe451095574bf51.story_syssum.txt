Steketee asked.
"We came to the conclusion that we needed to provide a context, use the audio of the soap and find a form to tell a layered, nuanced story of the relation between the fictional story of the radio soap and the daily reality of contemporary Rwanda," Steketee said.
Steketee and Blankevoort's documentary, "Love Radio," combines the story from "Musekeweya" with behind-the-scenes insights from everyday Rwandans and people involved in the making of the radio drama.
