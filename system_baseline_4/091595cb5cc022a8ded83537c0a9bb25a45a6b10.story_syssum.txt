Death-defying leaps.
But for Joe Putignano, it wasn't as simple as running away -- it took a lifetime of dedication and a battle against addiction to get where he is today: dangling from the 40-foot-high catwalk above the Cirque du Soleil big top.
And for Joe, it's not just high-flying acrobatics that cause him pain.
"Sleeping hurts a lot, because I'm rolling over on my shoulder.
"I really wanted to see if I could continue on, and just kind of manage it, do a lot of physical therapy, and get out of this pain.
His left shoulder has just the one injury -- another SLAP tear.
"I suppose there's always a risk that when they do fix it, that it will destroy my flexibility," Joe says.
"Opiates made me feel like I was the greatest human being possible.
"I recently met a woman who was 10 years sober, and she had breast cancer," he said.
He's determined to not let it become his reality, both for his own benefit, and to show other addicts they don't have to fear a day where they need surgery.
"We don't have exact numbers of the percentage of former addicts that are going back for surgery, but this is definitely a growing problem in America," said Dr. Boris Spektor, assistant professor of anesthesiology and pain management at Emory University and the person who will be managing Joe's pain throughout the process.
Step two of Joe's pain-management plan involves a cocktail of medications -- none of them drugs of abuse -- intended to reduce swelling, turn down the nerves' pain signals and reduce Joe's stress-response to pain.
During step four, Joe will see a psychologist the day after surgery and regularly after that to ensure he stays on the right mental path.
"I think every patient is unique," Spektor says.
"But I think Joe has an incredibly good psychological framework going on.
I'm jumping into a freezing cold pool, and I don't know how I'm gonna react," he said days before the surgery.
When you're met with pain, only then you'll know how you'll react to it."
