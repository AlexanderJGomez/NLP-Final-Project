The industry has repeatedly promised a "mobile advertising tipping point," yet despite the proliferation in smartphones, new advertising formats and new promises, mobile advertising is yet to come of age.
Whether mobile will kill digital advertising is not the most pressing question the industry faces.
If we focus on mobile phones - then it is our expectation that mobile media will take no more than 20% of digital revenues by 2016.
Seen through an advertisers' eyes, mobile is so much more complex than other media formats.
Orange's annual independent study into mobile media habits for advertisers, showed that in the UK 82% of mobile media users access the internet primarily via the browser, compared to 61% who accessed internet information from an app.
So mobile will certainly challenge digital.
To think that mobile could kill off another media format would completely miss the benefit of mobile devices.
So back to the question, will mobile kill digital advertising?
I don't think so.
