Ryanne Mace was 19 when she was killed last year in a shooting rampage at Northern Illinois University.
Mace believes that Ryanne was probably one of the first to be killed in the Northern Illinois University shootings a year ago, because she was in the front row in the lecture at Cole Hall.
We're going to miss her every day for the rest of our lives," Mary Kay Mace said.
The Maces said they would like to know more about the police investigation into the shooting and Kazmierczak's history of mental illness.
Because Kazmierczak had not been in a mental facility for more than five years, he was legally able to purchase those weapons in Illinois -- and on the firearms application form Kazmierczak filled out, he stated that he had never been adjudicated "mentally defective" and had never been "committed to a mental institution."
But somewhere along the line, the pertinent information didn't get into the right database, and he could waltz out of a store with a legally purchased weapon," Mary Kay Mace said.
Now, the Maces have started a scholarship foundation for psychology majors in honor of their daughter.
