But instead of doing all of that for basketball, these same students should say the heck with the games and put their energy, zeal and passion into two fundamental issues posing the most dramatic barriers to their college education: the rising cost of tuition and the lack of financial aid.
But marching and demanding a rollback of student tuition is just one front of the battle that students in college and high school should be waging.
Federal officials say the banks are reaping upwards of $9 billion a year in these subsidies, which include interest collected, and the Obama administration wants to push more of that money to students by increasing Pell grants and Perkins loans.
Reining in this perk for the banks won't lower the cost of college, but it will make it easier for many students or parents to pay for it.
So some of the very folks who should want students to get as much money as possible to stay in school are not always operating in their best interests.
Four students at North Carolina A&T decided they'd had enough of the segregated lunch counters in downtown Greensboro.

• Remove your money from their coffers.
Imagine what would happen if thousands of students fanned out across a city and picketed and actually led sit-ins in the banks.
• Rally the masses online.
Send throngs of students from each district and make it clear that you will organize young voters and parents in those districts and throw them out of office if they continue to allow the banks to run roughshod.
• Engage celebrities in the battle.
Students, the time for talk is over.
Election Day 2008 was not the end, but the beginning.
