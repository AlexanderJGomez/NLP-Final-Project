America changed its mind after 2008 and broke hard for the tea party, building a wave that would devastate Democrats.
And as we are a few weeks out from the 2014 midterm elections where many believe Democrats are poised once again to be battered into oblivion by another tea party wave, it's important to dissect what happened in 2010 and why there is a possibility that this time might be a little different from what conventional wisdom is trying to tell you.
In truth, if you look at the enormous drops in voter participation from 2008 or 2012 in comparison with 2010, instead of referring to it as the "2010 Tea Party wave election" a more accurate description might be "the 2010 Democratic ebb election."
In key battlegrounds, Republicans have a 17-point advantage in the actual voter turnout between base Democratic precincts and base Republican precincts.
That in a nutshell is how Democrats lost in 2010 and how Republicans are poised to have a stellar year again in 2014 -- not a wave, but a Democratic base ebb.
Yes, Democrats have to persuade swing voters, but there isn't enough persuasion in the world to make up for a 17 percentage-point difference between Democratic base precincts and Republican base precincts; that's a nearly a 2 million vote difference in these five key states alone.
A base that has been underestimated before by Washington conventional wisdom.
If Democrats have any chance of surviving the perfect midterm storm on the horizon, it will be because the same underestimated younger and diverse cohort of voters that anchored the Obama majorities are awakened and engaged.
