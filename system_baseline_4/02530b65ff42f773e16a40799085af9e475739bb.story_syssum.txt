"The airlines have eliminated tens of thousands of seats due to consolidation and just plain old capacity cuts and (they're) using smaller planes," said George Hobica, president of Airfarewatchdog.com.
It's also a bit trickier to book flights for Thanksgiving than Christmas because so many travelers want to fly in such a small window of time: four days versus two weeks for many people who save vacation time for the big holiday in December.
"Don't delay: Prices are not going to go down between now and Thanksgiving," Klurman said.
If you're flying with someone for Thanksgiving, the chances of sitting together on the plane are also higher if you book early, Hobica said.
So you may find a cheaper flight out of Allentown, Pennsylvania, than Philadelphia, for example, Hobica said.
Consider flying on Thanksgiving Day
Travelers who choose to fly out on the Monday before Thanksgiving and fly back on the Sunday after will pay on average $213 more than travelers who fly on Thanksgiving Day and come back the next day, Travelocity calculated.
If you are flying on Thanksgiving Day, try to take the first flight out to make sure you make it to dinner.
If you miss a connection, Travelocity warns that with planes booked solid, it could be a while before your airline is able to book you on another flight.
It may be worth paying this extra charge during peak travel times, like Thanksgiving, to make the journey saner, Hobica said.

It just makes the whole experience a bit more pleasant when you treat yourself well and get the perks."
