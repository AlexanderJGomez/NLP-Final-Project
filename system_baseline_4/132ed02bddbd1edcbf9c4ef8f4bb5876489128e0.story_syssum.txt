(CNN) -- A woman in Little Egg Harbor, New Jersey, came forward as part of a group of 16 that won a piece of the $448 million jackpot from Wednesday's Powerball lottery drawing.
There were three winning tickets sold in this mega Powerball drawing.
The holder of the third lottery ticket has yet to come forward.
The man, 59, did not wish to be identified.
That was split among three tickets sold in Illinois, Kansas and Maryland.
