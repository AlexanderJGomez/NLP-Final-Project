MALE, Maldives (CNN) -- The new president of the Maldives wants to relocate -- his entire country.
Foremost among them: the very likely possibility that the Maldives will sink under water if the current pace of climate change keeps raising sea levels.

"We will invest in land," Nasheed said.
Maldivians also worry that their tiny secular nation of 370,000 Muslims could fall prey to the reach of Islamic radicals.
"We have made many pledges," Nasheed said in his inaugural address.
Nasheed, a 41-year-old one-time journalist, was among the fiercest critics of former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who came to power in 1978 and ruled the Maldives for 30 years.
Nasheed was arrested several times in the last 15 years and held as a political prisoner.
Nasheed and Gayoom ended up in a runoff -- with Nasheed winning 54 percent of the votes to Gayoom's 46 percent in the October 28 race.
"No other citizens in the world in modern times have changed a 30-year-old regime so peacefully," Nasheed said in address.
They decked the cobbled roads of Male with the red-and-green flag of the Maldives and the yellow banner of Nasheed's Maldivian Democratic Party.
