The search will go on at least all day Wednesday, the Coast Guard said.
The Learjet 35 -- carrying a doctor, nurse and two pilots, all of them Mexican citizens -- crashed shortly after one of the pilots reported apparent engine failure shortly after takeoff Tuesday evening from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.
"We have an engine failure," the pilot said.
He said that he had submitted requests for the plane's maintenance records and information about the pilots and their experience.
The two medical staff members worked for Air Evac International, said Albert Carson, the company's director of operations.
Carson said many of its patients are tourists.
