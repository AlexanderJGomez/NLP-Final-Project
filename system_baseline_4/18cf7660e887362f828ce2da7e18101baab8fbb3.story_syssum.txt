There was even a liberal white teacher in my high school who suggested to me, straight-faced and with the very best of intentions, that if I was feeling out of place among my fellow black students I should just spend more time around what was then called "the ghetto" and learn how to speak as they would prefer; maybe even to adopt their speech as my own, so as to ....I don't remember the exact words, but I'm guessing it was to better embody whatever her idea of legitimate blackness was back in the mid-60s.
If you came of age in mid- to late-20th century America when the civil rights movement gave way to growing consciousness of, and pride in being of African descent, the charge from within the black community that you were Not Black Enough was almost as wounding, even debilitating, as a racial epithet from a white person.
Lately, though, issues of black cultural authenticity have poked into broader public view; likely as part of the widening space for racial dialogue opened by Barack Obama's election as president, if not set off by it: Hard to remember now, but some black Americans questioned back in 2008 whether the son of a Kenyan man and a white woman could be considered as authentically rooted to the black American experience as those whose racial background went back generations on this country's soil.
The latter, "Dear White People" is writer-director Justin Simien's Sundance Film Festival sensation about culture clashes between white and black students (and among black students themselves) at a mythical Ivy League college.
Neither these characters nor their creator Simien insist on reconciling or dismissing such seeming incongruities.
But America had too many other things to figure out about black people back then to dig out this elemental truth: That there are as many ways to be black as there are to be white.
There was much hype in advance about the "innovative" aspects of this series about African-American ad executive Andre Johnson, whose preference for being called "Dre" betrays his uneasiness with his fast-tracking lifestyle and whether sending his four children to elite Los Angeles schools disconnects his family from their black heritage, or, at least, those aspects of black heritage he thinks he's left behind in the working-class, predominantly black neighborhood where he grew up.
Some may wish calling out who is or isn't "Black Enough" would remain a covert operation.
The future has a way of settling these arguments, one way or another.
