Being able to ride along narrow trails and carry out maintenance checks on a motorbike are not talents most health workers in the world need to possess, but for Jallow these skills are crucial.
In an area where lack of roads and unreliable transport would typically force patients to spend several hours reaching the nearest clinic on foot or by bicycle, Jallow's durable bike allows him to navigate through the bush to deliver life-saving treatment and health advice to rural communities.
Jallow says all this wouldn't be possible without Riders for Health (RFH), a social enterprise working to transform healthcare delivery across rural Africa and provide outreach health workers with the transport they need.
"Since I got my motorcycle I have been getting my regular supply of fuel and my motorcycle is being serviced regularly," he adds.
It estimates that some 12,000 children in the continent die daily from illnesses and conditions such as pneumonia, diarrhea, measles, malaria and malnutrition.
"Barry came back and said there are children in rural communities who really need to be reached because they need immunizations; women are dying in childbirth and then 30, 20, 10 miles away in ministry of health car parks there are motorcycles and ambulances that are simply broken because nobody has been trained to repair them, there's no supply chain of parts, there's no knowledge of transport maintenance," remembers Andrea, a mother of three and former motorcycle racer.
RFH says its work has enabled outreach health professionals to see nearly six times more people and spend double the time with their patients.
"We have shown that the maintenance of vehicles is absolutely critical if you are going to be able to solve the health issues of rural Africa," says Andrea.
"What gets me up in the morning is the idea that health workers who are very highly trained -- women and men living across Africa -- really want to get out to their rural communities and make sure that they are healthy," says Andrea.
