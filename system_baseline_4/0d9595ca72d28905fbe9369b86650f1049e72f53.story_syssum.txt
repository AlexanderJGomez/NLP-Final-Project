(CNN) -- Heavy rain, hilly terrain and inadequate equipment slowed efforts to recover hundreds of people feared killed by a massive landslide in eastern Uganda, officials said Thursday.

The terrain also is inaccessible by road, Ecweru said.
The Red Cross, United Nations and World Food Program are helping provide food, water and other essentials, such as blankets, to the displaced, officials said.
"We have not found anyone alive today," Ntabadde said.
Most of the bodies were recovered from a hospital engulfed by the landslide after residents sought shelter, officials said.
Flooding also has destroyed roads and washed away bridges in at least seven districts.
