Known as the "Weed Pass," the measure will turn coffee shops into private clubs for Dutch citizens over the age of 18.
"The Cabinet expects that closure of coffee shops to foreign drugs tourists will ensure that they no longer travel to the Netherlands to purchase and consume cannabis.
Amsterdam doesn't want it," said Machteld Ligtvoet, a spokeswoman for the Amsterdam Tourism & Convention Board.
The Amsterdam Tourism & Convention Board says the new measure should be dismissed because it discriminates against foreigners.
Twenty-three percent of Amsterdam tourists say they visit coffee shops during their stays, according to the Amsterdam Tourism & Convention Board.
This year's Cannabis Cup is slated for November 20-24 and is not affected by the new measure.
"As a result, HIGH TIMES is encouraging all who've always wanted to attend the Cannabis Cup and visit Amsterdam to do so this year," the magazine says on its website.
