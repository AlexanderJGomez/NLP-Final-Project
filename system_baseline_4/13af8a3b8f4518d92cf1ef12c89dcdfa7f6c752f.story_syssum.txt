(CNN) -- The economic downturn may take its toll at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, which opens Wednesday night.
On paper, they have."
Leah Rozen, film critic for People magazine, said there are several promising contenders for the Palme d'Or, Cannes' top prize, as well as a number of notable movies premiering out of competition.
Two of the films in competition are American: Quentin Tarantino's World War II movie, "Inglourious Basterds," and Ang Lee's "Taking Woodstock," a tale about the 1969 music festival.
Cannes has been good to Tarantino; he won the Palme d'Or for "Pulp Fiction" 15 years ago.
"Taking Woodstock," the new film by "Brokeback Mountain" director Lee, is based on the book by Elliot Tiber, whose hotelier parents owned a musical festival permit in Bethel, New York, where Woodstock was held.
But this year's Cannes festival is attracting plenty of attention for its out-of-competition films as well.
Cannes, which also functions as a huge film marketplace, may widen the net in attracting distributors.
"One thing that always surprises me is that some of the films you have the lowest expectations for turn out to be terrific, and sometimes the bigger films turn out to be disappointments," Rozen said.
