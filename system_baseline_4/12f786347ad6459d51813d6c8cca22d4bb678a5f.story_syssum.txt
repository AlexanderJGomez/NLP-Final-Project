Gina, the owner of a busy graphic design firm, started giving herself -- and her employees -- four-day workweeks after she had knee surgery and found it tough to get around.
"They were using the extra day off to spend time with their families, do errands and take long weekends away, but also to schedule appointments they might otherwise have taken an afternoon off to attend," Gina said.
By most accounts, the American workweek is now at its most saturated: Nearly 86% of American men and 67% of women work more than 40 hours in any given week, in the name of productivity, financial necessity and, according to at least one study, happiness.
Much was made of the rumor, which Facebook would neither confirm nor deny, despite the fact that many working mothers around the country routinely, and increasingly, negotiate four-day workweeks.
In fact, 44% of female doctors now work four or fewer days a week, up from 29% in 2005.
When Utah introduced four-day workweeks for many of its state employees in 2008, it boosted productivity and worker satisfaction.
Fried also reported that the four-day workweek had made it easier to recruit new talent and retain valuable staff -- male and female.
Though unlikely to affect higher-ups like Mendelsohn, the four-day week tends to work best when the entire office is involved.
"But I always felt that the most important decisions were made when I was home relieving the nanny."
There's also the simple economics of the four-day week, as seen in Utah.
Three years later, Gina's knee is healed but the four-day workweek remains.
"I'm sure that can't account for all the growth," Gina said.
