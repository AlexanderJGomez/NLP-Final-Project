But while she battles for the gold, Johnson is fighting another battle: with Crohn's disease, one of the two most common inflammatory bowel diseases, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
She had to -- like many people, she had heard of Crohn's disease but had little understanding of it.
Crohn's disease is an autoimmune disease of the digestive tract that most often affects the small or large intestines, and sometimes both.
In Crohn's disease, all layers of the intestine may be involved and there can be normal healthy bowel between patches of diseased bowel."
"Crohn's is a chronic, lifelong disease for which there is no cure," he said.
Each patient is different, and treatment is a trial-and-error process.
Early treatments for Crohn's disease primarily centered on steroid drugs such as prednisone, which relieved the inflammation but did little more.
A diagnosis of Crohn's disease often brings more questions than answers, and patients can face a long list of ever-changing complications.
Crohn's patients face another stark reality: In spite of their and their doctor's best efforts, the disease can stop responding to medication.
According to the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America, about 70% of Crohn's sufferers eventually require surgery.
This is one of the most serious complications of Crohn's.
"It's not a matter of if we find cures; it's a matter of when, and that's determined by available funding," said Richard Geswell, president of the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America.
This allows the patient to develop an understanding of his or her individual case, and allows the foundation to have access to more patient histories for use in its research.
