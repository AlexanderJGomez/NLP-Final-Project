(CNN) -- Peanut butter makers not affected by the deadly salmonella outbreak linked to a Georgia peanut plant are trying to get consumers to keep buying peanut butter.
Smucker Co. have started running ads and offering coupons, trying to lure peanut butter customers as sales have plunged at least 20 percent since the salmonella outbreak.
"ConAgra Foods, the maker of Peter Pan Peanut Butter, has confirmed that none of the ingredients used to make Peter Pan Peanut Butter come from Peanut Corporation of America, the company linked to the government's current salmonella investigation," the letter says.
"Our Smucker's peanut butter brand and peanut butter products are safe for consumption.
Americans have shied away from peanut butter despite the FDA's assurances that major-label peanut butter in grocery stores is safe.
They're not."
Tainted peanut butter and peanut paste were shipped by Peanut Corporation of America to institutions such as schools, nursing homes and prisons, not to grocery stores.
I think it's prudent to avoid this stuff until we see where this is going," he said.
