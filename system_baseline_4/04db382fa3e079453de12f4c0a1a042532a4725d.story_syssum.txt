Reporters who had been hastily convened for the news conference, which took place outside the heavily fortified Green Zone where the U.S. Embassy is located, learned that the militia was releasing a man they said was U.S. soldier Randy Michaels.
A Pentagon official insisted all active duty U.S. troops have been accounted for and no civilian was recently reported missing, and even the man's ex-wife said she didn't know he had been kidnapped.
Hultz said he was held in various locations across the Iraqi capital by Promised Day Brigade members.
Maha al-Douri, a lawmaker and a member of the al-Sadr movement, said at the news conference that the man had been in captivity for nine months, consistent with the reported June 2011 abduction date.
Hultz was not among them.
Another U.S. official with knowledge of Hultz, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he returned to Iraq in 2006 as a civilian contractor.
Sometime after returning to Iraq, Hultz moved into private business.
As to Hultz, by Sunday he'd been provided "all necessary consular services, including a medical check-up and debriefing," according to the U.S. Embassy.
"The Embassy reminds all private American citizens living and working in Iraq to register with the Embassy at travel.state.gov and to pay heed to the Iraq country-specific information, including the current travel warning for Iraq," the U.S. government said in its statement.
