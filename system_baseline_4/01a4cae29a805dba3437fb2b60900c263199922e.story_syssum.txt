Erika Murray was arraigned September 12 on a bevy of charges stemming from the discovery of the dead infants at her home the day before, but she has not been charged in their deaths.
Just how many children lived with them in the vermin-infested 1,150-square-foot home, however, depends on which parent you ask: of the four living children that the state removed from the home on August 28, Murray told investigators that Rivera, 38, only knew about two of them.
Rivera also "presumably" did not know about the ones that had died, at least according to the account Murray has told authorities, Halpern said.
"She was terrified of the pregnancies being discovered," said Halpern.
Why?
"I feel certain that she did not do anything to harm any of these children," he said.
This was not the first time a 51A had been filed when it came to that home, according to a Massachusetts Department of Children and Families spokeswoman.
For now, Isaksen said DCF has Murray's four children in its care and is focused on  "ensuring (their) safety and well-being and providing them with the proper medical care, support and services they need," she said.
"Our investigation will continue for quite some time," said Joseph Early, the Worcester County District Attorney.
