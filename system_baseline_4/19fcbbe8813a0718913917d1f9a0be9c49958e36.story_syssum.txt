(CNN) -- My decision to join the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) in college was not part of my life plan.
I jumped out of perfectly good airplanes, rappelled, solved problems and met some amazing people the 32 years I have served my country.
One of the most affirming moments in my life was the day I was promoted to brigadier general.
So, this is NOT about me.
It is about living fearlessly every day.
