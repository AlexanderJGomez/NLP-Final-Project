What about when she tried to bribe her younger sister with candy for kisses -- behavior she likened to that of a "sexual predator" -- or when she touched herself while the two girls shared a bed?
He accused them of enabling behavior "that would be considered child abuse" in some places.
What matters more than what Williamson and others make of their childhood relationship is how Dunham's sister, Grace, responded to the events as a child, how their parents addressed them in the moment, and how they continue to affect the younger sibling, now 22.
At the very least, it's not the kind of behavior that warrants branding a pre-pubescent Lena Dunham a child abuser.
"It can be difficult to tell the difference between age appropriate sexual exploration and warning signs of harmful behavior," Brateman said.

Parents should also look out for patterns of aggression, physical force or coercion at any age, such as preoccupations with touching breasts or public exposure, especially if the behavior continues with age.
Many critics cited the age difference between the sisters as evidence of Lena Dunham's inherently abusive behavior, a valid argument because research shows that the age differential matters.
"Ultimately the deciding factor is to sit down with the younger child and get a sense of whether they feel they're being pressured, uncomfortable or coerced; and, to do it in way that makes clear to the child they're not at fault," said Gold, whose research focuses on adult victims of childhood sexual abuse.
"Right now, we're teaching children to tell someone, but basically putting the responsibility on the child to make it stop and that can be damaging if (we're) not teaching adults the importance of taking decisive action," he said.
