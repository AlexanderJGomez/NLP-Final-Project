On Monday, President Barack Obama offered the best rebuttal to date.
But instead of the "liberty-only" patriotism of Reagan and political descendants such as Paul Ryan, who would turn love of country into hate for its government and its people, Obama offered a deeper "liberty and justice for all" patriotism.
But while Reagan advanced the simplistic idea that government and liberty are always at odds, Obama's speech reflected the realizations of a new century.
Instead of "government is the problem," the president reminded us that we could all fall victim to sudden misfortune.
I do not think that following through will be easy, or that the president will do everything right.
