Winner: 11-year-old Sebastien De La Cruz, "El Charro de Oro" (the golden horseman) who became a national story after he sang the national anthem at Game 3 of the NBA playoff series between the San Antonio Spurs and Miami Heat and showed a lot of a talent, heart and class.
"Is this the American National Anthem or the Mexican Hat Dance?
Here's a quiz:
Now, which do you think represents what it means to be an American?
Meanwhile, De La Cruz took the high road.
It's not hurting me.
My father and my mother told me that you should never judge people by how they look.
De La Cruz is a Mexican-American born in San Antonio.
The part about De La Cruz being Mexican-American, as opposed to a Mexican immigrant, is essential to the story.
"My father was actually in the Navy for a really long time...People don't know, they just assume that I'm just Mexican.
The next chapter will be where some Mexican-Americans actually turn on De La Cruz for appearing to distance himself from Mexico.
De La Cruz was invited back to perform an encore of the national anthem at Game 4.
I bet there wasn't a dry eye in the arena.
"To be invited back to sing the national anthem is just amazing because now I know the San Antonio Spurs like how I sing," Sebastien said.
It was the American thing to do.
