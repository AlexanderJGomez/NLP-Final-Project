(CNN) -- Abdul Aziz believes he was standing right next to a shooter Sunday when gunmen opened fire at a Mother's Day parade in New Orleans, injuring 19 people.
They happen most every Sunday, except during the hottest months in summer, according to Aziz.
I saw muzzle flash, but unfortunately I didn't get a chance to see who the shooter was," he said.
"I'm sad.
According to police, 19 people were injured in the shooting, including two children.
Shots were fired from different guns, and officers saw three suspects running from the scene, police said.
"It's important for us, as I have said, to change the culture of death on the streets of New Orleans to a culture of life, and it's going to take an all-hands-on-deck approach," he said.
