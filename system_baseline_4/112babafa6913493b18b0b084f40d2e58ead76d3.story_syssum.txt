Jan Brewer vetoed a "religious freedom" bill that critics say would have allowed businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians, a supporter of the bill said that community appeared to need no special protection, thank you very much.
Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League, asked CNN's Chris Cuomo, in an interview on "New Day" that became a spirited discussion of marriage.
"You didn't need the law," Cuomo said.
"I think, if people say, 'Listen, I don't want to sanction polygamy or gay marriage or anything other than traditional marriage,' I think we need to respect that," he said.
Cuomo noted that some people marry not to have children but because they seek life-long companionship and commitment.
Why should heterosexual marriage be considered any different than gay marriage, he asked.
That rationale -- that love is all that's needed as a condition for marriage -- could lead to a brother and sister tying the knot, Donohue said.
Donohue said gays and lesbians have individual rights, but contended that "the institution of marriage is best set when we have kids raised by a father and a mother."
he asked.

he asked.
"Marriage is about family -- it's not about love," Donohue said.
"Marriage has always been based, historically, on duty and on commitment," he said.
"If they love each other, that's great," said Donohue.
Donohue said he did not want to discriminate against gays as individuals, only as part of married couples.
"But that's the same thing," said Cuomo.
Donohue ceded no ground, saying he had plenty of allies.
"I do believe that people ought to love gays as we would straights," Donahue said.
"You're bleeding the individual into the institution.
