Some of the victims said they had consumed only one or two beverages before becoming ill, Cle Elum-Roslyn Police Chief Scott Ferguson said.
They said several people at the party used vodka from the bottle to make mixed drinks.
"Whatever occurred up there wasn't consensual," Ferguson told CNN.
She exhibited signs of having ingested a spiked drink, Ferguson said, and was taken to the hospital and later released.
None of the underage people who overdosed meant to get high or unconscious, said Ferguson, and none had more than one or two drinks, KOMO reported.
The party took place at a rental home about 30 minutes from the university campus in Ellensburg, police said.
The owner of the home was not at the party, police said.
"Despite our best efforts, however, students sometimes make bad choices," the university said.
