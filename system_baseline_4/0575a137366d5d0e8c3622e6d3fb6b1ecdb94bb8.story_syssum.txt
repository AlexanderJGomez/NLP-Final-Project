(CNN) -- To control costs and increase flexibility, more and more U.S. mobile users are choosing no-contract plans (month-to-month or prepaid) for cell phone service.
The no-contract carriers studied were: AT&T Gophone, Boost Mobile, Cricket, MetroPCS, Net10, T-Mobile, Tracfone, Verizon Wireless and Virgin Mobile.
Powers reports that this year, about half of of all no-contract customers have month-to-month plans, rather than prepaid ones.
The increase in attractive monthly no-contract offers might start stealing customers away from contracts.
Monthly non-contract customers spend $60 per month, compared with an average monthly service cost of $92 for customers with service contracts."
Some smartphones are now available on no-contract plans.
Right now, the major U.S. wireless carriers are making considerable revenue off of smartphone customers under two-year contracts.
