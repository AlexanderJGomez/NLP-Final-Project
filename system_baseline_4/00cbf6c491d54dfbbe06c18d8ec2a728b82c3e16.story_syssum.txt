After emerging from the showdown over the Republican-led government shutdown relatively unscathed, the Obama administration finds itself under assault on three fronts: problems surrounding Obamacare, the revelations of the U.S. spying on allies, and the 2012 attack on the U.S diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, the latter for which a senator has threatened to hold up all of the Obama administration's nominations.

Then, the White House found itself on the defensive over revelations that, despite claims to the contrary by the Obama administration, some who have purchased insurance on the open market will lose their coverage and have to buy new policies.
White House spokesman Jay Carney argued Monday the administration has always said some health care plans would not meet new Obamacare requirements.
But the reality that so many plans will disappear or have to change seems to fly in the face of what Obama said so often in selling the plan to voters.
"The larger problem is how Obamacare is hurting people out there," Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday.
But it was comments by the administration claiming that Obama did not know of the practice until recently that drew the sharpest criticism -- from both the right and the left.
And Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, said not knowing about the program was a "big problem" for both Obama and the Senate Intelligence Committee, which she chairs.
Senate rules allow a single senator to at least temporarily hold up presidential nominations, and Graham says he will do so until the administration makes survivors of the attack available for congressional testimony.
We need to get to the bottom of this."
