"Harry and his friends start Dumbledore's army to bring awareness to this," said iReporter Andrew Slack.
Slack is the executive director of the Harry Potter Alliance, a nonprofit organization dedicated to engaging Potter fans in social activism.
In the "Potter" books, "implications toward public policy are profound," Slack said.
Slack sees parallels between the magic in the "Potter" books and expanding one's mind to come up with solutions in a creative way.
Earlier this year, the Harry Potter Alliance conducted a book drive for children around the world, an effort led by "Potter" actress Evanna Lynch.
"Potter" author J.K. Rowling has many times compared Voldemort to Adolf Hitler.
For the midnight screenings of "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince," members were encouraged to wear buttons mentioning lessons that Dumbledore taught them.
Rowling herself has praised the Harry Potter Alliance, one of Slack's proudest moments.
Rowling has also written personally to Slack about his efforts.
Science fiction and fantasy aficionados have translated their fandom into real-world action for years.
Members of the Harry Potter Alliance, 4,500 of whom make up the most hardcore group, are inspired by what it has done.
Like Slack, Bolton condemns the "Muggle mindset," what members call an ignorance of or refusal to act on the important issues facing the world.
"I sort of took it as a compliment," he explained.
"There are issues I didn't know much about or hadn't thought about too deeply that I'm now involved in, like Darfur," Bolton said.
