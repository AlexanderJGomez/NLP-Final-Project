(CNN) -- Former Agriculture Department employee Shirley Sherrod said Thursday she will pursue a lawsuit against conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart.
Breitbart "had to know that he was targeting me," Sherrod said.
"This was not about Shirley Sherrod," Breitbart told CNN's John King.
"I wonder if Ms. Sherrod, who is such a champion of transparency, will publicly disclose who is putting her up to this.
"I'm also waiting for Ms. Sherrod to publicly apologize for accusing anyone opposed to nationalized healthcare of being racist," Bozell said.
Obama said earlier Thursday that Sherrod "deserves better than what happened last week."
Speaking at a National Urban League conference in Washington, Obama called the claim of racism against her "bogus."
