"This magnitude 8.2 is not the large earthquake that we were expecting in this area," said Mark Simons, a geophysicist at Caltech in Pasadena, California.
"We're expecting a potentially even larger earthquake."
Since 1973, Chile has had more than a dozen quakes of magnitude-7.0 and above.
Simons says Tuesday's quake is of interest because the fault line along Chile's coast has constantly shifted during the last 140 years.
But the area to the north and south of Tuesday's quake "did not rupture in this event," Simons said.
Given that it's an area of frequent quakes, and frequent ruptures, it may only be a matter of time.
"It may not occur for many, many years."
