Let's be honest, Western Moms would also relish these dazzling results -- valedictorian and violin virtuosity -- but can't imagine themselves, or their kids, committing to the rigid Chinese Mom-style method to guarantee perfection.
But more importantly, Western Moms, and in particular working moms, just don't have the time, energy, or well, discipline.
This is where Western parents fail, she says, by letting our kids give up too quickly.
Seriously, 15 minutes.
Yes, our kids need to excel at algebra, but we want them to not only learn, but to also enjoy learning in a stimulating environment where they can thrive in their own uniqueness.
Chua condemns these methods as Western foolishness.
The Western touchy-feely approach runs counter to the Chinese Mom philosophy.
For Chinese moms, a less-than-perfect child is a disgrace to the family, a slap-in-the-face to the parents -- utter shame.
Western moms just don't get this.
Do we want our children to succeed academically?
But the Western moms I know, particularly working mothers, have neither the desire nor time to run such an extreme household.
Not happening.
I think Western moms are a little envious of at least part of the Chinese mom method.
Maybe that was worth missing all of the sleepovers and play dates and summer camp, but then again, maybe not.
