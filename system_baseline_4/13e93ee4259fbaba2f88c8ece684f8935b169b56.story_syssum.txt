Braydon Nichols asked that the world not forget his father, an Army officer who died when the helicopter he and other soldiers were in was downed in Afghanistan.
Nearly 230 iReports were dedicated to him.
This week, "Dennis" wrote that he keeps on his computer a picture that CNN published of Braydon and his father wearing matching military uniforms.
Those notes mean a lot to Braydon, his uncle Monte Nichols said.
It's been incredible for the whole family to know that people do care," Nichols told CNN this week.
Last year, weeks before that horrible August morning that she had to tell her son that his father was gone, Jessica Nichols recalled how Braydon loved to fantasize giddily about how he and his dad were going camping when he finished fighting bad guys.
The self-assured and computer savvy boy was a miniature Bryan Nichols.
Those children, just like Braydon, need to be taken care of."
There were 32 children who lost a parent in the Chinook tragedy, and two of the wives of the men on board were pregnant, said retired Air Force Maj. Steve McLeary, the executive director of the Special Operations Warrior Foundation.
"We saw the CNN story and within 15 minutes we were on a call with board members who all agreed that every child who lost a parent on that helicopter would have their college expenses covered by us, whether their parents were special operations or not," McLeary said.
The Special Operations Warrior Foundation is covering all college tuition and room and board expenses for those children, too, McLeary said.
"We don't just give money, we develop relationships with these kids from the start," McLeary said.
The Special Operations Warrior Foundation has over 900 kids in their program, McLeary said.
If Braydon's first wish was that people never forget his dad, Monte Nichols said, his second is that no one forgets kids like him.
