What kind of font are you?
"Fonts form a kind of language of their own, and we are all unconsciously fluent in it," she says when I visit her studio in Hackney, north London.
By way of demonstration, she lines up three bottles on the table, next to a sample of three fonts: Comic Sans, Times New Roman and Helvetica.
As bizarre as it sounds, my job is to match up the bottles and fonts using only my sense of smell.
It was surprisingly easy.
"We've found that rounded fonts are commonly associated with deep reds and sweet tastes," she says.
To illustrate, Hyndman takes out another collection of props: candy bags with different fonts pinned to the outside.
I think for a moment, and decide that Gill Sans is the most "me".
This analysis is based on the cultural context of the Gill Sans font, which was created in 1926 by Eric Gill, who was inspired by Edward Johnston's iconic London Underground typeface.
It seems elegant, characterful and balanced, somehow.
But I do write for CNN (whose logo, Hyndman says, is "sweet with a little bit of savory, a little twist of crunch").
Admittedly, it's not completely watertight.
For those interested to know more, Sarah Hyndman has launched a new series of "Tuesday Type Tastings" in London.
