The House of Representatives passes an energy bill that includes a "cap-and-trade" program on emissions.
"This is the biggest job-killing bill that has ever been on the floor of the House of Representatives.
This bill," Boehner said.
Congressional sources said Democrats were hoping their constituents would also attempt to match phone calls opposed to the bill with phone calls for the bill.
Ventura said the bill was likely behind the phone-line crash.
"Now is the time for us to lead," Obama said during an appearance Thursday in the White House Rose Garden.
"This is a jobs bill."
"And it's disproportionately vote 'no.'"
Having cleared the House, the bill now faces an unclear future in the Senate, where Democratic leaders have held off on introducing their own version of the legislation.
