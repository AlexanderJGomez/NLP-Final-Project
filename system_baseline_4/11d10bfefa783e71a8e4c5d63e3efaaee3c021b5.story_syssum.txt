After 14 long years in the dustbins of Congress, mainly due to strong opposition from the Catholic Church, the Reproductive Health (RH) Bill was approved by both the Senate and the House of Representatives on Monday, 17 December 2012.
Not having a reproductive health law is cruelty to the poor.
Many poor women do not receive information on how to receive reproductive health care.
The children remain undernourished and undereducated because their parents are ignorant about reproductive health care and choices.
In short, the bill merely wants to empower a Filipino woman from the poorest economic class to march to the nearest facility operated by the Department of Health or the local government unit, to demand information on a family planning product or supply of her choice.
It is not a fascist diktat of a totalitarian power structure.
Apart from the Catholic Church, all other major religions in the Philippines support the RH Bill.
These constitute the top-ranking ulama, deemed to have the authority to issue opinions on matters facing Islam and Muslims.
An October 2012 survey among young people aged 15 to 19 years old in Manila shows that 83% agree that there should be a law in the Philippines on reproductive health and family planning.
Reproductive health care is a human right.
