Medina, who has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder, said he and his wife, Jennifer Alonso, were having an argument in the bedroom when "she started throwing stuff, objects, towards me," such as towels, mascara, creams, boxes and shoes.
At one point, he pulled a gun on his wife and told her to stop.
They talked again downstairs, where she unloaded a volley of punches on him.
Medina told police that Alonso threatend to kill him with a knife, but he disarmed her.
He told police Alonso also said she would have someone kill him.
An autopsy report released on Thursday said Alonso suffered gunshot wounds to her left forearm.
Seven bullets and two bullet fragments were recovered.
