Across social media, she's known as "The Woman in Red."
International headlines have proclaimed her an "icon" of the movement against the government of Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan.
"The violence of the police against peaceful protesters, people just trying to protect themselves and what they value."
But the truth is that woman in red told CNN Wednesday that she wants no part of this.
"There is not (a) difference between them and I."
Riot police moved in, lobbing tear gas and using pepper spray.
The 240,000-member KESK confederation of public-sector workers called for a two-day strike to protest what it calls the "fascism" of Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party.
