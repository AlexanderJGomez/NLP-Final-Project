New York (CNN) -- A New York college student died of head injuries last week during a fraternity ritual held in Pennsylvania, the local coroner's office said Monday.
The objective was for Deng, who was blindfolded and wearing a backpack filled with a 20-pound bag of sand, to navigate toward someone who was calling for him "while other fraternity brothers physically prevent that from happening," witnesses said, according to the affidavit.
Later, three fraternity members drove Deng to a Pennsylvania hospital early on the morning of December 8, authorities said.
In a statement, Baruch College said last week that Deng died while participating in an unsanctioned fraternity pledging event.
