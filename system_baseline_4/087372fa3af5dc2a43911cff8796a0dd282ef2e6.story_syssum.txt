The minister, Ali al-Amrani, was headed to the prime minister's office when the attack occurred, spokesman Abdul Basit al-Qaedi told CNN.
Al-Amrani was not hurt in the attack, al-Qaedi said.
Al-Amrani told CNN the country is facing a critical time for change and all Yemenis must stand together to support Hadi.
Demonstrators have continued their protests against the president, despite a power transfer deal that leads to his departure.
