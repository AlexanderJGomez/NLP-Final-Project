(CNN) -- For Thomas Tugend, there was no doubt which side he was fighting for as a young infantryman in Europe in World War II.
That the Tugend family was successful, educated and loyal Germans no longer meant anything.
The Tugend's longtime nanny, a mother figure to young Thomas, was forced to leave because of a government edict prohibiting non-Jewish Germans from working in Jewish homes.
As a result, the Tugend family was forced to move from their comfortable home to a poorer part of the city.
"He told my mother to forget the furniture and pack up what she could and get out," Tugend said.
"The reason so many German Jews didn't leave when they had the chance was because they couldn't believe what was happening," Tugend said.
Despite their escape, Tugend said his father was never the same.
"Even then I knew the historical significance of the war and I wanted to be a part of it," he said.
Thomas Tugend was sent to France, where he faced his former countrymen in battle.
Once the Army found out Tugend spoke fluent German, his commanders created a new job for him.
"Every town and village I went to," Tugend said, "I would be told, 'No, I'm not a Nazi.
"You have to understand, the average German may have known what the Nazis were up to, but I think most of them were just trying to survive," he said.
Tugend left the Army soon after the war's end, but he wasn't finished fighting.
He was later recalled by the U.S. Army to serve in the Korean War.
After all these years, Tugend is philosophical about his family's escape from certain death at the hands of the Nazis, and his time as an infantryman at war.
