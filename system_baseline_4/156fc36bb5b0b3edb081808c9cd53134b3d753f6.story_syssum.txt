(CNN) -- An Arizona woman is accused of injecting feces-laced fluid into her 66-year-old husband's IV as the couple was alone in his recovery room following his surgery, police said.
"This is the first that I've heard where fecal matter has been injected into an IV system," Favazzo told KTVK.
A test revealed the fluid contained fecal matter, police said.
Police don't have a motive, Favazzo said.
