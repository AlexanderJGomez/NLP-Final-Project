Prosecutors said they will appeal the decision, and bail for Valle was set at $100,000.
Defense attorney Julia Gatto said the decision backed up her assertion that Valle is "guilty of nothing more than very unconventional thoughts ... We don't put people in jail for their thoughts.
"The evidentiary record is such that it is more likely than not the case that all of Valle's Internet communications about kidnapping are fantasy role-play," Gardephe said in the 118-page opinion released Monday night.
The database, which Valle was trained to use and had access to as a police officer, helped him research potential victims, prosecutors said.
Valle, a six-year NYPD veteran, was convicted after prosecutors presented evidence such as a document found on his wife's laptop titled "Abducting and Cooking Kimberly -- A Blueprint."
"He is anxious to get home to his family, the people who supported him through this whole ordeal," she said of her client on Tuesday.
