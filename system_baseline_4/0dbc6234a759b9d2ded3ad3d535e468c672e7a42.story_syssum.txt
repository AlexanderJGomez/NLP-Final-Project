(CNN) -- Gareth Bale's imminent transfer to Real Madrid for a reported world-record fee has been criticized by Barcelona coach Gerardo Martino.
Barca spent $75 million to sign Neymar from Santos in June, but Martino said the Brazil striker is not guaranteed to start Sunday's match in Malaga despite the absence of the injured Lionel Messi.
Neymar came off the bench to score the equalizer against Atletico, but Martino played down expectations surrounding the 21-year-old.
The 24-year-old Wales international, who became the most sought-after talent on the planet following Neymar's decision to join Barca, also missed the London club's opening match of the EPL season last weekend.
Former Villa and England striker Darren Bent marked his Fulham debut with a goal after coming on as a second-half substitute, but Arsenal notched another morale-boosting win ahead of the second leg of the Champions League qualifier against Fenerbahce -- having won 3-0 in Turkey last Wednesday.
David Lopez headed a 33rd-minute equalizer before second-half goals from Cristian Stuani and Thievy Bifouma sealed victory for the Barcelona-based team.
Real Sociedad came back to earth with a bump following last week's 2-0 win over Lyon in the final Champions League qualifying round, being held 1-1 at promoted Elche.
