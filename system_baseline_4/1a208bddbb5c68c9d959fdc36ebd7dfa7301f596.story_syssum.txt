Errand Frazier of Vero Beach wasn't quite sure what to do at first when he heard purring coming from his Chevy pickup, parked outside his house in late May.
When he came back the next morning, the food was gone, but there was nothing on the video, he said.
"I said, 'What in the world?
In the past, Frazier said, he has rescued stray kittens and brought them to the local Humane Society.
"I said, 'Ma'am, there's a kitten that hitchhiked from my home and I can't get it,"" Frazier said.
Humane Society staff member Tonya Martinez got under Frazier's truck to try to move the kitten forward, while staff member Maria Valencia put on gloves to catch the kitty and animal care supervisor Robyn Krajewski stood ready with a special carrier, said Janet Winikoff, director of education at the local Humane Society, who posted the story on CNN iReport.
He took it as a sign.
On Friday, the Humane Society set up a special "kitty truck fund" to help Frazier.
On Friday, the couple said they weren't worried about the truck and hoped people would just donate to the humane society to help other animals.
"We really never expected all of this, to be honest, but God does blessings every day," Cindy Frazier said.
