Violence remains a critical issue, but economic issues -- bilateral and global -- have risen to the fore as both countries struggle to emerge from the global slowdown.
With its neighbors Mexico and Canada, however, the United States actually co-manufactures products.
The comparable figures with China, Brazil and India are 4%, 3% and 2%, respectively.
Pursuing an Open Skies Agreement between the two nations' airlines and making the cross-border trucking pilot program -- in which Mexican truckers can carry goods deep into the United States and vice versa -- would also strengthen competitiveness.
Without doubt, security cooperation will also remain a critical part of the relationship between the nations.
Migration is the one issue the two leaders will talk about Tuesday that matters a great deal to both nations but does not lend itself easily to a bilateral agreement.
Finally, as Mexico continues to grow economically, it will be increasingly possible for the two governments to focus on global challenges.
But as the bilateral relationship develops, relations between the nations might one day resemble those between the United States and Canada, in which global issues can be equally important.
