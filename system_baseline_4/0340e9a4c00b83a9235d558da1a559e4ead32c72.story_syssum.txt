(CNN) -- A Jackson, Mississippi, high school basketball coach is accused of whipping students for "failing to run basketball plays correctly," according to a federal lawsuit filed this week by three students.
The students are still attending classes and are playing on the boy's varsity basketball team, Ross said.
"In taking action, the school district considered the seriousness of the circumstances, prevailing policy, input and concerns from parents and the athletes involved, and Coach Dorsey's overall employee performance record.
The three students were beaten for "no legitimate purpose whatsoever," but Dorsey accused them of "failing to run basketball plays correctly," the suit said.
"I paddled my students... today, some of [sic] students have lost pride in their school and in their (sic) selves.
Principal Freddrick Murray is also named as a defendant.
