If that isn't a wave out there on the horizon, it is, at the moment anyway, a big, Republican-leaning ripple.
Odds of a GOP takeover of the Senate are looking up eight weeks to Election Day.
This cycle, GOP strategists say a great night would be adding 15-18 seats to the Republican majority; Democrats are hoping to keep their losses in single digits.
"I don't see any evidence of a wave like we had in '06 or '08," says Ayres.
In the CNN poll numbers, the encouraging news for the President is that he and the public are largely in sync about how muscular to be in responding to ISIS.
Even so, his job approval rating is stagnant at 43%, and the percentage of Americans who think things are going badly in the country stands at 55%, up from 50% in April.
But for now, the numbers are compelling: A weak President and a worried electorate are the trademark ingredients of a wave.
