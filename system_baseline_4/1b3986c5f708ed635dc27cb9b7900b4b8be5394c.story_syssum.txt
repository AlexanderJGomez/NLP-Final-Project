It can be exhausting nursing a child through a nasty bout with the flu, so imagine how 22-year-old Fatu Kekula felt nursing her entire family through Ebola.
Fatu took care of them all, single-handedly feeding them, cleaning them and giving them medications.
Instead Fatu, who's in her final year of nursing school, invented her own equipment.
Every day, several times a day for about two weeks, Fatu put trash bags over her socks and tied them in a knot over her calves.
UNICEF Spokeswoman Sarah Crowe said Fatu is amazing.
Her Ebola nightmare started Juy 27, when her father, Moses, had a spike in blood pressure.
Then the hospital closed down because nurses started dying of Ebola.
They said he had typhoid fever and did little for him, so Fatu took him home, where he infected three other family members: Fatu's mother, Victoria, 57; Fatu's sister, Vivian, 28, and their 14-year-old cousin who was living with them, Alfred Winnie.
While operating her one-woman Ebola hospital for two weeks, Fatu consulted with their family doctor, who would talk to her on the phone, but wouldn't come to the house.

"I'm very, very proud," her father said.
"I'm sure she'll be a great giant of Liberia," he said.
