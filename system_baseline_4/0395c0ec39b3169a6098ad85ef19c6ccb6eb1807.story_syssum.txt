"The entire society has solidarity for the loss of one of the most important and oldest fortresses in our country," said Home Minister Minjur Dorji, who has been on the site for the last three days, in a telephone call.
"It's not just a Bhutanese architectural loss but for the whole Himalayan region," Dasho Karma Ura, president of the Thimphu-based Center for Bhutan Studies, said by telephone on Tuesday before visiting the site.
Although an investigation is still under way, a short circuit in the wiring is believed to have caused the fire, according to the minister, adding that the dzong was 95% built of timber.
By Tuesday, only stones, which comprised the stairs before the dzong's entrance, remained of the dzong, according to the Bhutan newspaper, Kuensel, which reported that numerous administrative documents were lost.
No one was killed in the blaze, and all people have been accounted for, the home minister said, noting that Sunday had been a holiday, and that monks' residences were constructed outside the dzong.
"Dzongs are priceless," he said.
Only Simtokha Dzong and Punakha Dzong, both completed in 1631 and also by Zhabdrung, are older.
This week's fire will prompt Bhutan to shift its policy to protect its centuries-old dzongs, the home minister said.
"It was one of the most magnificent sites of Bhutan -- that dzong," said Dasho Karma.
It was always a great esthetic experience to sit quietly at the point where you could see that dzong."
