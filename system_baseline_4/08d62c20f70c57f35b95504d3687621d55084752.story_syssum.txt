Although the rules apply to all IM service providers, they are widely seen as targeting WeChat, the immensely popular mobile app that allows people to share text, videos, photos and audio recording with multiple users at once.
Public accounts on any mobile IM platform will also need to register with authorities using the real names of the owners.
Prominent Weibo users were later detained or prosecuted, on charges both related and unrelated to their online activities.
Another user of a popular WeChat account on current affairs said that the new regulation "will definitely impact what I'm going to post in the future.
"It's quite obvious now, other public accounts are definitely going to be more cautious about republishing political news because no one knows how strongly the rules will be enforced.
The three-year-old WeChat, owned by Tencent holdings, is unlike any other mobile app.
We welcome users to report such instance to us via online channel."

This is a highly innovative fusion of a variety of different digital services, and it's beautifully engineered.
