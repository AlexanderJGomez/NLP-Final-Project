Of the 1.4 million dogs euthanized at shelters last year, roughly half were pit bull types, Merritt Clifton says.
Officials and animal rights advocates agree that the dogs must lose this last battle for their lives because of their brutal training and risks to people and other animals.
Clifton and other experts estimate anywhere from 25 to 50 percent of pit bulls euthanized at shelters were fighting dogs.
Owners sometimes kill the dogs that don't win.
If the dogs do make it to shelters, they are usually euthanized quickly.

The stigma associated with pit bull types has victimized the "good" pit bulls, Pacelle said.
More than 90 percent of pit bulls in shelters -- fighters or not -- end up euthanized, said Clifton, who has been researching animal shelters for more than three decades.
The secondary fighting market has contributed to over breeding of pit bulls, Clifton said.
Considering the risk the fighting dogs pose to shelters, potential owners and other animals, "they just don't have a chance," Clifton said.
