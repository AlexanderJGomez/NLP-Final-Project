Ford and Mazda said 591,245 vehicles were potentially affected, according to the automakers' reports to the NHTSA in 2004.
All 730,000 are 2001-2004 Ford Escape and Mazda Tribute SUVs with V6 engines, according to the NHTSA.
The 2004 Ford and Mazda recalls were for the vehicle speed control cables in their affected vehicles.
The Center for Auto Safety petitioned the NHTSA to open a similar investigation on July 8.
The NHTSA has opened the investigation to assess "the scope, frequency and safety-related consequences of the alleged defect," the agency said.
