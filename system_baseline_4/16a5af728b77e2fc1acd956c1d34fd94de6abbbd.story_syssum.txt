Common also performed at "CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute" last year.
Common: I started (the foundation) with some of my team members because we wanted to give back to the youth who didn't have some of the opportunities we had.
Common: I grew up on the South Side of Chicago with my mother and my stepfather, and I was provided a nice home, a home with love in it.
As a teacher, she's an educator and also would just go the extra mile to help people.
I want to empower them first by letting them know that they are loved and people do care.
But they have other people that do care.
Common: (It) was an incredible experience.
These are people who do work for real in the world helping people.
But more than anything, I was grateful to be there and observe people and honor the people that were selected to be CNN Heroes, because it was well deserved and they inspired us all.
Common: A hero to me is someone who is able to take whatever talent, gift, personality, quality and utilize it to help build others.
