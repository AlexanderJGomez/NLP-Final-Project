From its twisted opening scene, where a floor of coked-up boiler-room meatheads toss dwarfs for bacchanalian sport, the feverishly paced film is hell-bent on making the audience feel like they just snorted a Belushian mountain of blow.
As with any high, though, it also doesn't know when to stop.
He gives a hell of a performance that's electrifyingly loose, perversely funny, and dripping with jerk charisma.
He proves to be such a born salesman that in no time he and his merry band of macho Bayside, Queens, goombahs (led by a terrific Jonah Hill as Belfort's bucktoothed loose-cannon sidekick) have more money than they know what to do with.
But the director also has to know that his film could have used some trimming.
Clocking in at just a minute under three hours, "Wolf" starts to repeat itself as we're given one scene after another of men behaving badly.
Still, Scorsese has pulled off something tricky with "Wolf": He's given us a thrilling cautionary tale about a guy who never for a second seems the slightest bit sorry for what he's done.
