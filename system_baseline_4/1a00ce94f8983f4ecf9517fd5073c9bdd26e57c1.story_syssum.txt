Four people believed to be connected to the drugs found in Philip Seymour Hoffman's apartment were arrested late Tuesday night, law enforcement officials told CNN.
The source identified the suspects being investigated in connection with drugs sold to Hoffman as Juliana Luchkiw, 22; Max Rosenblum, 22; Robert Vineberg, 57; and Thomas Cushman, 48.
Police discovered the largest amount of what is believed to be heroin in his apartment, the source said.
"He used to practice at night," said the former neighbor, recounting that Vineberg played keyboards.
"These charges have absolutely nothing to do with Philip Seymour Hoffman's unfortunate death," Kratt said.
Also found in Hoffman's apartment was his personal journal, resting on a living room TV stand, two law enforcement sources said.
Last week, Maryland officials said heroin tainted with fentanyl had claimed at least 37 lives since September.
On Tuesday,  a law enforcement source told CNN that the night before Hoffman died, he withdrew $1,200 from a grocery store ATM near his  apartment.
"Anything I could get my hands on, I liked it all," he said.
...
It really was, it was just that," he said.
And at that point, he took off his hat and he said, 'I'm a heroin addict,'" Arundel said.
But actor George Clooney said he had dinner with Hoffman a few months ago, and he seemed  fine.
Filmmaker Chris Barrett interviewed Hoffman January 17 at the Sundance Film Festival.
On Wednesday night, the famed Broadway theater district will dim its marquees for one minute at 7:45 p.m. in Hoffman's memory.
He starred in a Broadway production of "Death of a Salesman" in 2012 and was co-artistic director of the Labyrinth Theater Company in New York.
Kritzer said she had long admired Hoffman from afar.
