Yellowstone's magma reserves are many magnitudes greater than previously thought, say scientists from the University of Utah.
It may help scientists better understand why Yellowstone's previous eruptions, in prehistoric times, were some of Earth's largest explosions in the last few million years.
The magma chamber, which scientists already knew about, lies on top of the reservoir -- and draws magma from it.
Also, the discovery doesn't mean that there is now more magma than there was before, the scientists say.
An eruption in the next few thousand years is extremely unlikely, the USGS says.
To understand the consequences of Yellowstone's previous eruptions, open the history books to 1815, when Mount Tambora blew many cubic miles of debris skyward and killed about 10,000 inhabitants of Indonesia in an instant, according to a report in Smithsonian Magazine.
Yellowstone has dwarfed that at least three times, the USGS says.
Long before that, 2 million years ago, volcanic activity blew 600 cubic miles of Yellowstone debris into the air.
"If another large caldera-forming eruption were to occur at Yellowstone, its effects would be worldwide," the USGS says.
Here are the upper magma chamber and lower magma reservoir by the numbers.
The lower reservoir, which has a volume of 11,200 cubic miles, measures about 30 by 44 miles and is about 16 miles thick.
