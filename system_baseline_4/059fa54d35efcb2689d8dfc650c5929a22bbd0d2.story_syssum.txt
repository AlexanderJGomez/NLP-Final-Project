(CNN)Nineteen-year-old Tony Robinson was not armed when a Madison, Wisconsin, police officer fatally shot him, Police Chief Mike Koval said Saturday.
Robinson was shot after allegedly assaulting Kenny, who was responding Friday evening to a reported disturbance at a Madison residence, Koval said.
That's absolutely appropriate under these circumstances.
Koval said he visited the home of Robinson's mother late Friday night and met Robinson's grandparents outside the house.
Robinson's mother, Andrea Irwin, told CNN affiliate WKOW that she didn't understand what happened.
The incident started when authorities got a call that a black male was yelling and jumping in front of cars, Koval said.
When Kenny went to the apartment, he heard some commotion and forced his way in, Koval said.
Koval said he's not sure what Robinson was doing at the house in the first place.
"They are all in my thoughts and prayers," Schimel said.
Once DCI completes the investigation, the report will go to the local district attorney, Koval said.
"Who do we trust?"
"We've got a family that's really hurting," Soglin said, according to WKOW.
She said Madison police park on street corners in African-American neighborhoods and wait for something to happen, which leads to residents being hassled.
That doesn't happen in white neighborhoods, she said.
