But a new line of Harry Potter stamps released this week by the U.S.
Postal Service has outraged some stamp enthusiasts.
At this point, I'd be all for a stamp bearing the image of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford smoking crack if that could generate revenue.
Look, I understand that one of the mandates of the Postal Service is, "portraying the American experience to a world audience through the issuance of postage stamps."
In 2001, the Postal Service came under fire from some on the right when it released the Frida Kahlo stamp because she was a Communist, a Mexican and a bisexual.
Why?
Rather, it's because stamp purists are dismayed by the increasing commercialization of U.S. postage stamps.
Keep in mind that the stamp featuring Elvis Presley is the top seller of all time with over 700 million sold.
So I say it's time for the Postal Service to roll out stamps that will make money.
