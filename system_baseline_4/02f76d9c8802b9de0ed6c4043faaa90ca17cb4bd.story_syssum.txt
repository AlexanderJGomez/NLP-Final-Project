(CNN) -- Renewable energy is generating a lot of political heat.
Around the world renewable energy is going through a rebirth.
The modern renewable industry -- wind, solar, and other forms of energy -- was born with a great deal of excitement in the 1970s and early 1980s.
But the early hopes soon crashed on the harsh reality of lower energy prices and the fact that the technologies were still immature and not yet ready for primetime.
The European Union's energy policy is now predicated on using renewables to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 80% by 2050.
In order to meet its rapidly growing needs for energy, China is pursuing all options -- oil and coal and natural gas and nuclear power, as well as renewables.
Over the last decade, growing support by governments for renewable energy has been critical to its development.
The most aggressive of all is California, where about 15% of electricity today is renewable.
Renewables need to overcome two big hurdles.
Success there would be a major breakthrough for renewable energy
Renewables are carbon free.
The costs of solar energy continue to come down, and many of the new approaches under development and in the lab are aimed at further cost reductions.
To achieve big impact, however, renewables still need to establish that they are competitive at large scale.
That adds to the cost pressures on renewable energy.
As costs go down, more solar will come into use around the world.
In other words, wind and solar have much ground to cover, and it will take time.
Renewable will be part of a growing global business that will be measured in hundreds of billions of dollars.
That will be determined by a mix of government policy, technological advance, the world's energy needs -- and by sheer economics.
