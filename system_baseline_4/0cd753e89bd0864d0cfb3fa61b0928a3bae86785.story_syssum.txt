(CNN) -- The bodies of two dolphins and the head of another have washed up along the Gulf Coast, raising red flags for federal investigators already looking into roughly half a dozen dolphin killings.
"We have submitted those results to the federal enforcement officers, who are going to do additional exams or testing to further clarify the cause of death," he said.
The remains of the latest three dolphins were found in Mississippi.
The first dolphin was found January 8 with a bullet wound on Deer Island, near Biloxi, Mississippi.
On October 10, a dolphin was found on the beach in Dauphin Island, Alabama, with its fluke cut off.
On November 6, a dolphin was found dead with numerous cuts near Ocean Springs, Mississippi.
We need public input and information," he said.
