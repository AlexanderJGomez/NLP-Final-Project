Up to 1 meter (3.2 feet) of water was expected in some areas, said Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, as the Chao Phraya River spilled into the city of 12 million people.
"There is water from underground coming up," said Pracha Promnok, chief of the Flood Relief Operations Center.
"Many are exhausted and some problems cannot be controlled and were not caused by (the center)," Yingluck said, according to MCOT.
"We are confident that we will not be affected," Toopetch said.
In the resort town of Pattaya, fleeing Bangkok residents found it hard to get a room in hotels overflowing with European tourists, the Bangkok Post reported.
Thanyarat Hemkittiwat said she was planning to leave Bangkok to stay with relatives outside the city.
Ambassador Kristie Kenny said the crisis was slow-moving and it was hard to know what would be hit next.

The government has called the flooding the worst to afflict the nation in half a century and said it might take more than a month before the waters recede from some areas.
