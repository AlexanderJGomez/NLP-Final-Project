LONDON, England (CNN) -- British reality TV star Jade Goody married Sunday after being told by doctors last week that her cancer is terminal.
Shetty said last week that she was unable to attend the wedding due to filming commitments but was praying for Goody.
News of Goody's condition has sparked massive interest in the UK, both from the media -- which bid for rights to her story -- and among the public, who have contacted charities for information about cervical cancer.
But Clifford told ITN: "Ironically, a big part of what she's doing now is to fund her children's education.
"Read an article on Jade Goody's deteriorating condition," wrote Shetty.
"I hope Jack makes a good father to them.
"It will be the dream finish to her dream day, and it makes so much difference.
The wedding dress, which media reports say included a pouch to hold Goody's medication, was donated by Harrods owner Mohamed al Fayed.
