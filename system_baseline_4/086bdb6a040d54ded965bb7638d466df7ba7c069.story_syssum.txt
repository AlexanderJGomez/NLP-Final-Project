For French football clubs it's a new punitive tax law that's worrying them to death.
So if you're a French football fan don't expect to be watching the likes Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic or Monaco forward Falcao in action between 29 November and 2 December.
If it goes ahead it would France's first football "strike" since 1972.
But PSG could be at a further disadvantage in future given Monaco are exempt from French taxation laws and the principality club's tax expenditure would be $67.5 million less than the French champions per year.
"The high-income tax of 75%, which was included in the 2013 draft budget of France, will have a disastrous effect on the competitiveness of French football," said the Professional Union of Football Clubs (UCPF) in a statement.
French football has a strong tradition of developing young players through its academy system, but a French club hasn't won the Champions League -- Europe's top competition -- for over 20 years, though last season PSG reached the quarterfinals.
"In the short term clubs would have to buy cheaper players for lower transfers and would pay lower salaries to avoid paying the 75%," said Karlsen as he outlined a grim future for French football.
And given France's economic problems -- it has only just emerged from recession -- some members of the French football community remain uneasy about the proposed strike.
"I'm not totally for (the strike) personally, what worries me of course is that there is this tax, but, all French people suffer from having to pay taxes.
