(RollingStone.com) -- Paul Reubens is dusting off his red bow-tie once more for a film revival of his iconic character Pee-wee Herman.
"Steven Spielberg?"
The script was written by Reubens and comedian Paul Rust â€” whose writing credits also include "Arrested Development" and "Comedy Bang!
After missing the final cut for the 1980 cast of "Saturday Night Live," Reubens adapted the eccentric character for the stage with "The Pee-wee Herman Show," which gained national exposure after being filmed and released by HBO as a 1981 special.
As a sign of his character's '80s legacy, Pee-wee (not Reubens) was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
With Pee-wee then the punchline of dirty schoolyard jokes, Reubens retired the character for most of the decade.
