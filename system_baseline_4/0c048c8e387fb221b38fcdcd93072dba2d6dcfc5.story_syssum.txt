Now doctors say another child born with the virus appears to be free of HIV after receiving similar treatment.
The girl was delivered at Miller Children's Hospital in Long Beach, California, last summer to a mother with HIV who had not received antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy.
The California baby is still on antiretroviral treatment, so it's too soon to tell if the child is actually in remission.
A clinical trial designed to test the effectiveness of early treatment on infants born to HIV-positive mothers is set to begin in the next couple of months, she said.
Doctors administered the antiretroviral drugs 30 hours after the girl was born in hopes of controlling the virus.
In March 2013, researchers announced that the girl was the first child to be "functionally cured" of HIV.
A "functional cure" is when the presence of the virus is so small, lifelong treatment is not necessary and standard clinical tests cannot detect the virus in the blood.
And HIV-positive mothers who are given appropriate treatment pass on the virus in less than 2% of cases.
Researchers say the only other documented case of an HIV cure is that of Timothy Brown, known as the "Berlin patient."
"I've been tested everywhere possible," said Brown, who now lives in San Francisco.
In June, five years after he was "cured," reports surfaced that "traces" of the virus had been found in Brown's blood.
In July, Boston researchers said two HIV patients showed no sign of the virus in their blood following bone marrow transplants.
