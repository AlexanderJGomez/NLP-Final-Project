In a 26-minute audio message posted on a jihadist website Friday, al-Zawahiri called on the Syria's al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra, also known as al-Nusra Front, to stop fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).
The clashes pit Jabhat al-Nusra and another group against ISIS, according to the SOHR.
Al Qaeda splinter group ISIS this week staged bodies to look like they were crucified in the northern Syrian city of Raqqa.
As Syria's civil war creates a power vacuum, groups such as ISIS have stepped in with their own form of radical Sharia law to rule over an exhausted and terrorized civilian population.
In the first part of the interview, which was posted online two weeks ago, al-Zawahiri insisted al Qaeda is holding strong and, in fact, "expanding" 13 years after the United States launched its "war on terror" following the September 11, 2001, attacks.
