(CNN) -- Nineteen-year-old Sergio Peña is living his dream.
Peña may say it feels like play, but his work ethic says otherwise.
"He loved it from day one," his father said.
Jai Peña bankrolled his son's efforts for many years.
"The economy is tough, but if I had to do it again, I think I would do it again."
"The main goal of the 'Drive for Diversity' program is to get minorities a chance to enter their names into the sport," said Sergio Peña.
Peña completed the program, and his success helped him land a big sponsor, Hattori Racing Enterprises.
Peña is fully aware of this and attacks the track every time he gets behind the wheel.
"I'm just another kid trying to make it in racing, just following my dream," Peña said.
"It's getting there, step by step," Peña said.
