A school district outside Columbus, Ohio, is on track to receive more than $1 million in federal grant money for its Chinese arts and language program.
"And China will be a major player there."
The funds will be used, school officials say, to support their visiting teacher from China and to foster the newly formed relationship with their sister school in the southern Chinese province of Kunming.
She and her family moved to the district specifically for the language program.
"We feel very lucky that we have this," Aldis said.
"It's really been challenging," she said.
I think China has a beautiful culture."
"Not really often because I think most Americans are really polite," Chiwei said.
Kramar said he was concerned about impressionable elementary students learning about communism through material provided by the Chinese government.
School administrator Hank Langhals stressed that a relationship, however small, between China and the United States will be mutually beneficial in the long run.
Parent Mandy Aldis said she isn't bothered one bit by the program being funded by China's government.
I think the more you're exposed to another culture, the more you understand each other, you're just a more well-rounded person.
