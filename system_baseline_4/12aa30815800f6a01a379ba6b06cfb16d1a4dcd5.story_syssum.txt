Seoul (CNN) -- Everyone's made a joke they thought was funny only to see it fall flat, but Park Jung-geun's attempt at humor could see him jailed for up to seven years in South Korea.
But Park was imprisoned in January of this year, accused of "acts that benefit the enemy" and spreading North Korean propaganda.
"To be honest, if you did this in North Korea, you would be severely punished," Park said.
Used widely during the years of military dictatorship in the 1970s and '80s, the law was designed to protect the state against North Korean propaganda and to prosecute spies.
It should be reformed in line with human rights law and if the government cannot do this, it must be abolished," he said.
Some within the South Korean media are also criticizing the Lee administration for interfering in press freedom.
"President Lee Myung-bak has appointed pro-government people as presidents of the media companies, what we call 'parachutes,'' said Kim Jong-wook, head of the YTN labor union which is still on strike.
The government denies interference but picketing journalists say they are worried they are seeing increased censorship reminiscent of the dark days of dictatorship.
