"All these movements they do with their hands," Valle said.
The Badjao are a tribe of nomadic sea dwellers who have lived off the shore of northeast Borneo for more than 200 years.
Valle said that in recent years, increasing amounts of Badjao are transitioning to a life on land.
"They don't speak Malay or even know how old they are," Valle said.
Valle wanted his photographs to reflect the essence of their statelessness, to create a sort of "imaginary stateless nation."
"I wanted to show who they are," he said.
This project was the first time Valle photographed underwater.
"The sea must be calm and the water must be clean," he said.
"They're posing in all of the pictures," Valle said.
The soft light and the way the Badjao pose in the water reflect the "imaginary stateless nation" Valle wanted to convey, causing the viewer to examine the relationship between place and identity.
