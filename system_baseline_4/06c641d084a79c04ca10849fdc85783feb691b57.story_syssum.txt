Their AdTrap device intercepts online advertisements before they reach any devices that access your Internet connection, allowing you to surf the Web -- even stream videos -- without those annoying ads.
So, Russell and Butkus set out to recreate the past and they came up with AdTrap.
AdTrap, a white rectangular box that resembles a wireless router and costs $139, intercepts the ads before they reach the laptop, tablet or mobile phone.
"I think it speaks to the mindset of people right now of their experience on the Internet," Russell said.
There are a couple of sites like Hulu, for instance where AdTrap doesn't work, but Russell said they're working on some solutions.
"At some point, it's gotten a bit much," Russell said, referring to online ads.
"We're not trying to be against all advertisers," said Julie Russell, Chad Russell's mother, who handles finances for AdTrap.
