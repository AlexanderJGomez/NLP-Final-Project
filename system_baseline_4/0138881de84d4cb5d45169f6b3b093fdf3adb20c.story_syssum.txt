Matt Sandusky told the grand jury nothing inappropriate had ever happened to him.
The revelation kept Jerry Sandusky from taking the stand in his own defense.
In the police interview, Matt Sandusky said that he was molested between the ages of 8 and 15, that he tried to escape from the Sandusky home and once attempted suicide.
Matt Sandusky, a foster child formally adopted at 18, also described Jerry Sandusky rubbing, hugging and showering with him.
It was only days before the commonwealth rested, and after some alleged victims had testified, according to Matt Sandusky's lawyers, that he told them he was abused and wanted to cooperate with prosecutors.
By not putting Jerry Sandusky on the stand, the defense ensured that Matt Sandusky would not testify.
The audiotape's leak was the main subject of a meeting hastily called Tuesday by trial Judge John Cleland and attended by prosecutors, defense attorneys and even the judge who has overseen the grand jury that's investigated the Sandusky case, a source with knowledge of the meeting told CNN National Correspondent Susan Candiotti.
Cleland ordered that any discovery turned over to the defense in the Sandusky case be sealed unless it was put into evidence at trial.
"I'm innocent," said Jerry Sandusky, in answer to questions CNN's Candiotti asked of him through his lawyer.
But Jerry Sandusky doesn't regret his decision, according to his lawyer.
Others don't talk to him at all," according to Rominger.
