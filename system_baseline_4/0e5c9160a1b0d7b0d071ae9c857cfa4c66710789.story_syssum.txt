A Black Man's View of America."
Roland Martin says there's an assumption the word "qualified" needs to be used for women, minorities.
Hell no!
If you think about it, there never seems to be an assumption when white men are being discussed that they are unqualified.
Why do we as a society feel the need to say it's important to have "qualified" women or minorities?
Part of the issue is that a lot of folks have bought into the notion that any minority has gotten a job based on their skin color or a woman is hired because of her gender, so therefore, we better emphasize the need for a "qualified" person.
She would go on and on about being a white liberal but would often talk about how hard it was to find "qualified" minorities for jobs.
Then I would look at some of the most incompetent white men and women who worked for her and ask myself, "I wonder if they passed the qualified test?"
And yes, I've seen a host of qualified white men, white women, African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians and Native Americans hired for jobs, and they've done a fantastic job.
It's simply time that when it comes to women or minorities, we should retire the use of word "qualified."
