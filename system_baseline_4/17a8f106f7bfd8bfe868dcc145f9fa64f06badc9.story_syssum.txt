The Lexington County Sheriff's Department arrested Paul Thomas Rawl Jr. on Tuesday.
Major John Allard of the sheriff's department told CNN that the victim was never reported missing to his agency.
"Rawl physically assaulted (her) in such a manner that (she) feared imminent bodily injury or death," Metts said in a statement.
The sheriff's department said Wednesday night that it had no record of Rawl being represented by an attorney yet.
Rawl was convicted in 2000 of criminal sexual conduct.
