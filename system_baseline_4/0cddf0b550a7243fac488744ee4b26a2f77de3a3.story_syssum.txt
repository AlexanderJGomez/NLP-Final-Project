"If I'm concerned about anything, I'm concerned about defense capabilities that he may have stolen from where he worked, and does that knowledge then get into the hands of our adversaries â€” in this case, of course, Russia," Flynn said of the former National Security Agency contractor who fled to Moscow to seek asylum.
Flynn said he worried about what else Snowden knows, and how Russia -- where Snowden lives now -- may have access to the documents.
In January, he and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told the Senate Intelligence Committee that the Snowden leaks already caused serious damage to U.S. security.
Terrorists and other adversaries of America were "going to school on U.S. intelligence sources' methods and trade craft, and the insights that they are gaining are making our job much, much harder," Clapper told the committee.
