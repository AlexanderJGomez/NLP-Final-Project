At the end of the season, Oppenheimer had 40 pounds of excess fresh produce -- and nowhere to take it.
So Oppenheimer took the produce to a local food pantry at a battered-women's shelter.

A Google search showed the nearest food pantry was in another town, 25 miles away -- when in fact there were six food pantries in Oppenheimer's town of West Milford.
He reached out to food pantries across the country through social networking, food banks, master gardeners, faith organizations and other groups to encourage them to sign up for inclusion in his database of food pantries.
The free online resource enables food pantries to register and be listed in a central nationwide directory, and makes it possible for American gardeners to easily find the local pantries where they can donate extra produce.
"The country is loaded with gardeners who have more food than they can possibly themselves use," Oppenheimer said.
"That's the food that ... we can get into the system to help diminish hunger in the country."
Timothy Lesko recently received fresh produce from a food pantry that had items from AmpleHarvest.org donations.
Although Oppenheimer cannot track the amount of produce that has been donated to food pantries, he said he's received messages from numerous pantries and clients across the country who've been given food as a result of AmpleHarvest.org.
