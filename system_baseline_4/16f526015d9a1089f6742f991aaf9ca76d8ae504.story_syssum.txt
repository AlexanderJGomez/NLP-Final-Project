The series of bailouts and austerity measures implemented during the last two years has led to a fundamental political crisis affecting both the function of government and the standing of key politicians and political parties.
Yet, it would be a mistake to attribute Sunday's destruction to the austerity measures -- similar events took place in December 2008, well before any talk of a debt crisis had reached Greece.
It looks as if public opinion in Greece can tolerate the continuous and widespread destruction of central Athens, but would not accept any police or state action that would contain those few extremist groups that cause mayhem.
However, what many don't see is that Greece has now reached the other extreme, in which the lack of law and order hurts those who need it the most.
Yet, for the first time in recent memory, the political battle lines in Greece are not drawn between left and right, but between the modernizers and the populists existing in most political parties across the spectrum.
The former camp has so far failed to prove that austerity works.
The juxtaposition could not have been more telling.
One thing is certain -- the political system in Greece is changing and the repercussions may well be felt across Europe and the world.
