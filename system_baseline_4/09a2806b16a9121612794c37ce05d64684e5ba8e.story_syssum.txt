I said it was economic, but political in the sense that you have a political party -- the GOP -- entrenched with the wealthy and Wall Street while doing nothing to protect middle-class America.
It is personal.
The average salary for the rank-and-file American worker, however, is about the same as it was in 1980.
When there is this kind of disparity while these same CEOs are paying taxes at a rate lower than their secretaries, their receptionists, and the people who clean their offices, it is personal.
While President Obama has not done things perfectly, he has injected some fairness and balance into the economy to spur growth and job creation.
This week, we see banks tacking on extra fees -- which, contrary to what they argue, would lead them to 13% more in profits than they were making before the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act went into effect.
It is personal.
Are Republicans really advocating that the greed of Wall Street be put before the needs of the American people?
While some of those donations went to Democrats, the vast majority went to Republicans.
They do.
One way of getting there is the Buffett Rule -- Obama's proposal, named after billionaire Warren Buffett, that those making more than $1 million pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than the rest of us.
Critics scream "class warfare," and decry the attacks on the "job creators," and cry "socialism" as they continue to preserve this unjust system that is giving rise to what could be a powerful and sustained movement.
Who are they?
So asking the top 1% of wealthy Americans to pay their fair share and pay at least as high a tax rate as their workers is not class warfare or an attack on "job creators" or socialism.
With all this taken together, is it any wonder that our masses could be giving rise to our own "spring"?
Not economic, not political, but personal.
