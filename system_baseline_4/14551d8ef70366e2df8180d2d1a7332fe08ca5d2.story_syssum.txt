The latest outbreak of violence after ISIS swept through Mosul and beyond has Jordan's inner circle and the business community drawing up worst scenarios, with Syria and Iraq representing bookends of trouble.
Jordan is now home to more than 1.3 million Syrian refugees, half absorbed during the last 24 months.
"The extraordinary burden of the Syrian crisis, as well as any potential regional crisis including the Iraqi situation, should also be met by the international community," Toukan told me.
But Iraq is now very much part of the equation.
A sizeable $1.8 billion oil export pipeline from Basra in southern Iraq to the Red Sea Jordanian port of Aqaba may be delayed, sources suggest, due to the violence.
"We feel we are not getting enough to continue to play our moderating role in the region and meeting the needs of all those refugees is not only a humanitarian issues, it also neutralizes any extremist tendencies," said Toukan.
