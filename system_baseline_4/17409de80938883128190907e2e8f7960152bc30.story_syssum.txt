Monte Dinero, Argentina (CNN) -- When we landed in Rio Gallegos, Argentina it didn't take me long to spot Richard Fenton.
They are eco-pioneers in more ways than one.
Five generations later, the Fentons are still tending sheep here, producing high-quality wool and meat that is in demand around the globe.
So Richard began to devise a method to change his sheep herding practices, and after research in Argentina, Australia and England, he introduced a new system that constantly rotates the sheep to different pastures, thus allowing the grass to regenerate.
But slowly his efforts have paid off, and now 120 farms in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay are a part of the Ovis XXI -- a network which fosters innovation in sheep breeding and land management across South America.
"We use biological indicators to assess the health of ecosystem processes," says Pablo Borrelli, an Ovis XXI director.
As Richard and I walk through thick grass in a steady rain on Monte Dinero, the evidence is clear.
The Nature Conservancy is providing technology like satellite mapping and its scientists are working with the farmers to continue the effort to regenerate the grasslands.
They were amongst the first in Argentina to open their estancia to curious travelers from around the globe to hear how an English-speaking Irish family has thrived in a remote part of Spanish-speaking Argentina.
That's not to say that living at the end of the earth is easy, for the sheep or their herders.
And we love it," says Richard's father, David.
"Natural grasslands today in the world could capture as much or more carbon than forests and could be a very big help to the environment," says Richard.
