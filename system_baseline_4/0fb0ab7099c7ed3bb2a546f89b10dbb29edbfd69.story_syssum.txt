(CNN) -- As captain of the Neptune tugboat, Viktor Nikolsky spends his days gently directing giant cargo vessels in and around the vast port of St. Petersburg, Russia.
Nikolsky hesitates when recalling the moment he realized armed bandits were fast approaching his ship off the coast of Somalia.
"When they saw what kind of cargo they were surprised," Nikolsky said.
Bargaining chips in the middle of all this were Nikolsky and his crew.
This meant Nikolsky was in command when the pirates attacked.
As the days and weeks passed, Nikolsky began to talk to the leader of the pirates, eventually gaining his trust.
Nikolsky said his heart sank at this moment.
They left, and the ship and crew free to go.
The Faina sailed into the port of Mombasa, Kenya, a few days later where Nikolsky was reunited with his wife and family.
On their return to Russia, the family resolved that Viktor should seek a job that would be less unpredictable than life at sea.
"But I spent at sea all of my life, 45 years ... (and) now I like my village, I like my job here."
