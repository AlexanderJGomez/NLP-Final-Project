"I was told that no matter how difficult I found the load to bear, I needed to follow the law or suffer eternal consequences," said Wanda Barzee about her husband, Brian Mitchell.
Mitchell used the revelations to explain his heavy drinking, his engaging in oral sex with Smart and his demand that she "demonstrate sexual activity" in front of Smart, said Mitchell.
"I was told that I needed to listen to the plan of my husband," she said.
Mitchell told her prior to the Smart abduction "that I needed to take seven wives into my heart and home," Barzee said, adding that the news upset her greatly.
Mitchell ultimately ended the marriage with Kelly for reasons that Barzee said were unclear.
On June 4, 2002, the night of the abduction, she and Mitchell fought, Barzee said.
Barzee wept when recounting having been forced by Mitchell to cook her 10-year-old daughter's pet rabbit and serve it to her.
Barzee is being held at a federal medical center in Fort Worth, Texas, where she has been receiving mental health treatment, including medication.
