(CNN) -- Chelsea reclaimed the lead in the English Premier League as Didier Drogba continued his hot scoring run against title hopefuls Arsenal with both goals in a 2-0 victory on Sunday.
"Chelsea defended well until the last minute, so you have got to give them credit.
And it was Terry who helped Drogba score the eighth-minute opening goal, heading a corner to the far post where his unmarked teammate coolly slotted the ball into the net past exposed goalkeeper Manuel Almunia.
Arsenal poured forward in the second half but were unable to penetrate as Chelsea could afford to sit back and absorb the pressure.
But the 36-year-old Phillips scored twice in the last 10 minutes in a rare first-team outing this season to leave promoted Wolves in the bottom three.
