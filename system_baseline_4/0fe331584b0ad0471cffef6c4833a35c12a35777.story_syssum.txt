"I was trying to do everything to prevent that," said Cannon.
After hosting the Super Bowl preshow, Cannon started feeling pain again, this time above the kidneys.
"She is such a pro," said Cannon.
"That's what it's all about," said Cannon.
Morgan, who covered Whitney Houston's funeral for CNN, told Cannon that he was touched by the tweet Cannon sent out upon hearing the news of Houston's death.
"I know what she was dealing with and how people just started to come and let her know how special she was and how to keep her head up," recalled Cannon.
