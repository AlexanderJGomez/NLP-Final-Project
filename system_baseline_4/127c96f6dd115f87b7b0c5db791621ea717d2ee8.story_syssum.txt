It took only two days for hackers to crack into the Apple and Blackberry operating systems during the three-day Pwn2Own tournament last week, while Android and Windows Phone 7 models were abandoned and left unhacked by the end of the contest.
"The survival of a target at Pwn2Own does not automatically declare it safer than a target that went down," last year's Internet Explorer Pwn2Own winner Peter Vreugdenhil cautions.
In the mobile phone category, the Dell Venue Pro (Windows Phone 7), Apple iPhone 4 (iOS), BlackBerry Torch 9800 (Blackberry 6) and Nexus S (Android) were targeted.
Firefox and Chrome web browsers were also left undefeated because contestants withdrew from Pwn2Own.
Safari, Chrome, iPhone, Android and Blackberry all use WebKit in their browsers, which means that they are all susceptible to exploitation through the browser -- and that's exactly how the iPhone and Blackberry were attacked.
Android's survival was a bit of a surprise, since it is also a big target and had four contestants lined up.
