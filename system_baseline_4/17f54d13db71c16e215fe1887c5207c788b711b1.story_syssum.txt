(CNN) -- A roller coaster at Six Flags Fiesta Texas in San Antonio has been temporarily closed as a precautionary measure after a woman died last week on a similar ride at Six Flags over Texas in Arlington.
At its highest point, the Texas Giant is 153 feet and has a drop of 147 feet, according to the theme park.
It was redesigned with a steel track and reopened in April 2011 to mark the theme park's 50th anniversary.
Segovia also told CNN that Esparza was sitting by herself, contrary to initial reports she was sitting beside her son.
Six Flags Over Texas spokeswoman Sharon Parker said the park is committed to determining what happened.
