In a matter of minutes after its release, the video went viral.
Threats to rape and kill her were posted across the Internet as part of an assault that seemed intent on humiliating and silencing not only Roberts, but any woman who dares to speak up against inequality and expose the truth about how women are treated in our society.
But almost before this speech could be digested, a website featuring a timer was created to count down the hours and minutes until naked images of Watson would supposedly be released.
These threats are not just happening to high profile women, but to women and girls everywhere.
It's happening to celebrity women advocating for gender equality.
It is a hate crime against women.
You don't have to look too far to see how women are dehumanized in popular culture.
This is, of course, is just one aspect of the war on women, but it is one of the most insidious and damaging.
It is time for the silencing of women stop.
