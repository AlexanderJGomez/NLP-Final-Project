Brown allegedly sped away from the accident scene in May after a confrontation with the driver of another car, having refusing to provide his name, driver's license and insurance information.
A Brown representative said last week that the singer expected all of the charges to be dropped and probation reinstated this week.
Brown was ordered to return to court on August 16 for a hearing to set a trial date to determine if the probation revocation will stand.
The trigger for Brown's alleged rage was that Gure took a photo of him and his girlfriend, Karrueche Tran, to document the scene -- since he allegedly refused to show her his driver's license, she said.
When Brown tried to grab the camera, Tran screamed, "Don't touch her, don't touch her," Gure said.
"My lawyers will be contacting you.
Just a dirty car.
I don't have all the answers and you can't show me a person that age who has it figured out.
We live and grow.
Brown wasn't in town on some of the dates reported, the motion said.
The Los Angeles County district attorney's office has "tortured" Brown during his probation more than any client he's ever had, Geragos said.
