(CNN)Incumbent Goodluck Jonathan phoned former military leader Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday to concede defeat in Nigeria's presidential elections, Buhari's party says.
His 20-month rule was known for what he described as a "war on indiscipline," a tough regime that some say was marred by human rights abuses.
Violent protests after elections Saturday sparked calls for calm from the two main candidates and a warning by the United States and Britain against political interference.
"I want to urge all Nigerians to also wait patiently for the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to collate and announce results," Jonathan said on his Facebook account.
In his statement Tuesday, Jonathan said; "I promised the country free and fair elections.
More than 800 people were killed in post-election violence across Nigeria's north in 2011 after charges that those elections were illegitimate.
Jonathan has been criticized for not doing enough to combat Boko Haram, which is waging a campaign of terror aimed at instituting a stricter version of Sharia law in Nigeria.
