Damascus, Syria (CNN) -- At a funeral for a Syrian man allegedly killed by government forces, a grief-stricken sister wails uncontrollably.
...
(President) Bashar al-Assad is responsible.
Why?
But many of the protesters here pushed forward to show injuries they say were inflicted by government forces.
A banner emblazoned with al-Assad's image stretches across the street, and demonstrators wave Syrian flags and pictures of the president.
"This opposition is not legal or real," one woman said.
If al-Assad is forced to go, "it will be chaos," the husband said.
"He is a peaceful president," his wife chimed in.
For now, al-Assad remains in control -- for the most part.
