But the most glaring problem facing any aspiring filmmaker would have to be Richard Parker, the full-grown 450-pound Bengal tiger who shares the lifeboat with Pi.
The slightly artificial quality that comes with this technology -- even wearing the spectacles puts a barrier between the movie and reality -- complements Pi's magical realist yarn, and Claudio Miranda's luminous, glossy, color-saturated cinematography gives the movie a picture book look.
But it's more than that.
So how does Pi find himself in this unusual predicament?
The movie's Pi (Suraj Sharma) is considerably more circumspect than the novel's, and understandably so -- Richard Parker is more ferocious in the flesh than he was on the page.
It's at this point that the movie conjures its most surreal and outlandish episode, an alluring strange interlude on a floating island that doesn't quite catch the horror in the novel's description.
Ang Lee has made a bold and wondrous movie, one of his best.
