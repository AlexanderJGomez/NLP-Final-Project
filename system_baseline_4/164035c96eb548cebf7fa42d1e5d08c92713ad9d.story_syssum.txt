Do you: A) Change the name of your business?
Businesses across the United States are facing this very dilemma because the word "ISIS" is part of their corporate name or product.
The most common reaction from business owners is option "A," dropping the ISIS reference.
Reed, who plans to come up with a story line to justify the name change for next season, commented that ISIS is "the most awful thing and we didn't want to have anything to do with it."
Last week the owners of "CafÃ© ISIS" in the United Kingdom felt compelled to change their restaurant's name.
Who actually looks at the name of a business with the word ISIS in it and thinks: "Wow, that terrorist group from the Middle East now opened up a cafe in the neighborhood!"
But we need to let fear give way to intellect and not punish American business owners.
Perhaps an easy answer is for the media to universally start using the name ISIL instead of ISIS.
But what I really hope happens is that more businesses follow the lead of the California company, ISIS Pharmaceuticals, which is keeping its name.
So my advice is, if your company or product is called ISIS, keep the name.
