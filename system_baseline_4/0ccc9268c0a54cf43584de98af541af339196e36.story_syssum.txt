(CNN) -- Before making judgments about the shootings at Fort Hood, a thorough investigation needs to take place, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said Thursday.
"We do not yet have these details," the statement said.
Laura and I are keeping the victims and their families in our thoughts and prayers during this difficult time," he said.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations, based in Washington, said there was no reason for such violence.
"MPAC and the Muslim American community unequivocally condemn this heinous incident," said a statement from the Los Angeles, California, based group.
"American Muslims stand with our fellow citizens in offering both prayers for the victims and sincere condolences to the families of those killed or injured," the statement said.
For now, our focus is squarely on taking care of our soldiers and their families," said John M. McHugh in a statement.
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas said her heart went out to the people affected by the violence.
