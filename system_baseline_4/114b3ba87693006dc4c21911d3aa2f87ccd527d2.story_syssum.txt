Miami (CNN) -- For a war vet from South Florida, a leisurely road trip to a seaside vacation came to an abrupt end in Mexico, where he has languished behind bars for four months, sometimes chained to a bed.
Hammar, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan as a Marine, was headed to Costa Rica in August to go surfing with a fellow veteran.
He intended to hunt with it, his parents said.
A branch of the Mexican military has said the gun is not on its "forbidden list," she said.
"He said: I have your son," Olivia Hammar recalled, tearing up.
U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, a Democrat from Florida, stepped in on Hammar's behalf, speaking to Mexico's ambassador to the United States.
The calls have since stopped, his mother said.
"This is outrageous," Ros-Lehtinen said.
"Jonny, we're going to get you out of there," Olivia Hammar said to her son by phone Friday.
Hammar's parents now fear they could lose him just across the border, if they wait too much longer.
