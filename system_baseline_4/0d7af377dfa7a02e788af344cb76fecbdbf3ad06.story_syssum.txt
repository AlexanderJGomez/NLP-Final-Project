The mother of Brooke Stegall, 5, says opera gave her visually impaired child new confidence.
All of the actors in the Pumpkin Pickle Pop Cookies Opera are visually impaired 4- and 5-year-olds.
"These parents work so hard to make this happen," said Anne McComiskey, director of the program.
She is very aware of the efforts that both the children and the parents put into the program.
It helps parents understand what is possible for their visually impaired or blind children.
All of the children go to the center one day a week.
McComiskey says the performance reinforces lessons learned during the course of the program.
It's just many of the concepts that we have been teaching them for five years, coming to play in the opera."
She came up with the idea for the opera while talking with some of the teachers.
McComiskey says that that is one of the goals of the program: to instill a sense of "I can" in the kids.
"That is most unusual, for a child that is blind or visually impaired to go right into a typical kindergarten," McComiskey said.

Tatyana enthusiastically agrees after the performance.
