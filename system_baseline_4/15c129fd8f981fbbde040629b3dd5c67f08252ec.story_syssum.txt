(CNN) -- Sitting inside the quaint tasting room of Chateau O'Brien, an award-winning French-style winery in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Northern Virginia, co-owner Debbie O'Brien pours some of the best red wine in the region.
Virginia ranks fifth in the nation for number of wineries and for wine grape production.
Take Delaplane Cellars, a family winery owned by Jim and Betsy Dolphin that boasts panoramic views of the Northern Virginia mountains in a spacious, contemporary setting.
Wines at Delaplane Cellars include crisp whites like Chardonnay and Viognier and complex red wines that include Melange Rouge, William's Gap Reserve, and Cabernet Franc.
On a recent visit to Delaplane Cellars, the large tasting room was crowded and every table overlooking the mountains was filled.
For red wines only, visit Boxwood Wineries in Middleburg, Virginia, a picturesque property owned by John Kent Cooke, the former owner of the NFL's Washington Redskins.
Howard, a passionate wine expert from New York, and Debbie, a charming businesswoman from Alabama, both enjoy conversing with customers and keeping them smiling.
Since the Tannat flourishes in humid climates, Virginia is the perfect region to harvest the grape.
You won't regret it.
The inn offers 10 charming rooms on three acres -- six rooms in the main house and four in the school house.
It's a bit pricey, but for special occasions like birthdays, anniversaries or Valentine's Day, you won't be disappointed.
There are 18 rooms in six separate cottages.
The restaurant serves great food for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
