New York (CNN) -- For Angel Rojas, the daily bus ride through the streets of Brooklyn provided a respite from a hardscrabble existence juggling two low-paying jobs.
A young man boarded the bus, police said.
"Pretty big gun for a pretty small man," Police Commissioner William Bratton said of the suspected gunman.
"Just as everyone in New York probably feels terrible about it, we feel terrible about it too," Anderson's lawyer, Frederic Pratt, told reporters, according to CNN affiliate WCBS.
"The stupidity of those gangs that basically, over nothing, are trying to kill each other and, unfortunately, in the process, kill innocents as they did with this hard working young man trying to raise his family," Bratton said.
"He was the sole provider," Guerrero said.
Guerrero said, "He was just sitting on a bus.
"He was a hard worker and a family man devoted to giving his family a better life," Guerrero said.
His laughter and his presence stayed with you."
