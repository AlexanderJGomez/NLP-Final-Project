NEW YORK (CNN) -- The Justice Department and federal prosecutors will investigate allegations of discrimination against Latinos by police in Suffolk County, New York, officials said.
"We became involved because we thought that the charges filed originally by the police department did not meet with the facts of the case," said Cesar Perales, president and general counsel of New York-based LatinoJustice PRLDEF: specifically, that the youths were not charged with murder.
Lucero's stabbing also prompted the Southern Poverty Law Center to undertake an investigation in Suffolk County.
Their houses and apartments are egged, spray-painted with racial epithets and riddled with bullets in drive-by shootings."
Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer said law center researchers did not speak with him during the course of their investigation.
In January, hate-crime charges were extended against the seven teens charged in Lucero's death to include other assaults on Latino men.
Justice Department spokesman Alejandro Miyas said the department hopes police will cooperate with the inquiry and work with investigators.
"We have very good relationship with our minority community," Dormer said.
