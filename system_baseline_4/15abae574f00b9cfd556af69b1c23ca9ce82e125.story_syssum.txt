(CNN) -- David Wallechinsky didn't invent what's on the Internet.
"The Book of Lists" immediately took its place on another list -- the bestseller list -- and spawned three sequels.
"I was thrilled when the Internet came around," he says.
These days, Wallechinsky, 66, devotes his time to AllGov.com, an attempt to create a different kind of information repository: a site all about the business of government, including details about dozens of government agencies and names of hundreds of government officials.
CNN spoke to Wallechinsky about lists, government and finding himself referenced on Wikipedia.
I was thrilled when the Internet came around.
Wallechinsky: I think we live in an era of over-stimulation -- too much information -- so lists are a way of grasping that information.
I think the best lists are the ones you can't just look up -- you have to really think about and research.
Wallechinsky: No, not really.
My father and I had compiled a book, "The People's Almanac," and one of the chapters was lists, just list-lists.
Wallechinsky: Oh, sure.
One thing I don't like is where there's a list or a gallery and you have to click for No.
I just want to see the list on one page.
Something like 95% of what the government did doesn't get covered.
So I made this list of more than 300 agencies in the U.S. government, their budget, how many people they employ and that's how I got the idea for AllGov.
Wallechinsky: Yes, certainly that's the case.
It used to be that everybody watched the same news channels and that was it.
The Internet is just an extension of that.
Wallechinsky: I haven't looked in the last year or two, but at one point on Wikipedia it actually mentioned that either "The People's Almanac" or "The Book of Lists" was the progenitor of the Internet.
