By sheer numbers, the Google Books project has been a huge success.
Google did not seek approval to scan many books that were still under copyright, nor did it offer to compensate authors or publishers in any way, claiming the scans were fair use.
"As we have long said, Google Books is in compliance with copyright law and acts like a card catalog for the digital age, giving users the ability to find books to buy or borrow," said a Google spokesperson.
He said the Google Books program provided benefits to the public.
The books scanned are also primarily nonfiction titles, which have less copyright protection than fiction.
By converting print to digital text, the program has also made it easier to convert titles into more accessible formats, like text-to-speech and Braille.
