(CNN) -- What do NSA leaker Edward Snowden and a red panda at the National Zoo in Washington have in common?
But a little while was all Twitter needed to engage in a flurry of jokes, including the creation of several parody accounts for Rusty, the red panda.
And both have connections to China: Red pandas are native to southwestern China while Snowden recently traveled to Hong Kong, off southeastern China.
The zoo had tweeted several facts about Rusty, warning zoo visitors that he is still a wild animal and would bite if cornered or scared.
Although WikiLeaks claims to know his exact location, no one else seems sure.
"Now Putin has a Super Bowl ring, Ed Snowden AND a red panda," tweeted @MicahGrimes.
"Is there bamboo in Ecuador?"
Some tweets appeared to confuse red pandas with the black-and-white giant pandas, also called panda bears.
This isn't the first escaped zoo animal to inspire an attention-getting parody account.
The @NationalZoo account thanked its fans on Twitter and Facebook for helping recover Rusty.
