Tripoli (CNN) -- Libya's interim parliament Sunday approved a new government, led by Prime Minister Ahmed Mitig, in a controversial vote that threatens to deepen the country's political and security crisis.
Shortly before the vote in parliament, the EU's special envoy to Libya described the situation as the country's worst crisis since 2011.
They want to drive the country into an armed conflict for power after all peaceful and political means have been exhausted ...
Haftar also launched what he called an open-ended war on Islamist extremist groups and vowed to "purge" Libya of them.
On Friday, Libyans rallied in Tripoli, Benghazi and other Libyan cities in support of the campaign led by Haftar.
He returned in 2011 to participate in the revolution that overthrew Gadhafi.
