HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- In the decade since the 1997 handover of Hong Kong to China, local movie-makers have faced daunting changes in the industry.
"The Hong Kong film industry came to a rude awakening [in the late 1990s] that the world was changing faster than it was in the age of new delivery systems for home entertainment and the Internet," says Bede Cheng, a local film archivist and curator.
By 1997, that number dropped to 85 films grossing $69 million, according to the Hong Kong, Kowloon and New Territories Motion Picture Industry Association (MPIA).
"1997, unfortunately, coincides with the beginning of the collapse of the local film industry -- a well-documented fact," says screenwriter Jimmy Ngai.
The new Chinese market has translated into an emphasis in contrasts of Hong Kong-made films, says film archivist Cheng.
In 2006, Hong Kong closed five small cinemas and re-opened one multiplex.
Tim Youngs, Hong Kong consultant for Italy's Far East Film Festival, says changing tastes among Hong Kong movie-goers has also affected the industry.
How is South Korea's film industry different from its Hong Kong counterpart?
Films that best retain a Hong Kong style, Kerr maintains, likely carry "Category III" (under 18 not allowed) ratings: Movies that are "grown up and smart," she says.
"Around 1997, like lots of Hong Kong people, I kind of lost myself," says independent film-maker Chan Wing-chiu.
"I speak English better than Putonghua [China's official common language, also known as Mandarin].
Many Chinese say that now that Hong Kong is part of China, Hong Kong people must learn Putonghua.
Because our language, our culture, our values, our way of thinking are different.
Gweilos [Hong Kong slang for Caucasians] say: 'You are Chinese.'
After 1997, we lost the confidence to be Hong Kong people."
