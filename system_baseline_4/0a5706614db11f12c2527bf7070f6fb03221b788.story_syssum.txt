In a daring operation worthy of a movie, three men escaped from a Canadian jail by helicopter, prompting a massive manhunt, authorities said.
A manhunt is under way for Yves Denis Yvon Lamontagne, 35,  Denis Lefebvre, 53, and Serge Pomerleau, 49.
In March 2013, two men posing as tourists commandeered a helicopter from a Canadian tour company, ordered the pilot to fly over a detention center near Montreal, hoisted two inmates into the hovering aircraft using cables -- and zipped away.
While spectacular, airborne escapes are not unprecedented.
In 1971, Joel David Kaplan escaped from a Mexican jail aboard a helicopter.
The New Yorker's flight inspired the book "The 10-Second Jailbreak: The Helicopter Escape of Joel David Kaplan" and the 1975 movie "Breakout."
