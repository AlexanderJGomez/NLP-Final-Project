Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban told CNN the grenades were launched from the area where the anti-government protesters, known as the Red Shirts, have been encamped for weeks, but the protesters denied any responsibility for the attacks.
At least 87 people were wounded, the center said.
Thursday's explosions took place near an elevated train station where the Red Shirts are gathered, said Col. Sansern Kaewkumnerd, spokesman for the Center for Resolutions under Emergency Situation.
Meanwhile, pro-government demonstrators in multicolored shirts have also mobilized to support Abhisit during the crisis.
The Red Shirts are occupying a large area nearby.
