The two University of Oklahoma students at the center of a racist fraternity video have more than sports in common.
In high school, he was an avid sportsman, and he played cornerback on the football team, in addition to baseball, The Dallas Morning News reported.
Earlier this year, a sibling of the younger Rice described their close relationship in an interview with their high school newspaper.
His family has fled their home, where protesters gathered Wednesday.
Matthew Lopez,  a friend and fellow student at the university, said the video is not a reflection of who he is.
"His behavior is a result of his influence of the fraternity system and the traditions that have been embedded since pre-civil war times, when the fraternity was made, which obviously weren't the most tolerant times," Lopez said.
In a statement, his parents said their son made a horrible mistake and apologized to African-Americans, students and university faculty.
A spokesman for the Pettit family declined CNN's request for an interview.
