Denver hospitals are reporting a baby boom, which is arriving about nine months after two blizzards walloped Colorado's capital city.
Marjorie Silva told the Rocky Mountain News that she has a new baby because she didn't want her husband to play in the snow during the blizzard.
One baby couldn't wait to get to the second-floor delivery room.
Edie Coddington is wearing one of those shirts, even though her parents, Odele and Ian, were out of town when the storms hit.
Their joy is shared by co-workers who are having an "enormous rash" of blizzard babies, Ian Coddington said, adding that company picnics will be very entertaining in about five years, when the babies are older and running around.
One doctor at the hospital told CNN affiliate KMGH that he expects the baby boom to last for couple of more months.
"We've also been selling a lot of diaper bags and blankets.
I'm completely wiped out of blankets.
