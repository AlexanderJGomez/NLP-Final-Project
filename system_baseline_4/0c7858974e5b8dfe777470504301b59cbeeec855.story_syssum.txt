(CNN) -- "Out of an abundance of caution," American Airlines said Tuesday it would inspect 47 Boeing 757 airplanes after seats on two of the company's jetliners came loose.
So far, American Airlines has inspected 36 planes and found that six -- including the two involved in the recent diversions -- had seats that were not properly secured.
Not all of the seats were loose, the company said, but they had the potential to become so.
Earlier Tuesday, an American Airlines flight from Chicago to London made an unscheduled landing at Shannon Airport in Ireland after a passenger reported a smoky odor, an airline spokesman said.
Since then, the pilots have been engaging in what the airline calls a slowdown that has caused the number of flights that are delayed and canceled to skyrocket.
Late Tuesday, a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association said it would resume contract negotiations with the airline.
Seat installation work is largely carried out by outside contractors, rather than maintenance personnel employed by the airline, he said in a statement.
