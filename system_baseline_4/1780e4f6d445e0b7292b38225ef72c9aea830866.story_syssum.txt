We at Greenpeace, along with the activist group Yes Men, are behind the Shell Oil website ArcticReady.com, which we created to call attention to the company's Arctic destruction.
But we revealed our role just hours after the site went up, and the site is so over-the-top -- it has a kids' game called "Angry Bergs" -- that people realize very quickly that it is fake.
In the Arctic, the oil giant is exploiting melting sea ice to drill for more of the oil causing global warming in the first place.
The same drill ship can't meet the Clean Air Act standards the company agreed to earlier this year, and so Shell is asking the EPA to bend the rules at the 11th hour.
Shell has been relentlessly conducting its own PR campaign to distort the truth about what the company is doing in the Arctic.
We asked ourselves: What if Shell really did ask people what they thought?
And when people realize it's a parody, they like it even more.
People clearly want an opportunity to tell Shell what they think of the company's Arctic drilling program, and our site has provided them with a voice.
But Shell and its sympathizers would like people to talk about Greenpeace and the Yes Men rather than what the company is doing in the Arctic.
We're Greenpeace and the Yes Men, and we're ready to sit down with Shell any time to debate the ethics of Arctic drilling.
Let's go.
