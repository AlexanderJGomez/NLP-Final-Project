The Lower Ninth Ward Health Clinic was clinic director Patricia Berryhill's home before Hurricane Katrina.
Sometimes the questions are routine -- this time more anxious.
The clinic asks for a $25 "co-payment" but no one is turned away if they cannot afford it.
"So they come by, browse, and take whatever books they want free of charge."
Yes, there is a fair amount of new home construction, and renovations under way at some homes gutted by Katrina.
Overall, Tulane University geographer Richard Campanella says, the population of New Orleans stands at about 330,000 -- roughly 75 percent of its pre-Katrina level.
Campanella says median household income is up to $40,000 from $27,000 before Katrina, "and it is not because the city is doing better economically."
Craft-Kerney says a commitment to add a second school in the Lower Ninth, or enticements to bring in a supermarket or a major pharmacy, would help bring more people back, or attract new residents.
City officials say there are myriad reasons the rebuilding is slow.
But Craft-Kerney says the clinic would not be in operation had it not been for the help of Mike Leavitt, the Bush secretary of health and human services.
After Katrina, she decided to move elsewhere in the city, but agreed to donate her former home as a clinic.
Craft-Kerney will soon face the new administration.
I don't expect it overnight -- but he did say he would make good on President Bush's promise to make New Orleans whole again."
