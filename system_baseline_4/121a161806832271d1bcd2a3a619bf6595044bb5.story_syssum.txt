CNN Heroes salutes the following people who responded to Saturday's shooting at a political event outside a supermarket in Tucson, Arizona -- a shooting that killed six people and wounded 14 others, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords -- with acts of courage.
When the shooting stopped, Badger stood up and found the shooter was right in front of him, he said.
When the suspect was on the ground, another person took a gun away from him, Badger said.
Various people kept the gunman down for a few minutes until authorities arrived.
He said he ran outside and saw people wrestling with the suspect.
Maisch said that she dropped to the ground when the shooting started.
The suspect had pulled the clip out of his pocket, Maisch said.
Hernandez, a 20-year-old University of Arizona junior, had just started as an intern with Giffords' staff that week.
...
The entire time I was with the congresswoman, she was still responding," Hernandez said.
I think the people who are heroes are people like Gabby, who have dedicated their lives to public service," he said.
Rayle was one of the people who helped hold the suspect down after the takedown.
He said he was standing at the side of Giffords' table when the shooting started.
After the suspect was brought down, Rayle helped to restrain him.
That's basically the treatment; there's not much else you can do," Rayle said .
