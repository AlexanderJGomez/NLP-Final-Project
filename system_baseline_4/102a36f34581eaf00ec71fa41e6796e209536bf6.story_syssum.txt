"People were telling us that she had been raped and she wrote it in her journal," said Lynn Courey, Courey's mother.
The investigation has now also been referred to the Columbia Police Department from the University of Missouri Police Department.
According to the ESPN report, in February 2010, after a night out drinking with friends, Courey said she went home with a former university football player -- off-campus -- and had consensual sex.
Courey's parents say their daughter also talked about the alleged assault with a campus nurse and a campus doctor, 11 months after the attack.
School officials say they later discovered and turned over to Courey's parents a transcript of Courey's conversation with the rape counselor.
Courey's father, Mike Menu, said, "We did not feel supported in this letter.
"Victims of sexual assault need to know that they can seek medical care without the concern that reports will be made to police or campus officials without their consent.
We think it is strange and inappropriate for the University to be criticized for not undertaking an investigation when Sasha's parents chose not to respond to our request for their input.
