But those convictions and the related sentence were tossed out Thursday by a federal appeals court judge.
In explaining his decision, Chief Judge Alex Kozinski of the federal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals chided the prosecution for remaining "unconstitutionally silent" on the "history of misconduct" of its key witness, a Phoenix police detective.
The detective, Armando Saldate, said the friend told him that Debra Milke was involved in a plot to kill her son.
"The trial was, essentially, a swearing contest between Milke and ... Saldate," said Kozinski.
After that, Saldate said he placed Milke under arrest.
"The judge and jury believed Saldate," said Kozinski of the verdict and sentence.
"...
"In the balance hangs the life of Milke," Kozinski said, explaining the importance of his decision to overturn her convictions.
