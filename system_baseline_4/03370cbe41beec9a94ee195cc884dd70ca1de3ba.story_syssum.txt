Welcome to John and June Sturgeon's indoor train garden, a collection of model trains the couple have been sharing with friends and neighbors every holiday season for nearly 15 years.
John still has the train, and many more.
"I venture to say, each year I put at least a hundred hours in here," John says.
"And then ... when it closes [they're] looking forward to it next year."
The Sturgeons have worked consistently to make additions to the train garden.
...
"There's a train we added this year that has 30 cars on it.
The Sturgeons open their collection for 20 nights each year leading up to Christmas.
The front window of the house has a replica of the leg-shaped lamp from the classic holiday movie "A Christmas Story".
