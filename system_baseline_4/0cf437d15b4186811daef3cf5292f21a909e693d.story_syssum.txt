Casablanca, Morocco (CNN) -- Morocco's Facebook youth movement Fevrier 20 has called on civil society groups the length of the country to participate in a nationwide demonstration Sunday.
Corruption accounts for a loss of about 2% of Morocco's GDP, officials have said.
The king is widely revered in Morocco, yet many Moroccans are skeptical about whether real reforms will be implemented in a new political landscape he hopes to unveil in mid-June, after a special constitutional commission finalizes its work on the blueprint.
"The main areas of concern when we talk about corruption in Morocco are the judiciary, police and hospitals," Transparency International's local chief Rachid Filali Meknassi said.
"To give you an idea how bad it is in the judiciary," Filali Meknassi said, "we conducted a survey in 2005 and found that the majority of judges and lawyers in Morocco have no faith in the system being free of corruption.
The court's report focused on graft in the Health Ministry, the National Investment and Development Fund and several local mayors.
"We want a new constitution, which will define exactly what the new rules and regulations are in place to stop corruption," explained Said Benjebli, one of the movement's architects who edits the main Facebook page.
But then even smaller-scale corruption, like those who can't get a job despite having the qualifications, is also important."
