Hoylake (CNN) -- Rory McIlroy had won two majors before Sunday, but none in front of his dear old mum.
"My mum, she hadn't been to the previous two majors that I won, and it was incredible the first person that greeted me coming off the 18th was her.
McIlroy's Open victory was markedly different to his previous two major wins.
Leading by six shots prior to the final round he saw that shaved down to just two with a handful of holes left as Spain's Sergio Garcia, a friend and Ryder Cup buddy, hounded him doggedly.
"Winning The Open, the home major for guys like myself, it's a very special championship and I'm so very honored to have won it," he explained.
"Again this feels a bit more like the first one at Congressional where I maybe had to silence a few doubters about how I played links golf, how can I handle a lead, how do I play well on a Friday.
In 2011, as a 21-year-old, McIlroy led by four shots going into the final round, and disintegrated on the back nine, eventually finishing in a tie for 15th.
"I'll be going with a lot of motivation, I'll do everything I can to prepare the best way I can because it'll be a great chance for me to put that little milestone in my career to bed and go forward.
"That boys championship was 2003 -- a lot can happen in 11 years that's for sure," he said.
McIlroy's British Open career had been in decline before this triumph.
"I think you need experiences like the one in 2010, having the first round lead and losing it," he said.
I did.
I had the win earlier in the year at Wentworth and I felt like my game was just coming into form.
