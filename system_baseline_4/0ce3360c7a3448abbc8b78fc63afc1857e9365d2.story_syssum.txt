The Indonesian and South Korean pairs appealed the decision, the federation said.
But the Chinese sporting authorities accepted the decision and the head badminton coach apologized for the players' behavior.
"It's not in the spirit of the thing," said Kevin Button of Ashford, in Kent, just outside London.
In the first of the Tuesday matches under scrutiny, Wang and Yu played South Korea's Jung Kyung-eun and Kim Ha-na in a game in which "neither side seemed to be exerting themselves," the official Olympic news service said.
Former badminton player Andy Goode, who represented Team GB at the 1992 Olympics and managed the team four years later, said the disqualification was the right call for the sake of the sport.
"These players, I feel for them a little bit, because this wasn't their decision; their team has told them to lose these games," he said.
The Chinese Olympic delegation "fully respects the Badminton World Federation's decision to punish" its athletes, it said in a statement.
The Chinese Sports Delegation feels saddened," it said.
It's me to blame."
The game of badminton dates back centuries but has been an Olympic sport only since 1992.
