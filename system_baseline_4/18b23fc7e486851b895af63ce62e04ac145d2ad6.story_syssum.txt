"This is the first time we have won the gold in men's doubles, so it's certainly historic," Sharath told the official Commonwealth Games website.
In the pool, English diver Tom Daley won his second gold medal in two days, adding the 10 meter platform title to the synchronized diving crown he had already claimed in Delhi.
Elsewhere at the games, Australia won a thrilling women's hockey final, clinching the gold medal after a penalty shoot-out victory against New Zealand.
In shooting, the men's skeet singles title was won by England's Richard Brickell after he beat defending champion Georgios Achilleos from Cyprus in a shoot-off.
