Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has tossed out government fines against CBS Inc. and its affiliates for airing the infamous shot of brief nudity involving singer Janet Jackson during the 2004 Super Bowl.
But CBS countered that the government in recent decades has applied inconsistent rules to indecent words and images, punishing some instances and ignoring others.
After viewer complaints and national media attention, the FCC said the Jackson incident was obscene.
In addition to CBS Inc., 20 of its affiliates also were fined.
The television networks say their scripted shows no longer air nudity, racy images or expletives, even after 10 p.m., when some potentially vulgar words may be permitted.
The "wardrobe malfunction" case is FCC v. CBS Corp. (11-1240).
