"On one hand, we knew where things were going so we could build these huge story arcs in the first one, and even in the second one, that would get resolved in the third game," said Casey Hudson, executive producer of the "Mass Effect" series.
Hudson said the way the "Mass Effect" series is built allows experienced players to continue with the stories they've already worked on but also provides entry points for new players to get quickly acclimated to the tale and begin their own adventure.
As with "Mass Effect 2," players who have saved characters will be able to import them into "Mass Effect 3," changing some dialogue (the game will have a hefty 40,000 lines) and missions to reflect actions taken in previous games.
"
This is the beginning of all the biggest things you get to do in the 'Mass Effect' series, and then everything comes to an end that you define as a player."
Which major character doesn't make it to the end, and who will be left for the final battle?
"This is really the biggest part of this series.
"Mass Effect 3" will be available Tuesday in North America, Thursday in Australia, March 9 in Europe and March 15 in Japan.
