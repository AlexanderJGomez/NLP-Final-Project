Some iPhone 5 users are complaining that a burst of purple is showing up in their photos -- and Apple seems to be acknowledging it's just part of how the camera works.
An e-mail from Apple appears to confirm that the purple haze isn't all in users' minds.
He claims Apple support staff first said the discoloration shouldn't be happening but shifted after talking to Apple engineers.
A comparison by Mashable, a CNN content partner, studied similar images taken with an iPhone 5, an iPhone 4S and a Nikon D300.
"The new iSight camera in iPhone 5 features a sapphire crystal lens cover that is thinner and more durable than standard glass with the ability to provide crystal clear images," Apple wrote in promotional material for the phone.
Other iPhone 5 complaints have ranged from its aluminum casing scratching easily to light leaking from openings on the phone.
