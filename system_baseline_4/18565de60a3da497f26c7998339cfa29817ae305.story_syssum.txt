The structure, a 94-by-94-foot building, was the location where Tesla hoped to develop wireless communications and clean, free energy for everyone in the early 1900s.
The facility was lost a few years later due to debts Tesla racked up, and the huge tower was demolished in 1917.
Matthew Inman, the creator of Web cartoon "The Oatmeal," is joining forces with a nonprofit group, The Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe, to help preserve the facility as a science center and museum honoring "the father of the electric age."
"I made a comic about Tesla on my site.
The goal was to raise enough money to buy the property and begin efforts to restore the facility.
Inman said he was shocked by how much, and how quickly, people have donated to save Tesla's lab.
He's also asked the General Electric Company, co-founded by Tesla rival Thomas Edison, to contribute, and received a "modest amount" from Elon Musk, co-founder of PayPal and Tesla Motors.
"Tesla, for the past year or two on the Internet, has risen as a cult hero to geek people," Inman said.
"Tesla viewed the Earth as a generator of electricity.
"Tesla foresaw the wireless transmissions we do with our cell phones and our laptops," Alcorn said.
Eventually, the property was lost in 1915 -- to pay off a debt to George Boldt of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel -- before Tesla could realize his dream of free electricity for everyone.
The company put the property up for sale in 2009 and got an offer from a potential buyer who wanted to develop the land.
Alcorn said the money raised by the IndieGoGo campaign would just purchase the property and facility, not finance the cleanup or restoration of the building into a museum.
