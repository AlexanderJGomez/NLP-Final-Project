Queen Elizabeth II's much beloved Royal Yacht Britannia carried members of the monarchy on almost 1000 official voyages over 44 years, from her launch in 1953 to her decommissioning in 1997.
"Any royal yacht is around for some time," says Ken Freviokh.
The yacht designer would draw on the last Britannia as a source of inspiration for a new royal yacht.
"A new royal yacht shouldn't be conventional," he says.
It's not all business for the royals, and Freviokh says he'd take into account the more intimate occasions when creating spaces, allowing a banquet room to be converted into smaller family areas.
Tony Castro wants onlookers to be captivated by any royal yacht he would design.
"It's a great way to get people together to sell a message -- no one could turn down an invitation to the royal yacht."
"In the current market, it's so much cheaper to buy an existing yacht and re-fit and condition it," says Huish.
"The outside should be modern but I don't think the royal family would go for a highly modern interior, it would have to be traditional," says the designer who thinks furnishing should be classic with a slight modern twist such as simple mouldings made out of wood.
But if the Queen did not want a pre-loved model, Huish believes there's never been a better time to commission a yacht with an industry facing tough economic challenges; the royal is more likely to get more for her pound.
