Mobile phones, and their promise of unprecedented connectivity, have altered the way we live.
In the time since Cooper brandished what would become the DynaTAC phone, our mobiles have gone from now-laughably clunky bricks to sleek, stylized slivers of technology.
"We knew that someday everybody would have a (cell) phone, but it was hard to imagine that that would happen in my lifetime," Cooper said to CNN last year.
Cooper and his team had been in a race with AT&T's Bell Labs to create a cellphone.
"I called and told him, 'Joel, I'm calling you from a cellular phone, a real cellular phone, a handheld, portable, real cellular phone'," Cooper recalled.
When asked about it, he says he has no recollection of this moment."
Compare that to the iPhone 5, which weighs in at under 4 ounces, is less than 5 inches from top to bottom and sells at prices starting at $199.
"Phones have gotten so complicated, so hard to use, that you wonder if this is designed for real people or for engineers."
