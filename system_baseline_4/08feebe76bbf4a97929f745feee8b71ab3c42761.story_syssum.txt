(CNN) -- Here's the reality of the situation: A diplomatic solution to Syria's use of chemical weapons will include "boots on the ground."
There can be no inspection regime until all parties involved in the fighting in Syria agree to stop fighting and to an intrusive cease-fire verification regime.
Having led the initial weapons of mass destruction hunt in Iraq in 2003, I can tell you that there is no possibility that inspectors should volunteer to race into harm's way to inspect a possible chemical site without a phalanx of soldiers protecting them.
Hezbollah is guided and funded by Iran so it won't stop the killing.
Al-Assad will surrender that data on his chemical stockpiles, but it may well be wrong, full of intentional inaccuracies.
The killing will continue.
Finally, every party involved in Syria's civil war wants al-Assad's chemical stockpile.
Chemical weapons are strategic leverage.
