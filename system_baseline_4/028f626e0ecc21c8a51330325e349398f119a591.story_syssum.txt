(CNN) -- Since China took part in the Olympic Games in 1984 after a three-decade absence, competitive sports have served one purpose -- to build national pride.
To serve this calling, many kids who were identified as potential elite athletes were enrolled into the government supported "sports schools."
In 2008, China won 51 gold medals (100 medals overall) and topped the gold medal tally at the Beijing Olympic Games.
It is more and more difficult to find kids (and parents) who want to join the "sports school" system and aim for that one-in-a-million shot to become an Olympic gold medalist.
There is nothing wrong with the obsession towards winning, after all, that's what elite competitive sports is all about but there are other emerging trends that might change the face of sports in China.
However, we also see that more kids (and parents) are embracing sport and the values it teaches.
These are the qualities that will help them to secure that better future over and beyond their academic performance.
Six years after the Beijing Olympic Games, there is another Olympic Games currently taking place in China this month -- the 2nd Youth Olympic Games in Nanjing.
In today's China, the demand for sports has gone beyond Olympic gold medals and national pride.
