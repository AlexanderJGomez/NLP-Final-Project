(CNN) -- Syrian opposition voices spoke out Monday against a proposed law that would allow for new political parties, calling it little more than a publicity stunt.
"The law stipulates that any political party needs to have at least 2,000 members representing at least seven Syrian provinces before being active," said Damascus lawyer Anwar Al Bounni, who heads the Syrian Center for Legal Studies and Research.
This stipulation, Al Bounni said, makes it impossible for opposition parties to establish a presence, despite the new law.
More than 12,000 demonstrators participated in two towns alone, dissident organization Local Coordination Committees of Syria said.
It would require that new parties adhere to principles similar to those of Western democracies, SANA reported.
Online videos posted Monday morning showed protesters reaffirming demands of regime change, chanting: "The people want the fall of the regime."
Human Rights Watch says Syrian security forces have intensified their campaign of mass arrests in cities that have had anti-government protests.
