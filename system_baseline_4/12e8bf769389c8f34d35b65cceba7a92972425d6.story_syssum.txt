So, you got a drone for ChrismaHanuKwanzakah, huh?
Three drone associations partnered with the FAA this month to spread the word about the guidelines to safely operate drones -- the Know Before You Fly campaign.
The FAA has already recorded 25 incidents when small drones got too close for comfort with manned aircrafts.
Now, replace that bird with a drone.
The FAA advises drone pilots to keep their crafts away from large crowds and out of stadiums and racetracks.
Anyway, that shouldn't happen as long as you keep your drone within your line of sight at all times, another guideline for drone use.
The FAA even fined one man $10,000 for using a drone to shoot a promotional video.
The Academy of Model Aeronautics, one of three drone groups collaborating with the FAA, advises users not to use drones to photograph people secretly or spy on them.
