Los Angeles (CNN) -- Delays in deposing Kanye West and other witnesses in the divorce of Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries mean the 72-day marriage may not legally end until next year, lawyers said at a hearing Wednesday.
"Ms. Kardashian had no intention of going through with the marriage," Waller said.
Kardashian's legal fees have already reached $250,000, which Wasser said she will try to force Humphries to pay.
The deposition of Kardashian will not happen until after Humphries' lawyers have reviewed the production documents, Waller said.
Kardashian answered the door at her Los Angeles home on July 16 when a process server knocked and said told her he had something for West, Waller said.
West was not there at the time, Kardashian lawyer Laura Wasser said.
Humphries' girlfriend will be deposed by Kardashian's lawyers in New York Tuesday, Wasser said.
