He had recently converted to Islam and started the page under the name Jah'Keem Yisrael.
Nolen had tried to convert co-workers to Islam, officials said.
The statement said that "The Islamic Community of Oklahoma has consistently condemned all violence -- most especially acts of violence ostensibly carried out in the name of Islam.
"He wasn't targeting anyone, wasn't going specifically after them," the police spokesman said.
Nolen stopped attacking people when he was shot by Mark Vaughan, who besides being his company's CEO has been a reserve deputy with the Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office, said Sheriff John Whetsel.
The trooper, Betsy Randolph, told CNN on Saturday that Nolen started struggling after she put a handcuff on one wrist.
Mary Fallin, Alex Weintz, noted the governor had blocked Nolen from receiving parole in 2012.
Weintz said Saturday: "The suspect came up for parole in 2012 and the governor denied his parole.
