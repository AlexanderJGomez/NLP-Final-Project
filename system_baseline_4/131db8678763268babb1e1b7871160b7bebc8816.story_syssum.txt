Washington (CNN) -- Former presidential assailant John Hinckley Jr. should not be allowed to spend any unsupervised time during visits to his mother's home in Virginia, according to a psychiatrist who first met Hinckley in the 1980s and interviewed him several times in recent months.
Patterson said he had asked Hinckley about Secret Service reports Hinckley had gone into book stores and looked at shelves of history books which included volumes about presidential assassination.
He said Hinckley maintained he never looked at those books.
Patterson said Hinckley engages in deception and has what he termed "distorted relationships" with women.
Patterson said Hinckley lied to his parents and psychiatrists prior to the 1981 Reagan shooting.
Patterson said that relationship was a delusion and noted that years after the assassination attempt -- in 1995 -- Hinckley said he was over his feelings for Foster.
The hearing on whether Hinckley should get increased freedoms will resume on Monday.
