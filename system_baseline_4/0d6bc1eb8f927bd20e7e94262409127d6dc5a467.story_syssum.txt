"I sit back and reflect on the difference between flood and fire," Dawson said.
Comparing what she witnessed at her parents' home in New Orleans when it was flooded by Katrina and the fire that engulfed her own home, Dawson knows which is worse.
"It was total destruction this time," she said of her Colorado home.
Dawson got to her house in time to see the plumes of smoke and to receive the reverse-911 call to evacuate.
Dawson has two cats but could find only one.
The horses survived, but every day Dawson remembers another special item that disappeared in the fire.
They found her father's World War II medals.
The doll still holds water that seeped in during the time it was submerged.
Beyond reflecting on the destructive powers of water and fire, however, Dawson is unwavering on her next step.
