Burt and Verona (John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph) aren't legally bound -- she staunchly resists his repeated proposals -- but nevertheless they're a couple about to go nuclear: She's six months pregnant.
She's an illustrator with a lucrative line in anatomical drawings.
"We have cardboard windows...
Or they have college friends in Montreal.
And away they go.
In Montreal they pour gravy on French fries.
They may not be the most dynamic duo to hit the road, but the relationship between Burt and Verona feels touchingly true.
Unlike his character, he's an actor who has found himself.
Verona is so fresh and alert, she can't help but doubt herself as they trail from one family disaster to the next and wonder what kind of parents they are going to make.
More often than not, and where it really counts, "Away We Go" hits home.
