Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The first stage of the NATO handover to Afghan security forces began Sunday, marked with a ceremony at a police station in Afghanistan's Bamiyan province -- a small relatively stable area situated in the country's mountainous central region.
Helmand province is home to the small farming community of Marjah, where thousands of NATO and Afghan troops launched a massive offensive that drove  Taliban forces from the area, despite fierce  resistance and heavy losses.
The spokesman said Afghan forces returned fire on the empty school, as NATO airstrikes pummeled the building.
While some welcome the transition, critics question whether the country's security forces can repel a resurgent militancy without the same levels of foreign intervention.
Sunday's transfer ceremony came as Gen. David Petraeus -- the outgoing top commander of the NATO forces in Afghanistan -- prepared to formally transfer authority on Monday to incoming commander Marine Lt. Gen. John Allen.
