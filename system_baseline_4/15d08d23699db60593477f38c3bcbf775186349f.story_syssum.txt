Americans are increasingly concerned that ISIS represents a direct terror threat, fearful that ISIS agents are living in the United States, according to a new CNN/ORC International poll.
And 8 in 10 Americans support Congress approving military force against ISIS.
While the CNN poll indicates Americans think ISIS has the ability to attack the United States, Obama said in the NBC interview there has been no "immediate intelligence" that signifies the terrorist group is a threat.
The CNN/ORC poll shows that only 30% of Americans think that he has a clear plan for dealing with ISIS.
The CNN/ORC Polls shows that 45% of Americans see that ISIS is a "very serious threat to the U.S," while 49% thought the same of al Qaeda 11 years ago.
"Americans are significantly less reluctant to use military force than they were a year ago, and the number who say that terrorism is the country's most important problem has quadrupled, making it second only to the economy on the list of top problems in the public's mind," CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said.
