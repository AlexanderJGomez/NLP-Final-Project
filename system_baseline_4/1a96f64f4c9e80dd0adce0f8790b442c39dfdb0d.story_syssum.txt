Family attorney David McGee said Levinson's relatives were supposed to meet with FBI Director James Comey about the case long before it became publicly known that Levinson was working for the CIA.
Levinson, now 65, had gone to Iran on a mission to investigate corruption involving the laundering of oil profits by Iranian officials, including former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, according to a source.
His family had also said he wasn't working for the government.
When the Levinson family first went to the Senate Intelligence Committee for help, staffers contacted the CIA and at that point, the CIA told them "they have no connection with him at all," McGee said.
The family also had e-mails regarding his pending 2007 trip to Iran involving his instructions with Dawud Salahuddin, an American fugitive who lives in Iran.
Confronted with the evidence, the CIA then demurred, said it would get back in touch and later admitted the relationship with Levinson, he said.
Ultimately, seven CIA staffers were disciplined and three were fired, McGee said -- including Levinson's chief handler.
