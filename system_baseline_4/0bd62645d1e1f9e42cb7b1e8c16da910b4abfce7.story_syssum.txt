Toulouse (CNN) -- French police had no grounds on which to arrest gunman Mohammed Merah before he carried out three attacks in which seven people died, Prime Minister Francois Fillon told French radio station RTL Friday.
Mouton said he would meet with Toulouse prosecutor Michel Valet later Friday to discuss the case.
But, he said, "there was no single element" that would have allowed the police to arrest Merah before the killings began.
"We live in a country under the rule of law."
Bullet holes pock the walls and nearby cars, and broken glass lies scattered around.
Police tracked Merah down via his mother's computer IP address, which was apparently used to respond to an ad posted by the first victim, officials said.
Investigations will determine whether Merah acted alone, the prime minister told RTL.
Rival candidate Francois Hollande, appearing at a rally Thursday night, said questions will have to be asked about the Merah case, French media reported.
Merah then jumped out a window onto a balcony, still shooting, and was found dead on the ground, officials said.
After Merah was killed, police found video he had recorded of the attacks, ammunition and ingredients for explosives, Molins said.
Gueant said Merah had been under surveillance by French intelligence for years.
Merah was sentenced 15 times by a Toulouse juvenile court when he was a minor, Molins said.
Police said the same guns were used in all three attacks.
