Oxford Dictionaries' word for the year for 2013 is "selfie."
And sorry about the focus, it was a selfie."
Yes, the first-ever known mention of the word "selfie" stemmed from an inebriated mouth with teeth protruding through its bottom lip.
"Language research conducted by Oxford Dictionaries editors reveals that the frequency of the word selfie in the English language has increased by 17,000% since this time last year," Oxford wrote in justifying its choice.
"Selfie" is not slouching on its thrown, Oxford says of its word of the year.
"Selfie" has also been busy pumping out offspring in its namesake.
Fitting, since a drelfie in Australia was the first "selfie" that ever bore the name.
