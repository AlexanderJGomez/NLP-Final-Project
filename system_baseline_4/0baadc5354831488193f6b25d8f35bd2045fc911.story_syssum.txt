An alleged al Qaeda operative accused of playing a role in the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania pleaded not guilty Tuesday to terrorism charges brought against him in federal court in New York.
In response to a question from Kaplan, al Libi said he preferred to be addressed by his proper name, Nazih Abdul Hamed al Ruqai.
Al Libi means "from Libya."
In those paragraphs, authorities allege al Libi met with al Qaeda members about bombing the U.S. Embassy in Kenya, which ended up happening five years later in 1998.
Among the charges, he is accused of taking photos of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi in preparation for the attack.
U.S. Rep. Peter King, R-New York, said Monday that it was "unfortunate" that al Libi was on U.S. soil.
President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder have previously said they prefer to try people such as al Libi in American courts.
Al Libi was indicted in 2001 by the federal court in the Southern District of New York in the embassy bombings and in connection with his alleged roles in al Qaeda conspiracies to attack U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Somalia.
Al Libi's family members said they had received no news about him from the U.S. or Libyan governments and were shocked to learn that he had arrived in the United States.
His wife told CNN this month that al Libi has a severe case of hepatitis C and that she was worried about his health.
A senior Obama administration official said it wasn't possible to give Libya consular access to al Libi until he had arrived in the United States.
