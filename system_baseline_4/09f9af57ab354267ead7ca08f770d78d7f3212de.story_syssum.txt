(CNN) -- Wednesday night's debate showcased a Mitt Romney resisting his worst debating weaknesses and playing solidly to his strengths.
Let's begin with Romney.
Wednesday night?
Listen, Mitt Romney can handle these debates.
Romney talked over him so often that I swear one time I saw Lehrer slumping behind his desk while he meekly gazed up at Romney and muttered, "Excuse me, I believe you have my stapler."
In the Republican primaries, Romney wasn't a great debater when he was trailing in the polls.
Romney put Obama on the defensive and kept him there all night defending his policies.
As for Obama, one strength is that he is solid at picking a theme and sticking with it.
This time, Obama clearly presented his theme.
What was it?
And it failed to put Romney on the defensive.
Unfortunately for the president, he didn't correct this.
For Obama, with a troubled economy, it works against the president.
You know it's bad when at the end of the debate, uber-wealthy Mitt Romney seems like he cares more about the middle class and even the lower class than the sitting Democratic president of the United States.
Obama needs to find a much more effective way to pin Romney down to a specific policy.
Obama will need to stick to one subject over a series of exchanges.
Since Romney will continue to put him on the defensive (and this is guaranteed), Obama must turn potential flaws into strengths.
For Romney: Steady as she goes.
Romney was assertive (compared with Obama's passivity).
Romney was assertive in this debate without being aggressive.
Romney can lose more votes than he can gain in future debates if he comes across as rude or mean, an impression many had of McCain four years ago.
