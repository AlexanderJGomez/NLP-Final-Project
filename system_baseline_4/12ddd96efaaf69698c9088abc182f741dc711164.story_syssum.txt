CNN obtained a copy of the police report Friday, as news of the allegations against Joseph Rogers Jr. spread around the media.
His accuser told police that, starting in 2003, she had worked out of Rogers' house as his assistant handling personal and work-related items.
The accuser "was forced to endure the harassment and demeaning treatment by Rogers because she was a single mother and needed her job to support herself and her son," according to police.
No charges have been filed in the case.
It is known for its signature yellow signage, jukebox music and breakfast offerings.
