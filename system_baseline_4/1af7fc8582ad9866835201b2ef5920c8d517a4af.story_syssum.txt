(CNN) -- Some Gulf Coast residents and former clean-up workers are suffering from an array of mysterious illnesses, according to a Louisiana physician who has treated dozens of patients complaining of similar symptoms.
Robichaux said "there's no question" that these health difficulties are caused by contact with oil and dispersant.
Robichaux said this experience was "typical" of a subset of patients he sees.
He said the health problems he sees get very little national attention.
At its peak of the crisis, in June 2010, 37% of Gulf waters, or 88,522 square miles, were closed to fishing.
