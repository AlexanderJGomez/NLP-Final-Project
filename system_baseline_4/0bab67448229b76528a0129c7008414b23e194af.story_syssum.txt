O'Brien described a meeting between Bulger and a man who owed him money.
"What's that?"
O'Brien said he was an "independent" bookmaker, or unaffiliated with a crime organization, when Bulger summoned him to a meeting to discuss joining the Bulger group.
Mr. Bulger ended up on top.
The monthly payment went in excess of $2,000, O'Brien said, and was sometimes higher because Bulger and partner Steven "The Rifleman" Flemmi would charge random "taxes" if, for example, one of O'Brien's workers found himself at the end of a government wiretap.
He said before he left for the meeting he told his daughter, "If I'm not back in 12 hours go to the FBI in Miami.
Bulger's lawyers are trying to show Bulger was allowed to act with impunity, sanctioned by corrupt FBI agents and federal prosecutors.
Bulger's lawyers also are trying to establish that Bulger was never a paid informant for the FBI and that instead Bulger was the one paying rogue agents for information.
Bulger was in hiding for 16 years before he was captured in Santa Monica, California, two years ago, living under a false name with his girlfriend in an apartment in the oceanside city.
