(CNN) -- Sweden's military feels certain there was an intruder, but it has called off the search for a mystery vessel in waters near Stockholm.
Government officials have not said what they believed they had detected, but Sweden's media reported the military was probably looking for a Russian submarine.
Moscow said it had no vessel in Swedish waters and suggested Sweden ask the Netherlands if it was one of theirs stationed nearby.
Moscow has practiced mock attacks of Stockholm and has flown very close to Swedish planes and ships, he said.
And the national defense stir had some of his countrymen gunning for him.
