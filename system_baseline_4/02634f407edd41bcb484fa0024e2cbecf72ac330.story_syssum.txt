Chiquita Chavis is an Army Reservist who served in Afghanistan and is waiting to see if she'll be deployed for a second time.
"I never had to live in the street," said Chavis, 30.
Female veterans are also more likely to be single parents, the VA says, which can make it more difficult to find adequate housing.
Boothe, 35, considers it her mission to help her female comrades who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless.
"Not every veteran is living under a bridge," Boothe said.
In the past two years, Boothe has opened two transitional homes in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, where veterans and their children can live for up to two years while they get their lives back on track.
"We offer wrap-around services ... anything they could possibly need to help get themselves back in a state of independence," Boothe said.
Additionally, Boothe works to prevent homelessness by providing interest-free loans or grants to help female veterans pay for rent, deposit and utilities.
As a single mother, Boothe joined the Army Reserves to make a better life for herself and her young son.
Boothe and her son were fine -- she'd already sent him to live with a relative in Missouri while she prepared to deploy -- but the family lost everything, and Boothe became homeless.
When Boothe asked the VA what assistance was available for her, she was told they didn't have any programs that could help with the challenges she was facing as a female veteran with a dependent child.
Boothe joined her young son in Missouri, where she was able to eventually get her life back together.

"I have a job now, and I got promoted in like two weeks," Chavis said.
Boothe is determined to help as many female veterans as she can.
"It's my duty as a soldier to help my fellow sisters."
