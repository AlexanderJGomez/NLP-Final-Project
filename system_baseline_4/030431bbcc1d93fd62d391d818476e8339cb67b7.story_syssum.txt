The race appeared to be a nail-biter going into Tuesday night but in the end, it came down to the state that most had been saying for weeks that it would â€” Ohio.
"If we don't do better with Hispanics, we'll be out of the White House forever," says Republican strategist and CNN contributor Ana Navarro, who was the national Hispanic co-chair of Sen. John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign.
Their share of the vote expanded from 9% in 2008 to 10% in this election.

The youth vote came up big â€” and the white vote got smaller
According to national exit polls, 18-29 year olds increased from 17% to 18% of the electorate from 2004 to 2008.
That jump in size from four years ago made up for the president's drop in capturing the youth vote, from 66% in 2008 to 60% in 2012.
Some GOP strategists said that the white vote needed to be 74% for Romney to win.
"The American auto industry is back on top," Obama said campaigning last week in the Buckeye State.
And in the final weeks leading up the the election, the Obama campaign highlighted pushback by General Motors and Chrysler to a Romney TV ad and a radio spot this past week that claimed both domestic auto makers were sending U.S. jobs to China.
Nearly six in 10 Ohio voters said they approved of the federal government's role in helping the troubled domestic automakers, and according to exit polls, the president won three quarters of those voters.
Much was made of campaign visits by Romney and his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, to Pennsylvania in the final weekend before the election, and Romney's return to the Keystone State on Election Day.
And of the swing states that swung blue four years ago, it appears Romney was only able to turn Indiana and North Carolina red again.
We had a Democratic president, a Republican House of Representatives, and Democratic Senate going into the 2012 election.
And what did all that money buy?
