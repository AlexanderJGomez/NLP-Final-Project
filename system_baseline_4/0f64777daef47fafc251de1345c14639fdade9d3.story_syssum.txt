President Obama and the Republican presidential candidates almost seem to be trying to one-up each other's blunders.
...
And then President Obama joined in.
Let's be honest, these comments were not "gaffes" as the media dubs them, but rather, rare opportunities for us to have an unfiltered look at the candidates' character and views on issues.
Another gaffe occurred when President Obama was in Austria and commented: "I don't know what the term is in Austrian" for "wheeling and dealing."
The so-called gaffes in this campaign are not misstatements of facts or mispronunciations.
There is not doubt that President Obama meant what he said to the Russian president.
These rare, honest moments during the campaign should not be so quickly dismissed by the media or us as simply gaffes.
Indeed, we should applaud and savor these gaffes, because it's these very remarks that may ultimately help us decide if the candidate in question is truly the best suited to be elected or re-elected as president of the United States.
