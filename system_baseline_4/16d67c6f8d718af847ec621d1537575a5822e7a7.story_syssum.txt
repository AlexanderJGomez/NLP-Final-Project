The jury came back with the award late Thursday against Andrew Shirvell, said Deborah Gordon, a lawyer representing the plaintiff, Chris Armstrong, 22, who graduated last year.
Shirvell also referred to Armstrong as "Satan's representative" on the Michigan Student Assembly, she said.
"It's absolutely outrageous.
Gordon said that Shirvell's claim is without merit.
If you say my neighbor is having sex in a park with children, which is literally kind of what he said here, that is defamation.
Gordon said the multimillion-dollar judgment "is probably not collectable" at this time, since Shirvell has no job.
But she said that had never been the point of the lawsuit.
