A fire burns through the dome of the Taj hotel in Mumbai Wednesday.
When I inquired, one of the hotel occupants told me that some terrorists have entered the place and are threatening the people," said a person name Punya, who was staying at the Taj Mahal Hotel.
Punya was holed up in the hotel for 15 hours before he was able to escape at 1:30 p.m. local time.
"Me and my friend escaped down the fire exit, but I think they took more people upstairs.
They came from the restaurant and took us up the stairs.
...
... People were crying; people were limping.
...
...
"At around 9 p.m., all of us came to the ground floor to have dinner.
The senior staff then took all of us to the back of the hotel.
We were some 50, 60 people, waiting to escape.
Three people died in the taxi.
Chamberlain said that a group of about 40 people was "marched up like sheep" to the roof by a "young guy with a submachine gun, who was about 22 or 23."
The gunmen then asked if any of the hostages were British or American, Chamberlain told SkyNews.com.
"The smoke was so thick, I thought we were going to suffocate," he told SkyNews.com.
