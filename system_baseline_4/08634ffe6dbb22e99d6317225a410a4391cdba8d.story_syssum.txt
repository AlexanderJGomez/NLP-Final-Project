Michael Brewer, who suffered burns over 65 percent of his body, will have his own skin transplanted onto the burned areas of his back and buttocks, said Lorraine Nelson, a spokeswoman at the University of Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center.
On Thursday, three teens accused of setting Brewer on fire pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted murder, a public defender for one of the boys said.
Prosecutors say the three boys were in a gang that poured alcohol over Brewer, then set him ablaze in a dispute over $40, a video game and a bicycle.
Detectives say eyewitnesses told them that Mendez used a lighter to set fire to Brewer after Jarvis allegedly poured alcohol over him.
"We hope that we can maybe get a statement this week," sheriff's spokesman Jim Leljedal said.
Doctors say Brewer is improving but his condition is tenuous because of the severity of his burns and the possibility of infections.
"And he'll say, 'Am I going to be OK?'
You're going to be just fine,' " she said.
When Brewer did not pay, police say, Bent stole Brewer's father's bicycle.
They'll get theirs is all we can say.
"I can describe both of them as being afraid, being fearful," said Michael Brannon, a forensic psychologist, without identifying the boys.
"I don't think they expected to have happened, what happened," Brannon said.
"It's a horrible event that occurred, but this was not their conceptualization, in my opinion, of what was going to happen."
