Washington (CNN) -- Macy Friday can't remember what she was thinking when -- mouth agape, eyes bugged -- she shook hands with Hillary Clinton in Denver this week.
What does she like about Hillary Clinton?
CNN spoke with Macy Friday over the phone Thursday.
I was just like, 'Wow.'
And then I realized it was me and I went up and I turned back at my family.
(long pause) I turned back at my family and I, like, I, you know, made the face.
Macy: I like her because, like, she is running for president and a lot of people think that girls shouldn't be president because they are not as smart or they shouldn't have the same rights.
Macy: I didn't know, too, too, too much.
And her niece's name is Macy.
Did I already say Taylor Swift?
Macy: Maybe!
Macy: I would say that even if you are different or you are a different gender, it doesn't matter what you look like.
CNN: Thanks Macy...
(CNN did use the selfie that Finn took of his family and Clinton.
