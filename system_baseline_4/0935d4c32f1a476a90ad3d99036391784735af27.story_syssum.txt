Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- A local court has set free a teenage boy after finding him guilty of stealing a policeman's sandals in a case that caused furor among Indonesians frustrated with perceived injustices against the poor and defenseless.
To be on the safe side, the boy was returned to his parents.
This is a country with a thousand faces," the commission said.
"We came up with the idea of a thousand sandals which we see as being the symbol of resistance also as compensation for the sandals that was allegedly stolen," Kurniawan said.
To express disappointment over the verdict, the sandals would be given to different government institutions instead, Kurniawan said on Thursday -- namely the national police, the attorney general's office, the Supreme Court, the Justice and Human Rights Ministry and juvenile detention centers.
The Child Protection Commission, however, said the parents had filed a complaint with the Palu police after the alleged victim, 1st Brig.
The parents, according to the commission, wanted a case filed against those policemen.
According to Ihsan of the Commission, the police should have prioritized intervention and rehabilitation since the alleged offender is a minor.
According to the Commission, in 2011 alone, 6,273 minors were reported to be serving time in jail, some of them in adult prisons.
We don't want minors in jail," Ihsan explained.
Public pressure from a similar campaign in 2009, "Coins for Prita," helped a housewife escape criminal liability for complaining in a private e-mail about a hospital's service.
