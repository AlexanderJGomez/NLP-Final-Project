As a doctorate student in the Biomechatronics Group, which looks at how technology can be used to enhance human physical capability, Sengeh has taken on the challenge to design the perfect fit for every prosthetic socket -- the interface between the body and the prosthetic limb, and a major source of discomfort for amputees.
"I think it will change the whole industry," says Sengeh, who is from Sierra Leone.
But the horrors of war didn't prevent Sengeh from thinking big.
Yet the lasting legacy of Sierra Leone's war has followed Sengeh all the way to the United States, shaping his innovative work to this day.
He had realized early on that many amputees in Sierra Leone opted not to use any prostheses because of the discomfort they were causing them.
But Sengeh is not only coming up with new creations that can impact lives and change industry.
"We do have the talent and young people within Sierra Leone, within Africa as a whole, to invent the future," he says.
Those are what's needed to develop products that will change the world.
That is what changes a country."
