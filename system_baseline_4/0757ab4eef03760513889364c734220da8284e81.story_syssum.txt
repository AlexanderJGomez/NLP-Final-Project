Before Hundley's court appearance, his attorney, Marcia Shein, said that he would be entering a plea of not guilty.
On the flight he was in distress, upset and grieving," Shein said.
In her statement Wednesday, Shein did not address whether Hundley was drunk.
In her statement Wednesday, Shein acknowledged that Hundley "said something none should say even in their darkest moments" when the boy began crying and that he "deeply regrets saying those words."
Hundley "had paid a terrible price for his hurtful words but asks only that people understand that he was not doing well that night and spoke hurtful words he would have not otherwise have said," Shein said.
