Real Madrid notched up a club record 16th consecutive victory in all competitions -- a run that stretches all the way back to the middle of September -- by overcoming a gallant Malaga 2-1 away from home despite having midfield-star Isco sent off late on.
The result stretches Real's lead atop of the La Liga table to five points, although Barcelona, Atletico Madrid and Valencia will be looking to reduce that deficit when they play tomorrow.
Bayern Munich's seemingly unstoppable march to a third straight Bundesliga title continued apace Saturday with a 1-0 victory away to Hertha Berlin.
Arjen Robben's first half goal was enough to stretch Pep Guardiola's men lead atop the table to 10 points, although that could be reduced back to seven if second place Wolfsburg overcome Borussia Monchengladbach on Sunday.
Elsewhere in France Saturday, Monaco's stuttering start to the season continued with a 2-0 loss away to fourth placed Rennes.
Goals from Aymen Abdennour and Ola Toivanen were enough to ensure Leonardo Jardim's side couldn't follow up their impressive Champions League victory over Bayer Leverkusen earlier in the week.
