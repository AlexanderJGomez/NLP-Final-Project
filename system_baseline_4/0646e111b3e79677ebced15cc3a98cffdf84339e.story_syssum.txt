Hollister, a popular clothing store owned by Abercrombie & Fitch in the fashionable Soho neighborhood, remained closed Friday after a bedbug infestation was found earlier in the week, according to company spokeswoman Iska Hain.
"The company has requested guidance from the mayor's office on how businesses in Manhattan should deal with this issue," the company said in a news release.
According to the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development, it issued 4,811 violation notices to residential landlords for bedbug infestations in 2009, compared with 82 in the 2003-2004 fiscal year.
Further, landlords of commercial structures are currently not obligated to report bedbug infestation.
State Assembly member Linda B. Rosenthal, who recently sponsored legislation to require landlords of apartment buildings to disclose information about an apartment's bedbug history to potential tenants, plans to address the matter of bedbugs in businesses, though she admits doing so will be tricky.
The rise in bedbug cases is not exclusive to New York.
Despite their name, bedbugs need not live in beds.
