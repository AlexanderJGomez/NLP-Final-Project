The "House of Cards" creator, show runner and primary writer talks freely about his show, which concerns a powerful South Carolina congressman, Francis Underwood (Kevin Spacey), and his maneuvers to get his way in the conniving world of Washington.
Beau Willimon: I always keep my expectations pretty low.
But a number of my friends, including my best friend, Jay Carson, who is a political consultant on the show, were in the upper tiers and really knew what was going on.
It's dramatic, it's interesting, and I think it's something we can all identify with to a degree.
Willimon: Well, beyond the pale ethically for most people, sure.
I really don't think it's a show about politics at all.
CNN: Francis often says that he prefers power over money.
And then you see people like Francis who don't deny the importance of money, but that's not the reason he gets up in the morning.
They didn't.
Willimon: I don't consider myself to be a cynic nor the show to be cynical.
The problem with Washington right now is that people are too stuck to their ideology.
He says, I've got people over here who think this, and people over there who think that.
I think that's attractive to people.
Willimon: Sure.
CNN: I do find the sausage-making ugly.
Willimon: That's an interesting question.
I don't think that the media actually has the power to determine the course of history.
Willimon: It's sort of yes and no.
Willimon: There are so many.
(But) I think there's so much to be gained by digging into this life story.
The thing about Bill that's so extraordinary, besides the fact he's had a career that's spanned half a century, he continues to keep challenging himself.
Willimon: I wish I could tell you, but I'm not going to.
You'll have to watch and see.
