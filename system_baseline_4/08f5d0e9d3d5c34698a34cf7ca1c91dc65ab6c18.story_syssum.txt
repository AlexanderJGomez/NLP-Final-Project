(CNN) -- Sen. Ted Kennedy would have had a "very, very difficult" time politically surviving the drowning death of a young woman if it happened in the era of blogs, talk radio and 24-hour news cycles, experts said.

Kennedy vanished to the family compound for days after the incident, huddling with advisers before emerging the following week to plead guilty to leaving the scene of an accident.
"If at any time, the citizens of Massachusetts should lack confidence in their senator's character or his ability, with or without justification, he could not in my opinion adequately perform his duty and should not continue in office," Kennedy said.
According to a Time-Harris poll in August 1969, about 44 percent of respondents said Kennedy failed "to tell the real truth," 51 percent said his explanation was inadequate and 77 percent said he was wrong not to report the accident immediately.
New media and talk radio would be a "much more ferocious force" today, he said.
In his national address, Kennedy said he was driving Kopechne to a ferry landing because she was tired.
"The car overturned in a deep pond and immediately filled with water," Kennedy said.
Conceding he did not seek a telephone, Kennedy said he returned to the party and summoned a cousin and friend to the scene.
They, too, failed in saving Kopechne, he said.

Today, Baughman said, Kennedy could still survive a Chappaquiddick -- largely because of the Kennedys' clout and because Massachusetts is so enamored with the family -- but it would be tougher with the Slate.coms and Drudge Reports of the world hounding him.
"In the cable news era, that would not have been possible," he said, explaining that blogs and other new media would have prodded the networks and newspapers.
Arena said the Kennedys never pressured him during the investigation.
