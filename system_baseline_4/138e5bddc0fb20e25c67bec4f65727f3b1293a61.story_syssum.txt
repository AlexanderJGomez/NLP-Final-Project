(CNN) -- Eleven people died as Hurricane Sandy pummeled Cuba on Thursday, state media reported.
We have never had a storm hit like this," said a woman named Dulce, a doctor in the city of Santiago.
Residents in Santiago spent Thursday assessing the extent of the damage.
The same province was hit hard by Sandy.
It is a "small storm" with "mediocre wind," he said.
Sandy may not be a Category 5 monster, but "we take it seriously, and we just want to make sure we are comfortable," he said.
ET, the eye of the storm was 105 miles (170 kilometers) east of Nassau, sparing the Bahamas' largest city the worst part of the storm.
CNN meteorologist and severe weather expert Chad Myers said Sandy could have a bigger impact than Irene did last year, when it glanced off North Carolina before plowing into the Northeast.
To what extent is the question to be answered in the next four days.
Fort Lauderdale's Ocean Rescue advised beachgoers to stay out of the water, but acknowledged not everyone would heed the warning.
On Friday, more high waves and rip currents are likely along the coastal beaches of Florida's east coast and into southern Georgia, as well as tropical storm force wind gusts up to 50 mph.
The five-day forecast from the National Hurricane Center predicts the center of the storm will shadow the East Coast in the coming days, with Sandy potentially making landfall as a tropical storm in New Jersey the day before Halloween.
In the Dominican Republic, Misael Rincon, a CNN iReporter, couldn't sleep as Sandy's rain beat down on Santo Domingo because he knew his neighborhood is prone to flooding.
The government ordered evacuations of high-risk zones and canceled schools.
