They came, as tens of thousands do each year, to harvest a highly valuable commodity from the high-altitude soil: the Himalayan caterpillar fungus -- also known as Himalayan Viagra.
Dozens rush over to witness, Jafra is the first to arrive.
(about $3).
This is our first time coming for the harvest.
Like many others, Ram and his brothers traveled for the harvest betting on hope alone.
Police in Dolpa expect 40,000 people to migrate to the district this year.
"Look at the hills," says Gyalpo Thandin, a student in Dolpa, "they're all torn up from people digging.
Thandin, who was visiting home for the harvest, remembers when the yartsa gunbu season meant local bounty, not commercial competition.
Six years ago, a committee of community leaders in Dolpa instituted a taxation system on harvesters in an effort to control numbers and ensure the local community remained resilient amidst environmental changes.
The system is intended to spend the money on environmental protection measures and to subsidize food for villages in the district.
"The goal of the system was to charge people and therefore limit the number who would want to come for the harvest, but putting a price on the entry might actually be encouraging more people," he says.
As communities in Nepal, one of the world's poorest countries, cope with the economic need and the increasing desire for high-value commodities like yartsa gunbu, conservation efforts will require cooperation between leaders at village, district, and national levels.
Keeping it around for future generations will be the challenge.
