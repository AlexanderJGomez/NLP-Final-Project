Schmidt-Jones is just one of a growing number of professors and teachers who are using the Web site Connexions (cnx.org) to reach potential students.
"The access was going to be limited -- it would only be available to just a few students from the United States," he told CNN.
For example, to get Pluto out of all of our nation's textbooks will take a decade.
On the Connexions Web site, authors can upload bite-sized chunks of learning materials called "modules."
This building-block approach means that courses can be adapted both for personal use and by teachers who can tailor each collection for a particular curriculum, class or even an individual student.
"So we can lower the cost for everybody, sometimes to zero for materials that are online."
And as the site grows, Baraniuk is seeing a rise in the number of people using its modules, especially in the arts and humanities, for informal learning.
While most of the site's modules are in English, the site's volunteer translators help meet the demand for educational materials in other languages, where translation and production of traditional textbooks is often prohibitively expensive.
"I don't think any publisher of music textbooks would even have looked at my material," Schmidt-Jones told CNN.
She gets emails every week from teachers and students who've found her material helpful: "Your explanation of minor keys and scales saved my theory life.
Thanks," reads one example.
Schmidt-Jones currently has 167 modules available through Connexions.
The more complex modules, with sound files, figures and diagrams, can take a couple of days to write.
And through Connexions, they can reach an eye-poppingly wide audience.
