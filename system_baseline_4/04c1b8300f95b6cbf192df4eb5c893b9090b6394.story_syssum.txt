(CNN) -- Nanci Griffith wanted to look on the bright side.
Sparked by the changes in her life and American politics, she said, music has been vital to her personal resurgence.
"[The] American people will not let this country collapse," she said.
I [want] my audience to hear these stories," she said.
Nanci Griffith: It was very difficult for me.
That was such an inspiration.
Griffith: No, never in my life.
CNN: Now, in addition to "The Loving Kind," there are other songs based on actual events on this record.
Now, Workman didn't kill him; it was friendly fire.
Griffith: Not really.
Griffith: I do.
Griffith: It's about people like him.
Griffith: I hope so.
Griffith: I was always more interested in story songs, things with a point of view ... and things that informed me.
Griffith: Many have asked that, but I was actually inspired to write that by watching an interview with Shania Twain where she said it would not have mattered if she remained a lounge act for her whole career.
