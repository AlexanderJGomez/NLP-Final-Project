NEW YORK (CNN) -- Russia invades Georgia and President Bush goes on vacation.
Sen. John McCain takes weekends off and limits his campaign events to one a day.
It occurs to me that John McCain is as intellectually shallow as our current president.
When asked what his Christian faith means to him, his answer was a one-liner.
Why not?
Why?
That was it.
Where are John McCain's writings exploring the vexing moral issues of our time?
?
And it shows over and over again whenever McCain is called upon to think on his feet.
Unless he's reciting talking points or reading from notes or a TelePrompTer, John McCain is lost.
George Bush's record as a student, military man, businessman and leader of the free world is one of constant failure.
I fear to the depth of my being that John McCain is just like him.
