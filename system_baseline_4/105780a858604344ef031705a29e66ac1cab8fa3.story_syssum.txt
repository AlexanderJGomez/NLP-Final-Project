(CNN) -- Jennifer Aniston is getting married and this seems to be a matter of intense interest to women around the world.
She is no longer Jennifer Aniston, the star; she is Jennifer, a friend once removed and we talk about her among friends as if she were one of us.
Two reasons.
If a man could be unfaithful to such a lovely, successful and nice woman, we can know that perhaps we weren't left because we weren't pretty enough or sexy enough or witty enough, but because some men just fall in love with someone else.
Well, we thought, if a man could do that to Christie Brinkley, of course we shouldn't feel that a husband or boyfriend left us for not being pretty enough or sexy enough.
Her failed marriage says to us that someone even more glorious than ourselves can be left, but her engagement tells us that there can be a Cinderella story at the end of the road: a mate who truly loves us, who wants to create a family, who will deliver security and unconditional love at last.
Sure, we care about Jennifer, but we follow her life, and the life of other celebrities, mostly because they are now in our "friendship circle," however illusory this perception is.
