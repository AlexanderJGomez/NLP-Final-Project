(CNN) -- He claimed he won the prize this week, and now it's official: Pedro Quezada of New Jersey is the winner of Saturday's $338 million Powerball jackpot, the New Jersey Lottery said Tuesday.
But the money "won't change my heart," Quezada said.
He said he was nervous Monday night.
"I never thought I would win such a prize," Quezada said.
Quezada said he moved to the United States when he was 19.
And his son who works at the deli won't continue either, Quezada said.
Quezada said he might buy a car with part of his winnings.
"I don't know exactly how, but I will help those in need," he said.
