Tianjin, China (CNN) -- In a gleaming classroom at Chong Hua High School in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin, students peer at onion slices under microscopes.
For more than a decade, the Chinese government has selected tens of thousands of top minority students from Xinjiang and placed them in high schools in eastern China -- the heartland of the Han, the country's biggest ethnic group.
After passing a strict entrance exam Mamat joined the Xinjiang class.
It was his first time out of Xinjiang.
"We are just building future talent," says Li Zhenchong.
The same could be said for any classroom in Communist China, but for the Xinjiang class, the political indoctrination appears to take on a special urgency.
He says the Party could be failing.
Grose followed graduates from the Xinjiang class for years and found that they didn't internalize Communist Party ideals.
For Mamat, the Xinjiang Class is the only opportunity to get a strong education and he says he wants to go to college and then back to his home to develop the region.
