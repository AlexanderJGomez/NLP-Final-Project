For Father's Day, my wife gave me some boxer shorts and a tiny reading light, so I can flip through a book in bed without disturbing her.
My wife is the first to admit it: For her, and for many people, Father's Day is an afterthought, a holiday just a few steps above the one that celebrates the groundhog and that other one that promotes trees.
Why?
This would be a weekend in which I couldn't do only the fun stuff -- like playing blocks and watching cartoons -- with the girls.
If this were 1897 or even 1974, I could have coasted through the weekend, serving potato chips and cold cereal to Isabelle, and I would have brought the girls to my wife's bed for her to do the changing of the diapers.
As long as I managed to avoid the house catching on fire, and the girls didn't come down with malaria, at the end of the weekend, my family and friends would have laughed heartily at my mishaps, like they used to do in the last couple seconds of those 1970s and 1980s one-hour dramas (you know, after somebody made a joke and the shot went into freeze frame).
Parenting.com: His way can be better than yours
Mom weekend, instead of ordering pizza, I served Isabelle a chicken casserole with pineapple as a side dish.
I grew more confident in my parenting skills and even gave both girls a bath -- at the same time -- not once, but two nights in a row!
The soldiers would remain at their posts.
Fathers tend to play the part of the dashing news reporter, swooping into parenting duties just long enough to get our hands dirty.
Yet I think we dads merit at least a little more than boxer shorts, soap-on-a-rope, and neckties.
Just as much as the moms, we appreciate the cards, the praise, and being treated special on our day.
