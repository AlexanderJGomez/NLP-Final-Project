(CNN) -- During the past few months, I have gently suggested to my patients that they receive the flu vaccine.
More patients need to be protected against influenza by getting flu shots earlier in the season.
Severe flu complications, like pneumonia, can hospitalize these patients, or worse, be fatal.
One reason why the flu outbreak is so prevalent this year is that the predominant strain, H3N2, hasn't been this widely circulated since 2002-03 and is associated with a more severe illness.
But another reason is the relatively low percentage of patients who received a flu shot.
The reason many cite, "I got the flu from the flu shot!"
In some, the flu can be debilitating, leaving patients bedridden for days.
It's still not too late for a flu shot.
I realize I have to do a better job to dispel these myths in the exam room and convince more of my patients to receive a flu shot.
Then be proactive and get a vaccine earlier in future flu seasons.
