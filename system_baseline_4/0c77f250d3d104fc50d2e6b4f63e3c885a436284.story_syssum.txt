(CNN) -- The Senate Homeland Security Committee has scheduled a public hearing on the prostitution scandal involving U.S. military and Secret Service agents in Colombia.
Three other Secret Service agents were cleared of serious misconduct.
Sen. John McCain, the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said no classified information or weapons were present at the Hotel Caribe, where the alleged incident occurred.
An attorney for Dania Londono Suarez contacted the committee with the request, he said in a statement.
Secret Service investigators have interviewed her, King said.
