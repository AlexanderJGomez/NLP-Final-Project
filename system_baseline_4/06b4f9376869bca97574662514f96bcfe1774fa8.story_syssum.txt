If "The Stranger" hadn't been a success, Billy Joel suspects he would have been dropped from his label.
At a 1976 Columbia Records convention in Toronto, Joel opened a musical showcase and "ripped the crowd up," Ramone recalls in a phone interview from Connecticut.

Known then, as now, as an exciting live performer, Joel and his band gave a series of performances that impressed Ramone -- though, he noted, the recorded versions paled in comparison.
"The Stranger" established Joel as a best-selling artist -- reportedly, upon release, it was the biggest-selling Columbia album in history -- and propelled him to his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame career.
We were just happy with the album we were making at the time," Joel says in the press materials for the "Stranger" re-release.
Joel interviewed several producers, Ramone recalls, including the Beatles' George Martin.
He and Joel hit it off at "an Italian lunch that took forever," Ramone says, and in July went into the studio to record.
They all had great opinions."

"You have to adapt [the character] to you."
The song got a big boost when Joel appeared as the musical guest on "Saturday Night Live" in February 1978 and eventually won Grammys for song and record of the year.
"The Stranger" was the beginning of a fruitful run for Joel and Ramone.
I set out to make a living as a musician, and this is the way it happened," he said.
