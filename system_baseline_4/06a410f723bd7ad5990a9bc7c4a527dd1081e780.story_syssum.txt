Guatemala City (CNN) -- Software mogul John McAfee could be deported to Belize on Thursday after being detained by immigration officials, a Guatemalan official said.
He said McAfee left Belize to escape police persecution.
He sold his stake in McAfee Associates in 1994 and moved to Belize in 2008.
Officials say the dogs' barking and aggressive behavior was a frequent source of friction between McAfee and Faull, a contractor who retired to Belize from Florida and lived next door.
McAfee told CNN in the interview that he did not kill Faull and did not pay anybody to kill the man.
A 2009 story in the New York Times indicated that McAfee's fortune had plunged to $4 million from its $100 million peak, largely because of the real estate and stock market crashes that hit his investments.
