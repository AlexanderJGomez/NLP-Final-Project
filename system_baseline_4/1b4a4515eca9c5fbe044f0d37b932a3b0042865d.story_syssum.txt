(CNN) -- Cancer has surpassed heart disease to become the leading cause of death among Hispanics in the United States, according to an American Cancer Society report released Monday.
It is estimated that 112,800 people of Hispanic ethnicity will be diagnosed with cancer and 33,200 will die of the disease in 2012.
Overall cancer incidence and mortality rates are lower in Hispanics than in the non-Hispanic U.S. population, meaning Hispanics have a lower risk of cancer diagnosis and death.
For example, it is known that Mexicans in the United States tend to have lower cancer rates than Puerto Ricans.
On the other hand, Cubans in America tend to have higher cancer rates than Puerto Ricans.
The cancer death rate in Hispanics has been declining since 2000, one of the first years in which accurate Hispanic numbers were available.
The cancer mortality rate (risk of cancer death) among Hispanics has also declined by 2.3% per year in men and 1.4% per year in women.
Current data indicate that among Hispanics, 43% of women and 34% of men are obese.
