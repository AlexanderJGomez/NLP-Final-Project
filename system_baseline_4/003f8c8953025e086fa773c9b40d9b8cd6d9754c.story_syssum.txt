WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A former middle-school student who was strip-searched by school officials looking for ibuprofen pain medication won a partial victory of her Supreme Court appeal Thursday in a case testing the discretion of officials to ensure classroom safety.
The justices concluded that the search was unreasonable but that individual school administrators could not be sued.
"I'm pretty excited that they agreed with me, they see that it was wrong for the school to do that," Redding said from her Hobbs, New Mexico, home after the ruling was announced.
During an investigation into pills found at the school, a student told the vice principal that Redding had given her prescription-strength 400-milligram ibuprofen pills.
A strip search was conducted by Wilson's assistant and a school nurse, both females.
"The strip search was the most humiliating experience I have ever had," Redding said in an affidavit.
With the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, Redding and her family sued, and a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled against the school, calling the search "traumatizing" and illegal.
"And, common sense is not a judicial monopoly or a constitutional imperative."
In 1985, the high court allowed the search of a student's purse after she was suspected of hiding cigarettes.
"When parents send their kids to school, they can now breathe a sigh of relief they will not end up naked before school officials," Wolf said .
Redding, now 19, said she has never gotten over her experience.
She is attending college.
