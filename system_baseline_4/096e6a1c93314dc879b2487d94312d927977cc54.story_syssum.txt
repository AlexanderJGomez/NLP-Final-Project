Sometime in the next year, Cook will sit down for a cup of mud with someone who has paid at least $210,000 for the privilege.
Proceeds from the auction will go to The RFK Center for Justice and Human Rights, an international nonprofit founded as a memorial to Robert F. Kennedy by his family and friends.
The coffee chat will happen at Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters.
Other celebs taking part in the auction for the RFK Center include Robert DeNiro, Alex Trebek, Carrie Underwood, Peyton Manning, William Shatner and David Letterman.
For one, there will be no live-tweeting.
No word on whether Cook will pick up the tab for the coffee.
