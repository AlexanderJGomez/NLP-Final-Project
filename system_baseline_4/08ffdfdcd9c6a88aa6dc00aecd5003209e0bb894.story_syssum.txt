(CNN)Talk show host Dr. Mehmet Oz is defending himself against a group of doctors who accuse him of "manifesting an egregious lack of integrity" in his TV and promotional work and who call his faculty position at Columbia University unacceptable.
I will address this on the show next week."
The email sent to Columbia's faculty dean for Health Sciences and Medicine, Dr. Lee Goldman, said the group is "surprised and dismayed" that Oz is on faculty and that he holds a senior administrative position.
The doctors argue in their emailed letter that Oz shows "disdain for science and for evidence-based medicine, as well as baseless and relentless opposition to the genetic engineering of food crops."
The FDA disputed the findings and said the report was misleading and irresponsible.
Miller and the other doctors who signed the email echo that sentiment, saying Oz is misleading the public and they tell Columbia's Goldman that having him on the faculty is unacceptable.
Orlando, Florida, anesthesiologist Dr. Shelley Fleet told CNN when she received an email from Miller inviting her to sign the email to Columbia, she said of course.
He told CNN he does not have a vendetta against Oz.
For its part, Columbia University is standing by Oz.
A cardiac surgeon, Oz came to Columbia for his residency after medical school in 1986 and rose through the ranks.
Oz rose to fame after frequent appearances on "The Oprah Winfrey Show" led to the creation of his own show and magazine.
