I want to surf better in 10 years.
For Slater, it's a journey that began as a child growing up in the surfing town of Cocoa Beach, in Florida.

"Surfing is my religion, if I have one," he said.
Some guys say it's like being in the womb.
"This section came at me, and I just launched myself, kind of a 'Hail Mary,'" said Slater.
Life's worth experiences and it's worth the people in your life too," he said.
"Big waves are a whole different ball game," said Slater.
Slater has been chasing waves his whole life.
That's what we do.
