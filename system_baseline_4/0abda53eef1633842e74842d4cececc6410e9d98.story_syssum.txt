The remains of Tina Herrmann, 32, her 10-year-old son, Kody Maynard, and her 41-year-old friend Stephanie Sprang were found in trash bags placed in the hollow of a tree, Knox County Sheriff David Barber said.
Matthew Hoffman, 30, who lives in the home where Sarah Maynard was found, provided the information that led to the discovery of the three bodies, Barber said.
A judge on Tuesday set a $1 million bond for Hoffman, who is accused of keeping Sarah bound and gagged in his basement, authorities said.
Barber said earlier this week that authorities were fortunate to find Sarah, but he said blood evidence found in Herrmann's home coupled with the amount of time the three have been missing had made the situation more serious.
said Barber.
But, in the end, the crucial information came down to Hoffman, Barber said.
We became close to the victims' families," Barber said Thursday.
When asked whether the incident was a home invasion, Barber said it was not, but added that "either they knew Hoffman or Hoffman made himself known to them."
A Dairy Queen manager went into the home on November 11 and found blood inside, Barber told the station.
He just climbed trees and watched us," she said about Hoffman.
