On February 16, Republicans in the House of Representatives held a hearing designed to undermine President Barack Obama's decision to guarantee women free access to contraception health care regardless of their workplace.
We all have the right to disagree and fight for our beliefs.
Mitt Romney, a front-runner in the Republican primaries, has expressed support for life at conception legislation that could outlaw common forms of contraception, which would adversely affect many women.
But contraception isn't just a basic health care issue for women, it's also an economic issue.
Today, many women pay $15 to $50 a month for contraception, even with insurance.
Does this man have no wife, daughter or sister?
I respectfully ask members of Congress to not be blinded by the desires of a small but vocal anti-contraception community that could put the physical and financial health of millions of American women and families on the line.
