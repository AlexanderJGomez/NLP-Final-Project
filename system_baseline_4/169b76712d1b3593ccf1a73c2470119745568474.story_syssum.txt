Mexico City stores, such as this supermarket, can no longer give out non-biodegradable plastic bags.
Mexico City becomes the second large metropolitan area in the Western Hemisphere to outlaw the bags.
Bans and other restrictions on plastic bags are in place in several countries.
Ireland reported cutting use of the bags by 90 percent after imposing a fee on each one.
The bags are the greatest form of litter on the globe's oceans, the U.N. agency said in a recent report.
Mexico City, which has had some of the worst air pollution in the world, also is looking at improving its environment in other ways.
