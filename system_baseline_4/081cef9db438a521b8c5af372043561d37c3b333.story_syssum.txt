Knight, 49, faces up to life in prison if convicted in the fatal hit-and-run.
Knight, who was out on bail in a separate robbery case, is charged with with one count of murder, one count of attempted murder, two counts of hit-and-run with an allegation that he committed a serious and violent felony while out on bail, the district attorney's office said in a statement.
Knight turned himself in to Los Angeles Sheriff's Department investigators early Friday.
Shortly afterward, Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions.
That prison time -- along with Shakur's death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others -- contributed to the label's bankruptcy in 2006.
