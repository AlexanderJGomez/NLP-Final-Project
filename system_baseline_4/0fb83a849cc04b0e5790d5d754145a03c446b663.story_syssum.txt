The case of Chandra Levy, a 24-year-old Washington intern whose body was found in a Washington park in 2002, is back in court, but the actions of a D.C. Superior Court judge have given it a mysterious air.
When the sealed issues are discussed during the hearings, the lawyers and judge speak at the judge's bench, and observers in the courtroom cannot hear the conversations.
Carome predicted the secrecy surrounding hearings in the Levy case could last months.
Despite Fisher's restrictions on information, CNN has learned some key details of these unexpected hearings from Carome and court papers.
Armando Morales, a convicted felon and former gang member, testified at Guandique's trial that Guandique confessed to him in jail that he killed Levy.
Two women testified that Guandique attacked them in the same park.
The Levy case generated a swarm of media coverage in 2001 and 2002, in part because it was revealed that she had had an affair with Gary Condit, then a U.S. congressman from California.
Condit testified at Guandique's trial and denied involvement in her disappearance and murder and was never charged.
