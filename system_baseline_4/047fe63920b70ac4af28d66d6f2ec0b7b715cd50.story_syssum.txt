Italy is releasing 500 million euros ($720 million) "to give further support to our Libyan friends," Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said.
Frattini said he would propose the appointment of the new Italian ambassador to Libya at Thursday's council of ministers meeting.
Debates are set to include the freeing of Libyan assets and what a United Nations mission to Libya would entail, U.S. and Western diplomats said Wednesday.
The diplomats will also discuss helping Libya restore basic services and get the oil industry running again.
