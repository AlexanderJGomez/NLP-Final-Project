On Saturday night, the bodies of the children -- Jaelen, 13, and Faith, 10 -- were found in a hotel in Santa Ana, California.
Her ex-husband, Mark Edge, is hospitalized at the VA hospital in Decatur, Georgia, his attorney Marian Weeks said.
Under the order, she was meant to hand the two children over to her ex-husband at Cobb County Police Headquarters in Georgia.
Marilyn Edge, from Scottsdale, Arizona, has been charged with two felony counts of special circumstance murder in the deaths of the two children, the Orange County District Attorney said.
If convicted, she faces a minimum sentence of life in state prison without the possibility of parole.
