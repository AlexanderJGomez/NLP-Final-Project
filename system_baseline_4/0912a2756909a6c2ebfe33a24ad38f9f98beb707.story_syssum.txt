Recent research from Trusteer, an internet security firm, indicates that mobile users may be three times more likely to fall victim to e-mail phishing attempts.
Also, recent statistics from Nielsen indicate that U.S. mobile users spend more time on their phones doing e-mail than using Facebook.
Mobile users typically arrive first after the phishing e-mails are sent out.
In a Marketplace Tech Report interview, internet security expert Anup Ghosh warned that one of the most insidious parts of e-mail phishing is that the fake alert e-mail might actually say the company is notifying you in response to a recent publicized security breach -- that is, the one they perpetrated.
Mobile users are three times more likely than desktop users to enter login information.
3. iPhone users are eight times more likely than BlackBerry users to access phishing sites.
Boodaei speculates that many BlackBerry users are business users who were issued their BlackBerry by their employer, ostensibly with at least some security training.
So remain vigilant.
But if you do click a link in an e-mail, make sure you never enter personal information on the resulting website.
Just make sure you don't just call whatever phone number is listed in the e-mail message.
