Saleh has threatened to withdraw all members of his party from the national government and warned the prime minister he could face imprisonment.
Tension has escalated between Saleh and the new regime after new President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi said he was planning major reforms, said Yahya al-Arasi, Hadi's spokesman.
"Saleh informed the prime minister to take orders from him or else he will take him to prison," the aide said.
He will announce the formation of a new unity government if Saleh orders his party officials to step down from their posts.
Saleh is still the president of the largest party in the country and must be treated with respect," said a senior GPC aide who asked to remain anonymous.
The GPC have to choose between joining the government under President Hadi or standing with a person who lost all legitimacy to power in Yemen," Qahtan said.
