(CNN) -- Facebook is expanding its Gift feature to include plastic gift cards that carry balances for multiple stores and restaurants.
The cards will be rolling out gradually for Facebook users in the United States.
The recipient can monitor the balances on their card from the Facebook app (but they can't move the money between vendors, no matter how much they would rather have mascara than pasta).
It also offered gift cards for specific vendors such as Starbucks and iTunes.
The new product falls somewhere between store-specific cards and bank-issued open gift cards that can be used almost anywhere credit cards are accepted.
Choosing cards from specific vendors like a favorite coffee spot or clothing store can be slightly more personal than a Visa card to be used anywhere.
With this card you can mix and match stores.
A Facebook spokesperson said the company had nothing to share about how it will make money off the Card service.
