(CNN) -- Sergio Garcia, a 36-year-old undocumented immigrant in California, has held two lifelong dreams: to become a U.S. citizen and to practice law.
Garcia says that this an easy initial response to make but that looking at the details of his case, it is not so clear-cut.
If anyone feels frustrated the the situation, they should address it with the federal government, Garcia said.
Eight years later, at age 17, Garcia again returned to California with his parents and without documentation, though his father had obtained permanent resident status in the United States.
Asked why he didn't choose a different career or pursue other opportunities, Garcia said law was his singular focus.
Now that he has a law license, however, one thing that Garcia will not specialize in is immigration law.
