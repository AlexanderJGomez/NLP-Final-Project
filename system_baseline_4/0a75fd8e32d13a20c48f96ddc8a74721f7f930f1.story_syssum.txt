Do investors care whether Yellen is a woman?
Why?
Yet as influential as she may be, Yellen cuts a lonely figure in the global organogram of central banks, especially in Europe, where both the ECB and the Bank of England are currently bereft of girl power at the top of the tree.
A cursory glance at the Central Bank Directory shows just 12 of the world's 160 central banks had female governors last year.
Yellen is no ordinary women or economist.
If women can take on a mantle as big as that, surely it's time they had more of a say in the clubby world of monetary policy.
