(CNN) -- Environmental activist Erin Brockovich was in Kingston, Tennessee, on Thursday to speak with residents affected by a massive spill of coal sludge from a nearby coal-fired plant.
"They don't have the answers and they're very, very concerned," Brockovich said.
She said she will tour the site on the ground and from the air.
About 1.1 billion gallons of sludge, or ash mixed with water, spilled onto 300 acres from the plant located 40 miles west of Knoxville, Tennessee.
Brockovich said residents have sent her photos showing fly ash up to 2 feet deep in places.
TVA, the nation's largest public utility, promised to do whatever it takes to clean the spill in central Tennessee.
