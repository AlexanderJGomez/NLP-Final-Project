Voters head to the polls Wednesday for the first time since the violence-marred election in 2008 to choose between the 89-year-old incumbent and his arch political rival-turned-prime minister, Morgan Tsvangirai.
Zimbabwe did not invite Western observers to monitor the elections because of sanctions imposed on Mugabe and his top officials for rights abuses.
Zimbabwe's government has also arrested lawyers and members of organizations they see as threatening, according to Beatrice Mtetwa, a human rights lawyer based in Zimbabwe.
"Certainly in the last nine months we've seen a lot of civil society activists being arrested," Mtetwa told CNN's Christiane Amanpour last month.
Opposition party leaders and observers have called for postponement of elections, saying that more time is required to establish a transparent voting process.
Tsvangirai claimed that ballot papers cast in his favor during early voting for security services were discovered tossed in a bin.
There are fears that this election could descend into violence like the last election in 2008, which resulted in a runoff.
Regional leaders dismissed Zimbabwe's 2008 election as a sham, and the SADC pressured Mugabe to form a power-sharing agreement with Tsvangirai and his opposition Movement for Democratic Change.
Last week, Mugabe had a few words for critics of the upcoming election.
