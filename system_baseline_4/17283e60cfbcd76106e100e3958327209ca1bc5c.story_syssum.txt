Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Fidel Castro has never been accused of wanting for opinions, but the former Cuban leader's Tuesday commentary stumped many of his fellow citizens.
Castro's praising of yoga, which according to Granma, occurred at 2:40 p.m. on Monday, did not include whether Castro himself was a practitioner.
"Cuba has to be punished," Castro wrote that Deng said.
"The man" selling his soul for vodka was not identified, sparking a debate among Cubans, some thinking Castro meant former Russian President Boris Yeltsin, a reputed lover of the beverage.
Castro has not been seen publicly since March,when video was shown of him meeting with Pope Benedict XVI during the pontiff's visit to Cuba.
"But it's clear even if Fidel Castro is no longer in the limelight, he is not ready to stop talking just yet."
