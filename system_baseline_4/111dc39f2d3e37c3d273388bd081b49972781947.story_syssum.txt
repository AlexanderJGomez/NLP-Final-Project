(CNN) -- More than 12,000 California prison inmates are now taking part in a hunger strike launched to demand better conditions and a reduction in the use of solitary confinement, corrections officials and organizers said Thursday.
"I would say if the demands have been met, they wouldn't be going on a hunger strike," said Kamau Walton, a member of the Prisoner Hunger Strike Solidarity Coalition.
The Corrections Department said the strike is organized by prison gangs and that inmates will face disciplinary action for taking part.
Since then, more than 300 "Security Housing Unit" inmates have either been transferred back to the general population or are taking part in a program to gradually return them there, it said.
