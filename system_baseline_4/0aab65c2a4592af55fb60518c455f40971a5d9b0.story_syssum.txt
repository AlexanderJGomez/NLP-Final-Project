More than 400 tribal gunmen took over Taiz in southwest Yemen, witnesses there said.
Meanwhile, President Ali Abdullah Saleh was in Saudi Arabia Tuesday, recovering from burns over 40% of his body and a collapsed lung, a U.S. government official briefed on the matter said.
Saleh was wounded Friday in an attack at his presidential compound.
At least 15 people were killed in Abyan Monday night and Tuesday morning in clashes between Islamic militants and security forces, according to a security source in Abyan.
A man trying to cross into Yemen from Saudi Arabia early Tuesday fatally shot two security officers and wounded another, the state-run Saudi Press Agency said Tuesday.
Yemeni investigations are "focusing on what happened inside the mosque," not a rocket or mortar attack, diplomats said Monday.
The official, who asked not to be identified, said that Saleh was in the mosque when two "projectiles" were fired during Friday prayers.
"The Yemeni people will do all in their power to not allow Saleh to re-enter the country," Joint Meeting Parties spokesman Mohammed Qahtan said Sunday.
A U.S. government official said Monday he could not imagine the Saudis letting Saleh return.
The Yemeni government has had a "big impact on acquiring information on AQAP," the official said, referring to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.
