Joining Friedman and fiance Chris Chapman will be between 100 and 120 family members and their closest friends, witnesses to the couple's can-do spirit.
Wednesday was a day of continued wedding preparations for Friedman, 25, of Knightdale, North Carolina, just east of Raleigh.
Friedman and Chapman, a middle school science teacher, were to wed June 27, 2010.
"It was just spontaneous horseplay," said Friedman, a former dance and aerobics dancer.
"We're there for each other," Friedman said.
Chapman and Friedman put off the wedding during her initial rehabilitation and while they tried to figure out medical coverage.
After CNN wrote about the couple and HLN's Vinnie's Politan interviewed Friedman, a wedding and honeymoon planning company approached the couple.
Chapman and Friedman will exchange vows at 11 a.m. Friday at Fearrington Village in Pittsboro, North Carolina.
"It's perfect," she said of the nuptial plans.
Carol Friedman and Rachelle's 32-year-old brother help her during the week while Chapman is at work.
"We're definitely built to last," Chapman said in November.
A page on a website called CaringBridge.org features photos of Friedman and has a guestbook full of best-wishes entries.
The Walking With Anthony Foundation is covering the costs for Rachelle and Carol Friedman, said Gigi Betancourt, client services manager at Project Walk.
"Rachelle is a very motivated person," said Miranda Strider-Allen, program director at Resources for Seniors, where Friedman helped provide services to Wake County senior and disabled adults.
"My hope is she finds her new niche in life," Carol Friedman said of her daughter.
