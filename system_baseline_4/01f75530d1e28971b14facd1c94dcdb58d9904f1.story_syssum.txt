(CNN) -- HTC's new flagship smartphone, the One, is an impressive bit of hardware and a big step forward for the company in three significant ways.
Although the phone carries the branding established last year with the One X, One S, and other HTC phones, the One amounts to a reboot of the company's vision for Android.
"We think about the One X and we think 'Wow, it was big, and it was one of the best phones we've ever done,'" Scott Croyle, HTC's vice president of design, said.
And there's a focus in the new Sense on making things that users commonly do easier and more intuitive — such as sifting through social media and news apps, or snapping photos and video.
So, for the One, we really had to get it right, we really had to just go for it."
While it's easy to see the chamfered edges found on the One and think of the iPhone 5, the One is far from a copycat product.
While the One won't replace your Jambox anytime soon, its onboard speakers sound immensely better than anything we've heard from a phone.
The One will also sports a beefed up camera, with a ton of photo and video features — which are so plentiful we've written a separate story focusing on the One's camera.
Along with all new hardware, HTC is using the One to introduce an all new take on Android.
And the app can be connected to Twitter, Facebook, Flickr and other social networks as well.
While BlinkFeed is a pre-installed app, it's also the default view any One user will see once they unlock their phone.
"But, everybody's snacking on information, whether it's from their social networks or some news source that they're just interested in.
The significance of this can't be overstated.
The fact that the One is joining it's biggest rivals in a new paradigm that bucks the idea of exclusive phones is a good thing for HTC — because they get to sell their best device in more places — and consumers — because you have more choice when you go to buy your next phone.
