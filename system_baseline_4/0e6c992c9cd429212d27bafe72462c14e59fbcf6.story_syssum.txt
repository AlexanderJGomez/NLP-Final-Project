Fritz Gelowicz appears in court on April 22 in Dusseldorf, northern Germany.
Schneider is also accused of attempted murder, the court said.
When Gelowicz, Schneider and Yilmaz were arrested, they were found with sophisticated and difficult-to-obtain detonators, authorities with knowledge of the arrests have said.
Gelowicz was a leading member of a radical Islamist center in Ulm in southern Germany and was well known to German authorities, officials said.
German authorities had said the three men trained at the group's camps in northern Pakistan.
The group is believed to have ties to al Qaeda.
