Video of two sisters in India fighting back against men who allegedly harassed them has gone viral.
The sisters tried to ignore the men but they persisted.
Two of the men grabbed the women, and they struggled to get free.
Aarti Kumar said that no one on the bus tried to help the sisters, and some passengers shouted for them to stop fighting the men and get off.
Kumar said her parents have been very supportive of her and her sister, also unusual because girls and women in some areas of India are often discouraged from reporting instances of harassment.
A gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman in New Delhi in late 2012 brought into stark relief the danger that some women face in India.
