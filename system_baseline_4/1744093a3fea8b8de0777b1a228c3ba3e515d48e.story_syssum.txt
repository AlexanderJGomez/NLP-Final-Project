The Wolong Giant Panda Reserve Center in southwest Sichuan province is home to about 86 giant pandas, who were reported safe Tuesday.
Staff and critters at neighboring Chengdu Panda Breeding and Research Center were also reported safe, according to a spokesperson for the Atlanta Zoo, which has two pandas on loan from the wildlife reserve.
Zobor said the WWF had confirmed the safety of staff members based in Beijing but had not received word on the conditions in Wolong.
David Wildt with the Smithsonian's National Zoological Park in Washington says scientists in Wolong have overcome threats to the giant panda population before.
In the late 1990s, the captive giant panda population was in decline, with more animals dying than were born, Wildt said.
They're not a complete substitute, but they meet the needs of a basic high-fiber diet," said Wildt, who has worked with two pandas that the Smithsonian has on loan from Wolong.
If the staff is fine, then the animals will be fine," Wildt said.
