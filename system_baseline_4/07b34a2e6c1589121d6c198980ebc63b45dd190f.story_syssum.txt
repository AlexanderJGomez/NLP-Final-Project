How has life changed for new dad Marc Lesser?
As even Prince William demonstrated in a recent interview with CNN, his first since the birth of his son George, modern dads are more and more involved and wouldn't have it any other way.
"I just thought I don't know if I am going to be any good at this," he said in between yawns.
I was changing diapers with no problem," he said.
Mom' is outdated
he said with a laugh.
"I was thrilled to tell her ... that the kid has all her fingers, all her toes," he said, describing his phone conversation with his wife.
Shankman said he wasn't worried at all about going solo, and bases his confidence on the logic that kids have been surviving for years without their parents' sterilizing bottles and everything else.
"There is something to be said for having a dad who is a complete geek," he joked.
Every father I spoke with said he did more of the child care -- and the housework -- than his dad and his grandfather did.
Lesser said that when older family friends come to visit, he thinks they're probably a bit surprised.
Shankman said he gets frustrated at the portrayal of dads as clueless and uninvolved.
he said.
In his interview with CNN, Prince William said a lot of things affect him differently now that he's a dad, and all the fathers I spoke with could completely relate.
"That's an adjustment, but the reward is better," he said.
