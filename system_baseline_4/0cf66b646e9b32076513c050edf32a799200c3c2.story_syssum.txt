England international Steven Gerrard was cleared by a court in Liverpool of affray.
Gerrard spoke of his relief outside the court.
In the fracas which followed, Gerrard admitted throwing three punches but said only one connected.
"The victim's consequential actions of reeling backwards and then forwards and your actions in response to that movement forward has to be seen against that background," he added.
They will be sentenced at a later date.
