"The political winds blow left and right, polls rise and fall, supporters come and go, but in the end, leaders are defined by the convictions they hold," Bush said at the ceremony for the George W. Bush Presidential Center.
Bush has said he is aware that the opening of his presidential library would reopen debates over the Iraq War and the policies he pursued after the September 11 terrorist attacks.
Bush kept his word and acted, Carter said.
"This is a Texas-sized party," Obama said.
"That's what President George W. Bush chose to do," Obama said.
In an interview with CNN's John King, the former president said he knows that the center's dedication will rekindle the debate about his presidency, and he conceded the library is in part an effort by him and supporters to influence history's verdict.
"You know, I'm really not that concerned about why people did what during my presidency," he said.
Made the best judgment calls I could.
As the son of another former president, Bush said he wouldn't mind seeing his brother Jeb Bush run for the highest office.
In addition to the library and museum, the Presidential Center includes the George W. Bush Institute, a public policy institute.
