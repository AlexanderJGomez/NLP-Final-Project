As many as 200 girls were abducted from their boarding school in northeastern Nigeria by heavily armed Boko Haram Islamists who arrived in trucks, vans and buses, officials and witnesses said.
"Many girls were abducted by the rampaging gunmen who stormed the school in a convoy of vehicles," said Emmanuel Sam, an education official in Chibok.
They left with us in a convoy into the bush," said the student, who declined to be named for security reasons.
At one point, one of the trucks broke down and the girls on that vehicle were transferred to another one, the student said.
In a clip released by the group March 23, leader Abubakar Shekau threatened to launch raids and abduct girls from schools.
