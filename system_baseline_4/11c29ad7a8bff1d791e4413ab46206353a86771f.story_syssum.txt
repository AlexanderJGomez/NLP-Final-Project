Berry's case had been publicized through the years, and when Georgina DeJesus was reported missing, her case, too, became known to the public.
Last seen: walking home from a job at Burger King a few blocks from her home about 7:40 p.m., according to the FBI.
Clues: She called her sister to tell her she was getting a ride home, CNN affiliate WJW reported.
On the call, Berry also said that the 6-year-old girl also freed Monday was her own daughter.
Age: 14 when she was reported missing; now, 23.
"I thought it was a dream," Ricardo DeJesus said of his sister being found.
A sister, Mayra DeJesus, said Gina spent Tuesday with her family -- with the focus on her, but not so much what she'd gone through.
Age: 21 when she was reported missing; now 32, according to the Cleveland Police Department.
But the missing woman's mother, Barbara Knight, told the newspaper that her daughter would never have broken all contact voluntarily.
Law enforcement action: The FBI website makes no mention of her.
