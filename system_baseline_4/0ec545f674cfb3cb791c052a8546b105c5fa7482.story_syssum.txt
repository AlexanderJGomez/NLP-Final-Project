The transfer window is a set period of time when football clubs are allowed to buy new players.
The English Premier League pre-season transfer window opened at midnight on the last day of the season (May 24) and will close on August 31, while in the other big European football nations (including France, Germany Italy and Spain) the transfer window opens on July 1 and closes at the end of August.
The transfer window can see some of football's biggest stars switch club and it is a period that can determine how a team will fare during the season ahead.
This summer's transfer window is likely to be dominated by one club -- Real Madrid.
Their newly elected club president, billionaire construction magnate Florentino Perez, previously headed the club between 2000 and 2006, when his policy was to bring football's biggest names to Real Madrid.
Then there is Manchester City, funded by the vast oil wealth of the Abu Dhabi United Group.
