(CNN) -- "Our Nixon" is mostly comprised of Super 8 home movies made by three of President Nixon's closest aides: H.R.
But how they ended up in the Nixon Library, why they are in the public domain, and what happened when we found out there were multiple copies of the whole collection (of widely varying quality!)
But the home movies took an unexpected path during the Watergate investigation, when the FBI confiscated the contents of Ehrlichman's office, including a box of a duplicate set (copies) of the home movies.
When Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, he arranged to have his presidential papers sent to his home in San Clemente, California, assuming that they were his personal property.
Congress was concerned that Nixon would destroy papers relevant to the Watergate investigation, so it passed the Presidential Records and Materials Preservation Act of 1974 ("PRMPA"), 44 U.S.C.
While the Supreme Court ultimately upheld the PRMPA, it did not determine whether Nixon was entitled to compensation for his papers.
Nixon v. Adm'r of Gen. Services, 433 U.S. 425 (1977).
As a result of the PRMPA, Nixon's presidential papers became the property of the United States and were deposited in the National Archives.
Under the PRMPA regulations, purely personal material was removed from the home movies and returned to Haldeman, Ehrlichman and Chapin.
We paid for the National Archives to make standard definition video transfers of the preservation negative, and we began editing "Our Nixon" with these.
Since at the time the Nixon Library did not have a budget allocated to apply their standard 16mm inter-negative preservation technique to this collection, and since we desperately wanted to use it in our film, we proposed to pay for archival-quality digital scans.
We hired Jeff Kreines, inventor of the Kinetta film scanner, to travel to the Nixon Library and make the scans.
