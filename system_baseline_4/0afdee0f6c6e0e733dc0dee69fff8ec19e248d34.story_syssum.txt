(CNN) -- Brandt Snedeker stepped up his bid to win the FedEx Cup playoffs with a superb six-under 64 at East Lakes Saturday to share the third round lead with England's Justin Rose at the Tour Championship.
I might need one and hopefully I have saved it for the last day."
Furyk, who won the FedEx Cup two years ago, looked set to share the lead with Snedeker and the consistent Rose, but ran up a triple bogey on the 18th after finding the water.

I would trade him, but obviously that's the position I'm in."
