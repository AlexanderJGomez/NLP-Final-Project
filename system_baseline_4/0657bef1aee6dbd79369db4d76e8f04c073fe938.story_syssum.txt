But is the Uber story really as good as it seems?
In contrast, Uber has embraced a take-it-or-leave-it approach that may be tough for consumers to swallow over the long haul.
This adds up to Uber being a welcome disruption, blowing competition and free market pricing into the regulated taxi industries that don't always serve the interests of consumers.
According to its Terms & Conditions agreement, Uber is not a transportation service.
The car drivers are Uber's actual customers.
Surprisingly, Uber does not claim to "assess the suitability, legality or ability" of any third party providing services procured through Uber, and UberX drivers may not be professionally licensed or permitted.
I am sure there are fellow riders who, like me, take issue with the company not disclosing their passenger rating in the Terms & Conditions or privacy policy for the app.
And, again, I may not be alone feeling more than a little uncomfortable asking my driver for my rating.
In addition to the security of corporate data, there is the issue of whether individual drivers have access to personal passenger information and how Uber protects riders from unauthorized breaches.
Consumers both love and fear disruptive companies like Uber.
For Uber to get the value of its disruption, in the form of consumer goodwill, people will need to know why Uber-instigated changes in the taxi industry are good, not bad.
That suggests being more transparent, protective, inclusive and explanatory about your business and the impact of your actions on their safety, privacy and overall riding experience.
But the jury may still be out with consumers.
I happen to love Uber.
Otherwise, down the road, a competitor might more easily turn my head: one that delivers exactly what they promise me.
