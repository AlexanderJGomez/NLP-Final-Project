And an affluent Atlanta neighborhood up in arms over a possible new neighbor.
Amid rumors that pop star Justin Bieber was considering a move to Atlanta, the Regular Guys, a morning show on Atlanta radio station Rock 100.5, put together a fake neighborhood group and pulled the wool over the eyes of the world's news organizations.
The Regular Guys' Tim Andrews played the role of Harold White, becoming the face of the fictitious protest, doing interviews with CNN, the BBC and a host of other news outlets.
It warned that "Justin Bieber's relocation to Atlanta can be nothing but bad for our children, as well as the community.
"That's a big win," Wachs said of the prank.
As the prank swirled, no one in Bieber's camp commented on the rumored move, which began with a TMZ report.
There had been numerous Bieber sightings across the Atlanta area: skating rinks, a fast-food restaurant and a nightclub.
CNN's Susanna Capelouto and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.
