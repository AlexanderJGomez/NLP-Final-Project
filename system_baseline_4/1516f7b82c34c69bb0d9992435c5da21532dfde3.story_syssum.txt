Singer-songwriter Regina Spektor has just released her third album.
And in the music video for her peppy song "Dance Anthem of The '80s" she gets her face so close to the camera that at times you think she's going to gobble it up.
Watch an interview with Regina Spektor Â»
"It was just very, very trippy."
Regina Spektor: Yeah.
I try not to.
Spektor: I'm not really thinking that much of anything.
But I just love the fun of it.
It was a time of big, fast spenders and people who just didn't really think about the consequences of their greed.
Spektor: No.
I like things that are just all over the place.
Spektor: Yeah, but I wouldn't say that's a good thing.
It's how I forget a lot of stuff.
Spektor: I feel that feeling all the time that I need to record before I forget it.
Spektor: Well (with) some of them I'm very involved.
Spektor: No I've never been that not involved.
That was really cool because he had listened to the song and the video concept was his idea.
And I just got to come in and be directed more, be part of his take on a song, and that was really fun, too.
I don't know.
