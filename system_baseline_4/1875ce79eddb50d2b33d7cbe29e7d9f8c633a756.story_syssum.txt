(CNN) -- British TV host Piers Morgan said taking over for retiring Larry King is like replacing Frank Sinatra's Las Vegas show.
Morgan will replace King's longtime show with "a candid, in-depth newsmaker interview program," CNN announced Wednesday.
Morgan will be based in New York, but also will work from Los Angeles and London, CNN said.
"Larry King would be it," Morgan said.
I find him fascinating.
Morgan, 45, began his journalism career as a newspaper reporter in the United Kingdom for The Wimbledon News.
Morgan went on to become a television personality, hosting interview programs on the BBC and ITV.
Morgan also writes two regular columns for the Mail on Sunday newspaper, which he will continue.
