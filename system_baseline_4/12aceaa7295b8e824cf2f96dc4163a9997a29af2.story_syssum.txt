New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Close allies since the Soviet days, India and Russia marked the first decade of their strategic partnership with a slew of agreements at their annual summit Tuesday.
India and Russia share a robust collaboration in defense, with Moscow supplying more than 60 percent of military hardware to New Delhi.
At present, two nuclear power plants are being built in southern India with Russian assistance.
It is a partnership that has and will continue to develop independent of our relations with other countries," Singh remarked.
The two nations forged a strategic partnership in 2000 and have since been holding summits every year.
Medvedev's trip to New Delhi follows similar trade-promoting visits by U.S. President Barack Obama, France's Nicolas Sarkozy and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao.
