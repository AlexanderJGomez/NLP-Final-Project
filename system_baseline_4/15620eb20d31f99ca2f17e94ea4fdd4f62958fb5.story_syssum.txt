Treve became the third successive filly to win the $5.4 million Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in Paris on Sunday, following in the example of Solemia and Danedream, plus Zarkava in 2008.
I said to save her for today and he did," Head-Maarek said of Treve, which also won last month's Grade One warmup race to be only the sixth horse to complete that double.
She was wide the whole way and was traveling so easily the jockey just said he just let her go.
She had the worst possible race and yet won brilliantly.
"I was hoping she would stop, but she didn't.
I'm very sorry for the Japanese fans, owners and trainers who want to win this beautiful race and keep finishing second."
