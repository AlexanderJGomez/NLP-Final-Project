On Wednesday, Hinckley's lawyers said he is not dangerous and should eventually be released.
In opening statements, prosecutor Sarah Chasson said Secret Service agents will testify they performed surveillance on Hinckley without his knowledge earlier this year when he was allowed what he was told was unsupervised free time in Williamsburg.
Hinckley's attorney, Barry Levine, said the issue is not whether Hinckley has sometimes been deceptive but whether he is dangerous.
Since 1999, Levine said, Hinckley has been taking a drug called Risperdal.
Jones said Hinckley had been diagnosed years ago as suffering from depression and from an unspecified psychotic disorder.
Jones said he has interviewed Hinckley but has not treated him.
A September filing by prosecutors said Hinckley "continues to be deceptive regarding his relationships with and interest in women."
Currently, Hinckley is allowed to visit his mother 10 days a month.
After the judge and all the lawyers were in place, Hinckley, now 56, entered the court wearing a brown sports jacket, dark pants and a striped tie.
Prosecutors want to cross-examine Hinckley and his defense lawyers oppose that.
On March 30, 1981, Hinckley waited for President Reagan to leave a Washington Hotel after a speech.
Hinckley, who was 25 at the time of the shooting, was enamored of actress Jodie Foster.
