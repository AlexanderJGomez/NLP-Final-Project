Now, 19 months after marrying Prince William, the couple has given the country -- and the Commonwealth -- another reason to celebrate.
Both were studying art history when they met, but Catherine is said to have played a key role in encouraging the prince to switch to a degree in Geography in his second year.
The students grew closer after moving into a shared house with two other friends and were said to have started dating in late 2003.
She has been out shopping in stores and they run into the stores after her.
The split was said to be amicable with the couple determined to remain friends.
Royal commentators speculated that the split was due to the class divide between the prince and his middle-class girlfriend.
In July 2007, Catherine sat in the royal box at Wembley Stadium in London for the Concert for Diana, a massive charity concert to remember Prince William's mother, Princess Diana, 10 years after her death in a car crash.
Wedding fever gripped the UK as royal-watchers and the general public speculated for months about what Catherine would wear, her hair and the scale of the event in a country entrenched in austerity measures.
Then finally, on April 29, 2011, Catherine married Prince William in a televised ceremony at Westminster Abbey in London, becoming Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cambridge, before an audience of millions.
The Duchess of Cambridge was last seen in public during an official tour to Cambridge, England last week, when there was more talk about her new hairstyle than any speculation of pregnancy.
Prince William and Catherine's child will be next in line to the throne after William regardless of whether it is a boy or a girl, the British Cabinet Office said Monday.
