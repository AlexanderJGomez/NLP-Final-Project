He offered to obtain a kidney for an undercover FBI agent and a confidential witness working for authorities, the criminal complaint says.
The undercover FBI agent told Rosenbaum one of her uncles needed a kidney because he had been on dialysis for two years and on a transplant list at a Philadelphia hospital, the complaint says.
"I'm doing this a long time," the complaint says Rosenbaum told the two agents.

According to the complaint, the undercover FBI agent called a person who was the recipient of a kidney brokered by Rosenbaum, who had provided the telephone number as a reference.
The person, a New Jersey-area resident identified in the complaint as Recipient 2, had paid cash for the kidney a little more than a year before the February 2009 call.
"I prefer you do it with cash," the complaint quotes Rosenbaum as saying.
