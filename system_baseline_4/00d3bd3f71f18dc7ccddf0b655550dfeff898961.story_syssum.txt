(CNN) -- All five remaining inmates held in the Mississippi pardons controversy have now been released from prison.
In a statement after the court ruling, Barbour said it "reaffirmed more than a century of settled law in our state," but acknowledged that his decision has been difficult for many of the inmates' victims.
"We do respect the decision of the Court, but feel deeply for how it must weigh on the victims and their families.
Barbour has defended his pardons and said the former inmates had been rehabilitated.
