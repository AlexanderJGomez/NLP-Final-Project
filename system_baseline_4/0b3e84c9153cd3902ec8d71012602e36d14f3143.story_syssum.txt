(CNN) -- Oklahoma State University women's basketball coach Kurt Budke and assistant coach Miranda Serna were killed when their plane crashed on the way to a recruiting trip in Arkansas, university officials said Friday.
Budke and Serna were on a recruiting trip to Little Rock, Arkansas, the university said.
University officials credited Budke for turning the school's women's basketball program around, culminating with a top-10 national ranking and an appearance in the second round of the NCAA tournament last season.
Serna was also in her seventh season with OSU after coming to the school to work for Budke from Louisana Tech, where they both previously worked.
The school called off games scheduled for Saturday and Sunday, and grief counselors were on hand for athletes and staff, the university said.
The crash is the second fatal plane crash to strike the OSU basketball program in nearly 11 years.
