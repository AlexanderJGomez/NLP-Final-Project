It was a little tougher than the scoreline suggests," Lions head coach Warren Gatland said after the match in Hong Kong.
In the hot and sticky night air -- the temperature hovering around 30C in the windless Hong Kong Stadium -- the Lions ran in eight tries to one against the scratch team of internationals that last weekend had lost 40-12 to England.
Scottish fullback Stuart Hogg, the Lions' youngest player at 20, looked to get his tour off on a positive note but the beginning of a scything run a couple of minutes into the match was brought to juddering halt by a crunching tackle by Barbarians center Casey Lualala.
"From our point of view, the good thing is that Owen wasn't injured or knocked out, and from a rugby perspective I'm glad (Brits) wasn't sent off, it was just a yellow card, because it would have been less of a workout for us and the rugby as a spectacle," said Gatland.
Swinging arms aside, there was little of note to get the 28,643 spectators excited about in a slow-paced first half until Irish lock and match-day captain Paul O'Connell lunged over the line for the first try of the Lions tour.
O'Connell was pleased with the performance from a team that has only had a few weeks to bond.
For some of us being in camp for three weeks -- three weeks without a game is a long time, so it's great to get the tour started.
"Going forward I think these players that have played tonight have laid down a marker and the players that get picked and play against the Force they will know they will have to perform," the New Zealander said.
