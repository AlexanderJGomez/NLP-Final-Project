"It's like playing," Jamie Anderson said after winning gold in inaugural women's slopestyle snowboarding event in Sochi.
Slopestyle, which also has a ski discipline, is one of 12 new categories at 2014 Winter Games -- eight of which have their origins in extreme sports.
As is the idea of fun, which the winner of the men's slopestyle skiing event, Anderson's fellow American Joss Christensen, was keen to reference.
His comments underplayed the reality that the U.S. team annihilated the competition, claiming all three men's medals to end Canada's monopoly of freestyle golds at these Games.
"I hope I made my father proud," he said.
Did it for him."
Their main event, the X Games, is all about showing off new tricks in fairly relaxed, showbiz atmosphere.
"They found it (the competition) cool and now they wait for the party.
