(CNN)When Kyesha Smith Wood heard that her teen daughters were rude to another patron who asked them to be quiet at a local movie theater, she was furious.
The woman I'm looking for addressed them and asked them to be quiet and they were disrespectful," Wood wrote on her Facebook post.
The woman Wood was trying to reach is Rebecca Boyd, who saw the sheriff's department post and contacted her.
Glad they are learning a lesson.
I am so humbled by that."
