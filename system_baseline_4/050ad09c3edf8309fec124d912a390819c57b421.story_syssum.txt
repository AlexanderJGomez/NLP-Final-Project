(CNN) -- Whoever is running the social media strategy for the New York Police Department needs to be fired because that person has no idea how to follow the rules of social media.
Instead of igniting a positive viral PR campaign, a single tweet managed to set the NYPD's reputation on fire.
Social media disasters are becoming a regular occurrence.
Twitter users are the youngest demographic of all major social media outlets.
If you need to control the conversation, use Facebook.
On Twitter, the users are in control.
People on social media are ruthlessly honest, way more so than they would be in person.
It's better to monitor your reputation on Twitter using reputation management software and reply directly to people who tweet bad things about you.
If you want to use social media to promote a brand, either use the rules to pick the right platform and own the conversation or social media will own you.
Unfortunately, common sense, safe driving and social media rules are a lot like deodorant, the people who need it the most don't use it.
