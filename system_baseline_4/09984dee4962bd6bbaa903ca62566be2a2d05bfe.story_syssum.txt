Yet there was brush-fire-level rage on and off the Internet -- see #OscarsSoWhite -- following Thursday morning's announcement of this year's Academy Award nominations over the fact that "Selma," the critically acclaimed drama about Martin Luther King Jr.'s epochal campaign for voting rights in the South, received only two Oscar nods, one of them for best picture.
A depiction of African Americans in shameful, soul-depleting captivity is one thing; African Americans organized in open rebellion against their oppressors is very much another.
It's much harder to think of a Hollywood movie in which African Americans are depicted as the active agents of their own salvation.
It may have been bad timing, as the movie's nationwide release only took place last weekend.
And however the chatter has leaned on "Selma," those who support the movie should be grateful that there is chatter at all carrying the movie to the finish line.
That best picture nomination could very well become a best picture win.
