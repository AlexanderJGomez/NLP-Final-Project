Cairo (CNN) -- Predawn gunfire and clashes from a violent military crackdown on protesters in Cairo's Tahrir Square on Saturday left Egyptians feeling shocked, confused and angered in the hours that followed.
It is not clear whether or not they were troops engaged in the crackdown -- or whether they were some of the 15 uniformed army officers and soldiers who defied direct orders by joining a protest of tens of thousands of demonstrators in Tahrir Square on Friday.
Egyptian military confirmed that one person died from a gunshot wound overnight and that 42 people were detained, including three foreigners.
Essam said activists tried to help the dissenting military personnel to escape the crackdown by dressing four of them as civilians.
Late Friday, activists were seen confronting two military officers who tried to approach the square's central traffic circle.
The clashes came a day after large crowds of protesters amassed at Tahrir Square, many of them angry with Egypt's new military rulers.
On Friday, some soldiers joined the protests in a direct challenge to Egypt's military rulers.
That's why we are here today," one of the protesting officers said during the Friday protests.
Tempers flared at one point between soldiers and citizens outside the gates of the Egyptian Museum, which has been used in past months as a detainment center by the Egyptian military.
In scenes reminiscent of street protests last January and February, activists have once again blocked entry into Tahrir, using coils of barbed wire apparently left behind by the military.
