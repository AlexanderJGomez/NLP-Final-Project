London (CNN) -- Monkeys and bananas.
"Bananas grown for human consumption are full of sugar and calories, and bear no relation to fruit grown organically," said zoo spokesman Philip Knowling.
"Sweet and juicy bananas are good for humans but not for monkeys," Knowling said.
The zoo has seen "definite changes" in the monkey's behavior since the bananas were slowly withdrawn from their diet, Knowling said.
Zoos are getting smarter in the way they feed their captive animals.
Knowling said there was no obvious sign that the monkeys were missing the fruit.
