The racial profiling was so prevalent in 2008 and 2009 that some TSA employees at the airport referred to their colleagues as "Mexican hunters," a Star-Ledger story based on the 2010 internal report said.
"The report said Mexican and Dominican passengers were singled out for scrutiny of their travel documents as an easy way to drive up the number of referrals by Newark's (behavior detection officer) unit so that it would appear productive," the newspaper said.
Several officers quoted in the report said they were directed to use racial profiling, but others said they had never witnessed the practice or been told to use it, the newspaper said.
A story published by the Star-Ledger Sunday said the newspaper had obtained the report, but did not disclose how.
At the time, the TSA told CNN no single behavior on the list would, by itself, ever be enough to draw increased security scrutiny.
An officer would only select a passenger for closer examination if they showed several signs of stress, fear or deception, the agency said.
