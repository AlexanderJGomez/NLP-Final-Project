Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (CNN) -- Oklahoma state Rep. Charles Key never bought the official version of what happened 15 years ago Monday at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building.
Key stands for many of the issues that attract Tea Party protesters to a rally on the Capitol steps: less government, lower taxes and more liberty.
"I couldn't believe that at all," Nance said.
"I have moved past it."
It's just the opposite, Key said.
Key warns that if there's another domestic terrorist attack like the one on the Murrah Federal Building, it will be the fault of the federal government.
Another proposal, HB 2810, the State Sovereignty Act, would have Oklahoma withhold federal excise taxes from Washington if the state legislature determines that the U.S. government has violated the Constitution.
He says no.
But time is running out for Key.
Even those who rail against the government.
