Conviction on the misdemeanor charge of driving without a license is punishable by up to a year in jail, said her lawyer, Jerome Lee.
Lee said that Colotl plans to appeal the verdict.
She spent more than a month in the Etowah Detention Center in Alabama.
But she was quickly arrested on a warrant for the Cobb County Sheriff's Office and released on $2,500 bail.
On Thursday, Lee said that other than completing college, his client's plans for the future are unclear.
