The justices aren't weighing the fate of the entire statute this time.
The health care law provides for the establishment of "exchanges" through which individuals can purchase competitively priced health insurance.
They say the IRS -- one of the agencies charged with implementing the law -- was wrong to offer tax credits to individuals who live in states that only have federally run exchanges.
If the court says the IRS rule is invalid, absent some kind of action by the states or Congress, more than 5 million individuals will no longer be eligible for the subsidies, shaking up the individual market.
But when only a few states acted, the IRS tried to "fix" the law and wrote a rule allowing subsidies for those living in states with state-run exchanges as well as states with federally run exchanges.
Congressional opponents of the ACA such as Republican Sens.
Verrilli said it was "abundantly clear" that some states would not establish their own exchanges and that if the challengers win, those living in states with federally facilitated exchanges would "face the very death spirals the Act was structured to avoid."
Enrollment for 2015 is still in progress, but in court briefs the government said that nearly 7 million customers have selected or been re-enrolled in a plan through a federally facilitated exchange and "coverage throughout the exchanges is expected to continue to increase substantially in the coming years."
Those living in states with their own exchanges would not be in danger of losing their subsidies as a result of a ruling against the government.
The crux of their argument is that if it were not for the tax credits for premiums, they could not afford health insurance and thus would be exempt from the individual mandate to purchase health insurance.
As things stand now, however, the government has not pressed the issue before the Supreme Court.
