Some members of Congress complained that Colbert's testimony before the House Immigration Subcommittee was undignified; others took issue with his invocation of Christian values.
But migrant workers suffer, and have no rights."
Caring for migrant farmworkers is one way that Christians today -- including Christian lawmakers -- should follow Jesus' example.
Why?
For decades, farmers have relied on migrant workers, primarily immigrants, to do this difficult but essential work.
Undocumented farmworkers are poorly paid, enjoy few rights and live in fear of deportation.
(Undocumented immigrants, of course, pay sales taxes, and many pay Social Security and income taxes, though they are ineligible for most public benefits.)
Immigration reform has been debated for years.
And yet, after 21 months on the job, the 111th Congress has failed even to seriously debate the issues.
By mischaracterizing immigration reform as amnesty and open borders (nothing could be further from the truth), pandering to voters' fears and prejudices, and putting short-term political gain ahead of the national interest, they have lost legitimacy in the minds of many.
