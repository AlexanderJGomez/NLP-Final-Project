Even before the ink on Ohio Gov.
John Kasich's signature on Senate Bill 5 had time to dry, public employee unions in Ohio and their allies began the process of gathering the signatures necessary to invoke a provision in the Ohio Constitution that allows legislation to be placed before the state's voters.
Why all this national interest in an Ohio issue?
Well, in Ohio, all politics is also national.
Republicans managed to capture the governor's mansion and every other statewide office, 13 of the state's 18 congressional seats (a gain of 5 seats), and a majority in the Ohio House of Representatives (they already controlled the Ohio Senate).
But if Senate Bill 5 was fueled as much by politics as by ideology, the approach may have backfired.
The fear now among Republicans is not only that Senate Bill 5 will be repealed, but that organized labor in Ohio will emerge from this victory newly energized and better positioned to achieve its goals.
The voters of Ohio, however, did not just vote against the amendment; they also voted against the Republican Party that was seen to have backed the measure.
Polls showing Senate Bill 5 losing by nearly the same margin as the 1958 right-to-work measure ought to be sending chills down the spines of Buckeye Republicans.
Since no one has been elected president in more than 50 years without winning Ohio, it may well be that vote to repeal Senate Bill 5 in Ohio helps determine who will be taking the presidential oath in January of 2013.
