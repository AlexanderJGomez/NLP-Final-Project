Bill Miller said.
Eight people were killed: Six on the eastbound bus; one of three occupants of the SUV, and the tractor-trailer driver, the Tennessee Highway Patrol said.
Twelve of the hospitalized victims -- including the two in critical condition -- are church members, Cruz said Thursday morning.
Miller said it wasn't clear exactly what happened to the bus tire, other than it malfunctioned or failed in some way.
Some people walked out of the bus on their own, but emergency personnel had to extricate others, Miller said.
