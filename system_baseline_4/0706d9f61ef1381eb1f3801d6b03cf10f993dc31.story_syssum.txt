"I feel horrible that Brian Dorian went through this," said Glasgow, adding that evidence at the time and identification in lineups merited the charges.
A forensic analysis of Dorian's home computer and its activity put Dorian at home at the time of the shootings, authorities said.
It's not fair," Jill Aggen, a friend of Dorian, told WLS.
Dorian, who according to WLS has been on medical leave for an injured shoulder the past year, was taken into custody Friday at his residence, said authorities.
The gunman killed one worker at the site and wounded two others, police have said.
Dahl told Lake County (Indiana) Sheriff's Detective Robert Martinez that the gunman approached him on his farm and started a conversation about bees before beginning to shoot.
