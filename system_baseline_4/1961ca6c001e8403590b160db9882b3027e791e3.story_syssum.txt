WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A lawsuit filed in California against Kellogg, Brown and Root on Wednesday alleges the company and its subcontractor were involved in a human trafficking plan that forced Nepali men to work against their will in Iraq.
"KBR has not yet seen the lawsuit so it is premature for us to comment at this time.
When the Nepali men arrived in Jordan, according to the lawsuit, the contractors took their passports and drove them into Iraq.
Twelve of the Nepali men were taken by the insurgents and later killed.
Handley says the other Nepali workers who were sent to Iraq with Gurung did not come forward for the lawsuit after they were eventually released from KBR.
The case garnered the attention of the Department of Defense Inspector General's office after a number of news reports about KBR involvement in trafficking.
However, the case led to increased awareness and enforcement of trafficking laws by the U.S. military.
