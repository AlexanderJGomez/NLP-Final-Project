The glasses can be adjusted to the right strength by the wearer without the need to visit an optometrist.
His self-refraction glasses mean people can correct their vision without needing an optometrist (see Fact Box).
Silver has been developing the glasses for over 20 years and continues to research the technology at the Center for Vision in the Developing World (CVDW) at the University of Oxford.
He told CNN that about 80 percent of those who try the glasses are able to correct their vision, but there are limitations.
"If I can train people from existing networks to dispense glasses, and they can spare one day each week or month to dispense the glasses, then they can see 50 to 100 people in a day -- and that's a way to reach a lot of people," White told CNN.
Silver estimates that one billion people in the developing world don't have access to the glasses they need, and he has said that he would like to see all of them wearing glasses by 2020.
Distribution is one problem, cost is another.
Silver says far more research is needed before those one billion people get their glasses, but he sees his self-refraction technology as a step toward that goal.
