Washington (CNN) -- Inside a tall, red-brick building in Alexandria, Virginia, there is a federal courtroom just waiting for admitted intelligence leaker Edward Snowden to show up.
That's why a guy in Snowden's position -- now a world away in Russia with a grant of temporary asylum -- has to think about his next move.
In a major victory, Snowden won temporary political asylum in Russia.
The down side for Snowden is that his asylum is limited.
Edward Snowden's father, Lon Snowden, hoped at first that there might be a way to arrange for his son to return to the United States.
Option 3: Extradition.
Why?
This could be a problem for Snowden.
"So in this case, the Russians could at any time -- they could have done it already, they could do it now -- they could stick him back on a nonstop flight to U.S. and say goodbye ... or to Hong Kong where Snowden was last."
And Snowden is traveling with a representative of WikiLeaks.
