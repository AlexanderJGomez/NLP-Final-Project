In New York on Monday morning, fresh off a performance for "Good Morning America" -- which he jokingly called "Very Early Morning America" -- the Wallflowers frontman said, "It's not like we were a band that broke up and got back together.
We lost the plot a bit, and we needed a break, so we took one.
The Wallflowers broke through in 1996 with the quadruple-platinum album "Bringing Down the Horse" before going on hiatus in 2007.
Reuniting gave them a new sense of direction, "like a reset button," Dylan said.
But I'm lucky.
And with the new songs added, "I don't think we sound like 1995 or 2002.
beat them to it, a claim Dylan laughs about.
"The Clash left a big impact on me," Dylan said, "and I feel like we came all this way because of them.
Most of album's other lyrics address love and spirituality, "but no more than before," Dylan said.
"There's no real narrative," Dylan said.
Dylan doesn't look down upon fabrication, even the more scandalous form that recently affected his father when journalist Jonah Lehrer was found to have made up quotes from the elder Dylan in his book "Imagine: How Creativity Works" and consequently lost his posts at The New Yorker and Wired.
To demonstrate, Dylan took a song from the new album at random -- "Constellation Blues" -- and came up with a viable interpretation of it on the spot, giving it a cosmic yet nonsensical meaning probably unintended when he wrote it.
It's not like three-minute pop songs fall out of the sky, but I think if you have to explain the song, it's not a good song.
And some songs defy explanation.
Dylan said.
