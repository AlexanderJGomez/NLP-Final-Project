(CNN) -- After more than seven hours of deliberations, jurors still haven't decided whether Jodi Arias will live or die.
Now, the jury is weighing whether Arias, 32, should get the death penalty.
The jury's decision must be unanimous for Arias to be sentenced to death.
It was a stark reversal from two weeks ago, when she told a journalist she preferred death to life in prison.
"One of my cousins really drove it home for me and told me how much it would affect them, if I did anything to myself," she said.
"Please don't give up; please don't give up," Arias said she told her.
Arias told jurors that she had been a victim of abuse as an adult and as a child.
She couldn't have imagined herself capable of such a grisly crime, Arias told the jury.
She told jurors Tuesday that she could teach people to read in prison and pledged to dedicate her life to good causes.
"I'm not going to become a mother because of my own terrible choices," she said.
"We're not talking about whether or not to convict.
Prosecutor Juan Martinez said pointing to Arias' artwork as evidence that her life should be spared wasn't a valid defense.
He argued that jurors should sentence Arias to death.
That November, he baptized Arias into the Mormon faith, a ceremony Arias said was followed by anal sex.
After her arrest, Arias told an elaborate lie about masked intruders breaking into Alexander's house and killing him before she narrowly escaped.
