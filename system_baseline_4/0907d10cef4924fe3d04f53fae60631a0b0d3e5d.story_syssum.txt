(CNN) -- A Sikh farmer in India has surpassed a month on a hunger strike, demanding the release of six men from his community jailed since the 1990s during a period of a deadly Sikh separatist movement in the country.
Those who support Khalsa's hunger strike say it is long overdue that the cases of those Sikhs be reviewed.
Phoolka said.
International rights groups have accused both the Sikh separatists and Indian forces of serious violations during the insurgency.
Khalsa is "weak but says he will not end (his hunger strike) until he sees those six prisoners free," his aide said.
It's my personal opinion all such prisoners â€” whichever community they may belong to â€” should be set free now," said Sukhdev Singh Bhaur, general secretary of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), the top Sikh religious administration in Punjab.
Rights attorneys, however, say authorities are selectively rejecting reviews of Sikh inmates incarcerated during the Punjab militancy.
"There were serious human rights abuses during the Punjab insurgency," the human rights group said.
"Despite the findings of independent commissions, government forces or officials responsible for excesses, including during the 1984 riots, are yet to be properly prosecuted," Human Rights Watch said in its statement.
So, I am not standing on any false prestige.
