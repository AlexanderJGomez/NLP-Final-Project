(CNN) -- The head of the company at the center of a toxic spill in Hungary has been arrested, accused of public endangerment and harming the environment, authorities said Monday.
"I ask the parliament to accept the proposal.
Meanwhile, an eighth victim of the sludge has been found, said Gyorgyi Tottos, an official with Hungary's emergency services department.
The area has been evacuated, and soldiers were on standby Sunday, an official said.
About 800 people have been evacuated from the village of Kolontar, leaving it essentially empty, she said.
If the wall collapses, 500,000 cubic meters of toxic red sludge could spill out.
Orban, the prime minister, who was visiting the stricken area Saturday, said it was "very likely" the reservoir wall will collapse.
But water test results released Friday indicated the sludge may not harm the Danube after all.
The pH, or acidity, level of the Danube water was 8.5 Friday -- slightly above normal but not dangerous and able to sustain life, Tottos said.
"What happened on Monday has never happened before in Europe, so we will see," she said, "and we will try to avoid a bigger new catastrophe."
The aluminum company, MAL Co., said in a statement Saturday it was doing its utmost "to avoid further damages and to reinforce the injured deposit."
Orban warned Saturday of the "toughest possible consequences" for those responsible for the spill and said human error was the cause.
Dust from sludge that dries may also pose a threat, Hungary's Interior Ministry has said.
It said some workers involved in damage cleanup may need filtering masks.
