At an enthusiastic gathering at Hollywood's El Capitan Theatre, Marvel chief Kevin Feige reeled off announcements for a new Captain America film, a "Guardians of the Galaxy" sequel and the two-part Avengers adventure.
"We're opening up an entire new corner of the (Marvel) cinematic universe: the mystical," Feige said.
"Strange" wasn't the only film to get a spot on the Marvel calendar.
In addition, Marvel announced a two-part "Avengers" film, "Avengers: Infinity War," due in 2018 and 2019.
"We wanted to do this at Comic-Con this year, and things were not set: 'Civil War' wasn't set; 'Guardians of the Galaxy' wasn't out yet."
he said.
However, Cumberbatch was a no-show.
In addition to his well-received "Sherlock" series, for which he won an Emmy this year, he's earned a great deal of Oscar buzz for his performance as cyberpioneer Alan Turing in "The Imitation Game," a drama about World War II codebreakers.
