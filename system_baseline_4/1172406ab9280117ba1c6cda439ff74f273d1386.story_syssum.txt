LONDON, England (CNN) -- DNA testing to try to identify hundreds of bodies buried in a mass grave during World War I will start this week, the British and Australian ministries of defense announced Monday.
"Each one of these soldiers will be laid to rest with the dignity they deserve and we owe it to them to do all we can to identify them," British Veterans Minister Kevan Jones said in a statement.
The announcement comes only a week after the burial of the last British veteran of World War I still living in the United Kingdom.
By morning, about 2,300 British and Australian soldiers were dead.
"It's the largest military find since the end of the Second World War," said a spokesman for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.
The British and Australian governments have asked people who think their relatives may have died at the site to get in touch, Francis said.
The bodies of more than 165,000 Commonwealth soldiers killed on the Western Front during the First World War are still missing, the commission says.
