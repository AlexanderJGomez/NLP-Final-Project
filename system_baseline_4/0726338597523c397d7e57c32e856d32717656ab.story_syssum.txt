Brad Pitt talks about "soul mate" Angelina Jolie, life, and fatherhood in Parade magazine.
These days, Pitt said he's happy with his decision to become a parent with partner Angelina Jolie.
"This family is full of life," Pitt said.
Pitt said his life is very different now that he is a dad.
He's found a "soul mate" in Jolie, Pitt said, but he insisted he meant what he has said in the past about not marrying her.
Pitt told Parade he takes exception to anyone trying to dictate how someone should live and who they should love.
People should be able to be happy, Pitt said, and that includes his children.
No, not one bit," he said.
I hope I teach my kids to be who they really are."
