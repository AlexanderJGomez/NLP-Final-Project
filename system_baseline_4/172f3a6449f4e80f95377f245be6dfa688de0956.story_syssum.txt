Glatzer died in Los Angeles on Tuesday after having ALS for four years, his publicist said.
In a Twitter post Wednesday, Westmoreland said he was devastated.
"Finally, to our filmmakers, Wash Westmoreland and Richard Glatzer, who had hoped to be here tonight, but they can't because of Richard's health," she said.
He said he wanted to make movies.
And that's what he did."
