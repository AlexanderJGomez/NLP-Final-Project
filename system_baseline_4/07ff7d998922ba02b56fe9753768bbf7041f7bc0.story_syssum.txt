What followed immediately afterward proved it, as a news helicopter tumbled to the ground and burst into flames, with those flames spreading to several parked cars in its path.
The two people aboard the helicopter died in the crash, and another person who'd been in one of the three vehicles that caught fire was critically burned, officials said.
"We want to understand what actually happened, so we can understand what we can do in the future to prevent this from happening," Mayor Ed Murray said.
The helicopter had just come from Covington, Washington, and was planning to head next to Renton, said Dennis Hogenson with the National Transportation Safety Board, which is leading the investigation.
Video showed what was left of the helicopter immersed in flames, as well as a line of fire in the street that engulfed several vehicles.
One man emerged from a car that was ablaze, with "his shirt ... in flames, his head ... bleeding," Gonzales said.
Gregg said the man may have helped reduce the severity of his injuries by rolling on the grass, extinguishing the flames.

"He always had a smile on his face," said anchor and reporter Molly Shen.

Ten tons of sand were dumped on the street to absorb the helicopter's fuel, with vacuum trucks later heading to clean up the site, said the mayor.
"What we have left is basically just a part of the tail and burnt-out metal from the main chassis of the helicopter," Moore said.
Hogenson, from the NTSB, said that his agency would issue a preliminary report in about five days and a full report -- including the probable cause of the crash -- within a year.
