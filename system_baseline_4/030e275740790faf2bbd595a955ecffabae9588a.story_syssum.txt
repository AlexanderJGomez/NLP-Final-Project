Bing published its most-searched news stories for 2012, and topping the list -- ahead of the presidential election, Superstorm Sandy and the London Olympics -- was the iPhone 5, the newest version of Apple's iconic smartphone.
Other tech news stories on Bing's list included the launch of Amazon's newest tablet, the Kindle Fire HD, and Facebook's public stock offering in May.
That's a big change from 2011, when no tech stories made Bing's most-searched list.

Reality TV star Kim Kardashian topped Bing's most-searched person rankings for the year, dethroning 2011 champ Justin Bieber.
Apple also dominated Bing's list of the year's most-searched consumer electronics, taking 5 of the 10 spots.
Fortunately for Microsoft, the company wasn't shut out of its own search results.
