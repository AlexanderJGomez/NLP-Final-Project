LONDON, England (CNN) -- When Danish auteur Lars von Trier presented his gothic thriller, "Antichrist" at Cannes Film Festival last month, it was greeted with cat-calls, jeers and, at times, disbelieving laughter.
Misogyny couldn't be further from the truth, according to Von Trier, who says he sees himself up there on the screen: "I mostly see myself as the female character," the 53-year-old director told CNN in Cannes.
Do you think that Lars von Trier is a woman-hater?
"I think that if you are, shall we say, sensitive, then there is a good side and a bad side about it," said von Trier.
He has been nominated for the top prize at Cannes, the Palme D'Or, a staggering eight times, winning once in 2000 for the harrowing operatic tragedy, "Dancer in the Dark," starring Icelandic musician, Bjork, who also took home the Best Actress prize that year.
Von Trier claimed each morning she would say "Mr von Trier, I despise you," and spit at him.
His friend and long-time collaborator, actor Stellan Skarsgard describes von Trier as "not uncomplex."
Brought up in Copenhagen by bohemian parents who were committed nudists, he suffers from crippling bouts of agoraphobia; and, most famously, a fear of flying.
But, von Trier says, he has always taken a deeply personal approach to the experimental, often dark and challenging works that he creates.
