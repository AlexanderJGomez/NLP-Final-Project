(CNN) -- Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard and opposition leader Tony Abbott moved their only televised election debate so they wouldn't clash with the finale of "MasterChef Australia" Sunday -- but their switch forced Kylie Minogue to change her schedule.
Channel 7, the network that shows "Dancing with the Stars," is known for its news coverage, so they had little choice but to cover the debate, the channel's head of programming told the Daily Telegraph.
She ousted Kevin Rudd as leader of Australia's Labor Party, and prime minister, in June.
A Herald/Nielsen poll released just before the election was called said 56 percent of those surveyed preferred Gillard as prime minister, while only 35 percent supported Abbott.
