Arpaio responded by telling reporters he had "an idea of the politics involved in law enforcement" after 28 years of working with the U.S. Justice Department as a law enforcement official in Mexico, South America, Texas and Arizona.
For example, the sheriff apparently endorsed one constituent's letter asking for a "round-up" at one Phoenix street corner of "dark-skin(ned)" people: Arpaio told a member of his command staff in a note to "(h)ave someone handle this," the Justice Department said.
I could go on and on," Arpaio said.
I took an oath of office and I'm enforcing the state and federal law.
Arpaio pledged to continue working with the Justice Department in its ongoing investigation.
But even before he became Sheriff in 1993, Joe Arpaio was one tough lawman," his biography states.
"The problems are deeply rooted in (Maricopa County Sheriff's Office) culture, and are compounded by (its) penchant for retaliation against individuals who speak out," added Perez, who said authorities were also looking at allegations of excessive force and a deliberate failure to provide law enforcement services in select communities.
Authorities notified the sheriff's office of a formal investigation a year later, a statement said.
It is time to bring the community together around the shared vision of a department that is effective in reducing crime, respects the rule of law and enjoys the confidence of everyone," Perez told reporters.
