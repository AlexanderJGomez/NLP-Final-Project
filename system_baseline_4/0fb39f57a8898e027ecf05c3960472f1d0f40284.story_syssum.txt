BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) -- Riot police descended on scores of anti-government protesters in the streets of Thailand's capital as violence intensified early Monday.
Rivers said protesters had slashed the tires of a police van.
Thousands of "red shirt" protesters have rallied for days to demand Abhisit's resignation.
The protesters are loyal to former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a 2006 coup.
Thaksin said he would return to Thailand to lead people in a march on the capital if necessary, according to the report.
A police officer was led away by demonstrators and beaten, said Sathit Wongnongtoey, an official in the prime minister's office.
The leader, Arismun Pongruengrong, was charged with inciting people to break the law, police said.
