"It will be like coming to the last page of a book you don't want to end.
The 80 Raiders, flying 16 bombers under the command of Jimmy Doolittle, showed the world that America would never give up.
"All 80 of us knew each other, from all our training missions," Cole said.
Pretty good?
Cole was Doolittle's co-pilot in the first of the 16 planes to take off from the deck of the USS Hornet in the Pacific.
There was a time when every schoolchild in the U.S. was taught about the courage of the Raiders.
And then came the Doolittle Raiders, 80 volunteers with guts enough to thrill their countrymen.
"I was scared, frightened -- just about any word you can think of that describes being apprehensive," Cole said.
Two Raiders died as they bailed out.
One died of starvation; the others were grievously mistreated for more than three years.
The Doolittle bottle.
When the bottle is opened, Cole said, "I know there will be tears, at least in my case."
Friends and admirers of the Raiders have been trying to persuade Congress, in recognition of the Raiders' contribution to this country, to award the entire 80-man squad not the Medal of Honor, but the Congressional Gold Medal, one of our nation's highest tributes.
You'd think the Doolittle Raiders would rate one.
And their supporters have gone about the request in the proper way.
Cole is 98; Saylor and Hite are 94; Thatcher is 92.
The Doolittle Raiders have earned that medal.
It is Congress that should be proud and grateful to be permitted to be associated with the Raiders.
