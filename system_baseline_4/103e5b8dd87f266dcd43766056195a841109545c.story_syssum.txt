Hong Kong (CNN)A court in Hong Kong has thrown out an application for a 14-year-old girl to be removed from her family after she was arrested for drawing chalk flowers on a wall at a pro-democracy protest site in Hong Kong.
Reports of the arrest and the care and protection order application attracted widespread criticism among protestors as such applications are usually made by the Social Welfare Department, not the police, and are usually made in cases where a child is at risk.
The Lennon Wall became a focal point for messages of support for the recent pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.
Last week, police withdrew an application for a care and protection order for a 14-year-old boy last week.
Police officers are guarding Lennon Wall and remove all notes posted to it at the end of each day.
Thirty protest leaders, including the three founders of Occupy Central with Love and Peace and several prominent student leaders, have been called by the police to report to the police headquarters in Wan Chai district, where they could possibly be arrested and prosecuted for their involvement with the two-month long protest.
