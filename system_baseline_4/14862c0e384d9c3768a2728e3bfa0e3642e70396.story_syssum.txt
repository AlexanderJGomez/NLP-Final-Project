Ayatollah Khamenei said Iran would change its policy when the U.S. did so as well.
"My administration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us, and to pursuing constructive ties among the United States, Iran and the international community," the president said in his message Friday.
Khamenei also said world powers have come to realize they are not able to block Iran's nuclear progress.
The report was based on an analysis of data from the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Meanwhile, the widow of the late founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, died Saturday morning after a long period of illness, the Iranian-run Islamic Republic News Agency said.
