In the first "Magic Mike," 33-year-old Tatum starred as the titular Mike, a construction worker and aspiring furniture designer by day and magical male stripper by night.
According to Tatum, "Magic Mike XXL" will shift the action from Florida nightclubs to the road.
This one, we want there to be a lot of conflict and struggle, but we also want a s***-ton of fun.
"Magic Mike XXL" will follow a very busy few years for Tatum.
