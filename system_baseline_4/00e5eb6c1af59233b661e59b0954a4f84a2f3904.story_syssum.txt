Caller:  "I'm inside a plane and I feel like it's up moving in the air.
The caller was a ramp agent who fell asleep in the plane's cargo hold.
Flight 448, which was on its way to Los Angeles, only spent 14 minutes in the air.
The cargo hold is pressurized and temperature controlled, the airline said.
"We just took off for L.A. regular and then ... about five minutes into the flight the captain came on and said we were going back and we'd land within five to seven minutes, and we did," passenger Marty Collins told affiliate KOMO.
The man had been on a four-person team loading baggage onto the flight.
The team lead called into the cargo hold for the employee and called and texted the employee's cell phone, but did not receive an answer.
