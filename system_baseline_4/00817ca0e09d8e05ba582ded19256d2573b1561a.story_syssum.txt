But the 31-year-old is back with a bang, having terrorized Sri Lanka's batsmen to help the home side clinch a 2-0 series win in Melbourne on Friday.
Sangakkara, who on the opening day joined the elite club of players to have scored 10,000 Test runs, needs surgery on a broken finger after being hit on the gloves by Johnson -- who also gave wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene a hairline thumb fracture in the first innings.
"The plan through this Test match was to get up their batters and unfortunately for them they got a few injuries out of it," said Johnson, who passed the milestone of 200 wickets in his 49th Test.
I'm just happy with how I've come back, and making the most of the opportunities I get," he said.
"I've always been happy playing for Australia, it just got to the point where I was feeling the pressure.
I'm 31, I've been around the game for a long time now and I think I've matured in that I have belief in myself and just go out there and play my game and do the best job I can."
Mitchell Starc is expected to return after being rested, while debutant Jackson Bird made a strong impression as an opening bowler, taking two wickets in each innings.
I think Birdy played a huge part in Mitch's success in the first innings, and it allows a bowler like Mitch to be able to attack."
It is the first bilateral series between the neighboring countries in five years.
