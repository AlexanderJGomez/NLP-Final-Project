(CNN) -- As we gear up for the 71st annual Golden Globe Awards on Sunday, allow us to turn the focus to the real winners of the show: besties Tina Fey and Amy Poehler.
Fey will always be known as the woman who gave us the quirky character of Liz Lemon on "30 Rock."
In addition to being one of the stars of the late-night comedy show, the show's creator and producer Lorne Michaels hired Fey as a writer in 1995, and she would later become the show's first female head writer.
The theater offers affordable comedy shows and Poehler has been known to pop up here and there in more than a few.
Neither has won in those years, though Fey won in 2008 before Poehler was nominated.
But while Fey has two daughters, Poehler has two sons.
The Golden Globes organizers were smart enough to lock Fey and Poehler in to a two-year contract to host the show.
