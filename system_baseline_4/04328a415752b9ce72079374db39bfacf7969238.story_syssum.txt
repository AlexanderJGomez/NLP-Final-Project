In a written statement marking the formal end of U.S. combat there, Obama said the remaining 10,000 or so American troops in Afghanistan would still face danger but that the longest U.S. war ever was now history.
"Our courageous military and diplomatic personnel in Afghanistan — along with our NATO allies and coalition partners — have helped the Afghan people reclaim their communities, take the lead for their own security, hold historic elections and complete the first democratic transfer of power in their country's history," Obama said.
"Afghanistan is still a very dangerous place," Obama said at the New Jersey base.
Other U.S. officials — including Vice President Joe Biden and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel — have also marked the end of the U.S. combat mission in Afghanistan.
