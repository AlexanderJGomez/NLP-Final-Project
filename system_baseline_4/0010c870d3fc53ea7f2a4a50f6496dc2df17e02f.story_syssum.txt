(CNN) -- Bayern Munich might be licking their wounds after defeat in the European Champions League final, but the German club can find comfort in victory of a different kind: by beating Chelsea in football's financial league table.
"Manchester United have got a global reach," Brand Finance's head of sports brands Dave Chattaway told CNN.
Despite the defeat by Chelsea and having been beaten to the German league and cup by Borussia Dortmund, the club's brand value grew by 59% over the last 12 months.
Behind United and Bayern are the Spanish "El Clasico" rivals of Real Madrid, third with a value of $600 million, and Barcelona, with a brand worth $580 million.
"Within Europe, the Premier League is still the pinnacle," explained Chattaway.
Italian Cup winners Napoli ($85 million) were the only Serie A club to increase brand value, coming off the back of a relatively successful Champions League campaign, to be 22nd overall.
"The game in the U.S. is still developing massively," said Chattaway.
"The commercial deals in the U.S. cannot compete with the European market.
