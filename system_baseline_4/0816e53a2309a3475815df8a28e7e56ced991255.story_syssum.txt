The sport-crazy country's national team has been humiliated during the Ashes series against an England side they would once routinely embarrass.
But his absence could mark a wholly different watershed: his replacement, 24-year-old Usman Khawaja, is set to become the first Muslim to play for the Australian national cricket team.
Khawaja has been waiting in the wings throughout the series, and has been in sparkling form in Australia's domestic Sheffield Shield, boasting the highest average in the competition, close to 75.
But the promotion of Khawaja to the first team has come at a time when Australian cricket needs a good news story, and at a time when the country's attitudes to immigration and multiculturalism have been put under the spotlight by recent tragedy.
But for some, the emergence of Khawaja can have a far wider impact than leveling what has been a disastrous Ashes series for Australia.
