Somer Thompson, 7, went missing Monday on her way home from school.
You don't take from somebody.
You didn't just take her from me.
The body of her daughter, 7-year-old Somer Thompson, was found in a south Georgia landfill, Clay County, Florida, Sheriff Rick Beseler said Thursday morning.
"Since Monday, we have been trying to figure out who frequents that area," including anyone working on the home, she said.
The sister said she brought up the fight while she and her brother walked Somer home from school, and that Somer ran off from them, apparently upset.
The sister said she lost sight of Somer in a group of other kids leaving the school, according to the police report.
Thompson, he said, was devastated.
Authorities will work to pinpoint where the garbage load that contained the girl's body came from, Beseler said.
"There is a child killer on the loose," the sheriff said.
