Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- A few days ago we observed the two-year anniversary of the earthquake that devastated Haiti, killing an estimated 220,000 people, injuring 300,000, and leaving more than 1 million homeless.
To be sure, there is much rebuilding work to be done, but strong Haitian women are critical to the effort and leading the way.
Too many families are suffering without access to clean water and health care, and a devastating cholera outbreak has killed 6,700 Haitians, with more getting sick every day.
For families and communities fractured by the earthquake, progress has been less visible.
There are so many Haitians who are eager to do more to help their communities; they just need a small window of opportunity.
Oxfam alone has seen more than 1,600 women receive literacy and budget training, and small grants to start businesses to help support their families.
Kenia recently decided to try her hand at growing rice using a new technique called the System of Rice Intensification.
So Kenia found a landowner near where she lives who would allow her to experiment on a small, 100-square-meter (1,100-square-foot) plot.
Esline is the president of one of several water committees in Corail, a large camp of 20,000 people, where Oxfam has installed about 1.6 kilometers (a mile) of new underground piping to deliver clean water.
The profits are used to help the community buy more water and storage supplies.
Two years later, as we commemorate the lives of family and friends lost, we begin a new chapter with much work ahead of us.
Citizens like Kenia and Esline are not "victims" of the earthquake.
