The coroner's preliminary assessment is there was no foul play involved in the death of Getty, grandson of oil tycoon J. Paul Getty, said Detective Meghan Aguilar.
Gordon Getty is one of three living sons of J. Paul Getty, the oil baron who was thought to be the richest man in the world at the time of his death in 1976.
Gordon Getty spearheaded the controversial sale of Getty to Texaco for $10 billion in 1984.
In his request, Getty said he had been diagnosed with a serious medical condition in 2013.
