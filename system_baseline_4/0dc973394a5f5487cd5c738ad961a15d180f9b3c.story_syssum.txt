Since 2012, he delivered food and medical supplies within and outside Syria and provided trauma care and training, his family said.
But on October 1, 2013, he was "detained" on his way to Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria while performing a project for SERA, his family said.
"The Kassig family extends our concern for the family of Alan Henning," Kassig's parents said.
In 2010, Kassig took time off and began his certification as an emergency medical technician.
"I needed a game-changer," he said.
The next two weeks were filled with eye-opening misadventures as Kassig began to scratch the surface of the complexities of the Syrian conflict and the Middle East as a whole.

Kassig's family said SERA was dedicated to providing first-response humanitarian aid for refugees fleeing the widening civil war in Syria.
Kassig's family said he converted to Islam while being held hostage and now goes by Abdul-Rahman.
