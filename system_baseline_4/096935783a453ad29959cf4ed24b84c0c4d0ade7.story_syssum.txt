To carry out that mission, Alkhawaja -- who has dual Bahraini and Danish citizenship, and is the acting president of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights -- lives in exile and travels the world explaining how her people are oppressed.
"Every single day," Alkhawaja says, "between 15 to 25 different areas come out to protest in Bahrain.
Anger from the majority Shiite population was directed at the ruling Sunni minority.
For Alkhawaja, the cause continues.
In a statement, the Bahraini government says it has implemented reforms and set up independent bodies to address grievances.
In regards to grievances pertaining to any accusation of mistreatment, independent bodies have been established to investigate and address any incident of misconduct that may undermine public confidence in the Ministry of Interior (MOI), even if no formal complaint is filed."
Her sister, Zainab Alkhawaja, is also a very prominent rights activist, and also currently locked up -- having been sentenced to prison for, among other things, insulting the police.
It can all get to be too much, which is why Alkhawaja says she has to detach.
Over the past two years, Alkhawaja has become somewhat of a celebrity in the world of human rights activism, and not just in Bahrain.
She was in Lebanon for only a few days, but never stopped addressing audiences both digital and physical, large and small, urging the world to listen to the stories of the oppressed, one voice at a time.
