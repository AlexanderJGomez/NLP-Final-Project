(CNN)  -- Caroline Wozniacki moved a win nearer to reclaiming the world number one spot from Kim Clijsters but her passage to the last 16 in Dubai only came after her Russian opponent, Anna Chakvetadze, fainted on court.
Chakvetadze, who put out Pattaya Open winner Daniela Hantuchova in the first round, was later diagnosed with a gastro-intestinal illness.
Kuznetsova lost to the French Open winner in the longest women's match in grand slam history in last month's Australian Open, four hours 44 minutes.
Meanwhile, Britain's Andy Murray has withdrawn from next week's ATP tournament in Dubai, citing a wrist injury.
"Andy would like to apologize to both the tournament and its fans," he told his official website.
