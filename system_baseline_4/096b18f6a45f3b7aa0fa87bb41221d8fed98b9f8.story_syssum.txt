(CNN) -- We learned a few things on Monday night, those of us watching Anderson Cooper on "AC360," about Alex Teves, one of the people who died in the gunfire at theater 9 in the Century 16 multiplex in Aurora, Colorado.
He said, when Cooper asked how he was holding up: "It's the worst day of my life every day.
Teves had something to say to the news media, too, something impossible to ignore: "And if we don't stop talking about the gunman -- so somebody took a gun and went in and shot a 6-year-old girl?
He's apprehended.
The mass killings certainly dominated the news, quickly becoming one of the biggest stories of 2012.
Still, if mass shootings weren't big news, you would worry.
Like Teves, many people suspect that some sort of media glory is part of the payoff for these mass killers.
As an analogy, one he freely admitted is on a wholly different level, Teves used the example of people running on fields during professional ball games.
Mental illness?
News media speculation about the motive isn't helpful to anyone.
News outlets should never glorify killers in any way.
As Teves said, "You know, Alex would have expected us to live.
Still, when something like this happens, we are, as a society, like a tribe discussing the events around the campfire.
Here, too, we have questions: Who is this killer?
Tell us about the wolves.
