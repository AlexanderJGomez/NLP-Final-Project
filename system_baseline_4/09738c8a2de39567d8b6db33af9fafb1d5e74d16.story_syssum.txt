Bangkok (CNN) -- More than two months of floods and 8 million people affected -- the disaster in Thailand is immense; the aid effort a challenge.
In the ancient city of Ayutthara, one of the worst-hit regions, military trucks move slowly down the main street, cutting through a constant river of water, passing out aid to those who can get close.
The water here has nowhere to go and levels are rising fast.
He says the situation is dire and help is not getting there fast enough to those who don't live on the main street.
Monk Somkuan Thanajaro says it will take a long time to fix the waterlogged temple where Sinsap is staying.
The international community is responding to the disasters playing out across Thailand.
The World Health Organization has offered emergency health kits.
