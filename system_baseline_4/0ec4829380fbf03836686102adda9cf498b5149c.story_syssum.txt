Now, Iqbal is considering suing the U.S. government for unlawful detention.
His attorney in Washington, Richard Cys, said he is considering a lawsuit against the U.S. government, on behalf of Iqbal, but the details of the suit have not been worked out.
The move could lead to an increase in the number of lawsuits brought by former detainees who -- like Iqbal -- say they were held for no reason.
"I never [made] that statement," Iqbal said.
In March 2003, he arrived at Guantanamo's military prison, which became a lightning rod for critics who charged that the Bush administration had used torture on terror detainees.
Six months after he was admitted to Guantanamo, Iqbal said he tried to kill himself.
Former President Bush and other senior officials have repeatedly denied that the U.S. government used torture to extract intelligence from terror suspects.
Iqbal was among nearly 800 inmates who came through Guantanamo Bay, classified by Washington as suspected terrorists.
With the help of a U.S.-based lawyer, Iqbal was released in September without ever being charged.
