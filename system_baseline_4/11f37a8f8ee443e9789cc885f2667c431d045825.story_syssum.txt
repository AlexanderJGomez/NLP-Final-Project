(CNN) -- If you took a moment during the heat of the presidential race to drop by the Mitt Romney campaign office, you would have been shocked by the number of white people working to get him elected.
In a conference call with donors, Romney attributed his loss to the president playing Santa Claus by showering minorities and young voters with "gifts" -- health care, student loans and those things Americans clearly don't need.
Likewise with Hispanic voters, free health care was a big plus."

Now it's time for a dose of reality from the black guy to the white guy, Mitt Romney.
But Mitt, you need to check your facts and realize that there were a lot of white people who really didn't like you.
Mitt, you got 59% of those voters.
This is why Mitt Romney shouldn't have been president.
Even Louisiana Gov.
Bottom line, Mitt: The black guy beat you because he offered a more inclusive message to a cross section of people than you.
Well, Mitt, America should be thankful minorities and young people rejected your nonsense.
