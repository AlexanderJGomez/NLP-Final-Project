As a music style, heavy metal has completely passed me by.
Why would I want to listen to anyone even suggesting I do that?
Even at the end of the 80s, when Iron Maiden was releasing its "First Ten Years" compilation of greatest hits, I would have been sixteen (or thereabouts), the perfect age to fall for the charms of a long-haired, rebellious rocker in tight leather pants.
There's only one thing for it -- a crash course in all things metal with the man who knows, self-confessed metalhead Malcolm Dome, who also presents the chart show for 24-hour UK rock and metal radio station TotalRock.
"You'd probably be surprised how many heavy metal fans there are who have very high-powered business jobs -- even members of parliament who are into metal.
He's been involved in the scene since the late 1960s, when he fell for a young heavy metal group called Black Sabbath.
If there's anyone who can convince me of the joys of heavy metal, it's someone who also appreciates the soothing, melodic tones of Sinatra.
And that's what metal does.
It's 'he's behind you', it's the whole larger than life character, it's circus, it's frivolity."
The problem with heavy metal, Malcolm says, is that the mainstream media misrepresented it for years.
"You can understand people actually seeing what was being presented to them thinking 'I don't get it and I don't want to get it,'" Malcolm says.
Slaughter was a metaphor for the party.
It should be stated here that there are varying degrees of heavy metal, from the hair metal of carefully-coifured Jon Bon Jovi to the black art of New York doom metal band Unearthly Trance.
Dozens of sub-categories of metal have evolved to include black metal, stoner metal, thrash metal, power metal, goth metal, death metal and grind core, to name a few.
As Malcolm says, it's not unusual for bands to have a career that spans decades.
"Absolutely not, no, no, no," Malcolm says, looking slightly shocked.
Metal is ageless."
