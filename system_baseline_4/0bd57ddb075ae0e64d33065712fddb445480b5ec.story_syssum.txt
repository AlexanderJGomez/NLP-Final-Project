The commanders said they have no reason to believe Gadhafi can exercise command and control of those militia members who remain loyal to him, the official said.
Complicating the matter was the resignation Friday of Mahdi al-Harati, the deputy head of the Tripoli Military Council, a senior National Transitional Council official said.
"There is overlapping in the role of the Tripoli military council and the NTC," he said.
Early Friday, hundreds of revolutionary fighters attacked from the west, NTC military field commanders said.
At least 12 revolutionary fighters were killed and 193 others wounded Friday, the Misrata Military Council said.
The Red Cross said thousands of civilians remain inside Sirte and waves of war-weary civilians were streaming from the coastal city every day.
The council's leader and the interim prime minister have promised to step down to clear the way for a new government once Sirte is taken.
