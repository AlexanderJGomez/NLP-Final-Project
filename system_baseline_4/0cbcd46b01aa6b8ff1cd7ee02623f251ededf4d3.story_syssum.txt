Country No.
92 for the Waterers is Cuba.
"Each traveler must have a full-time schedule of educational exchange activities that will result in meaningful interaction between the travelers and individuals in Cuba," U.S. Treasury Department guidelines for people-to-people travel read.
And while the policy has kicked off a debate over what is a "meaningful" exchange, a flood of tour operators has entered the still uncertain world of travel to Cuba.
Most Americans heading to Cuba go there with the desire to make a connection with a people they have been prevented from having any contact with  for generations, according to Tom Popper, president of tour operator Insight Cuba.
Popper said the high cost of the trips is due to the fact that operators need to send guides with their groups to make sure they comply with the travel regulations, and that renewing the yearly U.S. licenses can take months of navigating a complicated bureaucracy.
The guidelines are so vague," said Michael Sykes, who ran the now-defunct Cuba Cultural Tours.
"The language is so cryptic and so bureaucratic," he said.
But some tour operators said travel to Cuba has become more cumbersome and expensive but is not policed any better.
"It's supposed to be people-to-people, not people-to-fish," the operator said.
"We are back in operations and hope to stay that way," Insight Cuba president Tom Popper said.
"I love Cuba," he said.
