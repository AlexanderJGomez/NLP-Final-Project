It also reported that the U.S. plane that carried al-Hajj had about 20 other former detainees aboard who also had been released from Guantanamo Bay.
"He was brought in here by ambulance and entered to the intensive care unit on a stretcher," said Al-Jazeera Director General Wadah Khanfar from the hospital.
Charge D'Affaires Alberto Fernandez of the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum said the transfer "is a result of many factors and the work of many hands.
"Al-Hajj is remarkably thin," Katznelson said.
I look forward to the moment," al-Hajj said told Al-Jazeera before being reunited with his family.
"Now I can think differently," Asma Ismailov said.
The network also said the United States placed some conditions on al-Hajj's release, including one that prevents him from any political activity.
"We are delighted that Sami al-Hajj can finally be reunited with his family and friends," said Joel Simon, executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists.
