Eto'o, who completed his switch from Barcelona on Monda, denied he has issues with Portuguese coach Mourinho and insists he never insulted his team's style of play after a Champions League match between Barca and Chelsea.
"Now I am happy to be here, for me it is a great honor to play for a coach like Jose.
"Why?
"Ibra is a great player but I am Samuel Eto'o and my past and my victories talk for me," said Eto'o.
Eto'o has spent his entire career in Spain since leaving Cameroon in 1997, playing for Real Madrid, Leganes, Espanyol, Mallorca and Barcelona.
"It's true I have always played in Spain but I have great experience of international matches," continued Eto'o.
