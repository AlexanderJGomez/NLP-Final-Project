This is Japan's exclusion zone.
My goal today is to see the town of Tomioka, a farming and factory community which sits in the southern section of the exclusion zone.
That's what strikes you first about the exclusion zone -- what you can't see, the people.
The signs of life can oddly be found among livestock roaming the region.
I'm carrying two radiation meters with me, one to measure surface radiation and one to track how much my body accumulates.
Tomioka, in the southern end of the exclusion zone, has a lower level of contamination than towns to the north and northwest of the plant.
On the pavement, the surface reads a radiation level of 0.042 millisieverts per hour, which is 10 times what you're exposed to in a dental x-ray.
But the rest of Tomioka sits empty, of people, of progress and an apparent future.
