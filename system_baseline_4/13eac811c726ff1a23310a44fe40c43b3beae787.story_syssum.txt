British Airways plans to reduce capacity by 4 percent next winter by parking up to 16 aircraft.
This is by far the biggest crisis the industry has ever faced," said Willie Walsh, British Airways' chief executive.
"It's all well and good for Willie Walsh to say he's prepared to work for free when he earns four times in a month what they do in a year," said Ciaran Naidoo, a spokesman for Unite.
The airline's premium passenger numbers fell 13 percent in the second half of last year, in line with the industry average.
Total traffic fell 3.4 percent and while the airline carried 33.1 million passengers last year, it was a drop of 4.3 percent from the previous year.
