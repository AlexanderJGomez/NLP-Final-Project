(CNN) -- A news anchor and four other people were killed on Monday in a suicide bombing after armed militants stormed a TV complex in Tikrit, Iraq, police said.
Tensions have pervaded the Sunni community, which has felt marginalized by the Shiite-dominated government.
The Committee to Protect Journalists, a watchdog group, said in a report this month that journalists have been subjected to threats and killings.
"These killings are a significant deterioration from 2012, a landmark year in which no journalists were killed for their work in Iraq for the first time since the 2003 American invasion," the report said.
Violence occurred in other regions of Iraq on Monday, police said.
Three people died in shootings in Mosul, and an attack on a bus in Baquba, northeast of Baghdad, left three others dead, police said.
