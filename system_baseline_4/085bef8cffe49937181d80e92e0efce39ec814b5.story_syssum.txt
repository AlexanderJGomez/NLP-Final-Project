In addition to the 12 Somali and 11 Yemeni suspects, the Indian navy seized two small boats and "a substantial cache of arms and equipment," the military said in a statement.
The Indian warship Mysore, which carried out Saturday's operation, is on anti-piracy patrol in the Gulf of Aden, the release said.
The Mysore changed course toward the Gibe and launched an armed helicopter, the Indian military said.
Indian sailors boarded the Salahaddin, the military said, and the 23 suspects surrendered peacefully.
Last month, the Indian navy said it had sunk a pirate "mother vessel" in the Gulf of Aden.
Indian authorities insisted that their ship, the frigate INS Tabar, had acted against a pirate vessel that had threatened to attack it.
He said the ship the Tabar fired on was laden with ammunition.
Just this month, Somali pirates captured two Yemeni fishing boats and 22 Yemeni fishermen in the Gulf of Aden, Yemen's official news agency SABA reported.
