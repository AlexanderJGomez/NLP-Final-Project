(CNN) -- There is a great, geologic break in the land that runs almost the length of Texas from around Fort Worth to just west of San Antonio.
Five of the 20 fastest growing cities in America might be in Texas, but they are also the municipalities moving the quickest toward failure of infrastructure and other acute problems the state's leaders ignore.
A commuter rail train runs in the Texas capital city, but because it was consigned to old freight tracks, it hardly serves the population density.
In fact, the gas tax in the state has not been raised since 1991 while lawmakers racked up a $23 billion dollar bond bill to construct roads.
The greatest peril facing a booming Texas population, however, is the lack of water.
Lake Travis, the jewel of the Texas Hill Country, which is also the water supply for Austin's swelling population, has not been full since 2007.
Bottled water sales are said to be booming.
The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality predicts four dozen cities in the Lone Star state can expect to run out of water, possibly by the end of this year, if the drought does not break.
And a No.
Y'all come on down to Texas.
