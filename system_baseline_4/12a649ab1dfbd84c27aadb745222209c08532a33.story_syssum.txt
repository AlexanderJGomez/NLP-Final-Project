(CNN) -- The arrest of drug kingpin Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman is a monumental moment in the world's war on drugs.
West Point's Combating Terrorism Center devoted a report to the international presence of Guzman and his drug trafficking.
Guzman, 56, is the drug kingpin extraordinaire.
Guzman had been caught once before by Mexican authorities, in 2001, but he escaped from a high-security Mexican prison.
"It just kind of adds to the whole mythology -- kind of like the old pulp Western books they used to write about these outlaws."
Guzman's drug operation is believed to have penetrated not just all of the Americas, but Europe, Australia and west Africa as well, according to the West Point report.
That helped Mexican authorities and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents hunting Guzman gain confidence in recent weeks that they could arrest him.
"Although it's a ridiculous phrase, the world's most wanted drug lord is accurate," said Malcom Beith, author of "The Last Narco," which is about Mexico's drug war.
"This would be a significant blow to the overall operations not only in the Americas, but Chapo Guzman had expanded to Europe.
The United States doesn't want to see Guzman escape again.
That's why they are eager to see him extradited to the United States as soon as possible, where he is named in multiple federal drug indictments and has been on the DEA's most-wanted list.
