All that cold air and a stuck weather pattern are keeping tornadoes to historic lows so far this year.
The group is responsible for issuing the tornado and severe thunderstorm watches that warn the public of impending severe weather.
At a time where the tornado season usually ramps up considerably, there has not been a single report this month of a tornado.
There have been around 20 tornadoes reported since January 1, well below the 10-year average of 130 for the period from the beginning of the year until mid-March.
In 2014, we ended the year with a count of 881, well below the average of 1,253.
It's also important to note that even in years where the tornado counts are low, you can still have very violent tornadoes -- 2013 being a perfect example.
The year ended being roughly 30% below normal for the number of tornadoes, yet included some of the strongest tornadoes on record.
