Moammar Gadhafi was born in the central Libyan desert south of Sirte in spring 1942.
He then enrolled in secondary school in Sebha, where, for the first time, he had access to Arab newspapers and radio broadcasts, notably the "Voice of the Arabs" news program from Cairo.
In the course of his time at the academy, he created the Free Unionist Officers Movement and selected its 12-member central committee, drawing on contacts made in Sebha and Misurata.
In fact, Gadhafi, the remaining Revolutionary Command Council members, the Free Unionist Officers and revolutionary committees appointed by Gadhafi tightly controlled the political system from the start, making all important decisions.
Gadhafi was a revolutionary, and initially, his regime pursued a complex, aggressive and often violent foreign policy.
By 2006, the United States had achieved full commercial and diplomatic relations with Libya for the first time in 25 years.
