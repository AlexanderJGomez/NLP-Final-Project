Adonis, born Ali Ahmad Said Esbar, grew up in a poor village near the Syrian city of Latakia and received no formal education until he was granted a scholarship to a French lycee by the then president of Syria at the age of 13.
He spoke to CNN through an interpreter at an exhibition of his collages and a series of literary events called "A Tribute to Adonis" at the Mosaic Rooms in London until March 30.
The Western world should not use this as a pretext to fulfill its own goals in the region.
A: I last went to Syria a year and a half ago, but I'm always in touch with my friends there.
They are not scared to speak out.
A: Lebanon will remain as it has always been: An ongoing project, a work in progress.
CNN: You received no formal education until you recited one of your own poems to the then Syrian president in 1943.
I can always say that poetry allowed me to be reborn.
Poetry has never had any influence throughout history, however poetry creates a new aesthetic, a new beauty, a new type of relations between things and people, and this is not insignificant.
CNN: You left Syria after being imprisoned for membership of an opposition party in 1956, then you left Lebanon in 1982 after the Israeli invasion.
Do you feel you have always been in exile?
I miss swimming in the sea.
What does this mean to you?
There's a lot of attention and a lot of sensitive appreciation.
