Samuel Tombs, an economist at Capital Economics, said there was an obvious boost to UK economic growth during the Games but it was too early to see a legacy benefit.
Tombs said the figures also showed growth in all areas of the economy, which he noted was was a first in recent years.
On Thursday, Mayor of London Boris Johnson said that the success of the Olympics and Paralympics has spurred investment in the U.K capital.
He added: "The Games have had more of an impact on London than the rest of the UK.
said the Games were "a triumph of public endeavour... it's a very good example of what a very dynamic and focused public sector can do."
