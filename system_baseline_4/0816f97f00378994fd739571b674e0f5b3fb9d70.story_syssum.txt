(CNN)"Sleeping in our caves is a mystical experience," says Umberto Paolucci.
For centuries, Matera's 156 rock crypts and maze of grottoes, known as Sassi, were home to "troglodyte" outcasts living in inhuman conditions.
"They're enchanted, magical, but real at the same time," Paolucci adds.
Grotte della Civita (Via Civita 28, Matera; +39 0835 332744) features 18 soberly restyled grotto rooms clustered around a cave crypt that serves as restaurant, cocktail and lounge area.
When I step inside my 80-square-meter suite, made up of three adjacent grottoes, I'm struck by an unexpected wave of spirituality even as I'm worshiping the accommodation's more earthly pleasures.
"Real luxury is the fulfillment of one's most intimate and true need," says Paolucci.
Until then, guests wanting to restore soul and body have to settle for a massage (with perfumed oils, burning braziers and new age music) inside their grotto.
Evening drinks are served inside the cave church beneath walls that are a puzzle of black holes and candlelit niches.
From the window, Matera looks like a nativity scene.
With no television, radio, minibar or magazines, it does feel like I'm leading a monastic life.
There are also plums known as "nuns' thighs" due to their unusual shape.
Built by former jeans designer Marcello Murzilli, this "modern ashram" is set in a 3,000-hectare park in Umbria and has only single-cell rooms, all named after saints.
"Brushing of the Monastery" massage uses sorghum grains to revitalize leg circulation.
The Romanesque church serves as the reception and hall, while the cloister has been turned into suites.
