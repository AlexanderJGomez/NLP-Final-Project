San Diego, California (CNN) -- President Obama deserves an A+ for his agenda for education reform.
Like no president in recent memory -- except maybe George W. Bush, who diagnosed that schools are often afflicted with "the soft bigotry of low expectations" -- Obama gets it.
1) There are low expectations, not just for students but also for parents, schools and whole communities that are written off as not able to compete academically.
3) Those intent on preserving the status quo resist tooth and nail any attempt to hold them accountable by linking teachers to the performance of their students or, in an idea that Louisiana is trying and that Duncan smiles upon and would like to see spread to other states, tracing back teachers to the schools of education that produced them.
Then, incredibly, the parents are blamed for not participating and involving themselves more in that hostile environment and when many of them thought that teaching their kids was the job of, well, teachers.
I know what you're thinking.
I bet that a lot of public school teachers -- many of whom, according to exit polls, vote Democratic -- are already missing the Bush administration.
At least when they were battling the accountability law known as No Child Left Behind, they could say it was someone else's idea put in place by a president who other people elected.
Trouble is, this week, Obama made clear that, when it comes to fixing our schools, he and the education secretary are on the same team.
