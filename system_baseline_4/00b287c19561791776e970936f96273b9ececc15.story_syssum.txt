The girl, Oceana Irizarry, and her father, Ommy Irizarry, 36, of Georgia were struck Sunday afternoon by a plane making an emergency landing, the Federal Aviation Administration said.
Kokomoor -- the president and CEO of local engineering firm -- is "emotionally distraught and devastated," his pastor, Victor Willis, said Tuesday.
Kokomoor said that he was losing altitude fast and had little time to make a decision.
The death investigation -- which is being conducted by the sheriff's office -- will determine if Kokomoor will face any charges, said Rose.
On the same day he died, Ommy Irizarry posted a love message on Facebook to his wife, as they were celebrating their ninth wedding anniversary.
He was a platoon sergeant assigned to Fort Stewart's Warrior Transition Battalion, the Army said.
"Our thoughts and prayers are with the Irizarry family."
