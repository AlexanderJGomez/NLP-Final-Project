Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Imprisoned Ukrainian opposition leader and former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko has ended her 12-day hunger strike, Ukraine's Batkivschyna opposition party said Friday.
Eugenia said many people, including European and world leaders, had asked her mother to stop the hunger strike, according to the Batkivschyna party.
About 7,000 people were protesting in the capital, Kiev, as of Friday morning, police said.
Russia threatened its neighbor with trade sanctions and steep gas bills if it forged ahead with an EU deal but promised deep discounts on natural gas if it were to join the Moscow-led Customs Union instead.
Yanukovich was also facing an EU demand that he was unwilling to meet: free Tymoshenko, his chief political opponent.
Yanukovich also canceled a planned trip to Malta -- a European Union member -- "due to the necessity to focus attention on the internal political issues," his office said.
