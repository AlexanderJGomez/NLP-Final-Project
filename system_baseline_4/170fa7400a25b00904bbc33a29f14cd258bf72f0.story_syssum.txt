According to the account she would later give police, Moore carried her sons to a nearby tree, gripping branches along with her boys as she tried to shelter them from the storm surge.
In desperation, Moore told police she then went to the back of the house, and tried to break in using a flower pot, but was unable to do so.
Relatives said Moore was too distraught to speak with CNN.
The man at the door didn't ask to enter the house, he said, but instead asked him to come outside in order to help.
He said he did not know the fate of the children.
Told that their bodies had been found, he said the deaths were a tragedy, but implied that the woman was at fault.
The man said he had given his account to police.
