The 60-minute initial mental examination of Gonzalez at the District of Columbia jail came as a surprise to the judge and to both the government and defense.
But the result, finding Gonzalez not competent, can't be ignored, Collyer said in court Tuesday.
Gonzalez was arrested in September after he allegedly jumped the White House fence and sprinted into the executive mansion, setting off concerns about Secret Service security procedures.
Collyer said that during the initial examination, the mental health screener found Gonzalez did understand some parts of the proceedings.
Collyer ordered the mental health screening to be done in 30 days and set a new hearing for December 3 at 10:30 a.m.
