Why?
So -- in essence -- everyone can get free health care if they need it.
What's important to remember is that you can't be refused emergency care.
That's because the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires that any hospital that takes Medicare or Medicaid must check you for emergent conditions and treat them if they exist.
But there's no guarantee of prenatal care in the emergency department.
You can't get preventive care in the emergency department.
And even if you could, it wouldn't be free.
You'll get that emergent care, but you'll also be charged for it.
In some cases, patients were even confronted and stalled by debt collectors as they entered the emergency department on some later occasion so that the company could collect on old bills before more care was offered.
It might even be worse in North Carolina, where a group of nonprofit hospitals sued 40,000 patients from 2005 to 2010.
This is problematic because nonprofit hospitals are supposed to provide a certain level of charity care in exchange for their tax-exempt status.
But let's acknowledge that patients will be held accountable for the costs of their care, even in the emergency room.
So it's true that an emergency room won't let you die if you show up at the door, but short of that, you can't get care for a host of medical issues.
That's a far cry from universal health care, and nothing to brag about.
