The next was to head to a mosque in his middle-class Palestinian neighborhood of Shuafat in Jerusalem for prayers.
Three people in a car came upon the 16-year-old as Abu Khdeir walked between his home and mosque around 4 a.m. Wednesday, then forced him inside, according to authorities and family members.
It was a horrible end for someone who friends and family remembered fondly on Wednesday.
Abu Khdeir hadn't fully made his mark on the world.
His family will never know.
