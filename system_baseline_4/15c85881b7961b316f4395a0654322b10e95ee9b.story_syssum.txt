It's an unmanned aerial vehicle -- commonly called a UAV or a drone -- and it's coming to deliver your order right to your front door.
Drone technology is literally taking off all across the world.
Foreign governments have quickly embraced its potential and have passed safety rules allowing a diverse array of commercial users to operate UAVs.
But the United States has fallen behind in the race to explore where this new technology can take us.
Unfortunately, they are long overdue, and the pace of rule setting is inhibiting America's competitiveness in the UAV technology race.
Imagine a firefighter using a UAV to gain a bird's-eye view of emergencies and use that new perspective to contain flames better.
Or American-made UAVs enabling the delivery of supplies such as medicine to remote, impoverished villages in the developing world, better enabling us to track and prevent diseases such as tuberculosis and Ebola.
If we don't, the United States risks forfeiting our position as the world's technology leader.
