Divided by mapmakers into 14 sections that vary from seven to 21 miles in length, the Wall Trail, or "Mauerweg," traces the entire path of the Wall.
The Wall Trail is a unique combination of tourist attraction and recreational zone, says Michael Cramer, the Green Party politician and cycling enthusiast who conceived the plan in the early 1990s and is now working on a Europe-spanning Iron Curtain Trail, inspired by the Wall route's success.
Berliners hated the Wall so much that many people wanted every trace of it obliterated.
Completed in 2009 at a cost of some 10 million euros ($13.4 million), today the trail appeals to all types of cyclists.
"As you experience the Wall zig-zagging through the city, you get a feeling for the separation," Wollenberg says.
For tourists new to Berlin, about 25 miles of the trail runs through the heart of the city.
At 29 different sites along the path, memorial placards tell the stories of some of the nearly 250 "victims of the Wall," such as Peter Bohme, a 19-year-old cadet in East Germany's National People's Army who was shot trying to escape to West Berlin in 1962.
Cramer's "Berlin Wall Trail: Cycling Guide" can be picked up for about $10 online or at the souvenir shop at the Berlin Wall Documentation Centre on Bernauer Strasse.
