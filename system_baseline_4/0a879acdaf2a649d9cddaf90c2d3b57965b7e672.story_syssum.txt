Detective Chief Inspector Paul Fotheringham of Kent police told the inquest that Geldof had been addicted to heroin for a number of years but had ceased taking the drug more recently.
Fotheringham's report to the inquest gave new details of Geldof's death.
Police who searched the house where she died found a black cloth bag hidden in a cupboard above the door of a spare bedroom, he said.
The musician had taken both children to spend the weekend at his parents' home.
A pair of knotted black tights was found under her body, and a burnt spoon containing a small amount of a brown residue in the bowl was found under the bed, Fotheringham said.
Geldof was 11 years old when her mother died of a drug overdose.
