Americans must outgrow the unbecoming arrogance that leads us to assert that America somehow owns a monopoly on goodness and truth -- a belief that leads some to view the world as but a stage on which to play out the great historical drama: the United States of America versus the Powers of Evil.
To battle the evil of others by responding in kind and exhibiting equally violent aggressive behavior is to flout the very ethic of our religious traditions; it is also to violate the Geneva conventions, international law, the United Nations, world opinion, and even our own Bill of Rights.
We have two powerful tools with which to bridge the chasm separating the United States from the Muslim world: faith in the basic goodness of humanity and trust in the power of sincerity and dialogue to overcome differences with our fellow human beings.
James Forbes on learning compassion at the dinner table
It is humanity's dream -- rich with hope and idealism for a troubled world -- that the great lady in the harbor symbolizes.
I wish for humankind to drink deeply from that rich, nourishing current of spiritual traditions -- those immutable principles of divine origin that have been given form in so many ways in human societies.
