A trade gateway linking east and west, the modern city can still show travelers glimpses of its long maritime history.
To this day, you can still see the influence of the Dutch colonialists in the architecture of many of the buildings in the old city.
But underneath the seemingly overpopulated, polluted exterior lies a vibrant city rich in history and eclectic tourism options.
Literally meaning "Fish Market" in Bahasa Indonesia (the country's native tongue), Pasar Ikan sits at the end of Sunda Kelapa harbor.
Although the market now sells all types of wares, Indonesian fishermen still gather here daily to sell their catch.
Today, the museum lets you step back in time through the country's nautical past and emphasizes how important the sea still is to the economy of present-day Indonesia.
In the 16th century, the Dutch settled in Indonesia -- renaming Jakarta "Batavia" -- after seeing a high demand for the country's spices.
And a few blocks west of Fatahillah Square is the Great Canal, with its historical Dutch drawbridge, Jembatan Pasar Ayam, rising over the waterway.
It was erected in the 1960s as a tribute to Indonesian independence and today stands as a reminder of Jakarta's vibrant and multicultural history.
