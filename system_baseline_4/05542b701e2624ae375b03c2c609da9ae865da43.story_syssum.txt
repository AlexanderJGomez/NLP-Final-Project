Atlanta, Georgia (CNN)  -- A third beluga whale belonging to the world's largest aquarium has died, the Georgia Aquarium announced late Monday.
Nico died at Sea World in San Antonio, where he and two other beluga whales had been moved temporarily while the Georgia Aquarium is undergoing renovation.
"We rescued Nico knowing that he had health issues due to his prior home, but we were confident that we could provide a better quality of life for his final years," Bossart said.
They can live up to 35 years.
