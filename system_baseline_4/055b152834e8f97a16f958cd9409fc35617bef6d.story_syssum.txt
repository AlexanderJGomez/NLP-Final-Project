Before Wednesday, people outside of the Secret Service weren't familiar with Joe Clancy when President Obama appointed him to be the interim head of the agency.
Clancy has a good relationship with both Obamas.
There was some talk of Clancy coming back when Sullivan left and before Julia Pierson was appointed, for either the number one or number two job, but he preferred to stay in the private sector at the time.
Secret Service insiders think that it would be a mistake to bring in an outsider.
But now that Pierson is gone, agency veterans are thrilled Clancy agreed to come back.
