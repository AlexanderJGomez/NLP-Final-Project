The first African-American president is confronting the delicate issues of justice and discrimination after renewed violence this week in Ferguson, Missouri, sparked by a grand jury's decision not to indict a white police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown, a black youth, this summer.
"If any part of the American community doesn't feel welcomed or treated fairly, that's something that puts all of us at risk," Obama said.
Instead, Obama pledged to lead a national conversation on race and address the deep rooted belief in many communities of color "that our laws are not always being enforced uniformly."
"He doesn't want to be the black president.
"When Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son," Obama said.
Obama has dealt gingerly with racial issues since he burst onto the national political scene in 2004 as a state senator from Illinois who delivered a galvanizing speech at that year's Democratic National Convention.
He would later speak with pride about his "commanding victories in states with some of the whitest populations in the country."
He responded with a speech in Philadelphia in which Obama said Wright's views denigrated the "greatness and goodness of our nation" and rightly offended "white and black alike."
Obama was deeply affected by a private meeting he held last year with a group of young black boys about a mile from his home in Hyde Park, Chicago.
But Obama has studiously avoided the debate over whether race is a factor in his sinking approval ratings.
Rogers Smith, co-author of  "Still a House Divided," a study of racial politics in the Obama era, said the president understood the symbolism.
"I definitely think he is conscious that as the first black president, he will be a subject of endless historical scrutiny as well as intense contemporary scrutiny," Smith said.
