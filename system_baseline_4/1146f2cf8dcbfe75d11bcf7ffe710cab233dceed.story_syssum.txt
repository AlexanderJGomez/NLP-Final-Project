Since leaving the State Department in 2013, Hillary Clinton has headlined six events in Canada and organizers in the country announced two more appearances in two different provinces on Monday.
With the addition of these appearances, Clinton has now headlined events in six of Canada's ten provinces (the country also has three territories).
CNN's calls to the group went unanswered on Monday.
One thing is consistent for nearly every event Clinton does in Canada: At some point, she is asked about the Keystone XL pipeline.
But after her visit to Ottawa in October, one headline pointed to the fact that Clinton's visit may be more than that: "Hillary Clinton winning hearts, if not voters, in Ottawa".
