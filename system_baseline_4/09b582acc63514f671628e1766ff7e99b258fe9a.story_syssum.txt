Woodward, an associate editor of The Washington Post, says in "The War Within: A Secret White House History 2006-2008" that the assassination program, not the 2007 increase in U.S. forces in the war zone known as "the surge," is primarily responsible for the reduction of violence in Iraq.
Michael Ware: Let's say that these "fusion teams," as they're being called, have come into effect.
I mean, the U.S. subcontracted out an assassination program against al Qaeda way back in early 2006.
Ware: It does work together.
But the key to the downturn in violence that we're seeing now is not so much the surge of 30,000 troops in itself.
This is your American militia, the counterbalance to the Iranian militias.
