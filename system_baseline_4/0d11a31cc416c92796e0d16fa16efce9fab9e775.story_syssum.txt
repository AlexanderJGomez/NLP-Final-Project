The leak diminishes the value of the video of the event that Kardashian and West own, the suit said.
"Immediately after giving his word to honor the condition required for his attendance at the event," Hurley posted the shaky video on MixBit, a video sharing website owned by his San Mateo, California, company, it said.
"Despite his extraordinary financial success in creating YouTube, which was sold in 2006, Hurley has ever since sought his 'second act,'" the lawsuit said.
"An opportunity to do so appeared to Hurley when he learned of the October 21, 2013, event featuring West and Kardashian," it said.
Hurley knows better, the lawsuit said.
