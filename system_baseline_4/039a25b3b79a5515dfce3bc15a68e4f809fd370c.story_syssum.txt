(CNN) -- A gunman killed three people and wounded at least five at the house of a mayoral candidate in the Philippines before polls opened on Monday, a military spokeswoman said.
In all.
Polls were scheduled to remain open until 6 p.m. local time (10 a.m. GMT).
"It's a very crucial litmus test to our democracy, our fragile democracy," said Leila De Lima, chairwoman of the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines, which will be serving as an independent election monitor.
"The right of suffrage is a fundamental human right," she added.
Whereas in the past, people were paid to vote, this time they are paid to waive their right to vote and have their index fingers marked with ink, making them ineligible, according to PNP.
Election watchdog group Kontra Daya on Saturday condemned the Commission on Elections' approval of presidential son Juan Miguel Arroyo as first nominee of a political party made up entirely of security guards.
Last month Kontra Daya identified 40 questionable party-list groups, showing their links to various people in the Arroyo administration or the president's family, including her sister-in-law, who represents a party of small entrepreneurs.
The Commission on Elections said Acosta, who is listed under the "KBL" party founded by Ferdinand Marcos, would remain on the ballot because so many ballots had already been printed.
