(CNN) -- McLaren may want a reunion with Fernando Alonso, but the Spaniard has no intention of leaving Ferrari.
But any hopes McLaren had of luring Alonso back were quickly quashed, with the two-time world champion declaring he saw his long-term future with Ferrari.
I have three more years with Ferrari and I hope many more to come if we can extend the contract and that will be my hope."
Two-time world champion Alonso has been with Ferrari since 2010, but his position as the team's undisputed No.
Alonso is desperate to win a world title with F1's most successful team, but has been thwarted by Red Bull's triple world champion Sebastian Vettel and a car which has at times been uncompetitive.
