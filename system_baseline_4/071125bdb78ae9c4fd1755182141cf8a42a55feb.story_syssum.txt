It may now be Albania's liveliest neighborhood, but a little over two decades ago it wasn't even on the map.
The Block ('Ish-Blloku' in Albanian) was Hoxha's refuge.
"If you could compare it, Albania was like North Korea is today," says Enno Bozdo, Tirana's deputy mayor.
The Block was a silent stronghold of Albania's elite.
One example is Duff, a diner inspired by Homer Simpson's drink of choice, where Yankees caps and varsity pennants line the walls and skinny-jeaned Tiranans play table football.
The Block was his perfect opportunity.
On big nights tables are booked in advance, even for drinks.
Almost all of The Block's venue's names are in English, a detail that irks some locals.
Others gripe that The Block's meteoric change has gentrified it beyond the means of most locals.
In the Block it's twice that.
"I like it here," she says.
In 2007 a shade more than a million people visited the country.
"We wanted to see Albania because not many people back home know anything," says Alexei, a French backpacker cycling to Istanbul through the Balkans.
"It's impossible to understand what that regime was like without living in it anyway," he says.
For coffee: Radio Cafe Tirana.
1, Tirana;
Yes, its theme might be cheesier than cheddar sandwich, but Duff is packed most nights and it's a great spot for people-watching in the heart of The Block.
Good for a romantic meal beside the madness.
