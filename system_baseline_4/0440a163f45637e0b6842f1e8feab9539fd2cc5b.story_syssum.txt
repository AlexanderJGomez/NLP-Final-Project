Werner said the couple -- both experienced sailors -- expected the creature to go under the boat before re-emerging on the other side.
"I looked around and I saw this huge whale coming out of the water and smashing against the side of the boat," Werner told CNN.
Because the couple had been sailing without the engine on, the whale had failed to hear them, she said.
The whale did not intend to attack us, it just did not hear us."
Werner said the whale appeared to be unhurt by the experience: "We saw it afterwards and there was no blood or anything.
Obviously it's a bonus if you see a whale but we didn't quite count on having one on top of the boat."
