(CNN) -- A former security guard told CNN on Monday that he was unjustly fired after he took pictures of President Barack Obama's motorcade during a visit to Atlanta in September.
Tate said he was issued a weapon by his security firm on the morning of the President's visit, but no one told him it was a violation of Secret Service protocol for him to carry a gun, he said.
Tate said he was supposed to take the President to two different floors of one of the CDC buildings.
A federal official with knowledge of the investigation into the case said Tate was supposed to stay on the elevator and left to take pictures.
The New York Times, which also interviewed Tate, reported that when he took pictures of the President's limousine, the Secret Service became upset.
He said he deleted the photos and CDC officials took his badge.
It had been a great day up to then, Tate told CNN.
