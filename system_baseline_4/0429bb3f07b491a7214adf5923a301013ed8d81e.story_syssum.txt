How Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan performs if he secures a first round victory in Sunday's Presidential election will determine if this sizable emerging market can restore its luster as an engine for growth and a regional political force.
Turkey enjoyed growth of 6-8% for the better part of his first decade in power.
But many believe this presidential election will not broaden democracy in Turkey, but only help Erdogan consolidate his grip on power in an effort to burnish his legacy.
But they say a successful transition is not a given.
If achieved, Turkey would be in the top ten of global economies.
Whether it can live up to those expectations will depend on prudent financial management, but also on how "Team Erdogan" conducts relations within the global investment community.
It is not unusual for Erdogan to draw comparisons of his leadership to that of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey.
