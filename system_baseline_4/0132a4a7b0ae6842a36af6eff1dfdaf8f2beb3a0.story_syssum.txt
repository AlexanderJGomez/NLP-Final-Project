"In the beginning it was unreal and a little bit surreal that all these clubs wanted Martin, but it's strange what you can get used to," his father Hans Erik Odegaard tells CNN.
He followed that up by scoring the fourth goal in a 4-1 win over Sarpsborg to become the youngest scorer in the Norwegian league.
Odegaard's father, a former footballer at Stromsgodset and Sandefjord, recalls the moment when he realized his son might have what it takes to play professionally.
He was, as always, with me.
"He's obviously still in the early stages of his development but his understanding of the game is very impressive," says Karlsen.
"I have been a regional trainer for the best boys in this area, and I checked how much they trained with the team and by themselves," says Hans Erik.
"It's the pace of the game that makes the difference in adjusting to different levels," says Hans Erik.
We were always changing captain, but he was never picked," he says.
"We've always -- and still do -- talked so much about football.
"If he went to some other countries they might take something out of his game, by telling him to get rid of the ball," Karlsen says.
"Nothing else matters.
We're also in a position that it's not obvious that he will go abroad now."
I don't think it's good for any young boy just to play football and PlayStation.
