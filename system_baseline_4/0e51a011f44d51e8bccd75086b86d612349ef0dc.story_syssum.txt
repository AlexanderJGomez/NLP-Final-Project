(CNN) -- In an attempt to reduce open street prostitution and to improve security for sex workers, Switzerland's largest city, Zurich, is opening "sex drive-ins" Monday.
"It was noisy and dirty because men took the prostitutes to a side street and left used condoms on the streets.
"The project is extremely controversial.
Sex workers have to pay 5 Swiss francs per night to make use of the so-called "sex boxes," but customers don't have to pay an entrance fee.
There are also showers, toilets, a kitchen and washing machines for the women to use, as well as an advice center where they can seek help from social workers.
"We are trying to promote the independence and self-determination of the sex workers," he said.
