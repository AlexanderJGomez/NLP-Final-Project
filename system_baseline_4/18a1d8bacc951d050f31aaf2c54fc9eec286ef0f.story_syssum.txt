Messi, the 2009 FIFA world player of the year, has been hailed as the natural successor to Argentina legend Diego Maradona, who is now his national coach.
"The truth is that Maradona has always been very nice to me, even before he was our coach and I took my first steps as a professional," Messi said.
He wears the No.
10 shirt made famous by Maradona, who won the World Cup for Argentina as captain in 1986 with a series of dazzling displays in Mexico.
"I've always had my family really close by, and my friends," he said.
Hopefully, it will be my World Cup, Argentina's World Cup and that we hit the ground running and play up to peoples' expectations and win the World Cup," Messi said.
"People have an opinion and I respect it.
Messi insists he feels no extra pressure going into the World Cup, with Argentina's first Group B match against Nigeria on June 12, as the intense media cauldron in Spain has prepared him well.
"Once I step onto the pitch, I try to concentrate and get myself into the game.
Argentina are not among the favorites after struggling to impress under Maradona, and Messi admits that European champions Spain, five-time World Cup winners Brazil and 1966 titleholders England are the teams to beat.
