The U.S. announcement came after North Korea recently threatened a pre-emptive nuclear attack on South Korea and the United States in response to stepped-up U.N. Security Council sanctions over its latest nuclear test last month.
Military and White House officials have said current U.S. missile defenses are adequate for the present level of threat, and President Barack Obama said in an interview with ABC News last week that he didn't think North Korea could carry out a missile attack on the United States.
North Korea on Saturday responded to the U.S. announcement by criticizing what it described as the Americans' "hostile policy" and saying it won't negotiate with them over its nuclear program.
Its nuclear weapons "serve as an all-powerful treasured sword for protecting the sovereignty and security of the country," a Foreign Ministry spokesman said, according to the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency.
North Korea responded angrily to the U.N. measures, vowing to carry out its third nuclear test.
