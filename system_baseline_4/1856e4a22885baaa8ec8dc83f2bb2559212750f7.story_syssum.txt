According to iSight, the hackers create fake accounts on social networks masquerading as journalists, government officials and defense contractor employees.
The hackers endeavor to build social network connections with friends, relatives and colleagues of their targets, who included senior American military and diplomatic officials, congressional staffers and defense contractors in the United States and Israel.
But among the more than 2,000 people with whom the hackers made connections are a four-star U.S. admiral, British and Saudi officials, journalists and lawmakers.
"The actors have intimated their interest in specific defense technology as well as military and diplomatic information by their targeting," iSight said.
Facebook says it became aware of the scheme while investigating suspicious activity and has removed the fake profiles associated with the hackers.
The State Department says it has been aware in the past of hackers from Iran using social media websites to investigate targets, including U.S. officials.
