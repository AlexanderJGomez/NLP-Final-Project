(CNN)Nigerian forces fought off Boko Haram militants in the northeastern city of Maiduguri, military officials said Monday, but the extremists seized another town in the same state.
The Islamist militants captured the town, together with its military barracks, a Nigerian military officer said.
He asked not to be named because he's not authorized to speak to the media.
Monguno and its military post served as a buffer  to keep the militants away from Maiduguri.
Kashim Shettima said soldiers will continue their crackdown on the militants.
The attack came a day after President Goodluck Jonathan made a campaign stop in Maiduguri ahead of the February 14 presidential election.
