Obama said his administration is trying to clean up "a mess" left behind by the Bush administration.
He called the release of the Bush-era memos a reckless distraction and belittled Obama's decision to close Guantanamo "with little deliberation and no plan."
In the past two months, the former vice president has become a frequent critic of the new administration in numerous national media interviews.
"The administration asserts that transferring terrorists from a detention facility on an isolated island to a prison inside the U.S. will make Americans safer.
Following in the steps of House Democrats, Senate Democrats on Tuesday rejected the administration's request for $80 million to close the facility.
Obama on Thursday pledged not to release any Guantanamo Bay detainees who threaten the United States.
But Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin said he thinks the U.S. can safely house terror detainees.
The sooner that we bring Guantanamo to a close, the better," he said.
The American people don't want to know how closing Guantanamo Bay will make us more popular, they want to know how closing Guantanamo Bay will make us safer," he said.
We have the best justice system in the world," he said.
Former Navy lawyer Charles Swift, who won a landmark Supreme Court ruling that knocked down the Bush administration's system of military commissions, said U.S. laws already cover the "vast majority" of cases the Obama administration will face.
"I want to ascribe to people the best of motives, and I presume that the former vice president believes for whatever reason that force is the only thing that works," he said.
