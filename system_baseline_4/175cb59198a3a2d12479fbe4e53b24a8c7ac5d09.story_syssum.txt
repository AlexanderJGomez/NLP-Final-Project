Arielle Spiridigliozzi is one of 350 students who have contracted H1N1 at the University of Kansas.
But it was.
A stuffy nose, body aches, fever and coughing make up the litany of symptoms, Spiridigliozzi, 18, and her roommate, Kaitlyn Perry, 18, said they have suffered.
Spiridigliozzi has abided by the the university's request, worried that she could infect another.
It wasn't like I was licking the handlebars of the bus or anything," she said.
While shopping, she came down with a fever and started feeling like she didn't have the strength to stand, she said.
Perry's flu hasn't been confirmed as an H1N1 strain, but a third roommate, the first to get sick, they said, was diagnosed with H1N1.
She said she has not heard of any students being hospitalized because of the flu.
Spiridigliozzi and Perry will get to wander outdoors again once their fevers have dissipated for at least 24 hours without the aid of fever-reducing medications, they said.
"I got all my homework done," Perry said.
"Yeah, I've gotten all my homework done for the next two weeks, probably," added Spiridigliozzi.
