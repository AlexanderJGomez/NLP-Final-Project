LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Jay Leno says immediacy is key to his new show, and he should have plenty of it for his prime time premiere Monday, when Kanye West is a musical guest.

West was booked by Leno weeks ago to perform with two other hip-hop superstars: Rihanna and Jay-Z.
Although Beyonce appeared stunned as she watched from the front row, she gracefully recovered near the end of the show, when she was onstage to accept an award of her own.
"I'm sooooo sorry to Taylor Swift and her fans and her mom," the message said in all caps.
