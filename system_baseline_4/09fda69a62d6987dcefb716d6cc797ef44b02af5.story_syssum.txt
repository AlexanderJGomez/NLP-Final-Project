The work, on artifacts from King Tutankhamun's tomb, includes restoring a statue -- broken by looters in the Egyptian Museum -- of King Tut on a panther, Zahi Hawass told CNN Sunday.
"It will all go back to normal in three days," he said.
Several Egyptologists told CNN in late January they were trying to stay on top of the situation as best they could and sift fact from rumor.
"Some things have turned out not to be true," she said.
Hawass previously was secretary-general of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities.
On January 28, as the protests were under way, a group of people broke into the museum in Cairo, Hawass has said.
But, Hawass wrote in a blog post on Saturday, "The two mummies that were reported as damaged at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo were in fact unidentified skulls dating to the Late Period; these two skulls are not royal mummies."
"The people who are in Europe and America are concerned about Egypt, but what is (important) to remember is that rumors can be very damaging," Hawass wrote in a blog post Friday.
