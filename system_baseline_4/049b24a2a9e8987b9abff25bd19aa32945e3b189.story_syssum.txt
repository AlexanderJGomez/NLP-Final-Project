Washington (CNN) -- A week after the Supreme Court ruled in favor of an Ohio law that restricts early voting, Attorney General Eric Holder argued the decision will disproportionately affect African-Americans, many of whom "heavily" use early voting.
The law cut down the state's 35-day early voting window by seven days.
A federal judge had previously said the law was unconstitutional and placed a hold on it so it couldn't go into effect.
In his video message, Holder said early voting is "heavily used" by African-Americans because the practice is popular among people who have a hard time getting to the polls due to childcare responsibilities, hourly salaries, and reduced access to transportation.
Holder announced late last month he'll soon be resigning from his post, but will stay on until a replacement has been confirmed.
