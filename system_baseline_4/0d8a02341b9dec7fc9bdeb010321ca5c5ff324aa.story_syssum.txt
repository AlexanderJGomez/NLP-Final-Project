Now Jay-Z charts his escape from the hard-knock life, describes the reunion that healed the wounds of his childhood -- and even reveals his personal creed.
Jay-Z spoke with Oprah Winfrey about his father, his anger and his old life.
Jay-Z: Anger.
Never wanting to let myself get close to someone like that again.
Oprah: Wow.
Jay-Z: We were told our parents would separate, but the reasons weren't explained.
Jay-Z: I summed it up that they weren't getting along.
Jay-Z: Yeah.
Jay-Z: It made me not express my feelings as much.
Oprah: I've read that when you were 12, you shot your brother in the shoulder.
Jay-Z: About 16.
Jay-Z: My mom set up a meeting.
I was saying, "You know, Ma, I've really been trying to look inward, and maybe I'm just not meant to fall in love like other people do."
Jay-Z: And I guess from that point, she figured out what was wrong with me, and she planned a meeting between me and my father.
Jay-Z: I never looked at that.
Jay-Z: I believed that.
Oprah: The second time, your father showed up.
Jay-Z: He showed up.
I'm like, "I was a kid!
Jay-Z: When I was 9, my dad's brother got stabbed, and my dad went looking for the guy who did it.
You can't do that."
Jay-Z: He was broken.
Jay-Z: A couple of months.
Jay-Z: Pretty much.
Jay-Z: Absolutely.
Jay-Z: Now I'm having an aha moment!
Jay-Z: As a kid, I didn't know any better.
Jay-Z: All the time.
