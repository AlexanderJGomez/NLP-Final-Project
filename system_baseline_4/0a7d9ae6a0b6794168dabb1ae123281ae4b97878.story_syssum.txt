As families prepare for air travel this coming Memorial Day weekend, United Airlines won't be offering early boarding to families in coach with small children.
The airline does allow passengers with children traveling in first class or business class to board early.
"That message has been communicated."
As a policy, American Airlines also does not specifically allow families with children to get on aircraft before general boarding.
JetBlue offers families traveling coach with children under age 2 to board early, the airline said.
Delta Air Lines said it also offers passengers with children an opportunity to preboard, including those with first class and business class tickets.
"We're always looking for ways to make the boarding process a little more efficient and quicker for our passengers," said spokeswoman Liz Landau.
