The U.S. Navy on Tuesday announced it was canceling all the air shows its Blue Angels Flight Demonstration Squadron had scheduled for the rest of the year.
The Navy, Air Force and the rest of the federal government must deal with $85 billion in cuts for the rest of fiscal year 2013, which ends September 30, that were mandated by a 2011 agreement by Congress that raised the federal debt ceiling.
The Navy team had also canceled a performance set for MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida, last weekend.
The Navy said the Blue Angels will continue to train at their base in Pensacola, Florida, for when the budget crunch ends.
The Navy intends to continue aerial demonstrations in the future as the budget situation permits," the service's statement said.
