The 36-year-old chose Australia Day to make his decision public, coming at the end of the third day of the fourth and final Test against India in Adelaide.
"It is with great pride and happiness that I make the decision to retire from Tests and one-day internationals," he said in a statement on Saturday.
Gilchrist took over the gloves from Ian Healy -- third on the list with 395 dismissals from 119 Tests -- in November 1999, and went on to establish himself both as a wicketkeeper and as a batsman of brutal hitting capabilities.
Jaques was the first to fall, bowled by India captain Anil Kumble for a patient 60 off 159 deliveries.
But Ponting, who has struggled for form so far in the series, ground out his 40th half-century in Tests and Clarke provided able support to take Australia through to the close of play with no further loss of wickets.
