(CNN) -- Nearly 35 years after a Texas judge sentenced him to death, Ronald Chambers was found dead Monday morning on the floor of his cell.
But Leach said Chambers had many health complications when he came last year to the Dallas County jail.
On December 18, 1975, a jury found Chambers guilty of capital murder and a judge subsequently put him on the state's death row.
While numerous reports called Chambers the "Dean of Death Row," because of the various legal maneuverings he didn't have a death sentence the entire time he was behind bars, including at the time of his death.
