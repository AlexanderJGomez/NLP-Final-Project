(CNN) -- Milton might be dead on "The Walking Dead," but actor Dallas Roberts (who portrayed the Governor's one-time lackey) is very glad to be alive -- and finally able to talk about the show's season three finale.
All season long, Milton has been kept squeaky clean, raising serious questions such as, "Where is he sending his dry cleaning?"
Roberts laughed.
He's always tucked in,'" Roberts continued.
Milton never got the sexy anything, did he?"
Milton didn't imagine that he would be "used as a tool to take Andrea out" as well, and if he had, "he would have behaved differently," Roberts said.
In the original plan for the scene, there actually was a bullet involved, but during the reshoot, it was changed to a stabbing.
"Before the door opened and he throws me to my knees, he and I were crying, laughing, at the jokes we were making," Roberts said.
Roberts laughed.
Besides, assuming he was on the outs, Roberts swiped a beaker that Milton used to use.
