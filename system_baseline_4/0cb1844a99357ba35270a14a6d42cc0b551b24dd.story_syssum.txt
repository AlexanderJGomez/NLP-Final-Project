IBM's sponsorship of the Masters tournament guarantees club membership for its officers, but Rometty is a woman, and the club does not allow women to join.
IBM spokesman Ed Barbini told CNN Wednesday that the company would not comment on the controversy.
Burk says there are only two choices at hand: Augusta can open its doors to women, or IBM can yank its money and force its male executives to resign from the club.
"Those are the only two options that are viable that are going to wash with the public," Burk told CNN last week.
"Augusta is a private club, and their personal membership is an internal matter," he said.
On the eve of the 2012 Masters opening Thursday, speculation surfaced that Payne, known to be more progressive than his predecessor, will offer Rometty a membership, but only after the tournament ends and the gender debate dies down.
That means that Rometty will probably not show up this year in a green jacket.
