Critics of using stimulus money for the bridge say it would give the software giant a break on a pet project.
Marchione applied for federal stimulus money after costs jumped on the project from $25 million to $36 million.
Microsoft is hardly getting the bridge for free.
"This is $11 million where we are substituting public money for private money, and that means there's some other project that would have a greater benefit than a bridge to Microsoft that's not being built," says Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense.
But without the stimulus money, Marchione counters, the bridge may not have been built.
Microsoft is one of the most lucrative companies in the country," Ellis says.
Microsoft did not respond to CNN requests for an interview on the bridge project.
Chris Gregoire certified 138 projects, including the bridge, to receive stimulus funding.
Even if Microsoft wanted to pay for this project on their own, legally they are required to work with the public sector."
But Ennis also says the bridge does not fit with the kind of projects the stimulus plan is meant to bankroll.
