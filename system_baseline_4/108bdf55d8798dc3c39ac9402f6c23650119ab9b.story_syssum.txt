Despite his assurances, how did Ebola spread from one patient to another inside the United States?
But faced with his biggest challenge -- the current Ebola outbreak -- some are questioning if his experience and leadership style are enough to stop the virus from spreading in the United States.
But we know how to stop it," he said last week.
And last week, a nurse who cared for that man was confirmed to have Ebola.
After the news that a Dallas nurse had become the first person to contract Ebola inside the United States, the CDC director almost immediately said that a breach of protocol had occurred.
Stop Ebola."
she said.
Frieden on Monday said state and federal health officials are re-examining the protocols, including the removal of protective gear after contact with an Ebola patient and if it might be helpful to spray virus-killing solution on workers as they leave an isolation unit.
New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Mary Bassett, who worked with Frieden when he held that role, said she witnessed Frieden's faith in the numbers.
When Frieden arrived in New York as health commissioner, there were about a thousand cases of TB in the city, Bassett recalled.
Ask Frieden what he considers the high point of his career, and he will refer to the time he spent in India, said Dr. Alfredo Morabia, an epidemiologist and historian who has followed Frieden's work.
What data has resulted in Frieden's confidence in the ability to stop Ebola?
The blog is hardly remarkable, but because it allows comments, it is ostensibly one way for the public to put their opinions in front of him.
It's unlikely that the CDC director will see these comments, but what if he did?
If the director is interested in hearing suggestions, they are piling up from other health care professionals and members of the public interested enough about the Ebola outbreak to post a message on his blog.
It's risky.
