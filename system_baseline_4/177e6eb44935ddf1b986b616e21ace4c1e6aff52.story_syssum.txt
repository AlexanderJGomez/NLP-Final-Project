Fort Meade, Maryland (CNN) -- Bradley Manning, the Army private whose disclosure of hundreds of thousands of U.S. military and diplomatic documents gave American officials a global case of heartburn, was sentenced to more than three decades in prison Wednesday.
The attorney, David Coombs, said the statement was part of Manning's application for a pardon from President Barack Obama.
"We're still here fighting for you Bradley!"
another said.
Manning will be eligible for parole in 10 years, Coombs said.
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who last week criticized what he called a "forced" apology by Manning, said the sentence was "a significant tactical victory" for the defense.
"Mr. Manning's treatment has been intended to send a signal to people of conscience in the U.S. government who might seek to bring wrongdoing to light," Assange, now holed up in the Ecuador's embassy in London, said in a written statement.
"Bradley Manning betrayed his country, his obligations as a soldier and the trust of all Americans.
"Given the vast damage he did to our national security and the need to send a strong signal to others who may be tempted to disclose classified information, this is a dangerous conclusion," McKeon added.
Joe Morrow, the prosecutor, said Manning's arrogance meant that he "felt he alone was knowledgeable and intelligent enough to determine what information was to be classified."
But Coombs said Manning was "a young man capable of being redeemed" and urged Lind to hand down "a sentence that allows him to have a life."
