Malik said one of the youths distracted the driver of the car that carried Malala, while the other asked a bystander to identify her.
Police said last week that they had arrested six men in connection with the shooting, but were still searching for Khan, who was studying for a master's degree in chemistry.
The 15-year-old Malala initially gained international attention in 2009, writing a blog about her life as the Taliban gained a foothold in her home region, in northwest Pakistan near the border with Afghanistan.
Malik called her "the pride of Pakistan" and said "we would love her to come back."
Malik is scheduled to visit Malala on Monday in her hospital in Birmingham, England, where she is recovering from her head wound.
He said she had asked for her school books so she can study for exams, which he said will be given to her when she returns.
