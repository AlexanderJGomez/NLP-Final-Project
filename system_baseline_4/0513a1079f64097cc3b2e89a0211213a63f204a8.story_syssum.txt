(CNN)  -- "LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean" holds fast to the pirate code with great humor and animation, appeal for all ages and massive replayability after the main story mode is complete.
Players can use up to eight different characters on each level during story mode, but that can lead to a crowded screen.
Ellison said the settings are as iconic as they could be and the team tried to put the LEGO spin on the movies.
Since the films' characters are so well known, he said the team wanted to make sure to include little details to help players relate to each character.
"Eight collectibles in each level and 10 ships in a bottle can be found," Ellison said.
Said Ellison: "The exploration game play ties into the ideology of 'Pirates of the Caribbean.'
Ellison said each scene has to be solvable for all ages, and the game teaches you what to do and where to look as it goes along.
Plus we took the same slapstick humor from the films and just made more of it."
"We will have some of the same locations but none of the dialogue (LEGO characters do not speak, only grunt).
Unlike previous LEGO games, which forced the two characters to stay in the same screenshot, "LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean" actually splits the screen as the characters walk away from each other.
However, the split in the split screen moved around in relation to where the characters were on the level.
Once each level is completed in story mode, free play mode is unlocked, allowing you to use any of the characters you have available to solve puzzles that couldn't be previously figured out.
The game is also available for the Nintendo 3DS, but there are only 16 levels, and you can use only one character during each level.
It ramps up the humor from the films and offers plenty of action for players.
I mean, Captain Jack Sparrow ... is worthy of any would-be pirate.
