(CNN) -- It took a lot of effort for Leo Bonten to turn his amputated leg into a fully functional lamp.
But it really happened.
So, Bonten, now 53, settled in to the fact that he would be losing his right leg -- a harsh reality for an otherwise healthy and active man.
"It's my legal right."
Well, what if I bring in my own tin foil?"
Body parts can also be buried during some sort of official funeral (and, perhaps, exhumed) with proper legal oversight.
Still, he wanted his leg, for he had a crazy idea.
Thus, Bonten and the hospital entered a complicated period of legal negotiations, where they finally came to a mutual agreement after a strange set of circumstances.
You see, as per his profession, van de Goot was able to legally obtain Bonten's leg from the hospital after surgery.
And, ultimately, he would preserve the leg with chemicals so it could remain ... a leg.
Almost.
They made a lamp out of his leg.
Above that is an empty space.
Bonten explained to me that the one he's getting through his insurance is not top of the line.
Something more agile.
So, he decided to sell his lamp on eBay for â‚¬100,000 -- an endeavor that lasted not even two days before the online bidding site rejected his listing.
So, until somebody comes to him with an offer, Bonten will just keep it at home, where he just returned after a lengthy stint in rehab.
His lamp will arrive on Sunday, and he'll finally be re-united with his leg.
