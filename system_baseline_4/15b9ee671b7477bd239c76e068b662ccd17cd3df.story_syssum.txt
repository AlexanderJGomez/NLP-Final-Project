Judge Sonia Sotomayor would be the first Hispanic person to serve on the Supreme Court.
If confirmed, Sotomayor will be the first Hispanic person and only the third woman to serve on the nation's highest court.
Sotomayor has called her mother her inspiration and said she instilled in her the values of education.
Gender, ethnicity and socioeconomics are no longer the obstacles they once were, he said.
Ramirez said Latino people have been waiting a long time for a person of Latino descent to be nominated to the court.
"It's here!
David Perez, a 23-year-old student at Yale Law School, where Sotomayor attended, said many people in the Hispanic community feel such excitement about the nomination that they're almost numb.
Sotomayor's nomination "helps to create a tapestry of this country that is very reflective of the people who live in it," Ramirez said.
Anne Guarnera, spokeswoman for the Hispanic College Fund, said Latinos are inspired by the fact that someone of their ethnic group is being portrayed in such a positive light.
Sotomayor will inspire young Latinas to chase their dreams, she said.
But Sotomayor's nomination serves as proof, she said.
