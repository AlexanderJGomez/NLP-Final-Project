Philadelphia (CNN) -- A singer is being sought for questioning in connection with the death of a woman following a cosmetic procedure, police said Friday.
Aderotimi and three other women had traveled from England to undergo the cosmetic procedure in Philadelphia, police said.
The preliminary cause of death has been linked to the injection, according to the affidavit.
Last year in New Jersey, state health officials launched an investigation into infections related to cosmetic injections after six women were hospitalized for complications.
Tan has heard reports of caulk and other products being used in the injections, as well as injection substances being purchased outside of medical supply stores, she said.
"In our cluster, these patients had to be hospitalized," she said, adding that injection procedures should be performed by licensed health providers.
