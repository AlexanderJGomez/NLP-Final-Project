Boy?
The man on the phone was offering us young children with the casualness of a market trader.
We were told he was one of the men running this "unofficial" displaced camp -- one of the many that has mushroomed in the town of Yola as the influx of people fleeing Boko Haram has grown beyond the capacity of the official camps.
When our colleague want to see them, he was shown a group of children and asked which one he wanted to take.
I told him we wanted to know what we'd need to do, if we decided we did want to "foster" the children.
He told me, "Sister, Jesus will reward me," so the "fostering" was free, he said.
The Global Slavery Index says Nigeria has the highest number of people in modern slavery of any sub-Saharan country.
Did I want to consider an older girl?
Either way, two girls would be ready tomorrow, he said.
Our last phone conversation revolved around what an appropriate "donation" would be in exchange for the children.
I put the phone down and we traveled back to the capital that day to show Naptip what we'd found.
