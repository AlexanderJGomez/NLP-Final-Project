I couldn't have won either fight without having nature on my side.
Now I'm working hard to protect natural areas that will provide the source of future drugs that could save millions of lives.
Nature was a good teacher.
But as they worked I found some comfort when I learned that one of them was derived from an African flower, the rosy periwinkle.
My cancer is now in remission and once again I owe my survival to working with nature.
This promise extends to other diseases as well, with half the new drugs created in the past 25 years derived from nature.
Right now, there's a bipartisan bill in Congress, the Global Conservation Act of 2010, that seeks to address extinction and natural resource depletion worldwide by laying out a strategy for helping other countries protect millions of square miles of natural habitat.
According to the World Conservation Union, more than 16,000 species, plant and animal alike, are in danger of extinction, largely because of human activities.
I won "Survivor: Africa," and I've won my battle against cancer.
The rosy periwinkle saved my life.
