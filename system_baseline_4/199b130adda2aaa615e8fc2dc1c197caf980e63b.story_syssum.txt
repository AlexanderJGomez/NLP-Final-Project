From a white lie about time spent as a customer service rep to a whopper about earning an MBA, résumé padding occurs regularly across industries, experts say.
The most common lie on a résumé has to do with education, said Kim Isaacs, founder and director of ResumePower.com and Monster.com's résumé expert.
In the wake of the allegation, made by shareholder firm Third Point, Yahoo removed all references to Thompson's degree from his biography on its website and said the error "in no way alters that fact that Mr. Thompson is a highly qualified executive with a successful track record leading large consumer technology companies."
"Thompson has a degree in accounting, not computer science, but frankly at this point in his career does it really matter what he studied as an undergraduate?"
On the other hand, Bausch & Lomb's Ronald Zarrella offered to resign when it was discovered that he had not earned his MBA from NYU, as he'd claimed.
Résumé padding has become a point of increasing concern for companies big and small, prompting them to step up screening methods and background checks for job applicants, according to HireRight's Employment Screening Benchmarking Report.
Isaacs sees résumé padding with growing frequency in her role as a résumé adviser because of the fluctuating job market and high unemployment rates.
People see job postings for which they feel they have the right experience but not the requisite degree, prompting them to fabricate an extra line on their résumés, Isaacs said.
It's a combination of wanting to get an edge and jobs being limited due to the economy," she said.
It's easy to disparage Thompson, she said, but given the high incidence of résumé padding in general, people should use this opportunity to take a second look at their own résumés.
Do you think Scott Thompson deserves a pass or should he be reprimanded?
