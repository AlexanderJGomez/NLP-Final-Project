The freshman comedy, about a successful African-American family man's struggle with cultural identity, made its debut on the network Wednesday night to impressive ratings.
To put it another way: This is exactly how you want your pilot episode to launch.
"I guess for a kid from the 'hood, I'm living the American dream," Anderson's Dre says in an opening voiceover.

But while Dre's fretting could (and does) raise more serious conversations about race, class and identity, "Black-ish" is still a comedy, and critics have praised it for knowing just how to leverage its complex subject for laughs.
It can't just be funny, it has to be astute and adept as well.
'Black-ish's' nuance is promising -- it's aware that there's not just one way to be black -- and the sheer level of execution suggests it has staying power," he said.
"For now, I can only say what I want to hear about any new half-hour: it happens to be funny."
