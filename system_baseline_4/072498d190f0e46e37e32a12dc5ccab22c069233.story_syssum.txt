(Mashable)  -- UK artist Banksy, he of the guerilla techniques and ever-increasing popularity, is about to be unceremoniously identified to the highest bidder in an eBay auction, which ends Wednesday.
The seller also says that eBay had previously terminated his auction because he was selling an intangible good; the seller is now technically offering for auction a piece of paper containing Banksy's legal name.
However, we read on the artist's website that not all Banksy work that is sold necessarily corresponds to the artist himself.
Would you want to know Banksy's identity, or do you think he deserves to live privately and relatively anonymously?
