An armed burglar entered her Atlanta home in the early morning hours and tied Windom's hands to the headboard of her bed, police said.
Fortunately, the man did not take her laptop, which lay within reach of Windom's feet.
"I dragged my laptop over and with my feet I pried it open," she said.
Campos said an investigation into the incident is under way.
"I don't have the world's prettiest feet, but I think I'll keep them," she said.
