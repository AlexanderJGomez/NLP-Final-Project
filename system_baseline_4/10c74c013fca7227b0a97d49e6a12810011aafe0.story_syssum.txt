Ryan Taylor, right, and client Shawn Stockman of Boyz II Men at Taylor's downtown Los Angeles office.
Taylor says he wants to change the apparel business model by personalizing a customer's needs, instead of having large inventories and high overhead costs that can quickly put someone out of business in a bad economy.
He borrowed money to pay for a booth, but like many entrepreneurial designers getting started, Taylor said buyers were not interested in clothing without established brand names.

"Nine times out of 10 we visit clients in their home or offices, we take their measurements right there inside their office, have them select the fabric they prefer, take their measurements right then and there, and [in] a couple weeks have a tailor-made garment to wear," he said.
Taylor told CNN's Ted Rowlands that one of his first clients was the late comedian Bernie Mac.
"Our business model is remarkably fit and lean," he said.
"We eliminate the cost to have your clothes tailored and we eliminate the time it takes to go shopping," said Taylor.
In a volatile economic climate, Taylor is not cutting back.
