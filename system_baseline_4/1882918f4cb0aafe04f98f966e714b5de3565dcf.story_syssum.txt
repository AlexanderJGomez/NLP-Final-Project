But the news came too late for Jevon Thomas, a worker who died of a rare cancer in April, penniless and distraught.
He didn't want to talk to anybody," says his daughter, Monet Thomas.
It's not known how many of those who worked at ground zero have died of cancer, according to Dr. Michael Crane, director of the World Trade Center Health Program Clinical Center at New York's Mount Sinai School of Medicine.
Thomas was working for a company that installs portable toilets when the planes hit the World Trade Center.
At the time, workers could apply for money from the federal September 11th Victim Compensation Fund if they suffered respiratory problems -- but not cancer, because a scientific link had not been found between the disease and breathing in the fumes at ground zero.
"Instead of everyone uniting, coming together, and figuring out a way to help you, they're figuring out a way of not helping you to save a dollar," Thomas said in 2010.
All he cared about was me and my brother," Monet Thomas says through tears.
When CNN interviewed Thomas two years ago, he said he was "100% sure" his cancer came from his work at ground zero.
While someone's cancer might be because of his or her work at ground zero, it might also have been a coincidence -- Thomas might have gotten cancer anyway.
"People were very concerned that they were going to pull the trigger on the (federal) coverage too soon and they would end up covering people who didn't have a World Trade Center cancer," Crane says.
Monet Thomas says her father would be "grateful" for the decision to compensate cancer victims who worked at ground zero, even though it took more than a decade.
Even though her father was depressed, destitute and felt alone at the end of his life, she says he never regretted his work on the pile.
