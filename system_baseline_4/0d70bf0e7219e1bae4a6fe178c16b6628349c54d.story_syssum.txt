(CNN)Last month's so-so jobs numbers confirm the challenges our economy still faces.
Low-wage workers have been the hardest hit since the onset of the financial crisis, and low-wage jobs remain a fixture of the new economy.
Congress should help low-wage workers gain access to predictable work schedules.
Not surprisingly, such haphazard scheduling wreaks havoc with low-wage workers.
A University of Chicago study found that 41% of early career hourly workers and 47% who work part-time received a week or less of notice of their work schedules.
Similarly, a large proportion of minorities work low-wage jobs.
Child care is the primary casualty of just-in-time scheduling.
Traditional economic safeguards have offered little help to these workers.
And in December, San Francisco became the first jurisdiction to pass a "retail worker bill of rights."
Last summer, The Schedules that Work Act was introduced in Congress.
According to the National Women's Law Center, the bill would provide workers the right to request and receive predictable work schedules, receive compensation for sudden scheduling changes, and not fear retaliation if they request scheduling accommodations from their boss.
The bill protects families and allows them to attend to their many obligations, not just work.
Conversely, just-in-time scheduling increases worker turnover and hurts worker satisfaction.
It's the stock man at an Amazon fulfillment center in Lehigh Valley who can't get his son to pre-algebra tutoring because of his erratic shifts.
They can start by passing legislation that better protects shift workers from arbitrary and unpredictable scheduling practices.
