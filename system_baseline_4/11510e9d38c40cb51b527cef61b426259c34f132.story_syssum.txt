Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Large explosions and the sound of jets over Tripoli Thursday night indicated NATO has likely increased the intensity of its air strikes on Moammar Gadhafi's key command and control military sites.
U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates disclosed that the drones saw their first use in Libya Thursday, but poor weather forced them to return.
Rebels, who have complained that NATO was not being aggressive enough to protect civilians, said Thursday they had gained control of a key border crossing into Tunisia.
He said the rebels detained 14 members of Gadhafi's forces.
More than 1,000 rescued migrants were on board, as were the bodies of photojournalists Tim Hetherington and Chris Hondros, killed in Misrata on Wednesday, the organization said.
Another said, "US and UK with your loss, you shared with us the price of freedom."
France and Italy announced Wednesday that they will send military officers to Libya to advise the rebels.
"You cannot please everyone all the time," he said.
Britain said its contingent of military officers will be sent to Benghazi to serve in an advisory role.
Clinton said Washington has "a lot of confidence in NATO" and is pleased with the performance of America's allies in the conflict.
Among them were the two acclaimed photojournalists.
Mohammed said rebels have "annihilated" Gadhafi forces and have defeated snipers in the city in the past few days.
