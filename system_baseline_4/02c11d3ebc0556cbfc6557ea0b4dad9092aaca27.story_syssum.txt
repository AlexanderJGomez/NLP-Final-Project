We use antibiotics to treat bacterial infections.
But over time, the bacteria evolved.
Over time, we are often forced to develop new antibiotics to beat infections that were previously treated easily.
In this case, CRE infections kill about half of patients who have bloodstream infections.
Over time, though, a strain of bacteria, known as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, became a problem in hospitals.
Over time, though, it got out into the community.
These days, though, we pretty much assume it's the cause, and treat with stronger drugs.
Each time we use antibiotics unnecessarily, say to treat a virus, we make the problem worse.
This is a real public health issue.
It's much, much more likely, though, that these same people will ask for antibiotics when they get a cold.
That's the kind of thing we need to stop now.
