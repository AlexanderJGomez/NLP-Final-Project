The truck was spotted in a military parade in Pyongyang last weekend with what experts say is a new long-range rocket on board.
The U.N. Security Council committee that monitors implementation of the sanctions on North Korea is investigating, the official said.
Charles Vick, a missile analyst for GlobalSecurity.org, points out the truck may not have been made in China.
Or China may have sold the truck to North Korea in the years before the sanctions were in place.
Cordesman said there is much we don't know about the rocket.
But North Korea's recent failed launch demonstrated that it has made little progress in developing long-range missiles, according to the director of the U.S. Missile Defense Agency.
And their progress has not been made apparent in this latest flight test."
