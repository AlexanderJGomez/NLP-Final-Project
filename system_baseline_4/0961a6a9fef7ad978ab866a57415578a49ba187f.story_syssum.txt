DHAKA, Bangladesh (CNN)  -- More than 1,700 people have died in Bangladesh after a devastating tropical cyclone ripped through the western coast of the country, and the toll is expected to rise, a government spokesman tells CNN.
Thousands of people have been displaced and many are still missing.
The government has identified the 12 worst districts -- all of them located on the southern coast -- out of the 23 affected by the cyclone, Munaim said.

He said 280,000 families have been rendered homeless by the cyclone, but many have been able to get shelter from family members.
Those teams have cash with them to buy relief supplies from local wholesalers, said Chowdhury, who said the latest number of people injured was 15,000 with 1,000 missing.
Chowdhury said about 600,000 people had fled, adding that about 2 million people lived along the coast.
Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the U.S. Mission in Bangladesh, anticipating the storm, pre-positioned 16 Zodiac boats, water treatment systems, water ambulances and food for a more rapid response.
