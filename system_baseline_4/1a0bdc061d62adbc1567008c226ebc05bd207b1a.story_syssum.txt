Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iran has successfully test-fired a new version of its Fateh missile, which has a longer range than previous models, Iranian news agencies reported Wednesday.
He also denied that Iran's implementation of the Fateh missile was linked to the recent purchase of U.S.-made Patriot missiles by Kuwait, according to Fars.
The test-firing of the missile came days after Iran unveiled the first long-range military drone manufactured in the country, state media reported.
The U.S. State Department called the Iranian proposal a stalling tactic and said world powers would not "front" the fuel to Iran.
A stalemate ensued.
