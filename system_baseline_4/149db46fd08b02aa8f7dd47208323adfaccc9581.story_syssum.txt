Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN) -- A few miles south of the town of Starobeshevo in eastern Ukraine, a group of men in uniform is slumped under a tree.
The drive north from the port city of Mariupol -- only a couple of miles from the Russian border -- offered no evidence of a Ukrainian presence.
Certainly the rebel forces, now united under the banner of Novorossiya -- or New Russia -- are better armed and organized than they were two months ago.
By contrast, a small detachment of Ukrainian troops we encountered on the way north seemed demoralized.
Several houses had been badly damaged and at least one was destroyed by a direct hit.
The husband, Victor, said he was pure Ukrainian but accused the government of lying to the people.
"The Ukrainians came like peacekeepers," he said, "but then they kill us.
But accreditation could be obtained only in Donetsk, a city not so easy to enter now with the Ukrainian army shelling it.
Instead he put two of his men in our minivan and dispatched us with an escort to Donetsk, some 30 miles away.
The outdoor cafes and parks that were crowded in the early summer are deserted and more stores are boarded up.
It seems most of the people who are still here are those with nowhere else to go, caught in the middle of a war that threatens to lurch into the bitterly cold winter.
