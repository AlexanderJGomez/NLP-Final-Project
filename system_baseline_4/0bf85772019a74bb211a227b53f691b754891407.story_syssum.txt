A Toyota Prius hybrid, owned  by Luscious Garage, has been converted to run on electricity.
"The regular Prius is a gasoline dependent car; it doesn't get energy from anywhere but the gas tank," said Coquillette.
Coquillette expects to begin conversions to even more efficient lithium batteries soon.
"Gas becomes optional," with this conversion, Coquillette said.
"We've seen such a diverse group of people," said Coquillette.
They don't endorse or discourage it.
Hartline said the Prius was not designed with any conversion possibilities in mind, but she said the company welcomes any technology that pushes the envelope on plug-in batteries.
Much more research is needed, she said, about how hybrid owners would use their vehicles.
â€¢ In what other ways will the energy infrastructure have to change?
Luscious Garage will soon open a second location for the growing number of really green hybrid owners.
Then there is plug-in hybrid technology, which is the next step, which genuinely removes your dependence on fossil fuel," said Coquillette.
