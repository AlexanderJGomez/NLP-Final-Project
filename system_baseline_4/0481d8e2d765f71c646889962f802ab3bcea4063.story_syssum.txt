Relief groups and state agencies are registering volunteers to help with recovery efforts in storm-damaged areas in the days and weeks to come.
The organization is preliminarily registering volunteers and will be organizing disaster recovery projects after the storm passes.
The New Jersey Office of Volunteerism and AmeriCorps will match volunteers based on availability and skills.
Volunteers of any skill level can register online.
Red Cross volunteers have been dispatched from across the country to help the East Coast.
In all emergency and disaster situations, volunteers should not self-deploy -- for their own safety and the safety of others.
