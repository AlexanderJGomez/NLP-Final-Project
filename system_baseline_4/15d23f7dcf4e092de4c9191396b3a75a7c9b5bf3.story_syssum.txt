(CNN) -- Three men who toppled an ancient boulder in Utah's Goblin Valley State Park have been booted from their Boy Scout leadership roles.
The three men, all from Utah, defended their actions in interviews last week, saying the delicate structure posed a threat to visitors.
But when CNN affiliate KUTV noted that Taylor didn't look particularly debilitated in the video, he replied, "You didn't see how hard I pushed."
"We have now modified Goblin Valley, a new Goblin Valley exists," Hall is heard saying at the end of his video.
So it's all about saving lives here at Goblin Valley.
That's what we're all about."
"Obviously, we're very concerned and upset that somebody would come and destroy this natural wonder that took millions of years to be formed," he told KUTV.
"We thought we were doing a good deed," Taylor told the affiliate.
