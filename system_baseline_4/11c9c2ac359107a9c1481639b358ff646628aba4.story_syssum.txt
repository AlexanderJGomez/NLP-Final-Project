(CNN) -- Spain striker Fernando Torres may not be fit for the start of the World Cup, according to his English club Liverpool.
He told Liverpool's official Web site: "You can't be absolutely certain of anything but at this stage, if he continues to progress the way he is, he should be fit to play at some stage during the World Cup.
Adler has been told he needs surgery on a rib injury, aggravated while playing for his club Bayer Leverkusen during their weekend German Bundesliga draw with Hertha Berlin.
He said: "I am very pleased with the healing process but it is now definitively clear that the World Cup finals for me make no sense.
Meanwhile, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy has been left out of Holland's provisional World Cup squad, but coach Bert Van Marwijk says it doesn't necessarily spell the end of his World Cup dream.
"I'm leaving him until that date to convince me that he is sufficiently in shape to take part in the World Cup."
