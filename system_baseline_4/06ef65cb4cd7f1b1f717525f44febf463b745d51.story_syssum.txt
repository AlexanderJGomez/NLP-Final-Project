Robb Reiner: My initial reaction was that this was going to be cool, but I wasn't really sure if anybody would care.
Kudlow: It was purposely done.
Reiner: It's fair.

Kudlow: It's pretty much what you see is what happened.
Kudlow: Sort of.
Reiner: For me it was Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Grand Funk, Cactus, bands like that.
Reiner: It's like foreshadowing there.
You don't.
CNN: It's easy to make fun of a band -- or make a tragedy out of a band -- that doesn't quite make it.
Reiner: We've been successful a lot as far as we're concerned.
Kudlow: Most of the magic that's involved here is the fact that we've always kept our guns loaded.

Reiner: It's called the Anvil Experience.
Reiner: "Juggernaut of Justice" is our next album.
