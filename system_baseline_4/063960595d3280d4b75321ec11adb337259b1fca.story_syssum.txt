There will be quick-fire Spanish, varying degrees of English and jokes in the way I've only ever heard my Cuban relatives parry back and forth.
I'm flying not to Havana but to Miami, where my grandparents and other relatives came years after Fidel Castro took over Cuba, when it became clear there would be no free speech for anyone but him.
When they applied to leave the country, Cuban government officials did an inventory of the contents of their home.
When we land Tuesday in Miami, my mother and uncle will meet us at the airport and rush us to Havana Harry's or some coffee stand where I can get a real Cuban coffee -- none of this Starbucks silliness.
Every bit of Cuba I get is gleaned from pictures, music, stories people tell me and these trips to see Miami family, where I get hints of my ancestry in the food and jokes and presents.
I've never seen the sleepy, agricultural town of Pinar del Rio where my mother was born and lived until her teenage years.
The Christmas heat in Miami must be similar to what they feel in Cuba, only a short flight to the south.
Around midday on Christmas Eve some of us will head to El Palacio de Los Jugos for lunch and Cuban sandwiches.
My definition of beauty isn't blond hair or blue eyes or any classic American stereotype.
To Miami, not to Cuba.
But I am tired of the ads for religious charity trips to Cuba and all-inclusive beach resorts where tourists get pampered while my people, once removed, depend on charity for the most basic medical supplies.
I don't want to hear any more stereotypes about who my people are or tourists talking about going to visit Cuba "before it changes."
I want to put those hints together, fill in the gaps and see for the first time, where I am from.
