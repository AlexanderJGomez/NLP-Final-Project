The visitors had hoped to cement their strong position in this season's title battle with the return of Cristiano Ronaldo, who had been suspended for two matches following a sending off last month.
Atletico are now unbeaten against Real in six matches.
His return from suspension did little to revive what was a limp and lifeless Real performance.
"Real Madrid cannot lose 4-0 against anyone," said Ronaldo.
They sit in third, with Real's lead at the top cut to seven points.
