The girl, known only as "Belen," said in an interview that she would have the baby.
"That being said, the option of abortion, in this case, for rape, seems to be the right solution."
Pinera said that in the interest of the girl's health, doctors will consider whether it makes sense to induce a premature birth if it protects Belen.
"What is relevant is to help this girl who has been victim to a rape, but that, from my perspective, can't ever justify what is worse, which is to abort that child inside her," he said.
