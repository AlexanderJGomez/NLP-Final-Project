Boardwine's friend, Joyce Bruce, had used his sperm and a turkey baster to get pregnant.
The Court of Appeals of Virginia decided differently in weighing the commonwealth's assisted conception statute and denying Bruce's appeal to deny Boardwine visitation.
Boardwine initially was hesitant when Bruce approached him in 2010 with the turkey baster idea, the court document says.
She and Boardwine tried a few more times, and in July, she learned she was going to have a baby.
She thought he could have "some involvement," the appeals court decision says, but she would be the sole parent.
They didn't speak for more than five months after that.
The baby was born, and Boardwine says he learned about the baby's arrival from someone else.
Bruce argued that she used "noncoital reproductive technology" to get pregnant, and Boardwine was technically a sperm donor.
