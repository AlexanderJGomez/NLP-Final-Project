(CNN) -- A federal court has ruled in favor of Texas, which wants to ban state funding for Planned Parenthood affiliates participating in a health program for low-income women because the family planning network performs abortions.
"Today's ruling affirms that Texas' Women's Health Program has no obligation to fund organizations that promote abortion -- including Planned Parenthood," Perry said.
The state said in March that it was willing to give up funding from Washington and run the Women's Health Program itself.
Planned Parenthood sued Texas, winning an injunction against the law by arguing that abortion is constitutional and Texas' efforts would block women's access to preventive health care.
"Texas will continue providing important health services for women through this program in spite of the Obama administration's disregard for our state law and unilateral decision to defund this program," he said.
The program does not pay for abortions, and participating Planned Parenthood clinics in Texas do not perform the procedure.
Planned Parenthood says 3% of all its health services are abortion services.
Texas also slashed funding for family planning clinics.
