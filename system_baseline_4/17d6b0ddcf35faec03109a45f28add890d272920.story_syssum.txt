(CNN) -- Sal Dimiceli has spent decades helping people get back on their feet.
I want to cry thinking that CNN and people recognize the poverty that is out there so we can help even more people.
For many years, I felt alone making money, giving it away helping the less fortunate, and now I'm being recognized for doing what I vowed to do.
Dimiceli: I hope it will bring an awareness of what's going on in our great country behind closed doors and show how more than 50 million Americans are desperately suffering the pains of poverty.
...
Dimiceli: I'm going to put that right into the charity (and) use that for immediate funding.
People who are homeless, we'll help them get shelter; people who are hungry, we're going to feed them; people who have utilities off, we're going to turn them on; people that need transportation, we'll help fix their cars.
Dimiceli: Everything that I did to help others would not be possible if it wasn't for my mother.
I'm 60 now, and I'm going to keep that promise for as long as I can breathe.
