Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- Anders Behring Breivik's defense counsel had warned that the self-confessed killer would show no remorse.
There were smiles and handshakes with the psychiatrists and prosecution at the start.
It is a country that has endeavored, as the Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg promised shortly after the attacks last year, to respond with "more openness, more democracy and more humanity" to these most inhuman of crimes which left 77 people dead.
But his desire for revenge stops there.
There is a sense the people of Norway want to see due process done and then move on.
They are a people who believe their system works, which is why no matter how unspeakable his crimes and how hard these months are and will continue to be, Breivik has not been able to break them.
