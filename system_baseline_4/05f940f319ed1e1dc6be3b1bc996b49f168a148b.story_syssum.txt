Stephen Slevin's 22 months in solitary confinement in a county jail left him traumatized and physically weak, but he'll soon be a multimillionaire for his suffering.
"They threw him in solitary and then ignored him," said Coyte a year ago after a federal jury awarded Slevin $22 million.
"The Board of County Commissioners deeply regrets the harm Mr. Slevin suffered during this period," the county said in a statement Thursday.
Coyte said Slevin did receive a brief competency hearing a year into his imprisonment, but the case against the man never proceeded.
In pretrial motions, the county denied "that there was lack of medical care.
Coyte told CNN he and Slevin hope their victory would "help bring a stop to the use of solitary confinement in America.
"In the wake of this large settlement, we can say definitively that we have learned from the past," its statement said.
Slevin continues to have serious medical issues, and is fighting lung cancer, his lawyer said.
