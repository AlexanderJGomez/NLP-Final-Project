The concertgoers, who packed the club, were rocking with wild abandon to the sound of the band on stage.
"I can't help but watch because I'm one of them," Gina Russo told CNN affiliate WPRI-TV.
Russo suffered serious burns in the fire, but the flames claimed the life of her fiance, Fred Crisostomi.
Sunday, The Station Fire Memorial Foundation offered its condolences and sympathies to those affected by the fire in Brazil.
The Station fire brought changes to Rhode Island law, requiring sprinklers at buildings that can house more than 150 people and limiting pyrotechnics.
Michael and Jeffrey Derderian, the two brothers who owned the club, pleaded no contest to 100 counts each of involuntary manslaughter.
"It just takes time and patience and to know you're not alone."
"In coming days, Rhode Islanders will follow the unfolding news from Brazil with a sense of queasy deja vu -- the rising body counts, the victim identification process, the grieving families, and the assigning (and dodging) of blame," he said.
