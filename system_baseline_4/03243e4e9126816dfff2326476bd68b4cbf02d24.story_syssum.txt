The odds that archaeologists might recover Richard III's remains more than a half millennium later were exceptionally slim.
Archaeologists rarely search for individuals, let alone lost monarchs, and the Leicester excavation was focused on analyzing the medieval friary at which Richard III was rumored to be buried.
DNA analysis alone is not enough to seal this case, however, and any conclusion would neither incriminate Richard III nor prove his innocence, so such a study would mostly be a public curiosity.
An interesting archaeological mystery is the disappearance of the Roanoke colony from contemporary North Carolina in 1587.
But shoreline erosion removed much of the archaeological evidence associated with the colony.
When he died in 1227, Genghis Khan was buried in an exceptionally well-concealed, unmarked tomb whose location had become a mystery a century later.
As we continue to be captivated by the dramatic discovery of Richard III's remains, we should keep in mind that it's just one piece of material culture from a complex site that tells a story that will reach well beyond the mere hunt for a monarch's grave.
