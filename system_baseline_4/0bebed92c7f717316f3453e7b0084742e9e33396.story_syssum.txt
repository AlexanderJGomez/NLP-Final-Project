Paraguay's President on Saturday named a new interior minister and national police chief following clashes between police and peasants that left at least 17 dead.
About 80 more police and civilians were wounded and were receiving medical treatment, Gonzalez added.
Three of the police officers were flown to Asuncion for treatment, the official news agency said.
Rodriguez lamented the loss of life, but said the peasant leaders did not order the attack on police.
In a special session, the House of Representatives observed a minute of silence in honor of the dead, the Agency of Public Information reported.
