(CNN) -- More than eight years after a Utah teenager disappeared from her bedroom on a summer night, the man authorities believe masterminded her kidnapping is set to stand trial in federal court.
But no one expected what happened in March 2003, when Smart was found walking down a street in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy in the company of Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Eileen Barzee.
However, the state case against Mitchell was put on hold when federal authorities stepped in.
Barzee, 64, pleaded guilty in November 2009 to kidnapping and unlawful transportation of a minor in federal court and was sentenced in May to 15 years in federal prison.
Mitchell's attorneys attempted to move his trial, saying it should be held outside of Utah because publicity in the case had prejudiced the pool of potential jurors against him and jeopardized his right to a fair trial.
"It is possible that a jury could be seated where all the jurors would satisfy Mr. Mitchell's view of impartiality," the 10th Circuit ruling said.
The federal court summoned 600 jurors to fill out a preliminary juror questionnaire in the case, according to court documents.
Kimball narrowed that number down to slightly more than 200 potential jurors, according to The Salt Lake Tribune newspaper.
