Bradley Manning's defense attorney spent only 35 minutes Wednesday questioning just two witnesses before resting their case.
Padgett was the senior enlisted man on the night shift in the intelligence office where Manning worked.
At that point another soldier came in the room, subdued Manning, sat him down and Padgett continued counseling him, Padgett testified.
Padgett testified said he did not discuss the outburst with the major who oversaw the intelligence analysis officers, the company's first sergeant nor the company commander.
Prosecution witnesses testified that Manning downloaded and leaked 400,000 DoD field reports from Iraq and 90,0000 similar documents from Afghanistan.
For a short time in December 2009, he was an officer in the intelligence analysis office where Manning worked.
In news reports before the hearing, Manning is said to have bragged in a chat room that he was able to download materials onto a CD while pretending to listen to Lady Gaga.
Mark Zaid, a national security attorney, said the fact the defense called only two witnesses is not surprising.
After that the Investigating Officer, Lt. Col. Paul Almanza, who oversaw the hearing, will consider the testimony and evidence and make a recommendation as to whether Manning should face court martial and if so, on which charges.
Witnesses for the prosecution have characterized Manning as being troubled by Army discipline and testified that he allegedly bragged on the Internet about the leak of classified documents.
On Tuesday, a convicted computer hacker from California who became a confidential informant for the Army testified about six days of online chats that he had with someone he believes was Manning.
Lamo testified that based on an e-mail he received from Manning, as well as an examination of Manning's Facebook page, that Bradass87 was Manning.
