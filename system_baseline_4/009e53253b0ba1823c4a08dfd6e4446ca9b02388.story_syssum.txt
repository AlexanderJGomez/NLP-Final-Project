And, I would suggest, she should have gone further: There's reason to think that bombing is exactly what ISIS wants us to do.
The most recent ISIS propaganda video was produced in English for a reason.
Why?
Longtime defense analyst Kenneth Brower made a similar point: "A YouTube video of a beheading forces the U.S. president to go to 'war' in order to avoid being called weak by his domestic political opposition.
ISIS then beheaded a British journalist, so the British stepped up its military support in the campaign against ISIS.
Yes, the violent terrorism of ISIS is medieval and inhumane.
Why would ISIS goad the world to attack it?
But in the West, mainstream media is doing it for them, covering ISIS propaganda as 24/7 fear- mongering under the banner of news.
But right now, we are the dog being wagged by the tail of ISIS.
The leadership of ISIS may do abhorrent things because of a crazy adherence to an apocalyptic interpretation of Islam, as Graeme Wood has just written in The Atlantic.
Recruits are flocking to ISIS.
We have to stop responding with bombs every time they provoke us with videotaped slayings.
In fact, if you think the only way to defeat them is with bombing, they've already won.
