Bulger eluded federal authorities for more than 16 years before his arrest in June 2011.
Shortly after Bulger's 2011 capture, Alcatraz historian and author Michael Esslinger wrote to the imprisoned Bulger asking for details about his time in the notorious federal penitentiary.
Much to Esslinger's surprise, Bulger wrote back extensively about his fond memories of his time in Alcatraz.
There's even a photo of a smiling Bulger with his then-girlfriend Teresa Stanley dressed in mock prison garb.
"According to (Bulger's associate Kevin) Weeks, Bulger had even taken preliminary steps to track down the overseer of the program, Dr. Carl Pfeiffer ... and assassinate him," English wrote.
Bulger and girlfriend Lindsey Cyr had been dating only a few months in 1966 when Cyr became pregnant.
Despite his initial reluctance toward fatherhood, Cyr said Bulger doted on the boy.
Bulger sat by his side for three days, wrote Cullen and Murphy.
He was never convicted or sentenced on either charge and received an honorable discharge in 1952.
Nearly every mobster has a colorful nickname, but family and associates say Bulger hated "Whitey," a reference to his white-blond hair as a child.
In his letters to Esslinger, Bulger described that time as "a 16-year honeymoon."
The "unassuming two bedroom apartment" can be yours "for $2,950 a month -- far more than Bulger himself had paid during his rent-controlled stint there," according to  The Hollywood Reporter.
