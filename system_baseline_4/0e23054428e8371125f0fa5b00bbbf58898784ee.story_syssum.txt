(CNN) -- I have always been a fiercely independent woman.
A child of divorced parents who always fought about money-related issues, and with my grandmother's words etched in my mind, I told myself at a young age that I would never rely on a man or anyone to take care of me.
A lot of my friends, however, were beginning to settle down and I started to feel like something was wrong with me for not being able to even fathom doing the same.
Tom was a nice man who seemed to take a liking to me quite quickly.
Or at least, that's how I felt.
We all know what sugar daddies are: Wealthy older men have throughout history sought out much younger women -- "sugar babies" -- to date, even marry and take care of.
Now there's nothing wrong with being in a relationship in which one person financially supports the other.
I am now married and have a child with a man who is quite successful in his own right.
In a span of a lifetime, my relationship with Tom was a mere blip.
