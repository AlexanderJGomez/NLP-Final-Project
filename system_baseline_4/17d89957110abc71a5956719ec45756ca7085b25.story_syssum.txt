The victorious Vikings landed another blow for American football Sunday as the team staged an exciting 34-27 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers in London.
A regular season game was first played in London in 2007 but, for the first time this season, two games were scheduled on the opposite side of the Atlantic.
There were also plenty of domestic fans who were happy to travel to London to support their teams.
Dan from New York added: "I love the pub atmosphere in London.
American football is just that, an American sport, but if the sport can successfully "go global" that presents the NFL with new markets and new business opportunities.
"There are multiple challenges," USA Today's NFL writer Tom Pelissero, who was at the game in London, explained to CNN.
You can fill Wembley with 80,000 people once, twice this year, but can you do that for 10 games a year?
"If you put a team in London, I don't think it would be difficult to make a profit.
Steve, who made the journey from London to New York, was also skeptical about the reality that NFL could become a regular fixture in London.
"[A London franchise] is a great idea, the NFL would make a ton of money out of it.
Do we move to three games, are there other ways to grow the game in the UK?"
For now, Peterson -- who had never been outside the U.S. before his trip to London -- and his fellow Viking raiders can feel satisfied with winning the game, as well as perhaps inching the NFL a little closer to a permanent place on sport's European map.
