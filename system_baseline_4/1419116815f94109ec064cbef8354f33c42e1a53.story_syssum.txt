Jerusalem (CNN) -- An Israeli soldier faces a manslaughter charge in the death of a Palestinian waving a white flag during a three-week incursion into Gaza, the Israeli military said Tuesday.
The manslaughter charge was filed after an investigation into the shooting, the Israel Defense Forces said in a news release.
The commander was indicted "because he deviated from authorized and appropriate IDF behavior" and ignored rules on the use of civilians in military operations, it said.
"The aerial strike targeted a terror operative involved in the launching of rockets toward Israel who was standing outside of the mosque," the news release said.
But Palestinians said Israel's actions were unsatisfactory.
The IDF news release said that Israel carried out the operation after enduring eight years of rocket attacks from Gaza.
The Israeli military said 1,166 people were killed, 60 percent of whom were "terror operatives."
