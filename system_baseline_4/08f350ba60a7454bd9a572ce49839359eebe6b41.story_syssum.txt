(CNN) -- "Borderlands 2" wants to raise the stakes and improve upon its signature art style and outlandish weapons while broadening the story on the planet of Pandora.
This tank of a character can wield two weapons at once, bringing more firepower to fights and dishing out the pain.
Gearbox producer Randy Varnell said the team wanted to improve what it had done to make the characters look great, then extend that look to the surrounding environment.
Just like you would see in a comic book," Varnell said.
Varnell said bringing an antagonist to the plot gave the team more options to make the story personal for the players.
he said.
Varnell said giving the players a focus also helps flesh out the game's characters and what motivates them.
"In 'Borderlands,' (designers thought) it was just a fact that as a four-player (co-op) game, the vehicle had two seats," he said.
Little refinements, he hopes, will make the gameplay and the experience even more enjoyable for fans of the franchise as well as new players who are seeing Pandora for the first time.
More than 200 unique types of creatures will be in the way of players as they work their way through the game quests and other missions.
The player characters from "Borderlands" will also show up in the new game as nonplayer characters, providing backstory and missions for the gamers to complete.
