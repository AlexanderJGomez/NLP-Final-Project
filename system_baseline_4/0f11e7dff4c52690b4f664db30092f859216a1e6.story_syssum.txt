Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik said the Saturday attack at the Marriott Hotel "is the biggest attack, volume-wise" in Pakistan in seven years.
Watch guards scatter after an explosion Â»
At a news conference in Islamabad on Sunday, Pakistani authorities released security video of the blast, showing a small explosion inside the truck before the larger, deadly explosion.
Then, as security guards approach the truck, the top of the vehicle explodes and the security guards flee.
No arrests have been made in connection with the attack, Malik said Sunday, adding that militants in Pakistan's tribal regions are suspected of orchestrating the attack.
The crater was 24 feet deep and nearly 60 feet wide, Malik said.
Most of the fatalities appeared to be drivers, who were waiting with their cars outside the Marriott, and hotel security guards, Geo TV's Hamid Mir said.
The blast occurred about 7:50 p.m., after the breaking of the fast during the holy month of Ramadan, Malik said.
"My heart cries tears of blood.
These people are not Muslims," he said.
"We had taken all security measures," he said.
The British High Commission in Islamabad said six British nationals -- five adults and one minor -- were injured in the attack, including three commission members.
A Pakistani staff member of the commission was also injured, it said.
