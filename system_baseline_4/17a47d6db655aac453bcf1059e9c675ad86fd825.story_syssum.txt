Bayer Leverkusen are second in the table with three points after a 2-0 home victory over Belgian champions Genk.
Arsenal are second in the table with four points, two behind French champions Marseille, who lead the way with a maximum six points after cruising to a 3-0 home win over Borussia Dortmund.
Europa League winners Porto went ahead in the 10th minute when Colombian James Rodriguez netted from Hulk's right-wing cross, but the home side drew level 10 minutes later when Roman Shirokov scored from the edge of the area after goalkeeper Helton had deflected a Viktor Faizulin cross into his path.
Shirokov scored his and Zenit's second when converting from close range and Danny added a third 18 minutes from time when turning home Alexander Kerzhakov's cross.
