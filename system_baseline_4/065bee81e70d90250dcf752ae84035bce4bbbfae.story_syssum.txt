(CNN) -- At least 1,200 people have given up their jerseys bearing the name of New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez at the team's official shop now that Hernandez has been charged with murder, the team says.
The exchange applied only to Hernandez jerseys purchased from the Patriots' ProShop and PatriotsProShop.com.
While the team did not release a figure of how much the exchange program is costing, a regular male jersey costs $99.95, women's jerseys cost $94.95 and youth jerseys cost $69.95, on the ProShop website.
Authorities have said Hernandez and two other men picked up Lloyd from his Boston apartment on June 17.
He also won't be able to marry his fiancee while in jail.
