(Sunset) -- Whether you're into lazy-day floating or rip-roaring rapids, there's a river out there for you.
And so here I am, on a Wine on the River tour with a winemaker, a pair of chefs, a nimble river crew and a handful of fellow fortunate souls.
We get the necessary primer before putting in: Drink lots of water, they tell us.
The river is calm, and we don't have to paddle if we don't want to.
For the first time in my life, I must assemble a tent alone.
It'll go on like this for two more nights.
Lots of wine.
After dark, the stars go so many layers deep that a few of us decide to sleep directly under them, and our tents become mere storage units.
Entry: My first glimpse of the Chilko is from 15,000 feet up in a tiny 10-seater plane, looking down the longest raftable stretch of continuous Class IV whitewater on the continent.
He instructs the eight of us -- a motley crew of three businessmen, a doctor, a lawyer, and a ranching couple -- on what to do if we run into a bear, how to tell a grizzly from a black, and how to prevent Mace mishaps.
Which makes me and Ginny, the other whitewater rookie, mighty nervous about the hardcore rapids to come.
Rapids!
We vanish into the rapids, as the raft bends and catapults and the waves pound through us on the famous great White Mile: 12 miles of rapids in 55 minutes -- yes, that longest stretch of continuous Class IV on the continent.
At camp: Tents are pitched while the guides set up and find a scenic spot for the Groover.
An "easy" day: Our raft gets hung up on a protuding log inside a rapid.
No sweat.
Mark reads stories about spectacular Groover mishaps (picture it overturning while you're in the way).
After lunch, we take the two final, gargantuan rapids called Gaping Jaws of Death and Brains Smashed In.
And more Groover stories.
