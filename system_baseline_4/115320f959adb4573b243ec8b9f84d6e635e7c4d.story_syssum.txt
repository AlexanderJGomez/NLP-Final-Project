(CNN) -- The health of Yemen's wounded president is improving, but doctors are recommending that he stay in Saudi Arabia for a "longer time" to recover, an adviser said Friday.
They said that Saleh's health is improving," said Ahmed Al-Soufi, a senior presidential adviser in Yemen.
Members of the Revolution Youth Organizing Committee, one of the groups in the Youth Revolutionary Movement in Yemen, condemned Saudi Arabia and the United States for what they said was the negative influence both countries are having on Yemen and promised that the countries' stance against the revolution will not be forgotten.
There were deaths and injuries in the attack, and Saleh was among several people taken to Saudi Arabia for medical treatment.
Meanwhile, four soldiers and a civilian were killed when a bomb-laden vehicle exploded Friday at a military checkpoint in Aden, a security official there said.
The United States has been aiding Yemen's military in its fight against Islamic militants amid fears that al Qaeda is exploiting the political chaos and leadership vacuum engulfing the unstable and impoverished Arabian Peninsula country.
