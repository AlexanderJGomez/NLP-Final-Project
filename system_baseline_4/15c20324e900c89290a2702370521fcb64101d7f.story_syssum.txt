A California artist is turning people into paintings.
The result is an image that looks like a painting within a photo.
Meade's work comes together in four steps -- painting, photography, art installations and performance art.
"A lot of people ask me where I went to art school, but I didn't study art.
Instead of sitting behind a desk, Meade ended up in her parents' basement in Washington, painting on grapefruits, fried eggs and sausage.
She started painting on people by chance.
...
When Meade first started her career, she didn't have any art shows.
Meade got her big break when a post about her work went viral.
And my friend wrote in the comments, 'You should check out Alexa Meade's work,'" she said.
"Being able to share my story at the TED conference has allowed almost 2 million people now to watch the video and learn about what I do," Meade said.
"When I first started out, it was impossible to get people to model for me," she said.
"It's always a risky thing to go for the improbable," she said.
