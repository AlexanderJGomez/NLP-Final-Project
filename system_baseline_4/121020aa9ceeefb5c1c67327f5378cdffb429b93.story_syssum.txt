(CNN) -- Washington and Lee University cited slavery's "regrettable" role in the Virginia school's history and announced that it will remove Confederate battle flags from a chapel that serves as a major meeting place.
Ruscio also said that the regimental flags are going to be removed from Lee Chapel.
The original flags will be placed on rotating display at Lee Chapel Museum in a more "appropriate location" where the stories behind them can be properly told, wrote Ruscio.
He said some students felt uncomfortable with the flags at Lee Chapel.
"It's commendable that the university and the administration took into consideration the feelings of all students," Hernandez Stroud, former president of the Black Law Students Association, told CNN.
In April, Ruscio said questions raised by law students were legitimate.
In his letter Tuesday, the administrator said the purpose of the historic flags in a campus setting is to educate.
