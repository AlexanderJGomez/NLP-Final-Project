A video installation, called "A Letter Can Always Reach Its Destination," featuring people reading from scam emails, is one of the five winning pieces of the Abraaj Capital Art Prize unveiled at Art Dubai this week.
Hadjithomas said they chose 45 emails to read out for "A Letter Can Always Reach its Destination" from some 4,000 received over the years.
"In our work we are very interested in the way you write history," said Hadjithomas.
The stories sounds convincing until they mention the $35 million they have, said Hadjithomas.
A more personal piece comes from the Palestinian artist Taysir Batniji, who produced "To My Brother, which he describes as a tribute to his brother Mayssara, killed by an Israeli sniper during the First Intifada in 1987.
"My work is about disappearance in general and especially in the Palestinian context," said Batniji.
Lebanese artist Raed Yassin combines his take on his country's civil war with the ancient tradition of recording military victories on vases.
His work "China" features seven Chinese porcelain vases featuring key battles from Lebanon's civil war.
"Apart from being trade gateways, these cities were also sites of resistance and rebellion against the imperial powers," says the exhibition booklet.
Muller said the $120,000 prize money given in advance based on proposals allowed artists to make work that would not otherwise have been possible.
"It's extremely important that there's production money because that's the most difficult thing for artists to find resources to concentrate on a piece they want to make," she said.
