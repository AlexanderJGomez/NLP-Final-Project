With extreme eating habits like these, it may be some surprise to learn that within the Olympic Village there lurks a culinary trap that can potentially tip athletes over the fine line between success and failure at London 2012.
Some 1.2 million meals will be served -- 60,000 a day.
"For the younger athletes it's an exciting new experience," says sports scientist Jess Corones, who works with the Australian Olympic swim team.
Phelps, after winning a record eight gold medals at Beijing 2008, told NBC that he gorged on carbohydrate-heavy pasta and pizza at the height of his extreme training.
"I've tried to get people to try it, but they won't.
However, it's rare for athletes to eat quite that much, says Corones, who first worked with Australia's track and field team at the 2004 Athens Games.
The only people that I've seen eat close to that are the hammer throwers, and they all weigh in at 120 kilos."
You wouldn't get many athletes doing that these days."
Good nutrition from a young age can be vital if you want to be an elite athlete.
"You can get vitamin D in food sources (such as eggs, dairy and fish) but it's not as effective as sunshine production," Stevenson said.
But, with drug-testing standards improving year by year and the list of banned substances also increasing, there is a strong onus for athletes to be acutely aware of everything they put in their mouth.
"Most athletes are using quite a few supplements.
We have hotlines where the athletes can call up and check anything, so it's pretty easy to find out if it's okay to take."
"It varies depending on where we are in the year," says Corones, who works for the New South Wales Institute of Sport in Sydney.
A big part of Corones' job is making sure athletes learn the right food habits -- and this generally means breaking eating patterns formed at a young age.
It's about trying to break those cycles and get them eating as well as they can."
