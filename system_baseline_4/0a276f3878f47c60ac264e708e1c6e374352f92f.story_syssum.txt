But he said surveillance video showed a male "similar" to the man who police say dragged and abducted the 22-year-old woman Sunday night.
We just want Carlesha returned to us safely," her grandmother Ana Mulero said at a news conference with Wilson in Philadelphia.
Police didn't immediately release the bank video.
The video shows Freeland-Gaither tussling on the ground with her abductor and being forced into a four-door vehicle, which police say may be a gray Ford Taurus.
Just before the vehicle pulled away, Freeland-Gaither broke out one of the passenger side windows, police said.
Investigators aren't sure whether she knew her abductor, though there's no indication on the Philadelphia surveillance video that she did, Wilson said.
The plate isn't readily legible in the video, and police said no witness gave them a plate number.
