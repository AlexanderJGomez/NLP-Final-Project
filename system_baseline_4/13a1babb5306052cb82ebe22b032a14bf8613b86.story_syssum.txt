(CNN) -- The deaths of four people this week at a Florida mansion leased out by tennis star James Blake were murders and a suicide, with a man shooting his wife and teenage children in the head and setting the home on fire before shooting himself, authorities said Friday.
Investigators don't know Darrin Campbell's motive, Lusczynski said.
Campbell used an accelerant to feed the fire and also placed fireworks throughout the home, Lusczynski said Friday.
He peaked at No.
