Singer Maura O'Connell says one of Ted Kennedy's favorite songs, "A Family Tie," spoke to his love of family.
He made the call himself to my home number.
When we spoke the next day, he told me how much he enjoyed my singing and named particular songs that meant a great deal to him.
We spoke a few more times before the wedding and he sounded like any other man who was delighted to be marrying the woman he loved.
We were all very proud of that, so when I got the call about singing at the wedding, the first person I told was my dad.
On the day of the wedding, my musicians Richard McLaurin and Zane Baxter and I were brought to Kennedy's house and escorted to the senator's home office.
The wedding itself was beautiful.
I sang some songs during the ceremony, and then a few afterwards.
Ever since then we kept in contact.
I sang at various events the senator was involved in, most recently at a fundraiser for his re-election.
He spoke to the kids about his first time in Washington and how his brother John, a senator at the time, showed him around.
He told them how inspiring it was to see how government worked and that he knew right then that he wanted to be a public servant.
He loved to serve, but most of all he dearly loved his wife and family.
