That is how President Obama should begin one of the most significant speeches of his presidency: the commencement address at Morehouse College this Sunday.
In appearances before African-American audiences, the president sometimes sounds like he's saying the wrong thing.
African-American men certainly could use an intervention from the most successful African-American man in history.
In urban areas, fewer than half graduate from high school.
Nobody understands, like this audience will, the contortions a successful African-American man has to make to fit in but stand out, to be strong but not intimidate or frighten, to be black enough but not too black.
Politically it was not the smartest thing to say (the LGBT community didn't turn Obama into the most gay friendly president in U.S. history by going easy on him) but any black man could understand the sentiment.
The president isn't the only black man who needs to step up support of his brothers.
It's OK for the president to note that not every aspect of black male culture is praiseworthy.
President Obama cannot, on his own, reverse this course, but he can do much more than he has to disrupt the flow of the one in three young black men who are headed to prison.
African-American men feel a special kinship with this president.
What a difference it might make for the millions of black boys who now are headed to destinies very different from graduating from Morehouse College or becoming president of the United States.
