(CNN) -- A judge has ordered mediation in the case of a teen girl who says her family threatened to kill her for converting from Islam to Christianity.
At a court hearing Thursday in Orlando, the girl's parents denied all the allegations against them.
The parents, Mohamed and Aysha Bary, could not attend the hearing in person but listened through a telephone conference as their lawyer spoke for them.
But Bary conceded he would have preferred that his daughter practice the Muslim faith first.
In the court filing, Rifqa Bary stated her father said, "If you have this Jesus in your heart, you are dead to me!"
Also at Thursday's hearing, the judge sealed a report on the girl from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and issued a gag order for attorneys in the case.
Another hearing is scheduled for September 29 if the family is not able to resolve the conflict through mediation.
