"With communication and cell phones, this is where it is difficult to cheat in elections now.
Just this month CNN reported dramatic increases in cell phone usage in African nations.
"During the 2006 local government elections in Senegal, Radio Sud used reporters and correspondents with cell phones to call in what they saw.

"All of this technology is very important and gives a powerful new tool that cuts the ability for cheating," LaGamma said.
