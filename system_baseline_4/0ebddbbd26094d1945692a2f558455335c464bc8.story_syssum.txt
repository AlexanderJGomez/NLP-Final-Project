That now depends on whether these parties can translate their momentum into seats in their national parties.
In Greece, Syriza should not even be called a fringe party, though they do occupy a space in the European parliament on the far left.
UKIP has already had the desired effect of changing the national debate in Britain.
But unlike many other fringe parties in Europe, UKIP does not have one single seat in Westminster, the national parliament.
The difference this time is perhaps, that the parties have gained more seats.
UKIP has gone from 16% to 27%.
It should also be noted that the far, far right British party, the BNP, lost both of their MEPs and will have none in the new parliament.
Now, it will be up to the centrist parties, in the European Parliament and in national parliaments to cobble together coalitions if they want to thwart the rise of fringe parties.
You may or may not support these party's views, but they are tapping into a growing resentment in Europe.
