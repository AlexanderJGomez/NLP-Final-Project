Aragones, whose death at the age of 75 was announced Saturday, coached his national side to the European Championship title in 2008 -- the country's first success at a major tournament in more than 40 years.
"Always with us, Luis," led the website tribute of Atletico Madrid, the club where Aragones played for a decade between 1964-74 and was head coach on four occasions, most recently 2001-03.
Aragones' final coaching job was with Turkish side Fenerbahce, which ended in mid-2009, and late last year he announced his retirement from the game -- in which he started out at Getafe in 1957.
"As a club, we had the honor of his services, albeit for a very short time, in the 1987-88 season, when we won the Spanish Cup.
Aragones' appreciation of Barca's "tiki taka" style -- started by Johann Cruyff and developed by Pep Guardiola -- was borne out by the number of the players from the Catalan club he selected for the national team.
"The loss of Luis Aragones saddens all of us who love football," said Real president Florentino Perez.
The only blot on his international career was an incident in 2004, when he was accused of making a racial comment -- which was caught on television cameras -- about France striker Thierry Henry while he was trying to motivate his players in training ahead of a World Cup qualifying match.
