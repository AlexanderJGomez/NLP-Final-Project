(CNN) -- With mostly mild cases of swine flu in the United States, swine flu fears are lessening.
Public health officials expect the 2009 H1N1 virus to linger a while.
However, there are two reasons to think the 2009 H1N1 outbreak will wind down in the coming weeks.

No.
"H1N1 flu could die down soon and return later again this fall when the flu season enters back in full swing," says Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano.
Napolitano adds that public health officials will be keeping a close eye on the Southern Hemisphere, where flu season starts soon.
In the fall, could we have a pandemic like we had in 1918?
"In 1918, that pandemic started out as a very mild case of disease in the spring of 1918.
Secondly, the 2009 H1N1 lacks a gene that is present in highly virulent flu viruses, such as the one in 1918.
Will there be a vaccine for swine flu?
Scientists are already working on a vaccine for 2009 H1N1.
Will the vaccine be a separate shot, or will it be put in the regular seasonal flu shot?
Public health officials have emphasized that even if a vaccine is available by fall, it doesn't mean everyone will be encouraged to get it.
Cohen adds that if the vaccine is available only in limited quantities, priority might be given to health care workers and to those at high risk of complications from the flu, such as the elderly, the very young and those with certain chronic diseases.
