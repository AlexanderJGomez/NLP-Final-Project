Introduced on Wednesday, the Kindle Touch will be the first Amazon e-reader with a touch screen.
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has defended the lack of a touch screen on previous Kindle models, saying conventional touch displays produce reflections.
It's also the technology embedded in Amazon's new $199 Kindle Fire, a multimedia tablet.
For that reason, the Kindle Touch relies on infrared sensors, which are stationed along the edges around the screen to detect when the user's finger touches a particular spot on the device's face, an Amazon spokeswoman said.
Barnes & Noble implemented the same technology to bring touch screen capability to its Nook.
Amazon will continue to sell two versions of the Kindle without touch screens.
"We have many customers who tell us they don't want touch," Bezos reportedly said at the news conference in New York on Wednesday.
"We're going to sell many millions of these."
