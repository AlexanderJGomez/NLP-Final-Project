(CNN) -- When looking at the world's lowest unemployment rates, one of the first things you might notice is that many of the countries are in Southeast Asia.
Speaking of the U.S., its unemployment rate is 9.2%, which ranks it close to the bottom among the countries on our table of 67 countries.
Many countries are not on this list because they haven't released their rates in years, if at all.
The latest CIA World Factbook has estimated unemployment rates for most of these missing countries, and eight of them are above 50%.
Egypt's rate was just under 12% in March.
But it's Spain, at 21.3%, that has the highest unemployment rate in the EU.
