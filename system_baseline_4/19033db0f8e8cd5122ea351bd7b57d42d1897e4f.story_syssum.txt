Acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson said Director Sharon Helman and two other officials at the Phoenix VA have been "removed" from their positions, but he said the government continues to pay federal employees during the sometimes lengthy termination process.
Gibson said he expects to "take action" against officials at a particular VA medical center this week after receiving more information from the VA's Office of Inspector General.
Responding to CNN's questions about when long wait times will be reduced, Gibson said his top priority is to ensure veterans receive timely, high-quality health care, but he does not know exactly when all wait lists will be reduced.
I want to be able to say it but I just can't do it yet," he said.
"Retaliating against whistle-blowers is against the law," he said.
