That's where they were slain, ambush-style -- Saturday afternoon as they sat in their patrol car, New York Police Commissioner William Bratton said at an evening news conference.
The gunman approached the passenger side of the patrol car and took a shooting stance, witnesses told police.
Both dreamed of being police officers, Bratton said.
"When a police officer is murdered, it tears at the foundation of our society," the mayor said.
Bratton said that Brinsley was somehow connected to Brooklyn, but would not discuss that information.
Baltimore police received information that Brinsley had made threatening comments about police, and sent a warning to police in New York, Bratton said.
"It is an attack on all of us," he said.
Now, we have two families that (are) missing somebody for the holidays," Shaniqua Pervis told CNN affiliate WABC.
I know it's a war going on and shoutout to Eric Garner's family and everybody else who lost somebody, but you're not at his house, on his lawn.
A grand jury's decision not to indict the police officer in the Garner case, as well as a separate grand jury's refusal to indict an officer in a controversial police shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, led to nationwide protests against the police.
It cannot be tolerated.
"Any use of the names of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, in connection with any violence or killing of police, is reprehensible and against the pursuit of justice in both cases," the statement said.
