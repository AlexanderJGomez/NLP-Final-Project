Washington (CNN) -- The Secret Service has yanked the security clearances of 11 members accused of bringing prostitutes to a hotel in Colombia ahead of last week's pan-American summit, government officials with knowledge of the investigation said Monday.
Their security clearances have been pulled while an investigation is under way and could be reinstated if they are cleared, the officials said.
U.S. government sources also said there was a dispute between at least one Secret Service member and a woman demanding payment.
Rep. Darrell Issa, the chairman of the House Oversight and Investigations Committee, said he met with Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan on Monday and said Sullivan was "shocked" by the accusations.
For 11 people to violate a basic security premise indicates a larger problem, Issa said.
But the congressman -- a leading Obama administration critic -- said the conduct could have posed a security risk to the president by exposing Secret Service agents to blackmail.
The Pentagon said Monday that the misconduct involved more service members than the five initially believed.
Little said the personnel were not directly involved in presidential security and did not have any contact with Obama.
A more senior officer was leaving for Colombia on Monday to continue the investigation.
Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovan said the agents were relieved of duty Thursday, before the president's arrival in Colombia.
