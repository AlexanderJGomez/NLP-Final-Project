Garcia is alleged to be a member of the violent MS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha, gang.
The FBI said a romantic entanglement and gang rivalries lay at the heart of slayings.
The FBI said that under the guise of an invitation to dinner in Central Islip, New York, Garcia coerced Argueta and her 2-year-old son into the woods.
The FBI requests that anyone with information on Garcia contact its New York Field Office at 212-384-1000, a nearby law enforcement agency or U.S. Embassy or Consulate.
