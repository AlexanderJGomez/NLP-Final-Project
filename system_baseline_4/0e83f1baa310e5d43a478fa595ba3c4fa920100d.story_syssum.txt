(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer continued their preparations for the first grand slam of the season with contrasting victories Friday at tournaments in Doha and Brisbane.
Nadal, who is the only seed left in the tournament after the shock departures of Andy Murray and David Ferrer, could have been headed that way as he dropped the opening set to Gojowczk, who had enjoyed a dream run to his first ATP Tour semifinal.
Monfils, something of a Doha specialist and twice a losing finalist, showed his quality with a straight sets 6-3 6-2 win over Florian Mayer of Germany in a little under an hour.
Federer is playing in Brisbane for the first time in his glittering career and treated the crowd on the Pat Pat Rafter Arena to a tennis master class against his Australian opponent.
Nishikori ground out a three set win over Croatia's Marin Cili, while Hewitt continued his fine run with a straight sets dismissal of Romanian qualifier Marius Copil, 6-4, 6-2.
