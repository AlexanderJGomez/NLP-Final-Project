Washington (CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama is considering airstrikes and humanitarian airdrops to help save thousands of Iraq's Shiite Turkmen, who officials said Wednesday are facing a potential slaughter at the hands of fighters with the so-called Islamic State.
Their situation echoes the ordeal of Iraq's ethnic Yazidis, whose plight after they were forced to flee into the mountains to escape ISIS militants triggered U.S. aid drops and the first U.S. airstrikes against ISIS.
There are Sunni and Shiite Turkmen in Iraq, and they account for up to 3% of Iraq's population.
The United Nations estimates that of the besieged Turkmen population in Amerli, roughly 10,000 are women and children.
On Wednesday, American warplanes carried out three airstrikes near Irbil, destroying a number of vehicles and a building, the U.S. military said.
The airstrikes in Iraq came as a U.N. human rights investigators accused both ISIS and Syrian government forces of committing war crimes and atrocities in their brutal fight in Syria.
"Among the most disturbing findings in this report are accounts of large training camps, where children, mostly boys, from the age of 14 are recruited and trained to fight in the ranks of ISIS along with adults," said Paulo Pinheiro, the chairman of the U.N. commission of inquiry on Syria.
Video posted on social media purports to show several of the alleged chlorine attacks.
