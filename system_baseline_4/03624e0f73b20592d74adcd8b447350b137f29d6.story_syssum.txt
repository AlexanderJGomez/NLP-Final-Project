Our panel consisted of Stephanie Brinley, senior manager at Auto Pacific; James Bell, editor and publisher of IntelliChoice and Jim Markwalder, veteran automotive consultant from Detroit.
Brinley looked through the company's vast data on the Toyota Prius .
"Prius drivers like the video-game challenge of continuously trying to best your own fuel economy achievements," said Brinley.
Bell sees another side to the Corvette.
"I think the Camry gets a bad rap for being the 'microwave oven' of the car industry," said Bell.
A Toyota Camry in the driveway tells everyone that you know what is important in life, and it's not your car."
But almost 30 percent of Challenger buyers are Gen X or Gen Y.
"Especially when it's in Hemi Orange, from old-skool Hot Rodders to the Import Tuner crowd."
Markwalder states, "The R-Class has always been a contradiction, looking like a minivan but not delivering on functionality."
Bell quips, "My experience tells me that its few buyers are attracted to its three-pointed star (badge appeal) or the large discounts because the R-Class hasn't sold well."
Brinley adds, "It's an old person's cars, with only four-percent of its buyers from Gen Y."
