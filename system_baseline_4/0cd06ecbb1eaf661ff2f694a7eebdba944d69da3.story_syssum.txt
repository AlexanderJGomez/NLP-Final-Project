Arora, who shared the video with CNN on Sunday, said he also turned it over to authorities investigating Lisa's disappearance in hopes it will help in the search for the girl.
Meanwhile Sunday, Lisa's parents, Deborah Bradley and Jeremy Irwin, were seen wiping away tears at the candlelight vigil outside their home.
Bradley said she last saw Lisa at 6:40 p.m. the night before.
The attorney for Lisa's parents said the release of the affidavit Friday was "unfortunate," as it could derail the search for the missing girl.
"I was the last one with her," a tearful Bradley said.
Asked whether he had questions about Bradley, Jeremy Irwin told NBC, "No.
I know the kind of mother she is."
The missing girl has two bottom teeth and a "beauty mark" on her right outer thigh, police said.
