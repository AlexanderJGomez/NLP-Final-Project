New York  (CNN)New York's iconic Statue of Liberty and Liberty Island will reopen to the public Saturday -- one day after a bomb threat that led to its evacuation was declared unfounded, officials said.
All civilians were evacuated and only emergency personnel remained on Liberty Island, according to police.
A sweep by U.S. Park Police canine units "alerted on an area of interest near the lockers at the base" of the Statue of Liberty, Rambo said.
Approximately 3.5 million people visit the Statue of Liberty every year.
It reopened on July 4, 2013, with a ribbon cutting ceremony and long lines of tourists.
It was a gift to the United States from the people of France to commemorate 100 years of Franco-American friendship as well as the centennial of America's independence.
