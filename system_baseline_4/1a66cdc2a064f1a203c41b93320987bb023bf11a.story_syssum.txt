(CNN) -- Huawei has given up its quest to conquer the market for telecom network equipment in the US, where the Chinese company's sales efforts have been repeatedly blocked by security fears.
US security officials and politicians have repeatedly identified Huawei as a threat to US national security -- an allegation the Chinese company has consistently denied.
Two years later, Huawei bid for a multibillion-dollar contract to supply network infrastructure to Sprint Nextel, one of the top US operators, but lost after the US government intervened.
Ken Hu, a senior Huawei executive, also wrote a passionate open letter calling on the US government to launch a formal investigation, which he believed would clear his company.
But October's congressional report made it even more difficult for the company to do business in the US, Huawei executives say.
William Xu, the unit's chief executive, said its goal of generating $15bn in revenues from the business by 2017 -- a target set just last year -- was "too optimistic".
