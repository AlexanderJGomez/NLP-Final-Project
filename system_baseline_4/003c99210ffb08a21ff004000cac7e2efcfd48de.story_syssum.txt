For the past four years, the Dallas, Texas, native has been providing hope to hundreds of disabled Iraqi children and their families through the distribution of pediatric wheelchairs.
"Disabled children -- they're really the forgotten ones in this war," said Blauser, 43.
An estimated one in seven Iraqi children ages 2 to 14 lives with a disability, according to UNICEF.
Some parents carry their children every day.
There's not a doctor available for help [and] there's no pediatric wheelchair source in this country," Blauser said.
"
"The experience for me in the first distribution was awesome," said Blauser.
That's the case for 3-year-old Ali Khaled Ibrahim and his family.

Since 2005, Wheelchairs for Iraqi Kids has distributed nearly 650 pediatric wheelchairs.
The organization provides wheelchairs designed for rough terrains in developing nations, making the devices "perfect for this environment," said Blauser.
Blauser and his group help adjust the children into their wheelchairs, which fit their bodies as they grow.
