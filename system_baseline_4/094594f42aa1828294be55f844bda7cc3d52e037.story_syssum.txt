Former flight engineer George Hopkins says he remembers vividly being hijacked to Cuba in 1968.
Pena Soltren is one of the men accused of hijacking Pan Am Flight 281 on November 24, 1968, and taking it to Cuba.
"I can still remember very vividly," said Hopkins, 71.
Hopkins said he felt a burning sensation where the gun was pointed on his face.
But the armed man was extremely nervous and shaking, Hopkins said.
"He said don't worry about it, we've done this before," Hopkins said.
The hijackers left the plane after it landed, but Cuban authorities held Hopkins and the rest of the crew on board for about six hours before they were allowed to fly back to the United States.
Hopkins wonders now whether he would even recognize Pena Soltren.
This is the first time I've even said anything about it for five to 10 years.
