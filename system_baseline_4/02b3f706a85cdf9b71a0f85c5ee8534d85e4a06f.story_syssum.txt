Rome (CNN) -- Mario Monti, the economist nominated to become Italy's new prime minister, began talks with political leaders Monday to discuss forming a government.
At any time the parliament could dissolve his government "because of lack of trust," he said.
Italian party leaders spoke in support of the new prime minister designate on Italy's senate TV after exiting deliberations with Monti on the composition of a new government.
Antonio Di Pietro, leader of the Values Party, said his group is "happy that the Berlusconi government could be replaced by the Monti government."
Monti was nominated Sunday to replace Silvio Berlusconi as Italy's prime minister.
"For the time being he is waiting to see what is happening under the buildup of the new government under Mr. Monti," said Deborah Bergamini, a member of Italy's Parliament and former assistant to Berlusconi.
... Let's hope that the international credibility of Mr. Monti will be able to work in this direction," Bergamini told CNN.
In announcing Monti's nomination, Italian President Giorgio Napolitano said the former European Union commissioner is "gifted, competent, experienced" and well-respected in Europe and internationally.
The upper and lower houses of parliament have 10 days from the time Monti is sworn in to hold separate votes of confidence on the new government.
Economists said Monday's bond yields could indicate that markets are still nervous about Italy's economic prospects, even with Monti in charge.
So my feeling is that the challenge today will be rebalancing ... politics and financial matters," Bergamini told CNN Monday.
