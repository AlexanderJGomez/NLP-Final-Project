(CNN) -- Explorer Dennis Schmitt found an island nearly two years ago near Greenland.
"One [was] that this was going to be significant because it was going to be an example of climate change."
He calls his discovery Warming Island.
Many climatologists and scientists say arctic ice melt and other changes in the Earth's climate are the result of an increase in the world's temperature, a trend widely called global warming.
Most of the scientific community believes that some warming is occurring across the globe and through some layers of the atmosphere.
There are several possible reasons for the warming, scientists say.
The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, for instance, has increased by 35 percent since the dawn of the industrial age, according to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, commonly referred to as the IPCC.
"For the last 30 years, there's no way there's anything natural that can explain it," Stephen Schneider, a professor of environmental studies at Stanford University in California, said.
Since then, there's been a few tenths of global warming, so we're proclaiming global warming."
He believes the current warming trend is the result of natural variability, where a planet goes through phases of warming and cooling and the human contribution to it is minimal.
Asked about glacial melt, which many observers point to as evidence of global warming, Lindzen said the way glaciers change and move are phenomena largely unexplained.
The models don't predict it," he said.
The lower end of the range could cause more intense hurricanes, droughts, wildfires and flooding, Schneider said.
"Exactly how much it's going to warm up, we don't know," Schneider said.
