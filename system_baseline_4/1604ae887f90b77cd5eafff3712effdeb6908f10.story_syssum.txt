Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda (CNN) -- The forest was in charge.
The moist leaves scattered on the soil demanded balance, stinging nettles and hiding holes urged utmost caution, centuries-old greenery wrapped its arms around me, challenging me to hack through the twisted vines and untested trails.
I grit my teeth knowing the forest was forcing me to want the prize it hid in its shape-shifting bosom.
No matter how contorted I became, the forest kept a piece of itself handy to cling on to, a mini consolation prize hinting that it was, after all, on my side.
No matter how much I wanted out, I had to push on, because there was no way out without rangers slicing pathways through the wild bush.
It was a rare 60 minutes, the shortest, the most fascinating.
