(CNN) -- My friend Brian Hull and I were both born 40 years ago today.
In our class, it was me and Brian.
After class, we talked briefly about where we were born and at what time of day.
Brian was an easy person to like.
One day in ninth-grade Spanish class, he rebelled against Miss Kahn's selected topic of conversation and instead suggested that we discuss the ongoing battle over Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court.
To this day, when I'm in an uncomfortable social situation, I'll wonder, "How would Brian Hull handle this?"
Whatever the reason, the absences and missed assignments were taking a toll, and things came to a head in English class.
So we went over every mother-loving detail of that miserable Greek tragedy.
In the movie version, this is where I would say that he aced that exam and got his act together and excelled at everything he did thereafter, and it was all because of a little help from his friend who was born on the same day.
I don't remember the last time I saw him or the last conversation we had.
Brian was only 22 when he died.
I think about whatever is going on in my life at the time, and how trivial it all suddenly seems.
By age 40, Brian Hull might have become a university professor or a successful entrepreneur or maybe an author.
We never played tennis, and we never saw each other over that summer.
It gives you a sense of your own mortality.
When I think about him today, I wonder who the other Brians in my life are right now -- am I squandering any opportunities to play tennis with them or see them over the summer?
