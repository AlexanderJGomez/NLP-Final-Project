Los Angeles (CNN) -- The man accused of shooting and paralyzing a U.S. Army soldier at a homecoming party in the soldier's honor faces one count of attempted murder, the spokesman for the San Bernardino, California, district attorney said Tuesday.
Christopher Sullivan on Friday night at a homecoming party in Sullivan's native San Bernardino.
Accompanied by an attorney, Jurado turned himself in to authorities in Chino Hills early Monday afternoon, said Lt. Gwendolyn Waters.
Sullivan was rushed to a hospital, where he was being treated, officials said.
"Right now, my son is hanging in physically," Suzanne Sullivan told CNN.
She also said she couldn't believe what had happened to her son, who she said joined the Army to try and help her out.
He was so happy when he joined the Army, because he really wanted to defend his country."
A fellow soldier from Christopher Sullivan's 101st Airborne Division brought the infantry's flag to the hospital, Suzanne Sullivan told CNN.
"I asked Chris if he wanted to me to hang it on the wall or cover him in it," Suzanne Sullivan said.
"He once told me that if defending this country takes his life, so be it," she said.
Suzanne Sullivan said her family is having a difficult time coming to terms with what happened.
