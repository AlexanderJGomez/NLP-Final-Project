Vice President Joe Biden: This might not have been the "Big f***ing deal" that he proclaimed the passage of Obamacare to be, but it was a pretty big deal.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell: He found the "dance partner" he was looking for in Biden and skillfully worked behind the scenes with the vice president to broker a deal that got overwhelming Republican support in the Senate.
He didn't get the big deal that he set out for and some progressives think that he gave too much away, but getting Republican votes to raise taxes on the wealthy is significant.
The employed: The two-year payroll tax holiday is over, so take-home pay will go down -- around $2,000 less a year for the average wage earner as the rate went from 4.2% to 6.2%.
House Speaker John Boehner: He had to pull his "Plan B" back from the floor when it became clear that he didn't have the Republican votes for passage and then had to sit back and watch McConnell make a deal with Biden.
First, they publicly threaten the deal passed by the Senate to up the anxiety for the nation on New Year's Day.
The can: That poor sucker gets a couple more dents and a few more scuffs as it gets kicked down the road again.
