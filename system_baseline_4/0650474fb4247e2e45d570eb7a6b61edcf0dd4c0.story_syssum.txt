Why did he invite the world to chime in?
The process may easily take up a decade before the final design is ready for approval.
The distance that separates any two adjacent capsules, called the headway, is a critical design parameter, and it will need to account for additional speed changes and halts that may occur during real operating conditions.
Smaller headways will require a capsule-to-capsule signaling system.
The Hyperloop design will require built-in security and safety systems to address these scenarios.
Airport security checks and loading/unloading times can easily double the actual travel time.
For a fair comparison, Musk's travel time estimate of 30 minutes between San Francisco and Los Angeles must also be scaled up to include passenger loading/unloading times at the Hyperloop stations and the time to reach and navigate these stations.
At the very least, we can hope that the Hyperloop design can guide the enhancements to existing modes of transport.
