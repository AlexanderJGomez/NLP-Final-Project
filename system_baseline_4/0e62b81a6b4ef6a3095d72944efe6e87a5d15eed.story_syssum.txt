(CNN) -- FIFA has imposed a worldwide lifetime ban from football on 41 players from Korea who became embroiled in match-fixing activities in their domestic league.
These latest sanctions add to a further 10 worldwide bans imposed on players from Korea in June last year.
"Of these 51 cases, 15 went to an appeal and an additional three persons (two players and one coach) committed suicide during the course of the investigations.
Elsewhere, the president of the South African Football Association (SAFA) and four other officials were suspended in December as part of an investigation into match-fixing ahead of the country hosting the FIFA World Cup in 2010.
In response to this threat on soccer's integrity FIFPro, the worldwide players' union, recently announced a project to tackle fixing that will include an education program and an online tool for their members to report illegal approaches.
A statement on FIFA's website explained: "These services include the provision of coaching classes for local football clubs for youth and adult players; involvement in and support of football for those with disabilities; and the support of ongoing and future domestic anti-match-fixing activities.
