Philippines Coast Guard Rear Adm. Rodolfo Isorena said Wednesday that he hopes the salvaging will begin soon so that further damage to the reef will be limited, the Philippines News Agency said.
Various U.S. officials, including Navy Vice Adm. Scott Swift last month, have apologized to the Philippines for the incident, which the U.S. Navy and the Philippines Coast Guard are investigating.
The U.S. ambassador to the Philippines, Harry Thomas Jr., assured the Philippines on Monday that the United States "will provide appropriate compensation for damage to the reef caused by the ship."
One of the environmental concerns is that algae will grow on dead or scarred corals, park Superintendent Angelique Songco said.
"We expect an increase in the incidence of grazer fish species in the area that feed on the algae.
But the park, which is celebrating its 25th year, will have to close two of its 15 major diving sites during the operation, she said.
