The ballot initiative defined marriage as between a man and a woman and banned same-sex marriage in the Golden State.
A new Field Poll, released at the end of February, provides the evidence of what many of us here on the left coast have been sensing over the last 4Â½ years: When it comes to same-sex marriage, many California voters want a do-over.
Thirteen years ago, I opposed same-sex marriage and supported the watered-down alternative -- civil unions.
In 2000, another ballot initiative -- Proposition 22, which defined marriage as between a man and a woman -- was approved by 61% of California voters.
When the California Supreme Court struck down Proposition 22 as inconsistent with the state constitution, opponents of gay marriage got crafty and proposed another initiative -- Proposition 8, which went so far as to amend the state constitution to ban same-sex marriage.
California voters approved the measure, 52% to 48% -- and in doing so, betrayed their own liberal reputation.
It wasn't pretty.
One of the main messages behind these ads was that, if same-sex marriage were legal, it would somehow creep its way into the public schools through the curriculum.
But, as we have learned time and again, fear doesn't listen to facts.
In the new Field Poll for California, 64% of African-Americans and Asian-Americans and 56% of Hispanics now support same-sex marriage.
In the poll, 57% of Americans now say that they have a family member or close friend who is gay or lesbian.
This is either one heck of a coincidence or evidence that people come to support same-sex marriage as the issue begins to hit closer to home and they become aware that someone they care about is gay or lesbian.
Speaking of this issue being close to home for many of us, among those attending the arguments will be Chief Justice John Roberts' lesbian cousin who lives in California.
