Lance Armstrong is also being asked to pay back millions of dollars.
"Lance Armstrong has no place in cycling," said the union's president, Pat McQuaid, announcing that Armstrong is also banned from the sport.
Following the union's announcement, the French Cycling Federation said it was reissuing its call for Armstrong to return 2.95 million euros -- nearly $4 million -- that he collected for winning the tours.
The Texas insurance company covered bonuses that Armstrong was promised if he won the Tour de France.
In a statement Monday, SCA said it was "considering all legal options to pursue a return of the funds paid by SCA to Mr.
Armstrong."
Armstrong did not comment Monday.
Though in the past he has often tweeted angry responses against those who accused him of doping, Armstrong has remained uncharacteristically quiet in recent days.
But allegations of doping long dogged his career.
McQuaid said Monday the cycling union would not appeal USADA's decision.
Armstrong had made two donations to the union for anti-doping technology.
If Lance Armstrong was able to beat the system, then the responsibility for addressing that rests not only with the UCI but also with" the anti-doping agencies that accepted the results, the cycling union said in its statement.
He did so in 1986, 1989 and 1990.
In its 202-page report, the USADA said it had tested Armstrong less than 60 times and the International Cycling Union conducted about 215 tests.
Armstrong stepped down last week as chairman of his foundation but said he will continue to be involved.
