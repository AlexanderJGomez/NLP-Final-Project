"Yesterday and today, a number of mortar shells fell in close proximity to, and on the grounds of, the hotel in Damascus housing U.N. staff," U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky said.
Nesirky said the agency is "temporarily relocating some of the U.N. international staff in Syria out of the country."
The United Nations remains active and committed to helping the Syrian sides in their search for a political solution," Nesirky said.
Free Syrian Army head Col. Riad al-Asaad, who is not related to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, was injured Sunday during a visit to the eastern province of Deir Ezzor, FSA spokesman Louay Almokdad said.
The United States has designated the al-Nusra Front as a terrorist organization linked to al Qaeda, but some rebels say they don't have a problem fighting alongside them against Bashar al-Assad's forces.
They are 90% Syrians and the rest may be from other Muslim countries," the rebel leader said in the video.
Al-Asaad also slammed the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, the main opposition alliance whose leadership largely consists of expatriates.
I hope the Syrian National Coalition wakes up and figures out what they are doing."
Moaz al-Khatib, the Syrian opposition leader, will be addressing the Arab League summit in Qatar this week "on behalf of the Syrian people," he said on the opposition Syrian National Coalition's Facebook page.
"This decision represents an important asset for the Syrian revolution, and a major step on the road to achieve to its goals," the coalition said on its website.
He wanted to step down, he said, "so I could work with more freedom unavailable to me within the official position of the organization."
