The future of transport is self-driving cars, says GPS inventor Bradford Parkinson.
While he is now a professor emeritus at Stanford University in California, in the 1980s Parkinson headed up the GPS program run by the U.S. military.
The development of GPS was the product of a military program called 621B.
"The air force didn't want it because first of all they thought we couldn't necessarily do it and secondly they are used to their old ways.
According to Parkinson, there are myriad possible uses for GPS that are yet to be explored, but one of the most immediate applications will be the integration of GPS technology into self-driving cars, which he believes will help bring down the incidence of road accidents.
I'm saying GPS can absolutely be the key and cornerstone ...
It will include cooperation between cars; I will know where the next car is going and will be able to sense how good the friction is on the road, I can sense whether my tires are slipping.
Self-driving cars are currently being trialled by companies such as Google, whose driverless car is reputed to have already competed 400,000 miles of testing -- further than most motorists will travel in a lifetime.
There is already a product that truck drivers can install in order to sense adjacent vehicles."
