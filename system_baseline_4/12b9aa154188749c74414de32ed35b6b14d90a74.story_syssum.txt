Opponents of President Barack Obama's plan, which makes sweeping changes to the nation's immigration system by use of executive order, focused their criticism on the legal case, saying Obama has overstepped the boundaries of his authority and is ignoring the will of the people.
Jeb Bush called Obama's action "ill-advised" and said it "undermines all efforts to forge a permanent solution to this crisis" that should come from Congress.
"President Obama is not above the law and has no right to issue executive amnesty.
The President has said 22 times previously that he does not have the power to legislate on immigration," Paul said in a statement.
Other Texas Republicans said that the President's actions were not only lawless but also ineffectual.
Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, the second-place finisher in the 2012 battle for the GOP presidential nod and a potential 2016 contender, called the executive order "just another in a long line of power-grabs by this administration.

Arizona Sen. John McCain said Obama's "executive fiat" hurts chances of working with a Republican-dominated Congress on an immigration reform bill.
"The last time the President issued a politically motivated executive order to change our immigration laws, he precipitated a crisis at our border, leaving thousands of children at risk and ripping apart the families he claims to want to protect," Priebus said.
