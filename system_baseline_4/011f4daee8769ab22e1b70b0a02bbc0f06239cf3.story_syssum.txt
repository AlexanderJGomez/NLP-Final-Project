The 46th Farnborough International Airshow will commemorate the first show ever held in 1948 at this year's event in Hampshire which runs from July 14 to 20.
To mark the occasion, Farnborough's world-renowned flying display will include aircraft which flew at the first show like the Swordfish, Spitfire, Sea Hawk and Sea Fury.
As well as displaying aircraft for the public, Farnborough has also established itself as one of the world's premier showcases for the aviation business world.
A full range of civil, business and defence aircraft will take part in flying displays.
The Airbus A380 also made its UK debut at Farnborough that year.
