(CNN) -- The Puerto Rico Police Department has a long pattern of violating citizens' constitutional rights through excessive force and unwarranted searches, the Justice Department said in a report released Thursday.
Protesters at other demonstrations have been met with chokeholds and rocks thrown by police, the report said.
The Justice Department also found the police department fails to police sex crimes and cases of domestic violence, and discriminates by targeting people of Dominican descent.
The Justice Department also contends that there are problems not just with the way the Puerto Rico police department carries out its functions, but among the officers themselves.
The governor also said that police have been meeting with the Dominican community in Puerto Rico to address issues of discrimination in policing.
The Puerto Rico Police Department is the second-largest in the United States.
He said history has shown that crime declines when the public has confidence in its police.
Nationwide, there are 17 investigations such as the one in Puerto Rico against police departments in the United States, Perez said.
"With the facts laid bare, it is now the responsibility of the Puerto Rican government and the Justice Department to make sure the police abuse and brutality end as quickly as possible," ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said in a statement.
