(CNN) -- It's no shock that people love to hate Facebook.
I want to watch it drop like a rock," one Twitter user wrote on the eve of Facebook's initial public offering Thursday.
Dubbed "the Winklevii" in the film "The Social Network," Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss are set to make millions off of Facebook's IPO despite the fact that some courts have rejected their claims that Zuckerberg stole their idea for his blockbuster website.
They could make $228 million for their 6 million shares in the company, according to a CNNMoney gallery on Facebook's new billionaires.
'Screw it!
"For years, you've wasted your time on Facebook.
"One last thing: what will, I, Mark Zuckerberg, do with the $18 billion I'm expected to earn from Facebook's IPO?
According to The New York Times, Facebook's new billionaires may spend their money in subtle (but still over-the-top) ways.
Part of the reason some people are frustrated with Facebook this week is that all of us -- the users of Facebook -- are essentially the ones making the company so much money.

"Why is Facebook going public?
"The life and times of Mark Zuckerberg are dramatic, even epic, and -- you might say -- lyrical."
"I'm happy for Facebook, Zuck and others put in their own time efforts and own capital they deserve this reward," another Twitter pundit said.
That's the tack Facebook appears to be taking.
You don't have to agree with how Mark Zuckerberg does things, and you can hate if you want to.
