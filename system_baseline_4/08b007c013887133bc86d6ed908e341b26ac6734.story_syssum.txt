Viagra entered the market 10 years ago, bringing once taboo subjects like erectile dysfunction out in the open.
The pill helped more than 25 million men get their groove back and blasted the topic of erectile dysfunction into the open.
"It is one of the revolutionary steps in sexual health," said Dr. Ira Sharlip, spokesman for the American Urological Association.
Men with medical conditions such as diabetes, prostate cancer, hyper cholesterol, endocrinological and cardiovascular problems weren't able to enjoy sex, Goldstein said.
Viagra increases blood flow to the penis, enabling a man to have an erection.
"Along with the birth control pill in the '60s, this pill really changed people, society and medicine," Goldstein said.
Dr. Gerald Melchiode, a Texas psychiatrist, agreed that the pill has helped men open up about their sexual health, but finds the commercials a bit much.
Since Viagra's appearance on the market, the dialogue about sexual dysfunctions has helped doctors identify other health problems in their patients, doctors say.
"There's now good evidence that shows that men with ED who have no other symptoms of anything are at increased risk for heart attacks and strokes," he said.
Despite the deluge of attention, Viagra doesn't work for about 25 percent to 35 percent of men with erectile dysfunction.
Another complaint: Having to use Viagra makes a spouse or partner feel undesirable.
"Why does he have to take this pill?
"One has to think beyond just giving a pill to cure sexual problems," Melchiode said.
Just giving them a pill isn't going to touch on all the problems of the resentment and anger."
