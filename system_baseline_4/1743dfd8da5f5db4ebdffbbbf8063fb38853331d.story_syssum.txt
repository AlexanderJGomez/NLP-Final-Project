(CNN) -- What do you get when you combine a hotel and a boat?
Now the oldest ferry boat in the country has a permanent home moored on the Hudson River -- and a psychedelic new interior.
Today Lilla has a much gentler existence, permanently moored in the quiet fishing town of Harlingen in the northern Netherlands.
The renovated 14-meter boat includes a double bedroom, dining room and two-person wooden bath.
History buffs can experience life as a World War II sailor -- without the combat -- aboard the historic USS Silversides submarine.
The 95-meter vessel, popular with school groups, features 72 bunk beds, giving youngsters the chance to step back in time and dream of life as a wartime sailor.
Perched on top of London's Queen Elizabeth Hall, this fantastical boat looks out over the city's River Thames, Big Ben and St. Paul's Cathedral.
"With its combination of painted wood and hand-worked gold and silver coated metals, it seems to echo the simplicity of a Japanese tea-hut or the rural haphazard quality of a midwestern farm building," said organizers.
