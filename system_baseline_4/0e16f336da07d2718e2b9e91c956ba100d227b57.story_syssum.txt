International hip-hop artists warm up for their show at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on Tuesday.
Both hail from Argentina, home of the tango.
The program consists of three weeks of meeting American hip-hop artists and dancers and visiting New York City, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.
"It's like a dream come true for me," Salazar said Tuesday, the day of the team's show, "because I only read their names in the Internet and now, like, I met Afrika Bambaataa, the founder of hip-hop.
"Dancers in the Philippines don't have much of a foundation [in hip-hop]," she says.
I can feel it by watching these [American] hip-hop dancers."
Colombia Barrosse, the vibrant head of the State Department's Cultural Programs Division of the Bureau of Cultural Affairs, says the cultural cross-fertilization is the goal of the program.
Pham, a member of the Vietnam Dance Association, is currently working to open a hip-hop training center in Ho Chi Minh City to reach out to young people.
With a broad smile, he says, "Hip-hop is such energy.
"Yeah, I see them, all the dancers in the street, the music, all the people that like hip-hop music," he says.
