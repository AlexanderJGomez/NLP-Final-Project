Hollande allies claimed 314 seats in the 577-member National Assembly -- the lower house of the French parliament -- according to early confirmed results by the French Interior Ministry.
The far-right National Front won its first seats in parliament in 15 years, with two lawmakers elected, including the 22-year-old granddaughter of party founder Jean-Marie le Pen.
Hollande has already introduced some of his programs, which are centered on growth and spending, not austerity, reversing Sarkozy's policies.
Hollande has unsettled investors with his criticism of the austerity policies central to European bailout deals for troubled economies such as Greece's and Ireland's.
Last month, Hollande said he wanted to balance the need to reduce the debts of European governments with efforts to stimulate growth.
