Now, perhaps Borussia Dortmund can claim similar after crushing Real Madrid 4-1 in the first leg of its Champions League semifinal Wednesday.
Barring the prospect of miracles at Camp Nou and the Bernabeu next week, Dortmund will contest the first ever all-German Champions League final against Bayern Munich at Wembley on May 25.
"The first 25 minutes were great and then we lost a bit of our game.
Go back to the strong first 25 minutes'."
The fresh faced innocence, the youthful zest, the unbounded energy, all these traits have helped shape a Dortmund side, which is quickly winning the hearts of football fans across the globe.
Lewandowski led the line, a lone warrior refusing to be tamed by a Real defense appearing more and more desperate as the night progressed.
Real would have expected Dortmund to start at breakneck speed, but even it was taken aback by the pace, power and ferocity of the German side.
But while Dortmund dominated, it was unable to add to its advantage and was made to pay as Real struck back with just two minutes of the half remaining.
Ronaldo's strike, his sixth in six consecutive Champions League games, appeared to have left Dortmund in a daze.
Dortmund were rampant and the hugely impressive Gundogan almost added a fourth when his fierce effort was brilliantly tipped away by Lopez in the Real goal.
On that occasion, Deportivo La Coruna came back from a 4-1 defeat at AC Milan to win 5-4 on aggregate courtesy of a 4-0 home win.
"I think Dortmund were the best team by far," Real boss Mourinho told Sky Sports.
"We know everything about Robert Lewandowski, every detail possible and we lost him in three goals.
A 3-0 win would take Real through to the final and keep alive its hopes of winning "La Decima" -- the club's tenth trophy in the competition.
"It will be very difficult in the return leg at home but we must remain confident and try to react," Real captain Sergio Ramos told reporters.
