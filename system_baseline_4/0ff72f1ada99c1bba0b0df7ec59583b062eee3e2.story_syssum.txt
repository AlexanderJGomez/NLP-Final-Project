With boundless health information available at the click of a TV remote or computer mouse, patients such as Patti and Cliff have come to rely on these media as they would a doctor's visit.
Then Patti had a thought.
"There's a lot of useful information that people get from TV," said Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist, assistant professor of medicine at Emory University.
They'll go to the doctor for something they wouldn't have initially gone for."
That's what Patti and Cliff worried about as they spoke with the paramedics at their home.
"People will hear something and it's like, it's meant," Oz told CNN.
Patients who play an active role in their care, which can include searching symptoms online, have better health outcomes, Bergquist said.
"Physicians can add the perspective and knowledge of putting symptoms together in terms of a patient's history," she said.
Although Cliff and Patti now readily turn to the Internet and TV, they know it can't replace a relationship with a doctor.
"[Stents are] a scary thing to look up," Patti said.
Sticking to legitimate websites is the safest bet, Bergquist said.
But if used correctly, the Internet and TV can make you a more educated and empowered patient -- and maybe even save your life.
