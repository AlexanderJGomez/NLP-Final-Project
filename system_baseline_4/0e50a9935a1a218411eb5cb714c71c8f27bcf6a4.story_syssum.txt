In early January, the fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, met with Bristol County, Massachusetts, prosecutors in what court documents call an immunity meeting, but the results of that meeting are secret, even from the Hernandez defense team.
Jenkins has been a regular at hearings for Hernandez.
"Normally, a fiancée is not going to testify adversely against her true love," said Callan, a former New York homicide prosecutor.
Prosecutors suspect Jenkins of following instructions from Hernandez to get rid of the murder weapon from their home by removing the gun inside a box, putting it in a black trash bag, and borrowing her sister's car to take the bag to a dumpster and throw it away.
Prosecutors said Jenkins, Hernandez's high school sweetheart, lied to a grand jury several times about the presence of guns in their North Attleboro home, among other issues.
Search warrants said Hernandez asked Jenkins to get something out of their basement.
A home surveillance video shows Jenkins leaving the house about an hour later carrying something "rigid" she described as a box, court documents state.
Jenkins told a grand jury she threw the item in a dumpster but couldn't remember where, according to prosecutors.
"I mean, who knows?"
Hernandez's defense team has filed a motion demanding to know what promises prosecutors may have made to Jenkins.
Callan suggested that if Jenkins is put on the stand as a prosecution witness and repeats her grand jury testimony that she threw out the item without knowing what was inside and can't remember where she disposed of it, she could put herself in greater legal jeopardy.
"It's going to increase her guilt if the prosecutor pursues perjury charges," Callan said.
