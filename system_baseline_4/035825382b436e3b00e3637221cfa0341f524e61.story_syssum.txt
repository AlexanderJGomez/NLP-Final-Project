(CNN) -- Tom Cruise should have been a rock star.
Turns out, some things are worth waiting for.
A caricature of already larger-than-life personalities Axl Rose and Steven Tyler, Stacee is very much a supporting character in Chris D'Arienzo's Tony-award-winning 2009 musical.
But he's also the star of the show, the one everybody else is dying to see, to make or to emulate.
A karaoke musical in which almost everybody bursts into FM anthems at the drop of a hat (yes, even Baldwin, who duets with Russell Brand on a camp rendition of REO Speedwagon's "Can't Fight This Feeling"), by rights "Rock of Ages" shouldn't come off as a one-man show.
Drew's own singing aspirations get considerably more screen time than Sherrie's, but he still fails to make much impact.
Even so, it's good to see Tom Cruise letting his hair down.
It's a fun show if you roll with it.
