WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A federal prosecutor formally declared Army biological researcher Bruce Ivins the sole person responsible for creating and mailing the bacterial spores that killed five people in the 2001 anthrax attacks.
The anthrax-laced letters sickened 15 and killed two Washington postal workers, a New York hospital worker, a National Enquirer photo editor in Florida and a 94-year-old woman in Connecticut.

"Dr. Ivins was a troubled individual," Taylor said, referring to his documented history of mental illness.
Investigators also traced the envelopes that contained the spore-laced letters to the Frederick, Maryland, area where Ivins lived, Taylor said.
Allah is Great."
Authorities began focusing on Ivins in 2007, but he was unable to give investigators an "adequate explanation" when questioned by authorities about the long hours he had spent at the lab around the time of the attacks, according to the affidavit, which also said Ivins tried to mislead FBI agents by giving them false samples of the bacteria from his lab for analysis.
At the time of his death, Ivins was under a temporary restraining order sought by a social worker who had counseled him in private and group sessions.
Taylor said Ivins was one of few people at Fort Detrick who knew how to operate a lyophilizer, which converts wet anthrax into the kind of dry powder that was used in the attacks.
