Tacloban, Philippines (CNN) -- For Joseph Pedrero, the thought of another massive tropical storm bearing down on his home in Tacloban is traumatic.
"But we did not expect that a storm surge would be coming and take all our family away.
"The government is now providing better information.
I'm scared but at least I know what is going on.
He said one of the biggest problems last year was the sheer volume of people they had to help.
"Many were coming in from outside Tacloban and saying they were from here," he said.
The few shops that remain open seem to have plentiful supplies on their shelves, and no real queues to speak of.
Like many others people in Tacloban, it took Joseph months to rebuild his home -- and his life -- after such an appalling tragedy.
Joseph seems resigned to this.
We fear this typhoon will destroy everything again," he said.
And that is the biggest difference between this year and last.
