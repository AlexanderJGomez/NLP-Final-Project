Moore, Oklahoma (CNN) -- A search-and-rescue effort to find survivors of a monster tornado that pulverized a vast swath of the suburbs of Oklahoma City shifted Tuesday to one of recovery, officials said.
"I think that will stand," Lewis said.
Damage assessments conducted Tuesday showed the tornado packed winds, at times, between 200 and 210 miles per hour, making it an EF5 -- the strongest category of tornadoes measured, the National Weather Service said Tuesday.
Hardest hit was Moore, Oklahoma -- a suburban town of about 56,000 and the site of eerily similar twisters in 1999 and again four years later.
Rescue crews were expected to complete a search for victims by late Tuesday, Moore Fire Chief Gary Bird told CNN.
"But you know, that's how it goes," Wilkerson said, his voice shaking.
"I still can't believe this is happening," he said.
The weather wasn't cooperating with their efforts: National Weather Service crews surveying the damage in Moore reported rain, half-inch hail and 45-mph winds over the debris field.
Moore residents had about 30 minutes before the massive storm entered the western part of the city, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said.
Of the nine children killed by the storm, authorities said seven died at Plaza Towers Elementary School where the tornado ripped the roof off and collapsed walls.
On Monday, a father of a third-grader still missing sat quietly on a stool outside.
How did this happen?
...
Moore, and the Oklahoma City region, are far too familiar with disaster.
Todd Lamb said.
This is a tough community," Lamb said.
"If there is hope to hold on to -- not just in Oklahoma but around the country -- it's the knowledge that the good people there and in Oklahoma are better prepared for this type of storm than most," he said.
"We could have a round 3," CNN meteorologist Ivan Cabrera said.
