Women are the voters most likely to matter on November 6 -- they make up the majority of undecided voters and they outvote men.
They know about the pay gap.
"How are we supposed to do it?"
In order for the candidates to speak directly to women, they need to talk about jobs, but not just any jobs.Â  What matters are good jobs that make family lives sustainable.
This pay discrepancy affects the economic well-being of American households.
Inequality in pay means families have less money for quality child care, less education, fewer doctor visits and more scrambling to make ends meet, year in and year out.
When women ask about fair pay, they are also asking about how to get jobs that make it possible to take a sick child to the doctor.
It's good for the economy, and good for families.
First, fight for the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would expand 1963's Equal Pay Act and make it easier for women to compare their pay with that of fellow workers.
Family responsibilities burden all workers, men as well as women, regardless of pay.
Forty percent of the people in the work force do not have paid sick days, which puts them in danger of losing their jobs when they are sick; millions more cannot take sick days to care for their children.
This legislation would grant workers up to seven job-protected paid sick days each year, to use not just when they are ill, but for helping sick family members and preventive care.
