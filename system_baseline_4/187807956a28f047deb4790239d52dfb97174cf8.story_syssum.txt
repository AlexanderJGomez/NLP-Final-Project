"Patients are sandwiched between two groups who are being less than helpful: the FDA and Ranbaxy," said Lisa Gill, editor of prescription drugs at Consumer Reports.
A Food and Drug Administration spokeswoman couldn't explain why the recall didn't direct consumers to stop taking the drug even though patients might have received the contaminated pills.
"It makes my palms sweat just thinking about it."
Pharmacists at several CVS pharmacies said it was all right to keep taking already-filled prescriptions of Ranbaxy atorvastatin, but the company would exchange it for another brand at a customer's request.
The FDA has accused the company of "a pattern of systemic fraudulent conduct," including taking shortcuts in crucial quality tests.
