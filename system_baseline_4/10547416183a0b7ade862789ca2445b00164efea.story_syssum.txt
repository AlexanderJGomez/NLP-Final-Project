(CNN) -- With a slew of domestic violence cases permeating the NFL, some football fans are benching America's favorite fall pastime.
And the women's rights group Ultraviolet flew a banner over the New York Giants-Arizona Cardinals game Sunday, saying Goodell must go.
But the recent cases of four players -- Ray Rice, Greg Hardy, Adrian Peterson and Ray McDonald -- have hurled the topic into the spotlight.
After McDonald posted bail, he said he couldn't say much about the case.
Last week, San Francisco 49ers CEO Jed York said the team was awaiting the outcome of the criminal case against McDonald before determining whether to punish him.
But the NFL Players Association said Sunday that it could not confirm whether an appeal decision has been made.
After public outcry over a two-game suspension for Rice, the NFL established a six-game unpaid ban for personnel who violate the league's policy on domestic violence, Goodell said Thursday.
But his attorney said Peterson is "a loving father" who was disciplining his son.
Hardy said he is innocent and has appealed a guilty verdict.
"The climate has changed," he said.
"On Monday morning, I was genuinely excited to come to work and break down what I thought was a fascinating first weekend in the NFL," Storm told viewers.
Storm said she has some lingering questions of her own.
What does it mean for female fans whose dollars are so coveted by the NFL (and) who make up an estimated 45% of the NFL's fan base?"
