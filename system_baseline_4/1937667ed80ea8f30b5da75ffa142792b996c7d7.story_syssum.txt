Jameel Jaffer says the courts have ruled that refusal to disclose the abuse photos was unlawful.
(CNN) -- Last week President Obama announced that he would suppress prisoner abuse photographs that he earlier said he would release.
The government has acknowledged that they depict prisoner abuse at locations other than Abu Ghraib, and it's clear that the photos would provide irrefutable evidence that abuse was widespread and systemic.
In explaining his change of heart, President Obama said that the release of the photos "would not add any additional benefit" to the ongoing public debate about the abuse of prisoners.
President Obama's statement was meant to explain why the photos would not inform the public debate, but it only underscored why the release of the photographs is so important.
President Obama's other rationale for suppressing the photographs is that they would "inflame anti-American opinion and put our troops in greater danger," an argument that was repeatedly rejected by the courts when made by the Bush administration.

Blinding ourselves to the ugly consequences of the Bush administration's policies only deprives us of the opportunity to learn from recent history.
