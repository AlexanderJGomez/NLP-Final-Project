(TIME.com) -- As the assistant chef and the senior policy adviser for healthy-food initiatives at the White House, Sam Kass knows how to fill a plate to the first lady's approval.
You believe we will see the greatest changes to national health when young kids start making healthy eating decisions for themselves.

Really any of the seven MyPlate tips, if we did any of those, we would really have a great impact.
It feels like these problems are just so big, but in the end, the solutions can be quite small, approachable and doable.
I think there's a tremendous amount that we can all learn from the world.
There's care taken in making sure people have time to prepare them properly with good portion sizes.
We have a lot of peppers, our zucchinis and yellow squash are just finishing up.
We have the best pumpkin harvest of our time here by quite a lot.
That's what we're doing.
But we just can't have it day in and day out.
I'm also a big oatmeal guy.
