We can all agree that providing higher wages to home care workers would reward professional caregivers, attract more qualified people to this growing industry and improve care for the elderly and disabled.
As the head of a home care agency in Massachusetts, I am required by state law to pay overtime to caregivers who are eligible.
Why?
Let's say you need more than 40 hours of custodial home care every week.
If your caregiver wants the extra income, you can arrange for him or her to work more than 40 hours at the wage you have agreed to.
Any increase in home care wage for caregivers means more money flowing out of the Social Security check or retirement savings of seniors.
For a professional caregiver who wants to work more than 40 hours a week at the regular rate (and many do), that option evaporates when overtime pay is required.
Home care workers do not wind up with overtime assignments and higher earnings; instead, they receive less work and make less money.
Paying home care workers more money would have clear social benefits, but if it comes at the cost of pricing vulnerable seniors out of the home care market or reducing the earning potential of caregivers, then we need to rethink our laws.
