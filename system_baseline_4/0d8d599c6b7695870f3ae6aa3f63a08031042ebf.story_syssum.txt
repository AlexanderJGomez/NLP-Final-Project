The captain of a ship at sea is one of the last bastions of total authority in this world.
For this reason, a sea captain is granted complete independence, power, and control aboard his vessel.
He is given extraordinary training for the challenges of the waters he is in and the vessel he is commanding.
The captain of the Costa Concordia had all these resources at his disposal, and yet audio recordings and other accounts appear to show him violating every commonly accepted notion of how a captain will behave in a crisis.
Third, his personal decision to leave the vessel before his passengers had safely embarked from the ship shows a flagrant disrespect for his ultimate responsibilities as a sea captain.
One can only imagine how many might have perished had the ship run into trouble at sea with this particular captain and crew.
But even before it gets under way, one thing is clear: the training and promotion process that put a man like this in command of a passenger ship missed the character flaw that allowed him to jeopardize his vessel for some apparently transient and empty purpose.
He has been called a hero in the Italian press, but rejects the moniker.
I just did my duty, the duty of a sea captain," he said.
