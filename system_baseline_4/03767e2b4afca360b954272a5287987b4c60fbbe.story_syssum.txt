Thomas Perez has climbed America's "ladder of opportunity" and now can help others do the same, President Barack Obama said on Monday in nominating the assistant U.S. attorney general as labor secretary.
In brief remarks, Perez thanked Obama in both English and Spanish for what he called the honor of the opportunity.
Obama and Democrats call for a combination of stimulus spending, budget cuts and reforms to the tax system and entitlement programs to reduce chronic federal deficits and debt while maintaining government support for education, research and other areas they consider vital to economic development.
Perez's nomination pleased unions and workers' rights groups, but rankled Senate conservatives due in part to his record at the Justice Department.
"Mr. Perez has also had a controversial tenure at the Department of Justice where he has demonstrated a fundamentally political approach to the law."
Perez, who has overseen the agency's civil rights division, has been active in several high-profile cases in recent years.
Perez also became involved in a controversial 2008 voting rights case after it drew attention from Republican legislators and became the target of a Justice Department inspector general's report.
Though Perez had not yet been confirmed to oversee the civil rights division when the decision was made, he said in testimony to Inspector General Michael Horowitz in May 2010 that politics played no part in the decision.
Before rising to the Justice Department position, Perez led Maryland's Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation.
