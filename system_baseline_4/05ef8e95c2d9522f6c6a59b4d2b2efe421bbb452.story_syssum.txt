When you only eat fruit, you're excluding a lot of valuable nutrients from your diet, says Marisa Moore, registered dietician and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

Fruit contains a lot of natural sugar, which needs to be controlled by insulin in the body, Moore says.
Even if you don't overwork your pancreas, you're probably not eating enough calories on an all-fruit diet, Moore says.
It's nutritious.
