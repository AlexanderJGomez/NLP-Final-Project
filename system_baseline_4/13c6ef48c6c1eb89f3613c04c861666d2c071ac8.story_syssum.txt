Japan's birth rate of 1.34 is below the level needed to maintain the country's population.
Keidanren, Japan's largest business group, with 1,300 major international corporations as members, has issued a plea to its members to let workers go home early to spend time with their families and help Japan with its pressing social problem.
One reason for the low birth rate is the 12-hour workday.
The 5:30 p.m. lights-out program is one simple step toward helping address the population problem.
