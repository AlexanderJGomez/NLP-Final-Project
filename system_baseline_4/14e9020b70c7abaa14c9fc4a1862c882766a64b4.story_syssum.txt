(CNN) -- Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who died Wednesday at 56, made the world "immeasurably better," the company's board of directors said in a statement.
Cook said the company is planning a "celebration of Steve's extraordinary life for Apple employees that will take place soon."
The family said a website will be provided for those wishing to offer tributes and memories.
"RIP."
A bagpiper played as onlookers visited the site, some wiping their eyes.
Jobs' greatest love was for his wife, Laurene, and his family, the statement said.
