Bobby Jindal's swipe at federal spending to monitor volcanoes has the mayor of one city in the shadow of Mount St. Helens fuming.
Royce Pollard, the mayor of Vancouver, Washington, said on Wednesday.
"Instead of monitoring volcanoes, what Congress should be monitoring is the eruption of spending in Washington," Jindal said.
The volcano killed 57 people when it erupted in 1980 and sputters back into action periodically, most recently in late 2004 and early 2005, when it sent plumes of steam and ash thousands of feet into the air.
Louisiana is no stranger to natural disasters itself, having been devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
"That was just one example of wasteful spending in the largest government spending bill in history," Teepell said.
He said he wasn't sure how many jobs the money could produce, but, "For us and the people who live closer to it than Vancouver, it's important."
