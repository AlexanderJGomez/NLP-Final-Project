Fashion's Night Out, which took place last night in New York and across the world, is not for the self-conscious.
One can judge the success of their ensemble by the number of times they're asked for a photograph.
It was clear that something needed to happen to get people comfortable with shopping again and to remind them that their purchases were helping to support the economy and the lives of those around them that worked in fashion," said Susan Portnoy, vice president of media relations at Cond√© Nast.
"We feel that Fashion's Night Out helped to jump-start that thinking then, and each year it serves as a reminder," she said.
Since 2009, Fashion's Night Out has expanded to 19 countries and more than 500 cities in the U.S.
Ogura, standing out in Rockefeller Center with a bright yellow blazer and black cloche hat, said the event's appeal lies in its accessibility: It's an opportunity for the general public to connect with the seemingly intimidating fashion community on a more personal level.
"It's not only about the inspiration from all around and being in stores and seeing the new line and getting excited for Fashion Week, it's everyone coming together for a good cause," she said.
It galvanizes the community around a common love of shopping and fashion in unexpected and creative ways," said Portnoy.
At designer Nicole Miller's SoHo boutique, assistant manager Fantcha Mendes bops along to the DJ with an enormous smile because, to her, Fashion's Night Out "encourages people to feel good about themselves."
"We're having an amazing day so far," she said with a grin, glancing at the register.
