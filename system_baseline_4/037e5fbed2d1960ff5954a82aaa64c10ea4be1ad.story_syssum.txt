(CNN) -- A book company said Wednesday that it will release on September 11 a firsthand account of the raid that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
The former Navy SEAL was on the Bin Laden raid, according to Pentagon officials.
U.S. Special Operations Command has not reviewed the book or approved it, a Defense Department official said.
About two dozen U.S. Special Operations members and two helicopters were involved in the raid early May 2, 2011, in Abbottabad, Pakistan, that killed bin Laden.
The first man killed in the mission -- which the U.S. official said was code-named Operation Neptune Spear -- was the Kuwaiti courier who had worked for bin Laden.
From that point on, it is believed no other shots were fired at the U.S. forces, the official said -- which contrasts with early U.S. government reports describing the operation as a "firefight."
The U.S. official said that the team then entered the third-floor room where bin Laden was, along with his Yemeni wife and several young children.
Three months later, 15 members of Seal Team Six were killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan.
The new movie was said to be set for release just before the election, but after Republicans complained that it was a pro-Obama ad, it was pushed back until December.
The Pentagon's inspector general began an inquiry after questions were raised by Rep. Peter King, R-New York.
Some of what those investigations found did show collaboration between the administration and the filmmakers, but Defense Department and White House officials have said it's no different than what they give many filmmakers and news reporters on a regular basis.
