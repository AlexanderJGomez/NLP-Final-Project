Robin Givens told Joy Behar Tuesday night that details of domestic abuse are often the same.
...
Givens: Yes, it does.
...
Behar.
Givens:  I've spoken to women every[where].
He would like to choke me.
And a woman came up to me and she said I wanted you to stop talking because I felt like everybody would know that you were talking about me.
Givens: I was hit for the first time before I was married.
Givens: Yes.
And then you meet and all of a sudden this person, this man that you love, that's claiming his love for you, is crying, you know?
...
...
Givens: It's been torture.
...
Behar: That is a most interesting moment  in that interview, which I've seen many times.
...
...
...
Givens: Well, he had said that he was going to get help.
Behar: One of the most influential women in the world used her considerable power to speak up about domestic abuse.
...
Behar: If Oprah was speaking to you, too, call the National Domestic Violence Hot Line now.
...
How are you?
And it is.
...
Givens: Um-hmm.
Brown: And then that escalates into the physical violence, which is the hitting, the kicking, the punching, throwing up against the walls.
Givens: She's absolutely right.
Givens: I don't know why that is.
He said right now, it would take three years for people that are batterers to get that mindset to change.
Givens: The one thing I'd like to say to Rihanna, actually; as difficult as this all is, she does not have to answer to the media.
Behar: Thank you all very much.
Get help now.
