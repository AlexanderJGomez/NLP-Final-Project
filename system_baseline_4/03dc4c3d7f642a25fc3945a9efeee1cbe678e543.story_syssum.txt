LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Rob Thomas is a busy guy -- so busy, he apparently hasn't had much time to check in with his Matchbox Twenty bandmates.
By the time we met up with Thomas the next day, he and Doucette had already connected over drinks somewhere between midnight and the morning -- musician's hours.
Even though he's clearly excited about it, he spends as much time talking about Matchbox Twenty as he does the solo album he's in town to promote.
Carlos will call me at 10 at night and be like, "Listen, I had a dream about you, and so much good is happening, but there's dark forces at work, and when you get out of here, I have this woman who wants to cleanse you."
The first time we did an interview with MTV, it was about how no one knew who we were.
I don't know if we were being naive at the time, but we thought we'd won because our songs were more famous than we were.
Thomas: No.
I can go out and do it [publicity] for them, and they're fine with it.
I go to movie premieres -- my wife and I -- all the time, and nine out of 10 of those movie premieres, much to my publicist's dismay, I get there, but I sneak around the pictures and get into the party [using the back entrance].
And you have to not think you're so great so you don't get upset when somebody doesn't like your stuff.
Like "Her Diamonds" -- one of the singles on this solo album -- is one of my favorite songs that I've ever written, and the guys loved the song, but didn't want to play it.
Thomas: Britney Spears.
Thomas: Tom Petty is a famous musician.
When Tom Petty walks down the street, you know that it's Tom Petty, but it would be like, "Oh my gosh, it's Tom Petty!
-- and 3 million teenage girls follow him down the street.
