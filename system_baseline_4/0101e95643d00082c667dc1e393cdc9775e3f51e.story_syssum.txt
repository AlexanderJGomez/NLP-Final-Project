A new lawsuit alleges Bernie Madoff financed a sex-and-drugs workplace with investors' money.
Attorneys Joseph Cochett and Nancy Fineman filed the complaint based on an investigation, including a four-hour interview with Madoff in prison in July, that they conducted for former investors.
According to the complaint, Madoff transferred funds to London to buy extravagant personal items.
Officials of KPMG and the Bank of New York did not immediately respond to calls from CNN Wednesday evening for comment on the lawsuit.
Madoff was fond of escorts and masseuses, and used money stolen from investors to pay them, according to the complaint.
The complaint includes details of Madoff's drastically different life now in prison.
Many of his fellow inmates are in prison for drug and sex crimes, according to the lawsuit.
"Our goal of meeting with Madoff during the investigation is to get as much money back from responsible parties and that's why lawsuits are filed and why lawyers do what they do," Fineman said.
"He told us things that were self-serving to him," she said.
