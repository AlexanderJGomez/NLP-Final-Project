A 30-foot tract of red clay and splotchy crab grass separates her mobile home from the home of Raymond Daniel Thurmond, a residence so rank and squalid that it forced a seasoned police investigator to vomit upon entering.
Savage and her neighbors say they had no clue that Thurmond, 36, had a wife, let alone four kids; they were also oblivious that Thurmond may have held the five hostage in the three-bedroom mobile home for three years.
Thurmond kindly told Savage he hadn't seen anything suspicious.
She occasionally saw Thurmond mingling with other tenants, but she never saw his family.

Collins said police are not sure if padlocks were the only way Thurmond imprisoned his family.

Heavy, brown stains covered both toilets.
Collins said she went behind an adjacent mobile home and vomited when she and another officer first opened the door.
Collins said she had never experienced such a stench -- this from a police investigator who as recently as last week rode in an ambulance with a corpse that had been pulled from a burning building.
As of Thursday morning, Thurmond still didn't have an attorney and no bail hearing had been set, Collins said.
