San Diego, California (CNN) -- Nearly six years ago, I left Texas to move back home to California.
Texas added four House seats and increased its number of electoral votes to 38.
The other winners in the census lottery include Florida, which picked up two new seats in Congress.
It makes for quite a sea change.
Texas is the buckle in that belt.
Texas is the second-largest state in area, behind Alaska.
But in terms of population growth, it's second to none.
Texas is still a red state, but there is some evidence that it's trending purple.
You can't talk honestly about population growth in Texas without acknowledging two things.
Second, much of the rest of Texas' population growth is tied to the phenomenal increase in the Hispanic population.
According to Bill Frey, a demographer with the Brookings Institution, Hispanics made up more than half the new arrivals to Texas.
There is no question that, as a result of the population shifts of the past 10 years, Texas and states out West are coming into their own and will have more power and influence to steer a new course for the country.
