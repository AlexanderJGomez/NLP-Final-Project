The monsoon floods that engulfed most of the country and affected 20 million people have added yet another burden of misery onto the shoulders of the average Pakistani.
In Urdu, Pakistan means the "land of the pure."
Pakistan may be a world away from the United States, but instability feeds the extremism that fuels terrorism, so we ignore this crisis at our peril.
Pakistan followed along.
The Pakistan my father brought us home to experience was disappearing before our eyes.
But Pakistan couldn't.
Since 9/11, Pakistan has supported America's intervention in Afghanistan, the right decision but one fraught with controversy.
Pakistan needs America's help.
America needs a stable Pakistan.
The Pakistan government needs to focus on three things to stop the country's downward spiral: education, infrastructure and security.
These mullahs interpret the Quran for the people, and often they do so in an uninformed, uneducated way that distorts the true teachings of Islam.
The roads are a mess, electricity goes out most days and not enough food is produced.
In terms of security, with Afghanistan at war on one side and the barely held truce with India on the other, Pakistan needs to secure its borders, ignore the problems of its neighbors and focus internally.
I believe in Pakistan, as my father did.
And with America's support and investment, someday Pakistan may even be able to dream again of achieving its noble destiny as the "land of the pure."
