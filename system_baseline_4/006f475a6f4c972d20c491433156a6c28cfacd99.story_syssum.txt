And now, at what would have been a few weeks from her senior year in college, Christian Minard finds herself expelled from school -- because the person she married is another woman.
In a letter from earlier this month that Minard shared with CNN, an administrator at Southwestern Christian University noted that he'd been told of Minard's same-sex marriage and saw pictures of it posted to Facebook.
Did Minard sign the school's morality covenant?
"...
Minard came to the school on scholarship for basketball, though her playing career was cut short after doctors told her -- after she'd suffered multiple concussions -- that she should avoid sports with physical contact.
"We eventually fell in love and decided to get married," Minard said.
"Once I graduated," Minard said, "I was willing to go wherever life took me."
Having grown up in the Lutheran Church, Minard notes that she "at first ... struggled" with the idea that her faith was at odds with her sexuality.
And I believe you can still have faith in God and live a gay lifestyle."
