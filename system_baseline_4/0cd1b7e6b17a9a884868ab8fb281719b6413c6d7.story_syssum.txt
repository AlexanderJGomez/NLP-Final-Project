His team tried to summit via the mountain's notorious West Ridge in 2006.
Faced with the fearsome power of nature mountaineers like Bunting rely on one indispensable ally -- other mountaineers.
To illustrate this point, when Bunting -- a warrant officer in the British Army -- was compiling a team of soldiers to attempt an ascent of Everest's notorious West Ridge the first quality he and the rest of the selection panel looked for was not climbing expertise, but compatibility.
Bunting, 40, led the expedition of 21 army mountaineers to Everest's West Ridge two years ago.
Much of this build-up involved establishing strong bonds between team members.
An essential factor on a mountain as significant as Everest, Bunting says.
"(On Everest) a lot of people are out for themselves completely," says Bunting.
He says this selfish streak is exacerbated by the fast turnover of commercial climbing expeditions, which often meet for the first time just a couple of weeks before a summit attempt, meaning there is little opportunity to build team morale.
The biggest test of this togetherness came when Bunting was left the unenviable task of telling his team of ambitious young soldiers he was abandoning the summit attempt because of a high risk of avalanches.
This clear-headed thinking meant his team braved one of the most dangerous climbs in the world and made it back down again, together.
