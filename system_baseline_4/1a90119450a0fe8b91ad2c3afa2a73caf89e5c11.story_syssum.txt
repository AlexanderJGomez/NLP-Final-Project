For someone who makes a living out of communications, I have consistently been tongue-tied around Nelson Mandela.
However, with Madiba (as Mandela is often called), I feel like every moment spent with him is a gift, a blessing that I will tell my grandchildren about one day.
I first met Nelson Mandela in the early 1990s.
I remember thinking, if Nelson Mandela thinks I am gracious -- fantastic.
Years later, I was a young reporter working for the South African Broadcasting Corporation during Mandela's presidency.
The one I remember most was around a birthday or Christmas during which there was a photo opportunity at one of his grandson's kindergartens.
Mandela just happened to be an honorary fellow at Magdalene College, where I was studying.
Fast forward a few more years, I reported on Mandela occasionally during my time as a correspondent at CNN London's bureau.
( I didn't.
Or the time, I asked Zelda la Grange, his devoted personal assistant, to take a photo of me and Madiba together before I went up to Cambridge.
That's a complete no-no around Mandela -- his eyes were damaged during his years of imprisonment on Robben Island and flash photography is forbidden.
I never thought I'd meet him again, up close and personal, until, last year when Zelda, ever the diplomat, like her boss, invited to me to introduce my newly born daughter, Freya, to him.
The ones we sent to friends (and everybody we knew), show us laughing with the world's greatest statesman.
She freaked out some more.
