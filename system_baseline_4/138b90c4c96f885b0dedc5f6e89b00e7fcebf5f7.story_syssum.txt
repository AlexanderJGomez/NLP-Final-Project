Washington (CNN) -- Briefly back in Congress doing his day job, Ron Paul met with high school students outside his office.
"We are in denial here in Congress," Paul said on the House floor.
But Paul's Republican colleagues who did go had no shortage of opinions about his strong showing in the presidential race so far.
Ron Paul does that," said Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Alabama, who has served with Paul for years.
He feels very strongly about limited government, about personal responsibility and individual freedoms, and staying consistent has drawn a good, solid base for him in this presidential campaign," Brady said.
"We didn't count on him for anything.
"Many times, the vote would be 434-1 -- he'd be the one, but he was the one who kind of put up the ideological goal posts -- this is where you should be if you're pure, and what we found is no one is really pure except Ron Paul," he said.
And if you want to vote with him, great, and there's been a lot to be said for it," said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, who says he personally likes Paul very much.
"I like Ron Paul's independence," Jones told CNN in his office.
We've got to fix the job situation.
Jones thinks Paul has caught fire now because he has been so consistent.
"He's a workhorse, and that's what Washington needs right now is a workhorse, not a show horse," Jones said.
