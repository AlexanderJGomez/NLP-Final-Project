Peruvian authorities say that Van der Sloot has already confessed to killing Stephany Flores Ramirez and could be charged on Tuesday.
De Ruiter has not met van der Sloot and told De Volkskrant her suggestion that he may have a psychopathic disorder was based on analysis of "books, images and interviews" concerning the case.
Those with the condition "typically have no regard for right and wrong" and may be prone to violent behavior, according to MayoClinic.com.
But Trouw, in the opinion piece published before van der Sloot's alleged confession, said: "What if he is still proven innocent?
So he must be treated.
Radio Netherlands Worldwide said van der Sloot's alleged confession over the killing of Flores was a "surprise" as van der Sloot had previosly refused to say anything about his alleged involvement.
