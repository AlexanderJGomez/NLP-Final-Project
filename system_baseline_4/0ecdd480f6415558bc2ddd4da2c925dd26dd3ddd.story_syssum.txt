John Couey had been sentenced to death for killing 9-year-old Jessica Lunsford in Florida in 2005.
A source close to the case told CNN that Couey's death was not unexpected and he had been ill for some time.
"To me, death is sad," he said.
Couey was sentenced to die in August 2007 for abducting and raping Lunsford, then killing her by burying her alive.
"I am not shedding any tears," the girl's grandmother, Ruth Lunsford, said on Wednesday.
"
Citrus County Sheriff Jeff Dawsy, who led the investigation into the girl's death, told reporters he wished Couey could have faced the death sentence handed down by the jury.
"I'm sorry I won't get to look him in the eyes as he died, but I'm relieved to know he'll never hurt another child again."
In sentencing Couey, Judge Ric Howard noted Couey became fearful of police dogs being used in the area in the search for the girl.
Howard, at Couey's sentencing, brought many in the courtroom to tears as he discussed how the girl died slowly as her oxygen ran out.
"He caused a slow, suffering, conscious death," Howard said of Couey.
Although Lunsford's death was one of several that contributed to the passage of a federal child-protection law dealing with sex offender registration and other matters related to child sex offenses, Mark Lunsford said at the time of Couey's sentencing the law does not go far enough.

"I have bad news," Mark Lunsford said.
"You want to do something for her, give your life for the one you took."
