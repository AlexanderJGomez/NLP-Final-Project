The Log Cabin Republicans had filed an emergency request with the nation's highest court to reverse the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals decision allowing the military to continue with "don't ask, don't tell" while the government appeals a lower court ruling that the law is unconstitutional.
Until the larger questions are decided, that court had allowed the current enforcement policy to remain in place, prompting the time-sensitive appeal to the high court.
As solicitor general in the Justice Department before joining the high court in August, Kagan had been involved in preparing initial briefs in the case.
The appeals judges also noted that legislation pending before Congress to repeal the policy would render the case before them moot.
The losing side would probably ask the Supreme Court to step in once again, but the justices have the discretion not to accept the case for review.
Gay rights groups say the policy violates the due process and First Amendment rights of military members.
"The military should not be required to suddenly and immediately restructure a major personnel policy that has been in place for years, particularly during a time when the nation is involved in combat operations overseas," the government said in its high court brief.
In response to the court case, Gates recently raised the level at which gay and lesbian troops can be discharged under "don't ask, don't tell" by ordering that it be done only by the secretaries of the Army, Navy and Air Force.
Since Gates made the change, no service member has been discharged, according to Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell.
