See who the Dutch royal family are Â»
There was no one other than the driver in the car at the time, police spokeswoman Esther Naber said.
"The Netherlands always has been proud of their no nonsense royal family.
Is that still possible now the royal family has been the target of an attack?"
And will we continue to see the members of the royal family cycling through the canals of Amsterdam or hunting for bargains in the Bijenkorf in The Hague?"
The day is marked with the color orange all over the country as a reference to the colors of the royal family, who come from the House of Orange-Nassau.
