Also feared dead in the crash were two children -- ages 1 and 13 -- in one house, East Haven Mayor Joseph Maturo Jr. said.
Dannel Malloy said there could be as many as five people killed in the crash, including up to three people on the plane.
Maturo said the children were in one house with their mother when the plane struck shortly before 11:30 a.m.
The plane missed its initial approach, which isn't uncommon, said Tweed airport manager Lori Hoffman-Soares.
One resident said the accident wasn't surprising.
"It's always a concern, but it's something that happens in every airport," Maturo said.
Video from affiliate WTNH showed smoke rising from a heavily damaged house in East Haven, and what appeared to be the tail of a plane nearby.
