It's downright disgusting to listen to conservative and Republican lawmakers, presidential candidates, business owners and media commentators use such vitriol to describe the Occupy Wall Street protesters as hell-bent on destroying America.
Without dissent and protest, there is no United States of America!
Instead, they organized and mobilized to affect the political discourse in the Republican Party and have definitely had their voices heard.
As Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas said, "The right to revolt has sources deep in our history."
What would this world be without protest?
We would have never seen freedom in Eastern Europe were it not without the people there, in the words of civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer, being "sick and tired of being sick and tired."
As a supporter of Occupy Wall Street, I understand fully the sentiment that is being expressed.
Instead, they refuse to work with homeowners struggling to meet the big mortgage payments that Wall Street helped underwrite; then sell in exotic transactions that wrecked this nation's financial infrastructure.
No, Occupy Wall Street is about trying to bring some decency and honesty back to an industry that used to have some.
This fight that Occupy Wall Street is engaged in is nothing short of a battle for the soul of this nation.
That mean the young and righteous Davids must protest, march, sit-in, work the halls of Congress and state capitals nationwide, and make it clear that as long as Wall Street, its lobbyists and political protectors continue to mistreat the common man and woman, they are our mortal enemy.
Instead of listening to politicians pimp the next generation, these folks are saying in the words of the founders of the nation's first black newspaper, Freedom's Journal: "We wish to plead our own cause; too long have others spoken for us."
