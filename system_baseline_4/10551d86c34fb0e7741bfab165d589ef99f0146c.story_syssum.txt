London (CNN) -- Seven men have been arrested in the United Kingdom on suspicion of terror offenses, West Midlands police said Friday.
Police in London also arrested six people Thursday on suspicion of committing, planning or instigating terror offenses.
The seven men have been detained on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, a police statement said.
However, it is understood that the individuals arrested in the West Midlands and West Yorkshire were not targeting the Olympics, nor did they have any links to those arrested Thursday in London.
Additional security measures will be in place in London and elsewhere during the Olympics.
The Metropolitan Police is leading the "largest peacetime operation" seen in the United Kingdom as it seeks to keep the public safe, it said, with up to 9,500 police officers from London and elsewhere to be deployed on the busiest days of the Olympics.
