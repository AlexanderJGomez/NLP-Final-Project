(CNN) -- Virender Sehwag plundered the second-fastest Test double hundred as India piled on an incredible 443-1 off just 79 overs on the second day of the deciding third match against Sri Lanka in Mumbai.
That brought Sehwag and inexperienced opener Murali Vijay to the crease, and they launched a blistering attack on the Sri Lankan bowlers putting on 221 in just 39 overs.
Sehwag passed three figures from 101 deliveries and then raced to his second century off just 67 -- the only man to pass that milestone quicker is New Zealand's Nathan Astle, who took 153 balls against England in 2002.
I thought I would bide my time, see off the new ball and then take my chances."
The 37-year-old, who has taken 788 Test wickets, conceded 119 runs off his 20 overs.
Imran Farhat and Salman Butt put on 60 for the first wicket but then fell in quick succession along with captain Mohammad Yousuf as Vettori snared two wickets in three balls.
