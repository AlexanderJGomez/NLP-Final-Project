Teens at Camp Ayandeh learn how to blend their parents' history and culture with their contemporary lifestyles.
Like many attending Camp Ayandeh -- or "future" in Farsi -- Ramin has parents who were born in Tehran and immigrated to the United States after the Iranian revolution in 1979.
It's so common that Ayandeh counselors said the camp was created three years ago to address both Iranian and American parts of a new generation of Iranian-American youth -- a community they define as being "hyphenated."
Iranian-American teens from high schools across the nation now flock to the new Georgia address to learn about their heritage and ask questions that range from relationships and college admissions to sexual orientation and discrimination -- issues that can come with distinctly different social parameters than their parents were once accustomed to in Iran.
"There was not a single person that I could look at and say, 'He is me,' " Samei said, describing an absence of elder Iranian-American role models. "

"One day I would come into school very dressed up thinking, 'I'm looking Iranian.'
Bobak Moazami, a 17-year-old kid from Manhattan's Upper West Side, said he likes to think of himself equally as part of both communities.
For many of these students, traditional Iranian dishes such as qormeh-sabzi -- a stew of herbs and beef or lamb -- are a part of a heritage that at one time could only be preserved by their families.
"I read about American literature in the morning [at school]," Moazami said.
Unlike many of the American-born campers, Behnam immigrated to the United States at 5 after being born in Tehran.
Twelve years after arriving in the U.S., Behnam is part of a loyal following that returns to Camp Ayandeh each year.
