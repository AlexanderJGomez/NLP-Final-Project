The wife of British hostage Alan Henning pleaded Saturday with ISIS to release him, describing her husband as a "peaceful, selfless man" who was only in Syria to help people in need.
In a videotaped execution of British aid worker David Haines, made public last weekend, ISIS displayed Henning and threatened to kill him next.
"Alan is a peaceful, selfless man who left his family and his job as a taxi driver in the UK to drive in a convoy all the way to Syria with his Muslim colleagues and friends to help those most in need," she said in the statement.
ISIS has shown no regard in recent weeks for pleas from the families of its Western hostages.
And news of Haines' death came the same day that his family released a brief message to his captors through the UK Foreign Office.
"When they hear this message, I implore the people of the Islamic State to see it in their hearts to release my husband, Alan Henning."
While part of the convoy stopped at the Turkish border, Henning -- the only non-Muslim in the group -- volunteered to cross into Syria with a 10-person advance party.
Dr. Shameela Islam-Zulfiqar, a volunteer doctor who stayed behind the main part of the convoy at the Turkish border, said they got a phone call saying Henning had been taken by masked gunmen.
Now, Islam-Zulfiqar says she has a message for the people holding Henning.
Islam-Zulfiqar said other members of the convoy gave Henning the affectionate nickname "Gadget," for his love of all things technical.
"He really is the guy that fixes everything," she told CNN.
