It is September 2003, and I just found out my daughter is going to be born with Down Syndrome.
I do not want to deal with Velcro versus ties or orthopedic shoes; I want to pick out the latest trends and styles for her.
Does it really matter what kind of shoes she has on?
It doesn't.
A month goes by and Jaylin is born -- a healthy 4-pound, 12-ounce baby girl with a head full of black hair.
She rocked those shoes for a good couple of months.
I don't think she truly cares about shoes but just enjoys spending the time with me picking them out.
Had she not been born with Down Syndrome I don't think I would be as good a person as I am now.
Jaylin is such a special child.
She will keep doing what she loves, in great shoes, just to make me happy.
