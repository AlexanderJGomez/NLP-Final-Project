(CNN) -- The Obama administration vastly underestimated the tens of thousands of barrels of oil pouring into the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon disaster, despite contrary information from scientists using better methodologies, a report from a national panel investigating the response said Wednesday.
"By initially underestimating the amount of oil flow and then, at the end of the summer, appearing to underestimate the amount of oil remaining in the Gulf, the federal government created the impression that it was either not fully competent to handle the spill or not fully candid with the American people about the scope of the problem," said Wednesday's report.
The president appointed the commission in June and tasked it to provide recommendations on how to prevent future spills and mitigate the impact of any that do occur.
Government officials, reacting to the report, said the response was "in full force and immediate" and that the government adequately warned the public of worst-case spill scenarios.
After the oil rig sank, the U.S. Coast Guard and BP initially put the spill at 1,000 barrels per day.
"The government appears to have taken an overly casual approach to the calculation and release of the 5,000 barrels a day estimate -- which as the only official estimate for most of May, took on great importance," the report said.
That request was denied.
Better video and data led to the rise in the daily oil spill estimate, he said.
The federal government later Wednesday said it acted appropriately with regard to spill estimates and the clean-up.
"As directed by the President, the response was based on science, even when that pitted us against BP or state and local officials, and the response pushed BP every step of the way.
"The facts bear out that the federal response significantly mitigated the impact of the spill," they said.
