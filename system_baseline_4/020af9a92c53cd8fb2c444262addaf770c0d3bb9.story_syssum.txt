Below is an excerpt from CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta's new book,  "Cheating Death: The Doctors and Medical Miracles that Are Saving Life Against All Odds" published by Wellness Central, an imprint of Grand Central Publishing.
Mike Mertz was driving home, an hour after finishing his run as a school bus driver in Glendale, Arizona.
Whatever the reason, whatever route he wandered, it brought Mertz not to the usual entrance of his townhome complex, but the back driveway.
Hopping out, Ash immediately realized that it was coming from a Saturn almost directly across the street.
The only thing keeping it in place was a stucco wall a few feet from the tree; the car was wedged between the two.
After dialing 911, Ash started CPR the way he'd learned during an Air National Guard training exercise just two months before.
With a few simple measures -- going against the grain of the medical establishment -- they have found that they can radically improve the odds of surviving a cardiac arrest.
As fellow firefighters scrambled down, Florez thumped an urgent rhythm on Mertz' chest, two hundred compressions over two minutes, before a medic stepped in and delivered an electric shock from the paddles of a defibrillator.
Mertz was back from the dead.
In reality, survival from cardiac arrest outside the hospital is rare.
The experiment sprang from two lines of thinking: animal studies aimed at modifying CPR technique and a public health effort to train more people in CPR.
Published studies put the rate of bystander CPR at around 20 percent.
That one fact gets much of the credit for the city's high survival rate from cardiac arrest.
But how?
