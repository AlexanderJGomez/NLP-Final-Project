(CNN) -- George Zimmerman, who sold his first painting on eBay for a whopping $100,000, is at it again.
"Very proud to introduce @TherealGeorgeZ 's latest..."Angie".
The winning bid on it was $100,099.99.
"My art work allows me to reflect, providing a therapeutic outlet and allows me to remain indoors."
Zimmerman told a judge in November he had $150 to his name and was $2.5 million in debt.
