But on 10 minutes the referee took the decision that essentially ended the game as a contest.
Jardim Brandao dithered on the ball in his own box and Marco Borriello dispossessed him before trying to go round goalkeeper Gianluca Curci.
But 18 minutes from time he rose unmarked in the box to head home a David Beckham corner.
The Brazilian sealed his first Milan hat-trick with a rocket into the top corner from outside the area a minute from time.
Simone Perrotta opened the scoring on 17 minutes after a scramble at a corner and then Toni turned home Mirko Vucinic's cross on the stroke of half-time.
