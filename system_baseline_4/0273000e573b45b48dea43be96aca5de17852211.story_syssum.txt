Organizers said some 60,000 protesters turned out for a Saturday night rally and police tried to block them from joining other protesters that are part of a sit-in outside government headquarters.
Organizers  said they would continue to occupy the area outside government headquarters indefinitely until the students are released.
Hong Kong authorities said 34 people had been treated in hospital for injuries suffered in the protests.
Leaders of Hong Kong's Occupy Central movement, which had planned  a separate mass protest in the city's financial district over voting rights, decided Sunday to join the student movement.
"The future of Hong Kong is ours," said 16-year-old student Phoebe Leung.
