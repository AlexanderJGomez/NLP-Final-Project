Of upmost concern is not a lengthy closure of the federal bureaucracy, but that Washington could default on its debt around October 17, unless the debt limit is raised by Congress.
In other words, the country's reputation as a responsible international power, both in terms of domestic and foreign policy, is being undermined.
This was prompted by the last near debt default of Washington in 2011.
These findings on the U.S.'s reputation are echoed by the 2013 BBC Country Rating Survey, which interviewed about 26,000 people in 25 countries, and also the 2013 Pew Global Study based on a sample of about 37,600 in 39 countries.
Then, as now, however, the country retains attractive qualities for many foreigners, including its popular culture and economic innovation.
And this is not the first time this year that a Washington political impasse has threatened negative economic repercussions.
At the core of the current troubles is not just growing polarization between Democrats and Republicans, but significant intra-party divisions too.
The perception, in many foreign capitals, is that growing partisanship is also infecting U.S. foreign policy.
And, this is feeding angst over the reliability of Washington as an international partner, as has been vocalized in recent days by several countries, including China, Japan and Mexico.
Looking ahead this month, it remains most likely that a deal will be done before October 17 to raise the debt limit.
With uncertainty growing, the only sure thing is that default would send seismic economic and political shockwaves across the globe.
