Greek leaders, meanwhile, have seized upon this German "transgression" with glee.
Beating their chests about the German threat to Greece's national sovereignty, they are hoping that the Greeks will somehow forget that it was they, their leaders, who ceded sovereignty to the so-called troika of the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank.
To keep these truths from surfacing, German and Greek politicians, each for their own purposes, settled on gigantic loans for Greece that would act as plaster on the festering wounds of the aforementioned bankruptcies.
At the same time, Greek leaders, unwilling to confront their electorate, pretended to believe that they could deliver the targets demanded by Germany.
The worst part of this sad saga is that public debate is still failing to keep track with the real issues.
Neither side is willing to admit that the whole rescue package was flawed from the outset.
The preordained failure of the Greek "program" has not yet exposed our leaders' connivance.
If it is not our leaders' insidious lie, it will be the eurozone.
