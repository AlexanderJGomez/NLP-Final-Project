Last Thursday, Jeff Courcelle came home from work to find 5-year-old Mocha -- a pure bred fawn-colored Doberman pincher -- hovering over a pile of screws, metal pieces, three watch heads and some chewed leather straps.
Parkinson knew that Mocha wouldn't be able to pass all that leather on her own.
She had 28 staples down her belly and 10 inches of intestine removed, Parkinson said.
"It just looked like a Christmas tree and I almost threw up," Parkinson said.
The night Mocha stayed in the hospital, a nervous Parkinson stayed awake reading stories about dogs ingesting watches and other objects.
Mocha likes to suck on fleece blankets and has been known to eat rubber ear buds or hair elastics, but nothing like a pile of jewelry, Parkinson said.
"She had a dog that actually consumed her whole dog bed," Parkinson said.
From now on, Parkinson said she will put Mocha in a crate if the dog will be staying somewhere new.
"I am convinced that he and Mocha joined forces here to destroy all of his current watches in order to make room for Apple's new watch."
