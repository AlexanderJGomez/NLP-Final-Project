Since 1995, states have been free to set their own maximum speed limits, leading to long debates on safety standards.
The top rural speed limit is normally 70 mph, but in 2006 it set a maximum daytime speed of 80 miles per hour, the highest speed limit on the country, on more than 500 miles of rural interstate in its southwest corner.
St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands is at or near the other end of the spectrum.
In the U.S. territory the speed limit is 20 mph in the city and 30 out in the country.
As you continue west, interstate speed limits bump up to 70 in Iowa, and then you can maintain a steady 75 from Nebraska through to the California line, where interstate speeds drop off to 70 again.
Speeds are slower in more populous Eastern states and faster in the wide-open West, although the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety argues that some of the new, higher speed limits out West and elsewhere are costing lives.
Ironically, the new regime of U.S. speed limits has helped researchers make sense of whether higher rural speed limits are dangerous.
Once speed limits are raised on interstates, drivers are more likely to get off the more dangerous two lanes and use the faster routes, Yowell said.
While Yowell admits most states are well-intentioned, he's "not willing to accept that speed limits are solely a function of safety," he said.
In part, Yowell looks to differences in political cultures to explain the great continental divide in speed limits.
But it tends to be well above the speed limits that most jurisdictions set.
If you put the limit below that speed, some vehicles are traveling far more slowly than the fastest drivers, creating the most dangerous conditions of all.
