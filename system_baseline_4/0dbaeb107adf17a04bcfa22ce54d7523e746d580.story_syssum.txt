(CNN)  -- An Illinois woman and her boyfriend, already charged with aiding in the abduction of the woman's 6-year-old grandson, face new charges of tampering with a witness in the case, officials said Tuesday.
Police say the boy had been hidden for nearly two years.
Wilfong, 30, is jailed on felony child abduction charges and made her first court appearance Tuesday, Sandusky said.
"My grandson had the run of the house," she said.
"We were on our own and we had to do what we had to do and that was make sure our grandson was safe," Dobbs said.

A judge granted Chekevdia temporary custody, but by then Wilfong and the boy had disappeared.
Wilfong and Dobbs had accused Chekevdia of sexually abusing the boy, but authorities have said those allegations are unfounded, the Post-Dispatch said.
Ricky was taken into Illinois Department of Children and Family Services custody, and is staying with his father's family under child welfare supervision, WSIL said.
