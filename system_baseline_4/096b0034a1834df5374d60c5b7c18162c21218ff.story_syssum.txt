Terez Miles said her son, Jordan Miles, who is black, thought his life was in jeopardy when three white men jumped out of a car on the night of January 11 as he walked not far from his home.
"My son tried to run thinking his life was in jeopardy," Terez Miles said.
Miles' mother said the officers did not identify themselves as police to her son, a viola player and student at the city's Creative and Performing Arts High School.
A hearing in the case was scheduled for Thursday, but it was unclear whether the officers involved showed up, said Miles' attorney, Kerry Lewis.
The three officers were taken off plainclothes duty and were back in uniform, she said.
Lewis said Jordan Miles has no criminal record.
