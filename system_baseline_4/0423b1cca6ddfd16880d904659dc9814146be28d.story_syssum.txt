On September 30th, the artist will release two new records: Plectrumelectrum, his long-teased album with the group 3rdEyeGirl, and his recently announced solo LP, Art Official Age.
The pre-order includes the songs "Breakdown" and "Clouds," as well as three digital singles.
Prince has already released the video for album track "Breakfast Can Wait" and he played "Funknroll" during his appearance on Arsenio earlier this year, though the version on Art Official Age is "funkier and nastier," according to a Minneapolis Star Tribune writer who got an early listen.
"No one can play like this band," Prince told Rolling Stone about the record.
"That's where I was.
Earlier this year, Prince worked out a deal with the label where he now owns the masters to his recordings.
"Prince is one of just a handful of visionary artists who have truly reshaped and redefined modern music and culture," Warner Bros. Chairman & CEO Cameron Strang said in a statement about the two new records.
