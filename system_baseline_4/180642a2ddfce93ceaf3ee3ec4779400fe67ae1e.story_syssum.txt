(CNN) -- Tens of thousands of Congolese refugees fled camps Tuesday in the Democratic Republic of Congo as rebel troops attacked government forces in the area, the U.N. refugee agency said.
UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said, "They have been living in extremely difficult conditions anyway.
Now they have nothing but what they can carry."
A spokesman for the U.N. military mission in the Congo said it was uncertain which group attacked the Congo army outpost near the village of Kishangazi, according to the U.N.-affiliated news service.
The UNHCR said 375,000 Congolese in North Kivu province have been forced from their homes in the past year.
