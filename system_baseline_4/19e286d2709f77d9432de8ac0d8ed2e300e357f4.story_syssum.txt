(CNN) -- Former President Alfonso Portillo of Guatemala faces money-laundering charges in the United States, according to a federal indictment unsealed Monday.
Portillo was the president of Guatemala from 2000 to 2004.
According to the indictment, in one instance in 2000, Portillo funneled $1.5 million worth of donations for a literacy project from Taiwan into accounts in Europe controlled by his ex-wife and daughter.
There was a second instance where Portillo allegedly embezzled money given to Guatemala by the Taiwanese, according to the document.
Some of the money that Portillo took went to buy expensive watches and cars, the indictment says.
