Police investigate the vehicle destroyed by a car bomb in Spain's Basque region.
The Spanish national police officer killed was Eduardo Puelles, said the new Basque regional president, Patxi Lopez.
The officer was a senior figure in the fight against ETA and the explosion was caused by a limpet bomb placed underneath the car, officials told CNN partner station CNN+.
"My stance to stop ETA is unbreakable, so that people in the Basque country and Spain can live in peace, to halt this barbarity," said Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, after the attack.
ETA has threatened Lopez, who is a socialist and the first non-nationalist Basque president in 30 years.
