Woolley, an aid worker, husband, and father of two boys, followed instructions on his cell phone to survive the January 12 earthquake in Haiti.
"So I knew I wasn't making mistakes," Woolley said.
Concerned he might have been experiencing shock, Woolley used the app to look up what to do.
Once the battery got down to less than 20 percent of its power, Woolley turned it off.
With his injuries tended to, he wrote a note to his family in his journal: "I was in a big accident, an earthquake.
I'm still praying that God will get me out, but he may not.
After more than 60 hours, Woolley was pulled from the rubble.
"Then all of a sudden just all craziness broke loose," Woolley said.
When the shaking stopped, Woolley couldn't see.
Once in the elevator, he used the app -- called "Pocket First Aid & CPR" from Jive Media -- to tend to his injuries.
Woolley said his phone "was like a high-tech version of a Swiss Army knife that enabled me to treat my own injuries, track time, stay awake and stay alive."

Back home now in Colorado Springs with his wife Christina and children Josh, 6, and Nathan, 3, Woolley said he's grateful to God for getting him through the ordeal.
