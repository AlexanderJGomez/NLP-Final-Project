The investigation into the actions of former NFL tight end Aaron Hernandez, who is accused of killing friend Odin Lloyd, has turned to Hernandez's fiancee as law enforcement searches for the .45 caliber gun used in the slaying.
Shayanna Jenkins has not been charged in connection with the investigation, and lawyers representing her fiancé, Hernandez, have not responded to requests for comment.
The day after Lloyd's body was found, Shaneah Jenkins told authorities she was with her sister, Shayanna, and two uncles at Hernandez's home.
The documents go on to describe a mysterious, if not cryptic, text message obtained by investigators from Hernandez to his fiancée that allegedly read: "Go back in back of the screen in movie room when u (sic) get home an (sic) there is a box...jus (sic) in case u (sic) were looking for it!!!
Prosecutors have said no lock box was found in the home.
Singleton, Hernandez' cousin, remained jailed on a contempt of court charge for failing to cooperate with a grand jury, according to two law enforcement sources.
