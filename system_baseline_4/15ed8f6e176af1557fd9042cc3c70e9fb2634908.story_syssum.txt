CNN recently spoke with singer Patrick Stump, bassist Pete Wentz, guitarist Joe Trohman and drummer Andy Hurley about their surprise reunion.
Joe Trohman:  I think a lot of people don't understand that we were kids and that some of us grew up in this band, and we needed a little time away from the band.
Stump:  There weren't a lot of people knocking down our doors, going, "When's the next Fall Out Boy record?"
Stump: 2 Chainz is in his second act, and I think he learned so much from the first time around that he has a total other perspective than a lot of others have.
Wentz:  I think that there was a lot of "ready, fire, aim" stuff that would go on.
But also taking that time apart to be with our families, do other projects, work with different people and experience different things allowed us to come back and realize that maybe we did this thing not so well; maybe we should have talked more; maybe we shouldn't have been so passive-aggressive; maybe this guy should have voiced his opinion more.
How have your personal lives changed things?
Wentz: I took my kid to preschool today, and he has a friend who is really into music there -- this little kid -- and he was like, "I want to play Fall Out Boy right now."
(laughter) That will keep you grounded.
How mind-blowing is this?
CNN: Fall Out Boy will be embarking on an arena tour later this year.
A bunch of those -- like Barclay's in New York -- are almost sold out, so make sure you get your tickets so we can hang out and be weird together.
Wentz:  If you're bummed about the arena tour, you're going to be REAL bummed about the stadium tour!
