And like Alice in Wonderland, the "right size" for tablets keeps shifting.
Many iPad users treasure the Apple gadget's approximately 10x7-inch expanse, and I've seen some bristle at the suggestion that this size might be unwieldy.
The diversifying tablet market also includes the oddball Samsung Galaxy Note -- a moderately pricey, stylus-bearing smartphone/tablet hybrid.
Rumors have long been swirling that Apple might be preparing to launch an "iPad mini" model that's closer in size to the Kindle Fire.
Of course, before we learn the truth of the elusive mythical iPad mini, the next version of the Kindle Fire, which could be released as soon as May or June, might feature a model with a larger screen as well as upgraded specifications.
Perhaps even because they're smaller.
So for this reason, I wouldn't be surprised to see Apple eventually launch an iPad mini.
Apple might decide to take the "small is beautiful" approach and market an iPad mini as providing extra, or at least different, value -- not as a compromise.
