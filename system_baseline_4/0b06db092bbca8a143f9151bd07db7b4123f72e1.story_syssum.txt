CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- The woman who received the first-ever near-total face transplant in the United States told her doctor she has regained her self-confidence, said Dr. Maria Siemionow, head of plastic surgery research at the Cleveland Clinic and leader of the transplant team.
"I believe this procedure is justified because you need a face to face the world," Siemionow said.
This, combined with the olfactory receptors in the brain, gave the patient the ability to smell, Siemionow said.
The patient said she is happy because when she puts her hands on her face, she feels a nose, Siemionow said.
Siemionow, who has been working on face transplant research for 20 years, received approval from the Institutional Review Board in 2004 to conduct a full facial transplant.
Currently, cancer patients are not candidates for face transplants because  transplant recipients must take immunosuppression drugs for life so that the body does not reject the donated tissue, Siemionow said.
One of the French face transplant recipients was a man who had a genetic disorder that created large tumors on his face.
The Chinese patient had been attacked by a bear.
By looking at the genetic underpinnings of disorders that lead to facial deformities, scientists can also understand what accounts for the normal differences in face and skull types.
"These are going to be some of the genes that cause some of that variation," Jabs said.
