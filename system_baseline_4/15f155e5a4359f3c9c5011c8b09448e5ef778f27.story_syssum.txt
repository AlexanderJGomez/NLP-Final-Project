The shooting began after the student walked into Arapahoe High School in Centennial with the intention of confronting a specific faculty member, Robinson said.
But Robinson said Friday night that an investigation concluded there was only one after it was discovered that blood on another person was from the sole victim.
The shooting also occurred roughly 10 miles from where Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 students and one teacher in a rampage at Columbine High School in April 1999 before killing themselves.
Pierson walked into Arapahoe High School carrying a shotgun and made no attempt to hide it, Robinson said.
I said, 'They are shooting in the school.'"
"In my opinion, that was the most important tactical decision that could have been made," Robinson said.
In addition to the shotgun, authorities found two Molotov cocktails inside the school, Robinson said.
High school senior Frank Woronoff told CNN he had known Pierson since they were freshmen together.
While authorities hunted for the student gunman inside the school, students were locked in their classrooms.
Leytoldt said she was in yoga class and that her teacher told all the students to get into a closet to protect them.
They soon heard people yelling, and walkie-talkies crackling, and then they heard police asking someone to drop the gun, put the gun down, and hold his arms up, she said.
Colton Powers told CNN affiliate KDVR that he heard gunfire during his English class.
Within about 14 minutes of the initial report, "we had information on the radio that my deputies believed they had the shooter down inside the school," Robinson said.
The high school, with a student population of 2,229 students, has 70 classrooms.
President Barack Obama was briefed on the shooting, according to a White House official.
