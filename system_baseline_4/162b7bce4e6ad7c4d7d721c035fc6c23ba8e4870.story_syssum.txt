Promotion to the English Premier League is estimated to be worth $200m and it was QPR celebrating an unlikely win at the final whistle.
His QPR counterpart Harry Redknapp admitted as much as he reflected on his side's triumph.
Victory over Wigan saw QPR into the final, while Derby thrashed Brighton to reach the Wembley showdown.
"I've lost some games in my career but that is the cruelest," he told BBC Sport.
"For somebody to make mistakes -- we don't blame anybody," he added.
