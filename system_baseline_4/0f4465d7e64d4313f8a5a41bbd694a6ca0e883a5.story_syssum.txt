Government forces are battling the M23 rebel group in the eastern part of that country.
The deal was signed in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa by envoys of several African nations, including Uganda and Rwanda.
The M23 group was named for a peace deal of March 23, 2009, which it accuses the government of violating.
The unrest continues a cycle of misery in eastern Congo, a mineral-rich region at the epicenter of political and ethnic conflict involving its neighbors to the east, Uganda and Rwanda.
