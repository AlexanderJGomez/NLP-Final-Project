Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Olympic and Paralympic runner Oscar Pistorius on Sunday canceled his appearance in five upcoming races, days after being charged with murder in the shooting death of his girlfriend in South Africa.
"As you can imagine our entire family is devastated, we are in a state of total shock," said his uncle, Arnold Pistorius, in a written statement.
Pistorius, 26, also rejected the murder allegation "in the strongest terms," his agent said in a statement.
I was not expecting anything like this from someone like him," said Nondumiso Mlondo, who lives in Durban.
Citizens carried on heated discussions in buses, bars, barber shops.
"Medals are just medals ...
"It was a shock to the nation when we first heard it ... but it has worn off," he said.
I don't have any bitterness," she said.
The decision to air the program took "much deliberation," and that "this week's episode will be dedicated to Reeva's memory," Executive producer Samantha Moon said.
Images of his sports feats flashed across the screens at the time.
Steenkamp's killing rattled South Africa, which is grappling with the aftermath of the recent murder of 17-year-old Anene Booyson -- a case that has put a spotlight on violence against women.
But South African authorities stressed that the scenario did not come from them, and said there was no evidence of forced entry at the home.
"There are 1.5 million gun owners -- about 3.5 million guns in civilians hands," said Alan Storey, chairman of Gun Free South Africa.
"People acquire guns believing they are more safe ... but they place themselves at greater risk," Storey said.
But the South African Gunowners' Association, a popular gun lobby group, has said citizens have the right to protect themselves from increasingly violent crimes.
Prosecutors said they will argue that he committed premeditated murder.
