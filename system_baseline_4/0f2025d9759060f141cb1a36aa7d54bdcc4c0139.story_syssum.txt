Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- An anti-insurgent provincial governor who had survived Taliban assassination attempts was among 20 people who died Friday in an explosion at a northern Afghan mosque during prayers, a government official said.
Gen. Daoud Daoud, commander of the Afghan Interior Ministry's northern zone, said a suicide attacker apparently sitting next to the governor detonated a bomb.
He told CNN on Sunday that for the last two years, the security situation has deteriorated in Kunduz because insurgents decided to destabilize northern Afghanistan, which, until recently, had been relatively stable during the nine-year-old Afghan conflict.
"Currently 40 percent of Kunduz province is under Taliban control," he said.
"Today the news reaches us of another attack in which the governor of Kunduz, Mohammad Omar, was killed.
NATO does not give the nationalities of service members who are killed, but the British Defence Ministry said one of its soldiers was killed in Helmand province in the south Friday.
