(CNN) -- Residents of a North Dakota town got the all-clear to return home after a fiery crash this week involving a derailed train and a second one carrying crude oil.
A video camera at the head of the oil train recorded the crash as it slammed into a car of a derailed grain train.
"We are not optimistic that we will be able to retrieve data from those two recorders," Sumwalt said.
On the ground, they will search for signs of the cause of the derailment, including marks on wooden cross ties and on rails, Sumwalt said.
Early Tuesday, crews had tested the air for toxic fumes emitted when flames and pillars of smoke towered into the sky near the town.
