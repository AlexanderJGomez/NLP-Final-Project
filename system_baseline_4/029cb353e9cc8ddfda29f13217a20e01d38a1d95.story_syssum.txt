The video of Graham yanking her son, Michael Singleton, and slapping him with a right hand as CNN affiliate WMAR recorded has led to the Internet calling Graham #motheroftheyear.
Graham told Cooper that she saw her son with a brick in his hand, and she lost control of her emotions and told him to drop it.
The 16-year-old boy said he understood that his mother was there looking out for him.
Graham said her son told her the night before the violence at the mall that something was up.
There he was, in sweatpants she recognized.
"I was so angry with him that he had made a decision to do some harm to the police officers," she said.
Singleton said he had seen her, but it didn't make sense that his mother would be there.
I was there to get my child," she said.
Brown said her mother is always looking out for her children.
Graham said she tries to steer her son away from potential trouble and troublemakers.
"(She was) just telling me she did it because she cared about me.
