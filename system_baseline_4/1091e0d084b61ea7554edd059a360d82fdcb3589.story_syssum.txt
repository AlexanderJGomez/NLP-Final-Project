What should not be a surprise to any of us, however, is that Russia continues to spy on the United States.
Espionage will continue, even as the United States and Russia work out a new modus vivendi.
There remain significant issues of disagreement over European security.
Frankly, in a world in which even allies spy on one another, the Russian intelligence service would be shockingly incompetent if it were not spying on us.
Moscow seems to have calculated that with these agents in place, there was little reason to pull them out, even if relations with Washington were on the upswing.
The Soviets also used illegals mainly for assignments too difficult for KGB officers working under "official cover" as diplomats or attach√©s.
Will this spy flap seriously damage U.S.-Russian relations?
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, himself a former KGB officer, has said that he hopes the incident will not damage the improving relations between the two countries.
