(CNN) -- Despite public perception, Iceland is hot.
Hoping to tap into the events market, Reykjavik has set to work building its conference infrastructure.
"We may be a small country, but we've got big ideas," says Karitas Kjartansdottir, Harpa's conference director.
"If you're a manager, and you're risk-adverse, you might be hesitant to send several hundred of your best employees overseas somewhere, especially if you're not fully sure of how evolved the infrastructure is in that place," says Gudmundsson.
"It will be a long time before we get another meeting as prominent as the Reykjavik Summit," says Gudmundsson.
"We have great connections from the [United] States to Iceland, and that puts us in a strong market position," notes Kjartansdottir.
"The Blue Lagoon brings more energy to business groups, and makes corporate events more fun and productive," notes Magnea Guomundsdottir, the director of public relations for Blue Lagoon Iceland.
"It literally blew the socks off everybody there.
As if the setting wasn't unique enough, Blue Lagoon has also arranged DJs, circuses and modern dance performers for corporate events.
