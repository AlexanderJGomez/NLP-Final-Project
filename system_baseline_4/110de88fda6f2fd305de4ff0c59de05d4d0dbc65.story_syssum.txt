WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Conservative columnist and former CNN "Crossfire" co-host Robert Novak has died after a yearlong battle with cancer, his family said Tuesday.
However, Sam Feist, CNN's political director, said the dour visage masked a "warm-hearted guy" who "cared a lot about the people who worked for him."
Novak was a veteran columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times and a regular commentator for CNN for 25 years, beginning when the network launched in 1980.
Novak got his first newspaper job in 1948, when he was still in high school.
He cooperated with prosecutors and was not charged in the leak case.

Veteran Democratic consultant and on-air sparring partner James Carville said Novak "had the best sources in the Republican Party," making his weekly column a must-read for political insiders.
Novak left the network in 2005 after an on-air blowup with Carville, who had been needling him over the CIA leak case.
"I want to thank CNN for making this network available to me for 25 years," he said at the time.
