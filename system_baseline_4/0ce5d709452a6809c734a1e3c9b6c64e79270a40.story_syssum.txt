"We have moved toward the vision of producing thousands of middle-class jobs in our port; creating a solar-based city to enhance our environment and create jobs; building an efficient international border to bring billions of dollars into our economy; keeping our military and hi-tech sectors strong and vibrant," Filner said in response to the recall petition notice.

"I deal with frustrated travelers every day, but I never came across anyone like Bob Filner," she said.
