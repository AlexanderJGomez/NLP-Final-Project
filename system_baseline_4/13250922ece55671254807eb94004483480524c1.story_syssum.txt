Following a lengthy debate in the UK parliament Thursday, a majority voted against the government's motion to militarily intervene in Syria in response to an alleged chemical attack by the Assad regime.
The New York Times says Cameron's intentions were hasty and the result of the vote was a "blow" to the U.S. president.
Russia's weekly newspaper the Moscow News says the debate is "a stunning defeat" for Cameron.
The paper also suggests pushing for diplomatic instead of military resolutions.
The paper also claimed the loss was a win for opposition leader Ed Miliband, who supported military intervention but then spoke firmly against it.
British tabloid newspaper The Mirror also claims that UK politicians cannot pin Damascus on a map.
French news outlet France 24 expresses shock at the result of the vote, claiming that the nation's President Francois Hollande will maintain his firm stance in support of military intervention.
Unlike in the UK, the French leader does not need a vote in parliament to back his actions.
The online version of the Israeli Haaretz Newspaper claims that Israel should have been a part of the discussion: "During the lengthy debate in the British parliament over a possible military intervention in Syria on Thursday, Israel barely featured."
