"They are the 1% of America who kept the 99% safe," Bush said Wednesday of the 2.5 million military members who have served since 9/11.
It's "troubling" that 84% of veterans say the public isn't aware of the challenges they face and that 71% of Americans agree, Bush said, citing a survey by the Bush Institute and Syracuse University to be released later this year.
"It's an unprecedented demand that we've placed on such a small group," said Paul Rieckhoff, head of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA).
Bush announced that his Military Service initiative has launched a multi-faceted, public-private partnership aimed at helping veterans assimilate back into civilian life.
"I mean, you don't see many job postings that say "Wanted: experience hunting insurgents and terrorists willing to risk their lives for co-workers," Bush said.
"Employers would not hesitate to hire an employee getting treated for a medical condition like diabetes or high blood pressure and they should not hesitate to hire veterans getting treated for post-traumatic stress," he said.
"I honestly think this is a great program," said Verna Jones, director of the veterans affairs and rehabilitation division at the American Legion, who attended the event in Dallas.
A report released last March calculated that the cost of the wars, including health care for veterans, would be up to $6 trillion dollars.
