Mira Nair: I happened to read "The Namesake" on a plane in early 2004, when I traveled from New York to Jo'berg to finish the filming of "Vanity Fair."
CNN: It's filmed in both India and New York, such different cultures.
Nair: Well, the story of movement and crossings is as old as the hills.
CNN: Tell us about casting the role of Gogol.
Nair: Well, Kal Penn plays Gogol and he's known as a comic star, but I had no idea that he existed until my 15-year-old son said, "This has to be your Gogol."
we really made for the children on the streets and the kids who really love that Bollywood stuff, and also with "Deeply Alternative," which ran for 27 weeks.
CNN: "The Namesake" was filmed in America and India.
CNN: "The Namesake" is about not losing the identity of Indian culture.
Nair: I am at home in many cultures.
Nair: No, not really.
