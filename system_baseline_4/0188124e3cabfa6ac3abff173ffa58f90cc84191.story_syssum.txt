(CNN) -- Ian Livingstone may not be the father of Lara Croft, but maybe at 63 he can be labeled the grandfather of Lara, the Tomb Raider.
For a generation, video games had been 2-D worlds with the action moving across the screen.
And we had to have her.
Up to then, games were played mainly by teenage boys and the games were made were also men, so they tended to make male heroes."
Livingstone and his school friend Steve Jackson enjoyed playing board games, especially role-playing games.
"We had to live in a van for three months as we tried to get people to understand this strange role-playing game," Livingstone told me.
Now, with a CBE in the pocket and the honor title of Life President for Eidos -- a brand name now owned by Square Enix -- Livingstone is more of a advocate for the British video games and film graphics business.
Livingstone says he knows why.
As Livingstone likes to point out, the UK games and graphics business is bigger than the film industry.
"Back in the 90s, it was more of a sort of cartoon character," Livingstone said.
Here was this character that you played as Lara, who could sustain damage."
But not be raped, Livingstone told me, recalling a misstep by an employee who said last year that one scene could be seen as the prelude to a sexual assault.
With the reboot now out, it can't be long before we read of a new Lara Croft film with a new, younger, actress to set the mark for a new franchise.
