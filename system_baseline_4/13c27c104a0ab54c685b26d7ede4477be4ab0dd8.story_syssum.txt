Eleanor Coppola with husband Francis.
They began dating and three months later she became pregnant and the couple married.
Here Eleanor Coppola talks exclusively to CNN about her pride at seeing Sophia win an Oscar, what Francis is really like and just how close "Apocalypse Now" came to disaster.
I think because he spent his life as a director it's just in his nature.
He'll make up a song, set to a major show tune about anything.
EC: Definitely the ones he has written; the original pieces resonate with his life and aspects that reflect the way his life has evolved.
Just a fun, big war film.
It just got out of control.
The script was evolving and the scenes were changing -- it just got larger and more complex.
TSR: Tell me about how the documentary you shot while Francis was making "Apocalypse Now" came about.
I just had never shot a documentary before.
EC: When you do something that's the most extreme and hardest thing you have ever done -- everything is in jeopardy; your personal life, your financial life is in jeopardy and people's lives were literally in jeopardy.
That is just the way his life is.
He just doesn't see it that way.
EC: Well, I was deeply thrilled, particularly because she's a woman and I thought it was so touching that the children actually do reflect their parents and their upbringing and their parents' abilities do seem to have been passed on to their children.
