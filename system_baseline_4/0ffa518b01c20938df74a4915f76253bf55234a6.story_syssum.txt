"At the end of last year, I once again had a stress fracture in my left foot and had to sit out of basketball," he said.
Since then Yao has scored an average of 19 points per game and been voted an NBA All-Star player eight times, turning himself to one of the most successful overseas players in the league.
"The entire city and the team changed me to a grown man -- not only as a basketball player but also I had my daughter there."
Now the owner of his former club, Shanghai Sharks, Yao depicted a busy post-retirement schedule filled with work involving coaching, charity and commerce (too busy to help improve the Netherlands' national team, as suggested by a Dutch reporter).
The league paid Yao $93 million during his nine-year career.
To his admirers, however, Yao's multifaceted role as a sport star, national idol and cultural ambassador simply makes him invaluable.
"I followed somebody's footprints -- Chinese players in the league ahead of me," he said.
