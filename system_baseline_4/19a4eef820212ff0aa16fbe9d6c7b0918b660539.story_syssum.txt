"Meticulous efforts must be paid to the tasks of reform, development and stability to (bolster) development and maintain perennial stability in Tibet," Hu said, according to a report in the state-run Xinhua news agency.
That day in 1959, about 300,000 people surrounded Norbulinka palace, according to the advocacy group Free Tibet, fearful the Dalai Lama would be forcibly taken to Beijing.
Zhang said there were "very grave challenges" from separatists in Tibet, 60 years after what he called the "peaceful liberation" of Tibet by Communist forces led by Mao Zedong.
Among them, China's transportation minister Li Shenglin said Sunday that all counties in Tibet would have paved roadways by 2015.
Another official told the news agency that a new train line -- also to be built by 2015 -- would drastically cut travel time between the capitals of the provinces of ethnic Tibet and Xinjiang.
"The new railway line will play a significant role in boosting the economic development in the country's western regions and promoting exchanges among different ethnic groups," said Luo Yulin, vice governor of Qinghai.
