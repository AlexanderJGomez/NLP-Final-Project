This complex story has evolved into a visual psalm of spiritual power that leads us to the truths of democracy that defy, but also reveal, the ultimate power that occasionally breaks into our lives and lifts us to new cultural heights.
This is Selma the movement and "Selma" the movie.
We are what we are because others risked and gave their lives to redeem our world from the evils of racism, war and poverty.
The movie "Selma" has been years in the making.
When you see "Selma" for yourself -- and you must -- look for the miraculous transformation of America.
"Selma" is a cinematic tribute to the democratic vision that we can live together in freedom without violence.
Because of the miracle of Selma in 1965 and today as a film in 2015, we can bear witness and embrace the powerful belief that we shall overcome.
