Helg Sgarbi has admitted blackmailing Germany's richest woman, Susanne Klatten.
We asked him about where the money is, about accomplices and videos... and he refused to say anything about that," Winkler said.
Authorities said Klatten, who is married with three children, had an affair with Sgarbi.
Sgarbi's lawyer, Egon Geis, said he was surprised by all the media attention.
