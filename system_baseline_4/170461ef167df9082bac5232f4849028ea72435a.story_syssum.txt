(CNN)Rafael Nadal says he's unsure if he will play at this month's Australian Open after slumping to defeat in the opening round of the Qatar Open in Doha.
I knew that winning a couple of matches here will help me, so that makes me play a little bit more under more tension," Nadal said, the ATP Tour website reported.
If not I will be playing at Rio and Buenos Aires (ATP Tour clay court tournaments taking place in February).
After suffering a back injury in last year's Australian Open final defeat to Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka, and missing the U.S. Open in September with a wrist injury, Nadal could be forgiven for being cautious about his return.
"It is with great disappointment that I have to postpone today the start of my season, pulling out of the Australian Open," Tsonga said Wednesday.
Djokovic will play Ukraine's Sergiy Stakhovsky in round two.
