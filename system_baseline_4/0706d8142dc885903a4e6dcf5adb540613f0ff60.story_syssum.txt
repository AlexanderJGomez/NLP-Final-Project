(CNN) -- An apparent tornado touched down Saturday afternoon in a small town east of Kansas City, Missouri, blowing roofs off houses and toppling trees and power poles, the National Weather Service said.
Debris was scattered throughout the town.
"It's bad.
It's a mess," Jerry McNary told CNN Kansas CIty affiliate KSHB.
Stosberg said 80% of the town was affected.
Because power lines were downed, Kansas City Power & Light deliberately shut off electricity to the area until the damage can be assessed.
