CNN's Jessica Yellin appears live as a hologram before anchor Wolf Blitzer Tuesday night in New York.
said Yellin, waving to Blitzer as she stood a few feet in front of him in the network's New York City studios.
In reality, Yellin -- a correspondent who had been covering Sen. Barack Obama's campaign -- was at the now president-elect's mega-rally along the lakefront in Chicago, Illinois, more than 700 miles away from CNN's Election Center in New York.

"About a dozen years, I've been trying to do it," David Bohrman, CNN's senior vice president and Washington bureau chief, said to Blitzer on "The Situation Room" on Wednesday.
Chuck Hurley, the Washington bureau's senior producer of video and the staffer tapped by Bohrman to manage the execution of the "hologram," called it simple chroma-key technology that's been taken "to the Nth degree."
Hurley said the tiny cameras "talk" to the New York studio's cameras, meaning that when a New York camera moves, it "tells" the cameras in the tent which direction it's moving and keeps the subject in the correct proportions.
On Tuesday night, Blitzer could only see Yellin on a TV monitor across the studio.
Hurley and Oz agree that as good as the image looked on television Tuesday, it can look even more realistic.

Hurley said considering it was CNN's first real "test launch" with the high-end gadgetry, they were "beyond thrilled."
Hurley and Oz both said they couldn't put a price tag on the total cost of such technology.
The day after her virtual appearance in New York, Yellin said this kind of new technology is what keeps television news entertaining, even when it's presenting important political stories.
Now, in hindsight, Yellin only wishes she could have come up with a better "Star Wars" joke.
