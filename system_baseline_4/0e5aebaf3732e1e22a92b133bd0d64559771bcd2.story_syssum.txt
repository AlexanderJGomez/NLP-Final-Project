(CNN) -- Let's be clear: Israel's latest operation in Gaza is not about security.
But at the end of the day, the loss of Palestinian lives will far exceed that of Israelis.
What is particularly heartbreaking about the population in Gaza, against the backdrop of broader Palestinian dispossession, is that they have nowhere to run.
There are arguably two other factors behind Israel's new operation.
Put differently, Israel will ignore any cease-fire at will.
The second reason for the attacks on Gaza is that Israel may be testing the boundaries of the changes brought about by the Arab uprisings to see just how far it can push the U.S., Egypt, and the Palestinian leadership.
Four years on, the PLO/PA has little faith in the U.S. commitment to a two-state solution and none in Israel's.
What is needed now is an immediate cease-fire, pushed by Palestinian and Arab leaders and supported by the international community, whether Israel wants it or not.
