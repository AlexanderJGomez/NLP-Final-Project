It was en route to Japan with 3 million barrels of crude oil.
The Abdullah Azzam Brigades said the attack on the M. Star "sought to weaken the infidel global order which is thrust into Muslim lands and which loots its resources."
"Government and industry sources can confirm that the claim by the Abdullah Azzam brigades ... is valid," the U.S. Department of Transportation's Maritime Administration said in an advisory last week.
The Brigades are named after a Palestinian close to al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
The group is led by one Saleh al-Qarawi, who fought U.S. forces in Iraq and got to know al Qaeda's now-dead leader there -- Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.
The Brigades have certainly shown themselves capable of audacious attacks.
Describing his priorities, al-Qarawi said they include kidnapping U.S. and British citizens in the Arabian peninsula.
He has little time for the Shiite Hezbollah, accusing it of attacking Lebanon's Sunnis.
