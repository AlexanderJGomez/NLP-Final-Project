(CNN) -- U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin is considered a rising GOP star and the Republican Party's leader on fiscal and budgetary issues.
It's not the time to think about it," he told The Wall Street Journal in April.
In the House, Ryan is also a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee.
Ryan is considered a lightning rod, and his presence on the GOP ticket will fundamentally change the 2012 race.
Ryan will likely energize a GOP base often suspicious of Romney, and add youthful vigor to the race with his energetic debates and campaign methods.
"I think he does get Wisconsin," Green said.
Ask Paul Ryan and his friends in Congress."
This is the "bold" debate conservatives pushing Ryan want, but other Republicans worry it could steer the campaign focus away from the president and onto GOP proposals.
Ryan is also a policy wonk, a self-described nerd who cut his teeth working for conservatives Bill Bennett and Jack Kemp.
How do you feel about Romney picking Ryan as his running mate?
