(CNN) -- In news that likely didn't surprise anyone, AMC announced Tuesday that "The Walking Dead" was renewed for a fifth season.
Long before he joined Robert Kirkman, "Walking Dead" comic book creator, and Frank Darabont, show creator, Nicotero launched his career as a student of zombie icons George A. Romero and Tom Savini.
Greg Nicotero: I appreciate you saying that because every season when I watch the show, I'm constantly looking at what I feel people responded to and what people like, and what I thought was successful or could be refined.
Every year we're able to do that and it's exciting.
That's a really neat idea because, for background stuff, you don't need to worry about putting teeth into all of them.
I am really proud of Season Four and where the show is going.
The fact that viewers have responded very positively is rewarding because we fought very hard to make sure the show continues every season to raise the bar.
What Universal Orlando has been able to do is put fans directly in the middle of the experience.
It's like the greatest hits of the show.
NIcotero: I am a movie fan.
I have been that guy who has been to those locations because it connects me to the material I love so much.
They're going to connect themselves to the experience, and they now know what it's like to be on the set of "The Walking Dead."
There was a 30th anniversary screening of "Day of the Dead," and I went and hadn't seen George in about two years.
... Robert Kirkman's comic book is really a love letter to George Romero.
Nicotero: I think about things differently because I did come up in the ranks of the makeup effects world.
We did a cameo of the airport zombie from "Dawn of the Dead" with the plaid shirt in Episode 15 last year.
The thing I love the most is I've been doing this 30 years, and every day I come to work and still learn more.
