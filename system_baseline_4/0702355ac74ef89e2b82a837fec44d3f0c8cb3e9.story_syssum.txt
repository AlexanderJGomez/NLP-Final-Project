Meanwhile, more than 20 bush fires continued to burn uncontrolled across the state despite the easing weather conditions, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
Firefighters were battling 98 fires across New South Wales as of late Thursday, according to the state's Rural Fire Service.
"Today's conditions, both the hot, dry conditions but also the wind conditions, have contributed to the difficulties faced by firefighters and communities on the ground," he said.
The New South Wales Rural Fire Service has issued emergency warnings for the most risky situations.
They include the State Mine Fire, a large bush fire moving from Lithgow toward Bilpin, in the Blue Mountains, which has burned more than 20,000 hectares (more than 49,000 acres) of bushland, firefighters said.
