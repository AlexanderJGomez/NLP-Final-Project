"Football for reconciliation" is the driving purpose of Play31, the organization behind the U.N. game.
Added the enthusiastic U.N. ambassador from Paraguay, Eladio Loizaga, who contributed two goals in the first half for his team: "I mean, I didn't expect that!
Ban also emphasized the plight of children as an important priority on the U.N. agenda.
Chile's Ambassador Heraldo Muñoz, one of the team captains, elaborated.
The other team was led by Ambassador Christian Wenaweser of Liechtenstein.
And he played well; he had good positioning, good defense.
"It is very hard at my age to play soccer," Ban conceded.
Diplomatically, the score was not recorded, although observers said Team Lichtenstein was the victor.
Ban played defense the entire time, except when he came off for a couple breathers.
