(CNN) -- Brian Flynn, brother of a victim aboard downed Pan Am Flight 103, said Thursday that the killing of former Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi is a moment of justice.
Flynn's brother, John Patrick, was one of 35 university students killed in the tragedy.
"This is one of those situations that when (John Patrick Flynn) died, I said I promised him and myself that I wouldn't let it go, that there would be justice," he told CNN.
"Part of me thinks this story had to end this way," Flynn added, referring to the former Libyan leader's being killed rather than captured.
Two years earlier, the only convicted Lockerbie plotter, Abdelbeset al-Megrahi, was freed from a Scotland prison after serving eight years of a life sentence.
But a Libyan envoy said the new government is not likely to send him back.
For others, Gadhafi's killing also likely marks an end to more than two decades of documenting the Lockerbie tragedy.
