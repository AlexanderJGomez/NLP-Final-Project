Retired Col. John Leech narrowly escaped death at the Pentagon on September 11, 2001.
In an earlier visit to the memorial, Leech left a note for his friend Navy Capt.
...
In 2001, Leech was working as a Defense Department liaison officer to the White House Drug Policy office.
As he walked the now-renovated halls where he spent the morning of September 11, he recalled the horror of the day.

Several people were killed or severely burned not far from where Leech took cover.
...
It was not scorched; it didn't have smut on it," Leech remembered.
Seven years after that horrible day, Leech visited the chapel at the new Pentagon Memorial, a two-acre park, which opens to the public Thursday.
He wrote, "Thanks Jack for serving and dying for our nation -- John Leech."
A lot of very good people."
