(CNN)  -- Top seed and defending champion Serena Williams charged into her sixth Wimbledon final where she will play Russian Vera Zvonareva on Saturday.
Williams broke the left-hander in the fifth game of the second set and extended her advantage in the penultimate game.
The 25-year-old Zvonareva reached her first grand slam final after seeing off Pirinkova, who beat Venus Williams in the quarterfinals.
The turning point of their match came in the sixth game of the second set as Zvonareva made the breakthrough on Pirinkova's service and went on to level at a set all.
But she will need to be at her best in Saturday's showpiece as Williams bids for her 13th grand slam singles title.
