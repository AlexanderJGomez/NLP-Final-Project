Aberdeenshire, Scotland (CNN)In an exclusive interview ahead of his U.S. tour -- and ahead of his 10-year wedding anniversary -- Prince Charles paid tribute to the "brilliant" way his wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, has taken on the "real, real challenge" of defining her public role.
The couple first visited the U.S. together as newlyweds in 2005, and Camilla was confronted by hardcore Princess Diana fans with abusive placards.
A new poll conducted by Comres for CNN found that only 35% now oppose Camilla being known as queen.
Prince Charles praised how his wife has handled herself.
When Charles and Camilla married in 2005, there was huge sensitivity around the legacy of Diana, who was expected to be queen herself.
