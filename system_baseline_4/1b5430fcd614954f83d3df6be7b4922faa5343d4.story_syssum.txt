Camp was arrested Friday after federal agents said he bought drugs from an undercover agent.
Camp, 67, is the former chief judge for the Northern District of Georgia.
"This is really a case between Judge Camp and his wife," Morrison told reporters outside the Atlanta federal courthouse.
The dancer, who is not identified in court papers, had a prior drug-related federal felony conviction on her record and "recently began cooperating with the FBI," according to the charges -- but she began recording the judge before she became an informant, the affidavit states.
During the deal that led to his arrest, Camp carried at least two pistols, his arrest affidavit states.
According to the affidavit, Camp pocketed the drugs and told the undercover agent, "We'll call you again."
