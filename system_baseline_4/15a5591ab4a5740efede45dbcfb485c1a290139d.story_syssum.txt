Mehdi Karrubi says an "impartial committee" is needed to investigate alleged mistreatment of detainees.
The Web site said the letter was posted after Rafsanjani failed to respond.
In his plea for an investigation, Karrubi says he has heard descriptions of torture and violence that make his "body shake," though he doesn't specify a prison.
"Some of the former detainees have told of such brutal and violent, repeated rapes of the young women [in detention] that have caused irreparable damage to their reproductive systems," Karrubi says in the letter.
Rafsanjani himself has been accused of helping fuel the post-election unrest as part of recent mass trials of the remaining detainees over the past week.
