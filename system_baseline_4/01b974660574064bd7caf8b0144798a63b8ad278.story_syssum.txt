Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- A whale trainer at SeaWorld died from "multiple traumatic injuries and drowning" after a 12,000-pound killer whale grabbed her ponytail and pulled her underwater in front of shocked onlookers at Shamu Stadium, the Orange County Sheriff's office said Thursday.
"While this incident remains the subject of an ongoing death investigation, there are no signs of foul play," the sheriff's statement said.
Orange County Sheriff's Office spokesman Jim Solomons said Brancheau slipped into the tank.
The Orange County Sheriff's Office said the man apparently hid in the park until after it closed, then climbed into the tank.
"He's just a really, really large animal," Tompkins said, noting that female killer whales weigh 6,000 pounds -- half of Tilikum's weight.
Tilikum could have been trying to play with Brancheau or get her attention or companionship, said Nancy Black, a marine biologist who has studied whales for 20 years.
"I don't believe the killer whale purposely intended to kill the woman," she said.
Jaime Zalac said the organization had called on SeaWorld "to stop confining oceangoing mammals to an area that to them is like the size of a bathtub, and we have also been asking the park to stop forcing the animals to perform silly tricks over and over again.
But Tompkins said, "We have a tremendous track record with these animals at SeaWorld" and a very small percentage of problems.
"This is the first time in 46 years that we've ever had an incident like this with a trainer," he said.
