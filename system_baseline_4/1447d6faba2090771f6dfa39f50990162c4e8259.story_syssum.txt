(CNN) -- Russia's upper house of parliament has approved a controversial measure banning adoption of Russian children by U.S. families, Russian media reported Wednesday.
The bill also bars any political activities by nongovernmental organizations receiving funding from the United States, if such activities could affect Russian interests, the news agency said.

"The United States is concerned by measures in the bill passed in the Russian Duma today that, if it becomes law, would halt inter-country adoptions between the United States and Russia and would restrict the ability of Russian civil society organizations to work with American partners," U.S. State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said last week.
"American families have welcomed more than 60,000 Russian children into American homes over the past 20 years," Ventrell said last week.
Backers of the Russian bill said American adoptive parents have been abusive, citing 19 deaths of Russian children since the 1990s.
Konstantin Dolgov, Russian Foreign Ministry's Special Representative for Human Rights, said on Twitter that Russia is "well aware of, and have pointed out more than once, the inadequate protection of adopted Russian children in the US."
The United States has signed but not ratified the convention, which has sparked concerns from conservatives over its impact on U.S. sovereignty and parental rights.
"This bill hits back at Russia's most vulnerable children and could deprive them of the loving families they desperately need," Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said last week.
