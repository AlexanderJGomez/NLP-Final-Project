England has not had much to smile about in recent months but perhaps it will allow itself time to enjoy a rare moment of success.
The World Cup was an unmitigated disaster as England failed to qualify from the group stage for the first time since 1950.
Danny Welbeck, who recently signed for Arsenal after completing a move from Manchester United, scored both goals as England produced an encouraging performance.
Both goals came as a result of counter attacks with Welbeck finishing off Raheem Sterling's cross on 58 minutes after England had caught Switzerland short in defense.
We have worked on springing from defense to attack which you saw tonight.
"This team has a lot of quality and excellent players and it was just a matter of time before we scored," Valencia's Alcacer told TVE.
In Kiev, Ukraine suffered a 1-0 home defeat by Slovakia in with Robert Mak scoring the only goal of the game for the visitors.
