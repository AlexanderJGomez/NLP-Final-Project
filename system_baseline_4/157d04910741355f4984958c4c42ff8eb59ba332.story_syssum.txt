"Under the Clean Air Act these standards will require American power plants to put in place proven and widely available pollution technologies to control and cut harmful emissions like mercury, arsenic, chromium, nickel and acid gases," Jackson said.
The Power Plant Mercury and Air Toxics Standards are expected to have broad health benefits, according to the EPA.
A group of second-graders from Amidon-Bowen Elementary School in Washington, D.C., joined EPA Administration Lisa Jackson as she signed the new guidelines.
Jackson said the instillation and maintenance of the pollution controls would provide jobs as well as health benefits.
Consumers will see a bump in their bills while utility companies put the new technology in place, she said.
Those costs to companies and consumers she said would be far outweighed by the benefits.
