"It's a great honor to be asked to be the next manager of Manchester United," Moyes told United's official website.
"I have had a terrific job at Everton, with a tremendous chairman and Board of Directors and a great set of players.
Everton will be close to me for the rest of my life."
"He was a young man then at the start of his career and has since gone on to do a magnificent job at Everton.
Moyes told Everton chairman Bill Kenwright of his desire to join Manchester United and succeed Ferguson on Wednesday.
"Everton can confirm that David Moyes will leave the Club at the end of the season," the Merseyside club said in a statement.
Moyes took charge of Everton on over 500 occasions with the club qualifying for Europe four times during his time as manager.
The club has been repaying large amounts of debt since it was bought by the American Glazer family in a highly leveraged Â£800 million ($1.25 billion) takeover in 2005.
United did not have to pay Everton compensation for Moyes, as his contract had been due to expire in July.
Moyes later sued the player and his publisher over remarks made in his autobiography, but they settled out of court.
