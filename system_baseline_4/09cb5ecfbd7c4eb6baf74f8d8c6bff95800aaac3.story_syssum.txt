On Friday, Universal Studios is opening its "Wizarding World of Harry Potter" attraction at Universal's Islands of Adventure theme park in Orlando, Florida.
One of the reasons Harry Potter is so successful is its legions of fans, both young and old.
"I've grown up with Harry Potter.
I've brought all the books they came out, I dressed up for Harry Potter spirit day at my school.
I love the Harry Potter series."
"When I read the last book it was almost like the end, I still had the movies, but I was afraid it would be over, but the park is a way for it to live on."
