The government banned products that include milk, milk powder, vegetables and fruits produced and harvested from Chiba, Tochigi, Ibaraki, Gunma and Fukushima Prefectures, according to the Hong Kong Food and Health Department.
Japanese food imports make up less than 4% of food imported into the United States, the FDA says.
In Japan, that country's Health Ministry reported Tuesday finding radioactive materials at levels "drastically exceeding legal limits" in 11 types of vegetables grown in Fukushima prefecture, including broccoli and cabbage, according to Kyodo News Agency.
The news agency, citing the ministry, said, "If a person eats 100 grams (3 1/2 ounces) of the vegetable with the largest detected amount of radioactive materials for about 10 days, it would be equal to ingesting half the amount of radiation a person typically receives from the natural environment in a year.
A radiation physicist from the Office of Atoms for Peace said the agency will work with the country's health ministry to do random checks of imported food from Japan.
But radioactive caesium has also been detected in Japanese food, which can linger for years and cause long-term problems for food production and human health, according to the agencies.
In addition to the spinach and milk, very small amounts of radioactive iodine have been detected in tap water near the plant.
"I don't think you could eat enough spinach and you probably couldn't drink enough milk to have health risks," Cox added.
On Wednesday, Tokyo government officials advised residents not to give tap water to infants or use it in formula after tests at a purification plant detected higher levels of radioactive iodine.
