JACKSON, Missouri (CNN) -- Debbie Shank breaks down in tears every time she's told that her 18-year-old son, Jeremy, was killed in Iraq.
Eight years ago, Shank was stocking shelves for the retail giant and signed up for Wal-Mart's health and benefits plan.
Wal-Mart had paid out about $470,000 for Shank's medical expenses and later sued for the same amount.
"We assumed after three years, they [Wal-Mart] had made a decision to let Debbie Shank use this money for what it was intended to," Graham said.
The Shanks lost their suit to Wal-Mart.
But I just wonder if they need it that bad," Jim Shank said.
Jim Shank said he believes Wal-Mart should make an exception.
He's afraid he won't be able to send their youngest son to college and pay for his and Debbie's care.
"The recovery that Debbie Shank made was recovery for future lost earnings, for her pain and suffering," Graham said.
Graham said he believes Wal-Mart should be entitled to only about $100,000.
But just last week, the high court said it would not hear the case.
For now, he said the family will figure out a way to get by and "do the best we can for Debbie."
