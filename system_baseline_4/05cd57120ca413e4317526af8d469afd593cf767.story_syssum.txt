BEIJING, China (CNN) -- The death toll in China's outbreak of hand-foot-mouth disease has risen to 42 children, with the capital Beijing reporting its first case Wednesday, state media said.
The deaths are blamed on enterovirus 71, or EV-71, one of the most common causes of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD).
HFMD can be caused by a number of intestinal viruses, of which EV-71 and Coxsackie A16 are among the most common.
Public health officials expect the number of cases to peak this summer, since the disease thrives in warm weather.
China is also coping with the devastation left by a magnitude-7.9 earthquake that struck Monday, killing thousands and leaving even more people trapped in debris or simply listed as missing.
