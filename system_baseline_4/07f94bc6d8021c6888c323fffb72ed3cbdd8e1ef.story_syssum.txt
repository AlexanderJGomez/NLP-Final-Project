Not for On the Roofs (OTR), a loose collective of photographers from Moscow who have made it their mission to shoot thrilling, often beautiful stills and video from the rooftops of the world's tallest buildings.
Their latest stunt, published on YouTube on October 8 but already boasting well over a million views, shows four of them, identified at the end of the short video as Vadim Makhorov, Vitaliy Raskalov, Arseni Khachaturan and Nikolay Zheludovich (not their real names), climb a steel ladder onto the roof of a Hong Kong skyscraper and hijack a huge LED billboard.
"There's no philosophy to OTR, we are just a small group of photographers, who like exploration, interesting places and some different countries," Raskalov tells CNN.
He says they've climbed thousands of buildings in something like 50 countries.
I'm usually scared not about heights but about police.
Sometimes if we go to a dangerous country, like an Arabian country, maybe this is a big problem if police caught us.
For the "What's Up Hong Kong" mission, he says the hardest part was figuring out the computer program that ran the LED billboard.
It's not hard to see why; some of the footage is mind-blowing.
"People in Hong Kong messaged us about Occupy Central, asking how we could do the same stuff (as the LED billboard) with them.
But so far, it's just the thrill of the climb that keeps him, and his On the Roofs co-conspirators going.
