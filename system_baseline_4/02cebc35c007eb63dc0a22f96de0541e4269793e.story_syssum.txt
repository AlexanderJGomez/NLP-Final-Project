Describing a chaotic scene on the streets of the Thai capital Thursday night, Thomas Fuller of the International Herald Tribune described to CNN how Maj. Gen. Khattiya Sawasdipol was shot in the head as he was interviewing the opposition figure.
The protesters' barricades appear as a combination "of 'Mad Max' and some medieval scene," Fuller said.
Fuller said he was just inside the barricades when he was interviewing Seh Daeng.
"He was standing in the same location for a while when I was talking to him but he was moving around, he was gesticulating," Fuller said.
Seh Daeng -- or Red Commander -- is a controversial public figure, even within the protest movement, Fuller said.
"He's a renegade in all sense," Fuller said.
More than two dozen civilians and military personnel have died in police-protester clashes in the ongoing unrest.
