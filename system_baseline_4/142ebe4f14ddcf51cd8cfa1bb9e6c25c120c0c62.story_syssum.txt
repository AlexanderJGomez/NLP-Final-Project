(CNN) -- For the first time since the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Christine Wilford plans do something remarkable on Thursday that once was routine: drop her child off at school.
"We think it's good he's going back," Wilford said.
Newtown Public Schools Superintendent Janet Robinson said that part of the building had been transformed to resemble an elementary school.
The school has also been outfitted with rugs and furniture similar to those at Sandy Hook to help ease the transition for students.
"I think right now it has to be the safest school in America," Monroe Police Lt. Keith White said.
