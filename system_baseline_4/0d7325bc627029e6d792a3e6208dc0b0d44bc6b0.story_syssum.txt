Those who have been following the recent soap opera at the University of Virginia may think that it has to do with the blundering dismissal of the president, Teresa Sullivan, and her subsequent re-engagement by the Board of Visitors under instruction by the governor of the state to put their house in order or resign.
But in place of chanting "Close the university," on this occasion the students, faculty and others assembled on the quad claimed the right to open the university as their own and called for the right to select their own leader -- their own president.
In today's story, the students and faculty are saying that they are the university, an entity to be protected from a seemingly intrusive force: the Board of Visitors.
It was the crime of insult.
The rehiring of the president after a special emergency meeting of the board is a victory for the president, of course, but more significant, it is a victory for the concept of a governance system in which all parties who have a genuine interest in the maintenance of the university are given an opportunity to play their part, to express their thinking and have it inform the future of their institution.
Process becomes substance.
In the case at the University of Virginia, the leader of the board, Helen Dragas, was exposed as having disregarded "the way we do things."
I cannot help to think how ironic it is that this battle has two women in opposition, Sullivan and Dragas.
In this case, the fact that the media have not made much about the women in the showdown demonstrates how far we have come in contemporary America.
