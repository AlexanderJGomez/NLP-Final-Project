David Croom of Apache Junction, Arizona, hasn't seen his 18-year-old son in more than a week.
"He's never been in the wild before," David Croom said.
"There were similarities," Croom said of his son's disappearance.
Like McCandless, Johnathan Croom is apparently traveling with very few belongings: perhaps a small backpack and his phone, his father says.
Left behind in the Honda was the teen's ID card, plus a sweatshirt, blanket and jug of water -- things someone might need to survive in the wilderness.
The teen has been a main topic of conversation in Riddle, a logging and ranching community of about 1,300 with no traditional grocery store and no movie theater.
"It's 2Â½ miles from the major interstate; it's right in town in Riddle," Huston said of where Croom's car was found.
Johnathan Croom's camping experience is limited at best, his father says, not much more than camping once or twice with his car.

"He's been watching the movie a lot," he said.
An Oklahoma teen inspired by the movie reportedly went missing in Oregon in March after telling his parents he wanted to "live in the wild."
"One of the keys to that movie is that no one ever went looking for him.
"I got a phone call from a logger who said he saw a young man with the same grin as my son on one of the logging roads, so a bunch of local volunteers are going to blanket the area."
David Croom has appealed to local search organizations for assistance.
It's already been a week.
