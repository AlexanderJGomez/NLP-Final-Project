Eric George, who represents Debbie Rowe, the biological mother of Jackson's two oldest children, demanded Tuesday that the New York Post retract its report that Rowe had agreed to take $4 million not to challenge Katherine Jackson for custody.
While George said Rowe still has not decided if she will ask the court for custody or visitation, he said she will not try to get money from the Jackson family.
A child custody court hearing, which had been set for this week, was delayed until next Monday at the request of lawyers for Jackson and Rowe, a court official said.
The New York Post, quoting an unidentified Jackson family source, reported Rowe had agreed to drop any custody challenge for a $4 million payment.
Jackson and Rowe married in 1996 and their first child -- Michael Joseph Jackson Jr. -- was born in February 1997.
"He was upset because he really wanted to be a dad," Rowe said.
That is when I looked at him and said.
"
"That was my request, not his," she said.
She said the children don't call her "mom" because she did not want them to.
Rowe, 50, lives on a horse farm in Palmdale, California, about 60 miles north of Los Angeles.
