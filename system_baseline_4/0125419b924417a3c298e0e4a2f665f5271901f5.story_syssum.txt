(CNN) -- American investigators reviewing a hard drive belonging to the captain of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 have found that there were deletions of information even closer to the final flight than first indicated by Malaysian officials, U.S. law enforcement officials tell CNN.
It's not clear why Malaysian officials cited the February 3 date and if they knew of the other deletions.
"Barring other information to suggest otherwise one has to first think this was a tragic accident," a U.S. law enforcement official said.
U.S. investigators have compiled profiles of the two pilots, based on interviews with friends, neighbors and family members conducted by Malaysian investigators, and on a search of their online activities, U.S. officials say.
U.S. investigators also are concerned about the preservation of evidence in Malaysia.
U.S. officials say they understand that there are Malaysian legal restrictions and requirements for probable cause before such searches.
