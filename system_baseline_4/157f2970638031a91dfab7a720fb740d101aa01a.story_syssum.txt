Along with provincial elections in Iraq, residents in Basra may also be voting to become an autonomous region.
Wail Abd al-Latif -- a Basra member of parliament and a former Basra provincial governor -- is leading the drive and has hinted that he wants the region to receive its own share of the oil income generated there, Visser said.
A monthlong petition drive started Monday for a Basra region referendum -- which would be held if at least 10 percent of the more than 1.4 million registered voters in the province sign up, said the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq, or UNAMI, which is helping Iraq with its electoral process.
The voting age in Iraq is 18, but anybody born in 1991 will be allowed to register and submit signatures after January 1.
"What rights the regions will have with regard to the oil sector remains controversial," said Visser, also the editor of historiae.org -- where he posts scholarly papers about Iraq, including one on Monday about the Basra region.
Basra is the only Iraqi province that borders a body of water -- the Shatt al Arab waterway near the Persian Gulf.
