WASHINGTON (CNN) -- There is "no remaining hope" of finding six men trapped for almost a month in a Utah coal mine alive, a federal official said Saturday.
"The grueling around-the-clock rescue operation that claimed three lives and injured six others has also taken a tremendous toll on the many brave rescuers and the local community, and our thoughts and prayers are with them all," Chao said in a statement.
"We basically told the families that at this point in time we've run out of options," Stickler said at a news conference late Friday.
There were no public statements Saturday from Bob Murray, president and CEO of Murray Mining, co-owner of the Crandall Canyon Mine, who was the outspoken face of the rescue operation for the first three weeks, then largely disappeared from public view.
It's finished," the attorney for the families said, according to the Saturday edition of The Salt Lake Tribune.
Murray said last week that the search effort would stop if no signs of life were found at the sixth hole.
MSHA's Stickler said that hole was drilled into the Crandall Canyon Mine on Thursday, but there were problems with a robotic camera that teams were trying to lower into it.
It really couldn't go any farther than seven feet," he said of the latest try.
Murray said last Saturday he has already filed paperwork with federal regulators to permanently close and seal the Crandall Canyon mine.
