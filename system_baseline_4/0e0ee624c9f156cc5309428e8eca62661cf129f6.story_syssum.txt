Adm. Mike Mullen has been Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, the president's top military adviser, since October of 2007.
It wasn't just the October sun that brightened the day for Mullen.
"And he really likes it when you laugh at his jokes.
Mullen said.
"His leadership, his influence, his honest candor, his compassion and his outspoken concern for our troops have set an exceptionally high standard for the responsibilities and performance of a chairman of the Joint Chiefs," Panetta said.
Instead of trying to leap ahead decades into the future as we design our military, we must build a force able to handle the challenges we know it will face today, and one that can adapt to the future."
Mullen said Afghanistan will be Dempsey's biggest challenge.
The new chairman, the first Army general elevated to chairman since 2001, had the last word.
