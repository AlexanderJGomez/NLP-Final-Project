(CNN) -- Two men were being questioned Thursday by Mexican authorities about a shooting that killed a U.S. Border Patrol agent and wounded another near the U.S.-Mexican border in Arizona, a source in the Mexican attorney general's office said.
U.S. authorities have identified the agent killed as 30-year-old Nicholas Ivie.
He was released from the hospital Wednesday, said Jeremy Copeland, an agent with the Tucson Sector of U.S. Border Patrol.
As of Wednesday, investigators had not found the weapon used in the shooting, a U.S. law enforcement official said.
