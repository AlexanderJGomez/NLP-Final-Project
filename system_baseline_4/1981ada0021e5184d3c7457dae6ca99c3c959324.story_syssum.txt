"The twins' vital signs are good; they're doing excellent," said Sami Al-Shalan, spokesman for the King Abdulaziz Medical City facility in Riyadh where the surgery took place.

"We had to identify the arteries and the blood veins between each baby," Al-Rabeeah said.
The procedure was the 21st of its kind to be performed in the kingdom.
