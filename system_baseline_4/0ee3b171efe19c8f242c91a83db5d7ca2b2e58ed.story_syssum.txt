The performer, Sarah Guillot-Guyard, plunged to the floor after the wire rope from which she was suspended broke, the Nevada Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) said in a statement Tuesday outlining the results of its investigation into her death.
The agency said Cirque du Soleil hadn't trained Guillot-Guyard properly and had failed to adequately protect employees working for the show.
"Cirque du Soleil completed an exhaustive review of its safety policies and procedures in the wake of the tragic accident involving Sarah," Cirque du Soleil said in a statement.
"We have redoubled our efforts to ensure the overall diligence and safety of our performers and crew."
It resumed performances more than two weeks later.
Nicknamed "Sassoon," she was part of the original cast of "Ka," Cirque du Soleil said in a statement issued shortly after her death.
