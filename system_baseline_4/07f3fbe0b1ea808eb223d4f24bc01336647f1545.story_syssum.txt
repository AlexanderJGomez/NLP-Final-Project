Alleged cartel hit man Eduardo Ravelo has been added to the FBI's most wanted list.
He heads the Barrio Aztecas gang, but Ravelo isn't flashy, FBI agents say.
He is believed to be responsible for dozens of murders and assaults, as well as drug trafficking, extortion, weapons offenses and money laundering, FBI Agent Samantha Mikeska said.

"Eduardo Ravelo rose to power within the Barrio Aztecas criminal enterprise because of his connections with the Juarez cartel and also [because] he's a ruthless killer and will basically carry out what the Juarez cartel wants him to do," Mikeska said.
U.S. authorities say the commanders of the Juarez cartel often call on Ravelo to execute their enemies.
FBI investigators say they believe that in March 2008, Ravelo carried out a hit on a captain in his own gang.
But Ravelo has eluded authorities.
"He has an entourage, he has bodyguards, he has armored vehicles to protect him from rival gangs and rival cartels," Mikeska says.
