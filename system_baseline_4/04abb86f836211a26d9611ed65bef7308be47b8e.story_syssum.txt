(CNN) -- Walking through a hushed cemetery at night with only a flashlight to guide your way can be a stirring experience for amateur ghost hunters this Halloween.
"Oddly enough, a lot of cemeteries aren't that haunted," said Richard Senate, a historian and ghost hunter of 33 years.
Senate shared what he regards as some of the most haunted cemeteries in America.
Cemetery No.
1 is perhaps the most famous of New Orleans' cemeteries.
"She haunts her tomb," Senate said.
Not all cemetery hauntings involve walking through a graveyard at night.
She is seen not only within the cemetery but just outside of the gates.
Often, "Mary" vanishes in the car or steps out at the cemetery and fades into darkness, Senate said.
Not only is this cemetery full of Hollywood legends from the silent film era to our recently departed celebrities, Senate says it is also full of ghosts.
But when the lady in black died, her ghost carried on the tradition.
Both her and Valentino's ghosts have been seen by his grave, Senate said.
They now rest in Boothill Cemetery, alongside gamblers, smugglers and outlaws, Senate said.
"Tombstone is a true place for ghost hunters to go," Senate said.
"It is chock full of haunted sites, and the cemetery is but one."
But Senate notes that one of the most persistent ghosts is really just there to be social.
Should you decide to stop by any of these cemeteries and go on your own ghost hunt, Senate has a few words of advice.
"You should be like a ghost: No one should know you've even been there," Senate said.
