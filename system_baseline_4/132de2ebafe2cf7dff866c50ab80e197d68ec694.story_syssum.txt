It will take its place beside the Galaxy S and will, at least initially, be available exclusively on Verizon Wireless.
But the most distinguishing feature of this device isn't its main display; it's a secondary, 1.8-inch, Super AMOLED display.
Disappointingly, the Continuum will ship with Android 2.1, but Samsung has assured it will be updated rapidly.
The Samsung Continuum will be available for pre-order on November 11.
