The Dubai-based airline is aiming for the high-end business traveler with a new luxury private jet service.
The Emirates Executive Airbus A319 can accommodate 19 people, with the plane divided into two main zones.
Mechanically activated tables can be raised in front of two large sofas, while one of 1,500 channels of in-flight entertainment can be watched on two 42-inch LCD screens.
It's certainly a more affordable option than buying a large private jet outright; an Airbus ACJ318 (similar to the Emirates Executive A319) or long-range Gulfstream G650 costs around $65 million from the respective manufacturers.
North America, with around 40% of the market, remains the biggest destination for private executive travel but the largest growth is expected to come from emerging regions in Latin American and Asia.
David Velupillai, marketing director of executive and private aviation for Airbus says that their jets -- from A318s to superjumbo A380s -- can be fitted out according to their clients' needs.
