Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- The release of American hiker Sarah Shourd has been "canceled" because the judicial process has not been completed, a prosecutor said Friday, according to the semiofficial Iranian Labour News Agency.
Tehran has said the three hikers were spies, and Iran's intelligence minister has hinted the country may consider releasing them in exchange for the release of Iranian prisoners, according to state news outlets.
The hikers' families' website, freethehikers.org, said Shourd has been in solitary confinement, able to meet for only two 30-minute periods per day with Bauer, who is her fianc√©, and Fattal.
"They admire and respect different cultures and religions and share a love of travel that has taken them to many countries.
It is widely acknowledged that they are being held for political purposes that have nothing to do with the facts of their case.
