Bamako, Mali (CNN) -- Islamists in control of northern Mali said they forced a man and a woman into two holes and stoned them to death for committing adultery in the lawless region.
A leader of a radical Islamic group in the region said Sharia law condemns relationships outside marriage.
The stoning Sunday is the first reported Sharia killing since al Qaeda-linked Islamists took control of the north.
Islamists have since imposed a harsh form of Sharia law that bans drinking, music and sports on television.
Most residents in the area are Muslims, but have protested against the strict form of Sharia as Islamists remain determined to apply it.
In addition to the killing, Islamist militants have gone on a rampage for months, destroying sacred tombs in the region and vowing to target more.
They especially target Sufi shrines, which they believe are sacrilegious.
