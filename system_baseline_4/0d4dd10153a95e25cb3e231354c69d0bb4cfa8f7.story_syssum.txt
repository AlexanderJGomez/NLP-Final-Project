(CNN) -- As oil began approaching the coast of the United States, environmental scientists said the effects of the spill in the Gulf of Mexico could have ecological and biological consequences for years, if not decades.
"The immediate acute impact might not be that severe because there is not much oil getting to a certain spot, but because the oil might stick around [in the sediment] for 20 years you might have a real chronic effect."
About 1.6 million gallons of oil have spilled since the explosion, the Coast Guard said.
He said there have been some oil spills in Europe that provide clues as to what might happen.
Environmentalist Richard Charter of the Defenders of Wildlife organization said the size of the oil spill will be overwhelming to cleanup crews.
... You're looking at a long-term poisoning of the area.
The 1997 report said that what oil did remain could be found on beaches that were near still water.
The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustees Council also disagreed.
All the scientists CNN spoke to said that the long-term impacts of the spill depend on how much oil reaches the coast.
"Eventually that water moves out into the Caribbean and the Atlantic," he said, indicating the East Coast needs to pay attention to where the oil is traveling.
