Under the command of one of Libya's most well known rebel commanders, Al-Mahdi al-Harati, more than 30 Libyan fighters have made their way into Syria to support the Free Syrian Army rebels in their war against President Bashar al-Assad's regime.
Al-Harati, who has dual Libyan and Irish citizenship, first visited Syria last year on what he calls a "fact finding mission" to see the situation on the ground and find out what Syrian rebels needed.
He does not want his last name disclosed because he does not want his family to know he wants to go to Syria.
Mohammed smiles as he recalls the fighting in Libya last year, like now he says, it was during the Holy Month of Ramadan.
In Libya we experienced Jihad, tasted the beauty of Jihad.
We are going to support our brothers in Syria," he said.
I can not sit back and watch that," Najjair told CNN in a Skype interview from one of Turkey's borders with Syria hours before making the dangerous journey into Syria.
Najjair says the no-fly zone enforced in Libya last year helped rebel fighters and allowed them to make great advances.
Last month, a senior Libyan security official told CNN the government was aware of Libyans fighting in Syria, but they were individuals and not government sponsored.
But Libya's government and people have been vocal in their support for the Syrian opposition.
"We are coming for you Bashar," says one of the doctors as they shake hands with the heavily armed Syrian fighters.
In February, reports of at least four Libyan fighters killed in Syria circulated, but there has been no government confirmation.
If it's not my time it will be another amazing journey another amazing victory.""
