(CNN) -- The grizzly bear that attacked and killed a man in Yellowstone National Park acted in defense, park officials said on Thursday, adding that they have no plans to kill the bear.
Park officials were adamant that the bear's reaction was defensive and that the park does not have plans to track down and kill the bear.
Wenk said the bear "impacted" Matayoshi while his wife took cover behind a fallen tree.
She played dead and the bear left, Wenk said.
Gunther said hair and DNA samples were collected from the scene so that if another incident occurs they will know if the same bear was involved.
Wenk said bears have been very visible to park visitors this year but that park officials rely on reports from hikers to determine how many bears are in the back country of the park.
Wenk advised visitors to familiarize themselves with bear safety and protocol before they begin hiking.
