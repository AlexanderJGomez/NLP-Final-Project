But adversity has made him wise beyond his years, and Malek knows better.
"I need support, I need help because I'm representing Afghanistan -- especially disabled people," says Malek, who more than anything, wants to swim for his country at the 2012 Paralympic Games in London.
He is very strong, and I am sure that he can take part in any competition.
"I don't have any coach or any trainer to teach me how to swim, how to prepare for the games, so I'm doing by myself, because I love swimming," says Malek.
Nikpai, who was swimming in the same pool as Malek when we visited, is keenly aware how difficult it is to excel in athletics in Afghanistan.
"They want to bring medals back home.
Nikpai is very happy to see Malek make progress.
Malek has others encouraging him to chase his Olympic dream.
Malek knows that whatever happens, in a sense, he's already won.
