But in the end Manchester United's opening day fixture of the EPL season bore all the hallmarks of its recent troubled past as Swansea City upset Louis Van Gaal's side to win 2-1 at Old Trafford Saturday.
"It is very disappointing that we have lost our first home match," Van Gaal told BT Sport in his post game interview.
In the second half we never played as a team, therefore I'm responsible," Van Gaal continued.
Judging by this performance, the prospective new arrivals can't arrive soon enough.
United began with a 3-5-2 system similar to that employed by Van Gaal's Dutch side at the World Cup earlier this summer before switching to a 4-4-1-1 as the game progressed.
"We have been working hard in pre-season on defensive shape and we can get even better at that but there were pleasing signs in the way we stuck together and the goals we scored against a side of Manchester United's resources," said Swansea manager Gary Monk.
With more solid, mature performances like this over the coming season such predictions will be made to look badly placed.
