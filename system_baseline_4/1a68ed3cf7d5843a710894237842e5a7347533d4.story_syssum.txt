It's called kinesio tape.
The tape has been around for decades, but during the London 2012 Olympics, it has been spotted stretching and spiraling in interesting patterns on some athletes.
"She said she had been watching the Olympics, saw the tape on sale, and wondered if she should buy it," he says.
Because the tape is thin and pliable, it's different from athletic tape used on ankles or wrists, he says.
He thought the standard taping methods of the time were too restrictive and may even extend injuries, because they inhibited the flow of inflammatory fluids beneath the skin.
"You should have seen the doctor's smile.
The company has trained more than 100,000 practitioners around the world on how to use the tape, Halpern says.
When people see athletes who are doing so well, they think, 'Maybe this could work for me,'" he says.
Robin Rogers, an Atlanta runner who is also a massage therapist for athletes, says he's a fan of the tape.
Rogers says he hasn't used the tape in any races yet.
Running coach and marathoner Tina Klein says she tried the tape, but it didn't work for her.
It's pretty-colored cotton tape."
