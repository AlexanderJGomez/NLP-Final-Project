The man who got kicked off a United Airlines flight because of a fight over seat reclining says he's sorry about his behavior.
Although the Federal Aviation Administration hasn't prohibited use of the device on commercial flights, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines (which also operates the U.S. Airways brand) and Southwest Airlines (which also operates the AirTran brand) all say they ban the $22 device, which prevents the seat in front of the user from reclining.
The woman in front of him complained about not being able to recline, and the flight attendant asked him to remove the device, Beach told "the Today Show."
"She just took all the space, and I can't work now," Beach said he told the flight attendant.
Aviation blogger Johnny "Jet" DiScala says Beach should feel terrible.
