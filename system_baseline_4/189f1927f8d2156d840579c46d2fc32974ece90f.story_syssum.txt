(CNN) -- Hong Kong's narrow streets were once a dazzling gallery of neon, where banks and even bordellos plied their trade under sizzling tubular signs.
Now it's seeking public help to keep Hong Kong's neon heritage ablaze.
To drum up interest in its new acquisition, M+ is holding an online exhibition of Hong Kong's neon signs.
"Neon signage is a highly under-researched topic," says Chen.
One reason is a government crackdown on illegal and unsafe structures that in 2009 led to the removal of about 5,000 signboards, many of them neon.
The neon cow that will enter the M+ collection was deemed unfit as, at 4.5 meters wide, it busts official size limits.
The lights are tricky and expensive to make, requiring a neon tube-bending technician and, for something like the neon cow, a budget of HK$250,000 ($32,225).
A push from mainland China to use LEDs has also dimmed Hong Kong's love of neon.
"Many cities in China no longer support neon signage and this inevitably affects Hong Kong's businesses," says Tam.
In terms of quantity, neon will recede.
