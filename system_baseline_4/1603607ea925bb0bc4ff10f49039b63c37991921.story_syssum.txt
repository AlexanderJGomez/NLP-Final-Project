Marouane Fellaini, derided for much of the season following a nightmare year at Manchester United, headed home an equalizer with 20 minutes remaining after entering the fray as a substitute.
Its captain, Vincent Kompany, was born in Brussels to parents of Congolese descent, while Romelu Lukaku, the striker, comes from a similar background.
Even so, while Belgium boasts undoubted talent, its players have hardly excelled in European competition this year.
Nonetheless, Belgium was still expected to deal with an Algeria side which has been widely dismissed by fans and pundits alike.
His strike, which came from the penalty spot after 24 minutes, might have sealed a historic win for an Algeria side which has never qualified from the group stage in its past three attempts.
It wasn't until the 66th minute that it created a real opportunity when Divock Origi, on as substitute for the disappointing Lukaku, fired straight at the Algeria goalkeeper.
Belgium's next game is against Russia on June 22 while Algeria takes on South Korea later that day.
It was Akinfeev's dreadful error which allowed Lee Keunho's 25-yard effort to somehow squirm out of his hands and over the line.
Fortunately for Russia, Kerzhakov's strike ensured Russia avoided defeat after falling behind with 22 minutes remaining.
