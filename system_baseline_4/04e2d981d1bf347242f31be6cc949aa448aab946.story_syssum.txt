Frances Townsend says the director of the CIA is not a post for on-the-job training.
Mr. Panetta is a seasoned political operative and a proven manager -- both of which would be useful to him as CIA director -- but more is required.
Because of the critical role the intelligence community plays in protecting our nation, the director of the CIA is not a position for on-the-job training.
President-elect Barack Obama had a competent, qualified career intelligence official to nominate.
Mr. Brennan's loyalty was to the mission and role of the intelligence community in protecting our nation.
Regardless of who becomes the next CIA director, the nation is fortunate that from the deputy director on down, the CIA is run by career officials who will continue to do the nation's business.
Before abrogating Bush Administration policies on interrogation and detention, the new CIA director must learn: what is legal; what is effective; and how have these policies been implemented.
If Mr. Panetta is to be the next CIA director, he will need to earn the trust, confidence and respect of career intelligence officials.
Let's pray if he is confirmed that he is up to the difficult job ahead of him.
