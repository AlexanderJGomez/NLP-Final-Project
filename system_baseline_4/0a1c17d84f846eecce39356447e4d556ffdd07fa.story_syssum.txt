(CNN) -- Authorities scoured the national park around Washington's Mount Rainier on Sunday for a man they say fatally shot a park ranger and fled into the woods, a park spokeswoman said.
"And it's heavily forested."
Park ranger Margaret Anderson, 34, responded to that call and set up her patrol vehicle as a roadblock.
"We don't want to try to have those people get to their vehicle and caravan down the park road where it could be dangerous, being sniped at by a gunman," the spokeswoman said Sunday night.
Anderson was the mother of a 4-year-old and 1-year-old and the wife of a fellow park ranger, according to Taylor.
