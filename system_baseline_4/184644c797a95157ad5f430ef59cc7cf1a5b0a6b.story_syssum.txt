(CNN) -- Theresa Borawski sat down heavily on a neighbor's porch, somewhere in between her front door and her good friend's driveway.
"I was just like I had run in a marathon," Borawski remembers.
At her heaviest in March 2011, Borawski weighed 428 pounds.
"Today, I am 276 pounds lighter, 14 jean sizes smaller, and no longer need a wheelchair, walker or cane to get around.
She was heavy throughout high school and college but says her weight never really affected her life until 2003, when a series of setbacks sent her into a downward spiral.
Borawski lost her church job of 15 years and moved more than 200 miles to start anew.
"I already knew she was dedicated," Bowden says.
Over the next four years, Borawski gained weight steadily.
By January 2011, "my life was in complete chaos," Borawski says.
He and Borawski had become friends and chatted often about the future.
"I could barely function," Borawski says.
She got up, rode around in her wheelchair, popped painkillers, ate and went to bed every night at 7 p.m. "Every bit of energy I had went to just living."
When the sister hung up, Borawski went to the refrigerator and took out a bottle of peach soda.
Ten days later, she went to the doctor and had lost 7 pounds.
I lost 45 pounds between March and Memorial Day."
In October 2011, Borawski walked to her mailbox without a cane for the first time.
"To see somebody walk again?
Every time she lost 20 pounds, Borawski went to the store and bought a pair of pants in the next size smaller.
Last month, Borawski walked three miles for the first time.
She eats around 1,400 calories to maintain her weight at a healthy 150 pounds.
"The key for me was finding a plan that I could live with for the rest of my life," she wrote on iReport.
