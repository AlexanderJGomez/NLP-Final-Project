(CNN) -- Are immigrants to the U.S. more likely than the general American population to adopt tablet computers?
In all, 13% reported owning a tablet device, representing about 5 million people in the U.S.
Part of this might be explained by how Rebtel defined "tablet."
In fact, Pew's study differentiated between tablets and e-readers and found that another 5% of Americans currently own an e-reader.
Rebtel also noted nation-of-origin differences regarding whether immigrants would purchase a tablet in the near future.
