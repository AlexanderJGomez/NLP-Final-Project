"He was outgoing -- loved everybody, (was) very known in the community and got along with everybody," his brother Anthony Scott told CNN's Don Lemon.
Dash cam video released Thursday shows the two talking, then shows Scott get out of his car and run.
Another family lawyer, Chris Stewart, acknowledged that Scott had been arrested previously for outstanding warrants for not paying child support, but Stewart said that had been Scott's lone issue with the law for the past 20 years.
Regardless of why Walter Scott ran, "running from an officer doesn't result in the death penalty," Stewart said.
Anthony Scott said he watched the video that showed his brother getting shot dead, footage that has traumatized the family.
"It was a great celebration," Anthony Scott said.
"It's so tragic."
