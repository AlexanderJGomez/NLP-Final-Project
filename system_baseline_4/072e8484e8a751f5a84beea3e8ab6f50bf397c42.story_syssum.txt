(CNN) -- It seems like the opposite of what you'd expect, but my cancer diagnosis -- a staggering Stage IV colon cancer diagnosis, delivered to me at the age of 28 -- gave me a new lease on life.
I believed that my will to survive, to thrive, to love and laugh and enjoy my life -- would carry me through any physical challenge.
And it has.
Throughout my time battling cancer, I have learned so much about taking care of my body, mind, and spirit.
I manage stress levels and I make sure I always get enough sleep.
By far, the best part of my cancer-killing adventures has been becoming a part of a community of cancer warriors and their loved ones.
My fellow patients are more than just friends.
That's because they are.
A simple but revolutionary initiative that sees every penny donated going to cutting-edge research that I hope will get us to the cure for colon cancer in under 10 years.
The cure.
If you had all the money in the world, could you cure colon cancer?
Lenz and his dream team -- scientists and researchers from the United States and abroad -- are sure that they can find the cure for colon cancer if they have the funds to do the necessary large-scale research and drug development that the team has long been known for.
It sounds like an impossible goal -- to find the cure for cancer -- but it is possible.
I think that I always knew, deep down, that it was the end of the line for cancer.
