Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Five militants suspected to be behind an airport attack in Peshawar were killed Sunday morning when police raided a house where they were hiding.
Syed Naveed Qamar, Pakistan's defense minister, said the target could have been an air force base, which is adjacent to the airport.
Other than the attackers, four civilians were also killed, Shahid said.
Taliban official Ehsanullah Ehsan said their target was in fact the air base.
