(EW.com) -- Logan is back.
Rob Thomas has informed his "Veronica Mars" movie Kickstarter backers that Jason Dohring is officially on board.
"We now have three actors officially cast.
Veronica.
Logan and the waiter who says, 'Your check, sir,'" he wrote in an email Tuesday night.

"Don't worry.
We're busily working on bringing your favorites into the fold.
As a Veronica Mars backer, you'll be the first to know."
At New York Comic Con in 2008, promoting the former, the CBS vampire drama co-starring Alex O'Loughlin, EW asked Dohring to name five things that should live forever in pop culture.
His No.

5?
"Veronica Mars.
Unfortunately, it didn't last forever, but it seems when you walk around a place like Comic Con that it does," he said.
"Art's the kinda thing that stays with people.
You emotionally invest in people and you emotionally invest yourself in something, and then it lasts.

That's pretty amazing, actually, isn't it?"
