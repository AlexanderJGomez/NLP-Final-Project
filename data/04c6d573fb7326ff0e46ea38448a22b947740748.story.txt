In Detroit on Monday, Al Gore endorsed Sen. Barack Obama for president.
"Americans simply cannot afford to continue the policies of the last eight years for another four," Gore, the party's 2000 presidential nominee, told Obama supporters at a rally in Detroit, Michigan.
Perceived as a senior statesman in the Democratic party, Gore brings a certain force to Obama's campaign, political analysts have said.
Monday marked Gore's debut in the 2008 election; he had not weighed in while Obama was still battling Sen. Hillary Clinton.
Amid thousands of cheering supporters, Gore began by addressing head-on the criticism that Obama doesn't have enough experience to lead the nation.

"And yet another said the United States cannot afford to risk the future of the free world with inexperience and immaturity in the White House," said Gore.
"Who were they talking about?
Every single one of those quotes came from the campaign of 1960, when the the Republicans attacked John Fitzgerald Kennedy for allegedly lacking the age and experience necessary to be president."
Richard Nixon was the Republican nominee in 1960.
Joining Obama in the midst of the candidate's two week swing through the nation to talk about his plans to revitalize the economy, Gore praised  Obama as someone who could mobilize people, young and old, who had never before taken part in politics.

Gore went on to praise the nominee's vision on the environment, domestic and international issues.
Saying he will do whatever he can to support Obama's bid for the White House, Gore said Obama has "inspired" him.
"I feel that same spirit in this auditorium tonight, building all over this country this year," he said.
"Take it from me, elections matter," Gore said.
"If you think the next appointments to our Supreme Court are important, you know that elections matter.

If you live in the city of New Orleans, you know that elections matter.
If you or a member of your family are serving in the active military, the National Guard or Reserves, you know that elections matter.
"If you are a wounded veteran, you know that elections matter.
If you've lost your job; if you're struggling with a mortgage, you know that elections matter."

Gore cited concerns about the environment, lead-painted toys and food safety -- even pet foods -- as other reasons to vote for the Democrat.
"After the last eight years, even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter," Gore said, adding, "After eight years of lost jobs and lower wages, we need change.
After eight years of incompetence, negligence and failure, we need change."
GOP spokesman Alex Conant reacted to Gore's criticism of President Bush.
"This election isn't about changing the past, it's about changing the future," he told The Associated Press on Monday evening.
