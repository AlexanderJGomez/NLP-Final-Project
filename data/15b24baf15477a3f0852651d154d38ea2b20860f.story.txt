"Jean was a brilliant comedienne with exquisite timing.
Working with her was one of the greatest experiences of my life."
"I was at my computer when her glorious children, John and Pam, phoned me, and I told them I was working on my memoir, and reflecting on the time I was father to my personal family on Mooncrest Drive while also fathering Archie and Edith and three other families on CBS.
And I added -- so, at 90, here still is Jean Stapleton, 'always where she is,' helping me to see my own frailties and humanity yet again.
No one gave more profound 'How to be a human being' lessons than Jean Stapleton.
Goodbye Edith, darling."
