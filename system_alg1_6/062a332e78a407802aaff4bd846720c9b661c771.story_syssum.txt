And in the third major event of that day, the interim nuclear deal between Iran and world powers went into effect.
Under the deal negotiated in November, Iran suspended some of its nuclear enrichment operations, and Western governments started lifting some of the economic sanctions they have used to pressure Tehran.
It has become a proxy war for regional rivalries, with Sunni states, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, supporting the opposition, and Iran, along with Hezbollah, standing steadfastly with al-Assad by providing him with manpower, ammunition and intelligence.
The Iranian regime's goal is to spread its version of Islamic revolution and to make Iran the most powerful country in the region.
One reason Iran signed the interim deal is that it has already achieved a great deal of what it sought with its nuclear program.
European, Asian and Arab businessmen are lining up to make deals with a resurgent Iran.
Syria's regime will likely become more beholden to Iran than ever.
In the end, much of the Middle East's future will depend on whether negotiators can find a way to stop Iran from advancing its power to the point where it becomes essentially invulnerable.
