It's been a rough week for Alec Baldwin.
I want to apologize to my loyal fans and to my colleagues at MSNBC -- both for my actions and for distracting from their good work.
Baldwin responded with his own series of tweets.
This is not the first time Baldwin has had a run-in with paparazzi.
Baldwin said the photographer bumped him with his camera.
