(CNN) -- Visitors to the Tate Modern gallery in London on Friday have been stopped from walking on a porcelain sunflower seed art installation by the maverick Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.
A spokesman for Tate Modern told CNN that the public are unlikely be allowed to interact with the exhibit again.
Sunflower seeds are a popular Chinese street snack and one of the country's most famous exports, according to the gallery.
Shortly after, Ai -- who is one of China's leading social activists and bloggers -- distanced himself from the Olympics calling for a boycott and saying the Chinese government was using them as propaganda.
