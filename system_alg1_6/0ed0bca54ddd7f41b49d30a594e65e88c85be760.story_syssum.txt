What makes this situation awkward is that President Barack Obama and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano have given tacit support to the Senate immigration reform bill.
In June 2011, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton fired off an internal memorandum -- the "Morton memo," as it became known -- to all directors, agents and general counsel in the agency's field offices.
The Morton memo was heralded by immigration reform advocates as a major breakthrough.
It did.
At this rate, by the end of 2013, the administration will have deported 2 million people.
This administration has been excessively cruel to illegal immigrants and their families.
Napolitano has said all along she wants to remove illegal immigrants, more and more every year.
