Aside from providing a useful service for music-loving mobile users, Mdundo is also helping to raise the profile of East African artists.
Mdundo is funded by Google-backed 88mph, a seed fund and accelerator that focuses on investing in web and mobile startups that target the African markets.
In 2013, 1,000 East African artists signed up to the service and more than 1,000,000 Kenyan shillings (around $11,000) was paid to artists in royalties.
