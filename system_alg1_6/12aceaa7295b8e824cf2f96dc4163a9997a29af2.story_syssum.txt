New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Close allies since the Soviet days, India and Russia marked the first decade of their strategic partnership with a slew of agreements at their annual summit Tuesday.
At present, two nuclear power plants are being built in southern India with Russian assistance.
The two nations forged a strategic partnership in 2000 and have since been holding summits every year.
This reflects our mutual desire to bring our cooperation in other areas at par with our traditionally strong cooperation in the defense and nuclear fields," Singh told reporters.
