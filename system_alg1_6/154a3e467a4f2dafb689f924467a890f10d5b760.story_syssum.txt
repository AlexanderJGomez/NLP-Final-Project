Muse was arrested in the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama, a cargo ship that pirates attacked on April 8 about 350 miles off the Somali coast.
According to the complaint, Muse had fired his gun at Phillips, the captain said, and then took $30,000 from the ship's safe after he forced Phillips to open it.
Muse demanded that the Maersk Alabama be stopped and that the crew give him the number of the ship's owner, the complaint said.
Phillips boarded the lifeboat with them and the ship's crew freed Muse, who then boarded the lifeboat, according to the criminal complaint.
Muse also received medical treatment while he was on the warship, the complaint said.
