Around the world renewable energy is going through a rebirth.
The modern renewable industry -- wind, solar, and other forms of energy -- was born with a great deal of excitement in the 1970s and early 1980s.
The rise of climate change as a central issue in energy policy drove governments to much more actively promote carbon-free electricity.
In order to meet its rapidly growing needs for energy, China is pursuing all options -- oil and coal and natural gas and nuclear power, as well as renewables.
Over the last decade, growing support by governments for renewable energy has been critical to its development.
Jerry Brown signed a new law requiring that a third of California's electricity be renewable by 2020.
Success there would be a major breakthrough for renewable energy
The costs of solar energy continue to come down, and many of the new approaches under development and in the lab are aimed at further cost reductions.
That adds to the cost pressures on renewable energy.
As costs go down, more solar will come into use around the world.
In other words, wind and solar have much ground to cover, and it will take time.
Renewable will be part of a growing global business that will be measured in hundreds of billions of dollars.
