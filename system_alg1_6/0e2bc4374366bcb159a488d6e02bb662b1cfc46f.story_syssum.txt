Following in the footsteps of her older brother, Barnes started playing soccer when she was 4 years old, for Coach Walter Stewart.
Stewart started coaching the all-girls team in 1998 with only eight players at the Marian Anderson Recreation Center in South Philadelphia.
There are girls who want to play that may not get the opportunity in many parts of the country, and they can play, and they're very good," he said.
"They deal with the challenges of inner-city living for black girls, and soccer isn't that popular socially," said Jafi Barnes, assistant coach.
The Monarchs aren't just about soccer.
"They just want a chance to play," Stewart said.
"They're no different than anybody else."
