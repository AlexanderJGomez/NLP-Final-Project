A few hours later, my mom woke me up telling me there were a couple of men here to see me and that they said something about it being official or federal business.
I did not get to use it the first time, but I stayed after school that evening to see if I could get a chance to try it out.
That junior high school computer math program lead me to computer classes in high school.
Some of my friends already had computers and now my time came and I finally got my own.
We were really just looking around and playing games on these systems; we didn't want to harm anything.
Remember, back then home computers were very new, so there were no computer hacking laws.
Today, more than 30 years later, I'm still fascinated by computers: I'm employed as a network engineer and, at home, I tinker around on about half a dozen computers.
The things that we did set the stage for more than just our personal career paths: We helped create several federal laws that are still on the books for computer crime and password safety.
