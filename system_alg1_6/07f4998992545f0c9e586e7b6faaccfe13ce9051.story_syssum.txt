MADRID, Spain (CNN)  -- Human rights groups from the United States and Spain filed a lawsuit in a Spanish court Thursday, charging El Salvador's former president, Alfredo Cristiani, with covering up crimes against humanity.
The case filed by two human rights groups in Madrid argues that justice was never done in El Salvador.
Family members from at least two of the slain Jesuits will join the lawsuit later, the groups said.
But a lawyer for the Center for Justice and Accountability told CNN that the most immediate practical effect of the case might be an effective ban on Cristiani and the 14 former officers from leaving El Salvador, for fear of arrest.
For years, the extreme right in El Salvador had accused the Jesuits of siding with the leftist guerrillas, according to a CNN report shortly after the killings.
Uniformed troops were seen searching the living quarters of the priests at Central American University two days before they were killed, CNN reported.
