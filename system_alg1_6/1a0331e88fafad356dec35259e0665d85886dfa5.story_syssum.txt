"This time of war began in Afghanistan, a place that may seem as far from this peaceful bend in the Hudson River as anywhere on Earth," Obama said, referring to a conflict that started after the al Qaeda terror network attacked the United States on September 11, 2001.
He said the United States has helped bring hope and sovereign government to Afghanistan, but "there will be difficult days ahead."
"This is a different kind of war," he said.
The president said America's "strength and resilience" will counter people attempting to sow fear.
"America's Army represents the full breadth of the American experience," with cadets hailing from all walks of life, Obama said.
