The Indonesian and South Korean pairs appealed the decision, the federation said.
"It's not in the spirit of the thing," said Kevin Button of Ashford, in Kent, just outside London.
In the first of the Tuesday matches under scrutiny, Wang and Yu played South Korea's Jung Kyung-eun and Kim Ha-na in a game in which "neither side seemed to be exerting themselves," the official Olympic news service said.
"These players, I feel for them a little bit, because this wasn't their decision; their team has told them to lose these games," he said.
The Chinese Olympic delegation "fully respects the Badminton World Federation's decision to punish" its athletes, it said in a statement.
"As the head coach, I owe the fans and the Chinese an apology," he said, according to the state-run news agency Xinhua.
The game of badminton dates back centuries but has been an Olympic sport only since 1992.
