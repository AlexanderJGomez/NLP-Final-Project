(CNN) -- Nanci Griffith wanted to look on the bright side.
"[The] American people will not let this country collapse," she said.
I [want] my audience to hear these stories," she said.
Things came along like the Mildred and Richard Loving case ("The Loving Kind"), where Mildred died, and I read her obituary.
Griffith: No, never in my life.
CNN: Now, in addition to "The Loving Kind," there are other songs based on actual events on this record.
Griffith: Not really.
Griffith: It's about people like him.
Griffith: I was always more interested in story songs, things with a point of view ... and things that informed me.
When you're writing a personal song like "Rain," it's straight from your heart and seems to just flow.
