Asked which school meals were their favorites, students at a public school in the New York borough of Queens don't say chicken fingers or meatballs.
Active Learning's student body may be more accustomed to vegetarian diets than most, with 85% of the students being Asian and another 10% Hispanic, said Margie Feinberg, spokeswoman for the New York Department of Education.
"We've been working with tofu for a few months," Groff said.
But "the vegetarian menu fits right in with our mission, and we are thrilled that our students in pre-kindergarten all the way up to grade three understand the importance of healthy and nutritious meals," Groff said in a statement.
He hired a school parent as a vegetarian chef to develop the menu and described his school as the vegetarian test kitchen for the city.
