"Emotionally, the remnants of that stay for a long time," she said.
Abuse can influence a victim's future behavior in relationships and even in friendships, depending on whether the victim stays or leaves, said Mark Crawford, a clinical psychologist based in Roswell, Georgia.
"What they need to do when they get out of the relationship is make sure they're aware of their own anger, and then they can learn how to freely express it in a healthy, normal way," he said.
Women who have been abused prior to, but not during, the past five years had depression rates 1Â½ times greater than those without abuse experience, said Bonomi, who has collaborated with Dimer on research on abused women.
About 34 percent of women in the sample said they had been abused.
Some women do feel stronger having been through the experience of abuse, Dimer said.
Calling a domestic violence hot line is a good first step for anyone who is experiencing abuse, Dimer said.
