Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Tribesmen killed five Yemeni soldiers guarding Yemen's strategic Balhaf gas terminal Sunday, two security officials said.
The soldiers were armed but were not able to defend themselves as the attack happened quick and sudden," a security official in the province said.
Hundreds of additional troops were deployed after the terror alert on August 3.
