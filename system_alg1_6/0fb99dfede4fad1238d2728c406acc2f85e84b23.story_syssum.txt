Eric Shanteau said he felt angry when he found out he had testicular cancer.
After weeks of tests to determine the "stage" or spread of the cancer, Shanteau's team of doctors cleared him to compete in the Beijing Olympics, which meant carefully monitoring his tumor but delaying treatment.
Cancer was a motivator, he says, because he knew it meant he could be facing his last competition.
A source of inspiration, he says, were fans who shared their stories of beating cancer.
Shanteau says he experienced no symptoms of cancer and came across the tumor by chance.
Shanteau's father Rick, is battling lung cancer and responding well to treatment.
"But if they feel something [physically] that they don't think should be there, it takes them a year to get to their doctor and that just is not smart.
Later that week, Shanteau's pathology results revealed that the operation removed the most of the cancer.
Eric says the cancer diagnosis gave him a different perspective on life.
As for Shanteau's swimming career, he plans to compete in the 2009 World Swimming Championship in Rome, Italy.
