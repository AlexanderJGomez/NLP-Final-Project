Hong Kong (CNN) -- Pro-democracy activists took their fight Thursday to the doorstep of Hong Kong's chief executive, sitting down outside his office gates to express their dissatisfaction with him and the central government in Beijing.
But tensions have risen after a late August decision giving Beijing control over the slate of Hong Kong chief executive candidates in 2017.
The activists are open to talks with Chinese or other Hong Kong leaders, but not with Leung, one of the movement's figureheads, Lester Shum, said Wednesday.
"More pressure must be put on the government," Cheung said.
Sophie Richardson, from the advocacy group Human Rights Watch, said that Hong Kong authorities have shown restraint, aside from Sunday, isn't surprising.
"Hong Kong has a long history of managing large protests reasonably well," Richardson said.
"We have to keep it peaceful," she said.
Despite the huge turnout on the streets, not everyone in Hong Kong is behind the protest movement.
"Hong Kong should be stable, everything should be stable.
