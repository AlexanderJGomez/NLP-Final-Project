Delayed for months by chaos and conflict, the recovery of wreckage from downed Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 has finally begun in war-torn eastern Ukraine, Dutch officials said Sunday.
Several western nations and the Ukrainian government have accused the pro-Russian separatists operating in the region of shooting down the plane with a missile.
It noted at the time that Dutch investigators still hadn't been able to visit the site amid the unstable situation in eastern Ukraine.
