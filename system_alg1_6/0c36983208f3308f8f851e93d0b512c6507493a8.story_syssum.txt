Hong Kong (CNN) -- The number of Tibetans in China who have set themselves on fire to protest Beijing's rule has reached 100, according to Tibetan advocacy groups.
Self-immolation began as a form of protest among Tibetans in China in February 2009, when a young monk set himself on fire in Aba.
And on Wednesday, a Tibetan man set himself on fire in front of a famous Buddhist shrine in the Nepalese capital of Kathmandu, police said.
It makes centuries-old historical claims on the region.
