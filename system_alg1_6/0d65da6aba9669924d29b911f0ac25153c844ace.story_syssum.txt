Judge William Adams was back working Wednesday at Aransas County after his suspension was lifted by the state's high court, a court clerk said.
Adams was suspended last year after the 2004 video went public.
The video posting said, "Judge William Adams is not fit to be anywhere near the law system if he can't even exercise fit judgment as a parent himself.
Signed, Hillary Adams, his daughter."
William Adams has acknowledged that the man in the video was him.
