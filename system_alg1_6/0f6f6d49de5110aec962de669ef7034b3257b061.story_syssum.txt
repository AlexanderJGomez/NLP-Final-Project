And, to so many over the years who have known my story, I am a man in a race -- a race against illness, against fear, against discrimination.
A race against time.
Certainly, the race has never been easy.
No color can adequately define a mosaic, any more than one hardship, failure or achievement can define a person's life.
I run to make life matter, seeking more than the right way to go, but actually going there and watching the race mean something.
