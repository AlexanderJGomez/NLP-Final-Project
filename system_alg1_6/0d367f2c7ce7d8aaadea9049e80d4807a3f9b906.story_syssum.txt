It's not?
This year for old times' sake we revived our game, only doing the best actor category because it's been an impossibly full year of great male lead performances that have stumped the prognosticators.
But did anyone ever imagine that betting against Mr. Oscars himself, Tom Hanks, could pay off?
I haven't missed an Oscars since I got hooked as a teen.
I've attended the Oscars, been inside the crimson cocoon, felt the collective shock when "Shakespeare In Love" beat "Saving Private Ryan" for Best Picture.
If you are not in our little club, I get where you're coming from.
Plus, there's red carpet fatigue, as the Oscars limp on high heels to the finish line of a bloated awards season as overextended as Christmas and the NFL.
Will I sound like I'm on the Academy's payroll if I argue that the Oscars really are a great national tradition?
Dutifully filling out the ballots at your friend's Oscars party even if the only movie you saw that year starred Adam Sandler.
The knowing that it's all too much, but the kind of too much that some of us just can't get enough of.
