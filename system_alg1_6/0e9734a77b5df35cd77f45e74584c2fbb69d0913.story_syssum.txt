"Each awards show has a different personality style-wise, and people have learned to dress accordingly," said Sarah Bernard, host of "The Thread" on Yahoo!
The Academy Awards calls for classic, formal attire, she said, but celebrities can have a little more fun with the Golden Globes, the Screen Actors Guild Awards and the Grammy Awards, which allow for edgier ensembles.
It's about wearing something flattering in a style you love, said the new mom, who hasn't outfitted anyone this awards season.
"The red carpet is a very intense situation, and you want to be comfortable out there," Chavez said.
Even for the Academy Awards, which calls for mostly floor-length gowns, "shoes are still in the game," she said.
And with so much focus on the dress, shoes become a way for celebrities to experiment, and maybe take a fashion risk.
The saturated, rich jewel tones are all over the red carpet this season, like the jade green Oscar de la Renta dress Emily Blunt wore to the SAG Awards, or the fuchsia Marchesa gown Sofia Vergara donned the same night.
Chavez said she expects to see a mix of vibrant, nude and sherbet colors take over at the Academy Awards.
In the end, any celebrity can end up on a list of best- or worst-dressed stars.
