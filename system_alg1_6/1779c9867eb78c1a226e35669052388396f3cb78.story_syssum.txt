Austrian State Prosecutor Gerhard Sedlacek told CNN Thursday that Josef Fritzl, 73, was charged with murder because one of the seven children died in infancy.
Fritzl kept the daughter and all but three of the children in a cellar beneath his home in Amstetten, Austria, west of Vienna, officials say.
Three of the children lived upstairs in the home Fritzl shared with his wife and several of their own children.
Fritzl's daughter and her children have since been receiving counseling although doctors warn that they will take years to recover.
