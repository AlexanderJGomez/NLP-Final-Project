And this is not the first time this year that a Washington political impasse has threatened negative economic repercussions.
At the core of the current troubles is not just growing polarization between Democrats and Republicans, but significant intra-party divisions too.
The perception, in many foreign capitals, is that growing partisanship is also infecting U.S. foreign policy.
With uncertainty growing, the only sure thing is that default would send seismic economic and political shockwaves across the globe.
