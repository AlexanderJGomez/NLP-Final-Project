(CNN) -- As we gear up for the 71st annual Golden Globe Awards on Sunday, allow us to turn the focus to the real winners of the show: besties Tina Fey and Amy Poehler.
In addition to being one of the stars of the late-night comedy show, the show's creator and producer Lorne Michaels hired Fey as a writer in 1995, and she would later become the show's first female head writer.
She may be a celeb, but Poehler isn't too big to take it to YouTube with her Amy Poehler's Smart Girls series, where she interviews interesting women and answers questions from fans.
But while Fey has two daughters, Poehler has two sons.
The Golden Globes organizers were smart enough to lock Fey and Poehler in to a two-year contract to host the show.
