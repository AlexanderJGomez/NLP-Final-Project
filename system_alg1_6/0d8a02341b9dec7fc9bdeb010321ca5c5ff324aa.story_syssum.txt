Now Jay-Z charts his escape from the hard-knock life, describes the reunion that healed the wounds of his childhood -- and even reveals his personal creed.
Jay-Z spoke with Oprah Winfrey about his father, his anger and his old life.
Never wanting to let myself get close to someone like that again.
Jay-Z: We were told our parents would separate, but the reasons weren't explained.
Jay-Z: Yeah.
Jay-Z: It made me not express my feelings as much.
Oprah: I've read that when you were 12, you shot your brother in the shoulder.
Jay-Z: My mom set up a meeting.
Jay-Z: And I guess from that point, she figured out what was wrong with me, and she planned a meeting between me and my father.
Jay-Z: I never looked at that.
Jay-Z: I believed that.
Jay-Z: He showed up.
I'm like, "I was a kid!
You can't do that."
Jay-Z: He was broken.
Jay-Z: Pretty much.
Jay-Z: Now I'm having an aha moment!
Jay-Z: As a kid, I didn't know any better.
Jay-Z: All the time.
