Spanish National Police said Friday they have seized hundreds of kilograms of cocaine in an operation that they said thwarted an attempt by Mexican drug dealers allied with the Sinaloa drug cartel to establish a foothold in Europe.
The bulk of the investigation unfolded in the United States, where U.S. agents discovered that cartel members were planning to travel to Spain, a trip that occurred the following March, the statement said.
The four men, aged 37 to 52, were arrested near their hotels in Madrid, it said.
If indeed "Chapo" Guzman's cousin was among the men arrested, "that is a big deal," said Beith, whose books "The Last Narco" and "Hasta El Ultimo Dia," focus on the Mexican drug war.
