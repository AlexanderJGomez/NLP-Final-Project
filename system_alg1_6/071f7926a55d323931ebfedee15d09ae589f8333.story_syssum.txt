(CNN) -- Things are looking horrible for President Barack Obama.
Simply put: Obama is not the protagonist driving his own story.
Perhaps the worst thing about the problems with the Obamacare website is that they occurred at a time when things were finally looking politically brighter for Obama.
It looked as if Obama had righted his ship and would be able to refocus Americans on his priorities.
First, Obama should announce that retaking control of the House in 2014 is a top priority.
Unseating some tea party House members has become newly possible after the shutdown mess.
Sure, the Republicans will push back -- they will say Obama is behaving like a "king" or "tyrant" and complain about him nightly on Fox News.
Obama is the star of this movie.
