(CNN) -- With ticket sales closing in on $100 million, the surprise hit of the year is "The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel," a film about seven English retirees who travel to India to take up residence at the rundown Marigold Hotel, which, according to its misleading brochures, will provide them with inexpensive comfort in their remaining years.
In this case, however, the Forester novel with which "Marigold Hotel" has the most in common is his 1924 masterpiece, "Passage to India."
In "Marigold Hotel," the English retirees find a gentleness in the city of Jaipur that was not present in their homeland.
But the "Marigold Hotel" does not need to offer they-lived-happily-ever-after reassurance to succeed.
