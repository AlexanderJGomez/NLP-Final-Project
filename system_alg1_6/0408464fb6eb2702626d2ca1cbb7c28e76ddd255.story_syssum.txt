We set Baltimore on fire this time.
We let the violence stand for everything that's wrong with the things we already didn't like.
To which the only real answer can be: Stop kidding yourself.
Well, if I -- a son of immigrants whose family had nothing to do with any of those accomplishments -- if I get to claim those aspects of American history, then surely I have to claim the unsavory aspects too.
We created a polity in which racial inequity and economic inequality magnify each other unrelentingly.
No, we own them all.
And we all have to face that before we can fix anything in Baltimore or beyond.
Liberals gravitate on social media to commentaries or reactions that reinforce this frame, like the surprisingly astute comments from the Baltimore Orioles executive who spelled out why a long history of racial injustice and economic disenfranchisement made rioting nearly inevitable.
But it cannot possibly be that only those with whom I disagree are responsible for what is happening in Baltimore.
Because we are.
And there is no other "we" waiting in the wings.
