London, England (CNN) -- Whether in the form of personal history or political biography, Jung Chang has spent her writerly life telling the story of China's tumultuous recent past.
CNN caught up with Chang, who currently lives in London, and asked her about China and why it's so important to remember the past.
And then with Mao, there is still a lot of myth about him perpetuated in China today.
CNN: Your books are banned in China.
Hong Kong is still largely separate from mainland China, which is wonderful from my point of view as a writer.
People are under the impression that China is what it is today because Mao had laid the foundation.

JC: If there isn't anything dramatic happening, I think the country will probably go on as it is for a very long time.
China -- as a culture, as a people -- is something that I care about.
