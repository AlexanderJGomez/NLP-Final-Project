"Prius drivers like the video-game challenge of continuously trying to best your own fuel economy achievements," said Brinley.

But almost 30 percent of Challenger buyers are Gen X or Gen Y.
Markwalder states, "The R-Class has always been a contradiction, looking like a minivan but not delivering on functionality."
Brinley adds, "It's an old person's cars, with only four-percent of its buyers from Gen Y."
