Sara is a 115-pound federally protected loggerhead sea turtle who, if not for sheer luck, would be dead today.
The shooting of the turtle had to be deliberate, said Rich Moretti, who runs the Turtle Hospital in Marathon.
He said he does not believe whoever shot the turtle was from the Keys.
Sara is a young turtle, about 12 years old.
The staff at the Turtle Hospital sees many accidental injuries, "animals tied up in fishing line or hit by a boat," Moretti said.
