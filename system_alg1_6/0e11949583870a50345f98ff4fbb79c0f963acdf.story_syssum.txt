(CNN) -- Former Baltimore Orioles "Iron man" Cal Ripken Jr. said Friday that his 74-year-old mother is doing well after being abducted by a gunman last week, but he thinks the kidnapping might have been premeditated.
Police in Aberdeen, Maryland, said a man with a gun showed up at her home between 7 and 8 a.m. Tuesday, and then forced her into her vehicle and drove off.
He also said police don't know of any relationship between the suspect and the Ripken family.
Cal Ripken Jr. achieved stardom as a shortstop and third baseman with the Baltimore Orioles and is a member of baseball's Hall of Fame.
