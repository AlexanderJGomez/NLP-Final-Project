Workers at Shengzhou Stove Manufacturers prepare wood-burning stoves for firing.
Shen's factory began producing the new wood-burning stoves last year.
According to the World Health Organization, about half the world still cooks with biomass or coal, using open fires or traditional stoves.
The stoves reduce the use of wood for fuel by up to 50 percent, and cut carbon monoxide emissions by up to 70 percent compared to a traditional fire.
