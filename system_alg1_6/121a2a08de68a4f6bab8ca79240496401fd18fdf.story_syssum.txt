Dhoni, who made his debut in 2005, captained India in 60 of his 90 Test matches but decided to quit on Tuesday following the draw with Australia in Melbourne which meant his side conceded the series.
His decision comes just weeks ahead of the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand where India will defend its one-day crown.
During his 90-match Test career, Dhoni scored 4,876 runs at an average of 38.09, while his highest score of 224 came against Australia in February 2013.
Dhoni replaced Anil Kumble as captain in 2008 after guiding India to victory in the very first World Twenty20 title the previous year.
Dhoni has excelled in the one-day game having made 250 appearances for India.
He has scored 8,192 runs at an average of 52.85.
