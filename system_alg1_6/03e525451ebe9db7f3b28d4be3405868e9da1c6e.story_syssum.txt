The United States and Iran, sworn enemies for 35 years, are talking about working together to quell the al Qaeda-inspired insurgency sweeping northern Iraq.
Only the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and its al Qaeda backers would want that, it seems.
Then, the United States and Iran held "very brief discussions" about Iraq and the threat posed by ISIS on the sidelines of nuclear negotiations in Vienna, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said.
Even a conservative member of Congress who once advocated military strikes on Iran said Washington may need Tehran's help.
Whether the United States likes it or not, working with Iran on the Iraq crisis might be a necessary evil, retired Maj. Gen. James "Spider" Marks said.
House Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday that the United States should "absolutely not" talk to Iranians about the  Iraq crisis.
A Pentagon spokesman said Monday that military coordination with Iran was not in the cards, similar to what the senior State Department official told CNN.
