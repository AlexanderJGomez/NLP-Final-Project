We spent some time testing and touching the new iPad Mini and iPad Air after Tuesday's press conference.
The iPad 2 kept its number and a spot in stores, where its slightly lower price tag (now $399) might appeal to someone considering a cheaper Android or Windows tablet.
Unfortunately, I didn't have an older iPad on hand to do a weight comparison, and I'd picked up an iPad Mini first.
The iPad Mini got its first upgrade since it was first launched one year ago.
Like the iPad Air, the iPad Mini with Retina has the A7 chip inside.
Though other products can usually be had for much less, any hands-on time with Apple products remind you that one of their greatest selling points is solid, high-quality construction.
Faster processors gobble up more battery power, so maintaining 10 hours of battery life from an old tablet to a new tablet probably requires battery improvements.
According to Forrester analyst Sarah Rotman Epps, replacement tablet sales are growing faster than new new tablet sales worldwide.
