(CNN) -- No one may ever know for sure whether Ohio's execution of Dennis McGuire -- in a procedure during which he reportedly gasped, snorted and struggled -- was inhumane, but his family and medical and legal experts said Friday the ordeal points out fundamental flaws in the use of lethal injection.
He said the family plans to file a lawsuit next week in federal court seeking an injunction against the state's use of the drug combination, alleging that it represents cruel and unusual punishment and, as such, violates the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution.
"The family will be satisfied if this process stops," Rion said.
"What happened to Dennis McGuire is consistent with what a number of prominent medical experts said would happen," she said.
Previously, Ohio used a single drug, pentobarbital, for many of its executions, but the manufacturer has said it did not want its product to be used in executions and the state's stockpiles of the drug had expired, Dieter said.
And then that's all."
"None of these compounds are intended for the purpose of executing people," he said.
The compounds used by Ohio are in short supply, and their diversion from use in treating people to use in execution is questionable, he said.
"I think they take about 10 seconds," he said.
