By sheer numbers, the Google Books project has been a huge success.
"As we have long said, Google Books is in compliance with copyright law and acts like a card catalog for the digital age, giving users the ability to find books to buy or borrow," said a Google spokesperson.
He said the Google Books program provided benefits to the public.
The books scanned are also primarily nonfiction titles, which have less copyright protection than fiction.
