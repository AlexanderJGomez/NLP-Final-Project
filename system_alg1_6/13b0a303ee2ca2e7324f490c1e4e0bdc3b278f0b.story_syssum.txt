Students, teachers and even administrators were to stay inside; no excuses, no exceptions.
Cananea, in the state of Sonora, just south of Arizona, was back then a quiet town where one could leave doors unlocked without fear.
I had no idea who the man was.
Until then, the PRI (Institutional Revolutionary Party) had ruled Mexico with an iron fist for nearly 60 years and it would remain in power for another 12.
No restaurant would serve him and his people.
That year in July, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the PRI's candidate, won the presidency in one of the most controversial elections in Mexican history.
It was the first time in 71 years that Mexico was going to be governed by a party that was not the PRI.
And so Enrique Pena Nieto, a charismatic attorney and former governor of Mexico state, the most populous state in the country and adjacent to Mexico City, won the election this year.
The good news is that, as I said before, much has changed in Mexico.
The bad news is that much in Mexico hasn't changed since 1988.
Or will Pena Nieto and his party capitalize on this historic opportunity to break with old habits of the past for the benefit of the country?
