Romero, who described her recovery as a "miracle" from God, said she was ready to do whatever she could to help others infected with Ebola.
Romero spent 30 days at the Carlos III Hospital in Madrid, the same hospital where she contracted the illness while helping to care for an infected missionary who had been brought back from West Africa.
Now, Romero said, she needs to be left in peace to rest and recuperate.
As a childless couple, the dog "was the son we never had," Limon said.
Ramon said that through Romero's case, the hospital had learned many lessons about the treatment of patients with Ebola and how to protect the staff caring for them.
