Cosby and his attorneys are not going quietly into the good night.
A demurrer essentially says the complaint is so defective as written, that it should be dismissed His attorneys have also gone on the offensive, asking the court to impose sanctions against the attorneys who filed this lawsuit.
Huth filed her complaint long after the time permitted by the statute of limitations.
Accordingly, some jurisdictions have special rules extending the time to file in cases of childhood sexual abuse.
Cosby's attorneys correctly point out that Huth failed to file the requisite certificates, which exposes the complaint itself to attack.
That's why a plaintiff is prohibited under the rules from identifying the defendant by name until the court gives permission.
She didn't.
The court of public opinion will likely ignore these violations as technicalities, and continue to judge, and condemn Cosby.
But, under the rules of the Superior Court of California, this complaint should be dismissed.
