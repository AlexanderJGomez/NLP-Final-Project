Washington (CNN) -- Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin is two for two.
The Ryan Express chugged into the White House on Thursday with other House Republican leaders where he again waited for his opportunity to make an impact.
Though they did talk by phone on Friday and agreed talks should go on.
Ryan and Obama, on the other hand, have a completely different relationship.
Ryan is steeped in fiscal matters as chairman of the House Budget Committee.
CNN's Gloria Borger put it this way: Ryan and President Obama have a "preexisting condition."
It was the first time Obama and Ryan had sat down together since the presidential race.
Obama later complimented Ryan, saying, "I think Paul Ryan is a pretty sincere guy and has a beautiful family."
