Julian Torrico, a peasant leader, said he and other Morales supporters will storm the eastern city of Santa Cruz if the talks, which started Thursday, do not yield progress.
The government of Evo Morales took power by a majority and now these opposition governors don't want to let him govern," Torrico said.
Morales, an ally of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and former Cuban President Fidel Castro, said the moves could cause Bolivia to disintegrate.
Morales has said the opposition leaders are trying to overthrow the government.
Ivan Canelas, a government spokesman, said the talks provide a critical opportunity to break an impasse that has split the country for months.
He said the goal is to "give peace back to our country and give certainty to Bolivia."
