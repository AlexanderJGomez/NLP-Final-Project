"We're trying to get this child buried with dignity and respect," said Tony Herbert, a spokesman for Dobson.

On January 7, during subfreezing temperatures, King told police she allegedly locked the child, wearing only a T-shirt and shorts, outside on a balcony from 20 minutes to an hour, the complaint said.
King told authorities that the boy was "being very difficult eating and that the last full meal he ate was on December 26, 2013; after that he would only pick at his food," the complaint said.
"Each one of these tragedies, it's our job to try to stop," he said.
