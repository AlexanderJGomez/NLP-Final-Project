That decision prompted a response from the family of Eric Harris, the man Bates killed.
Bates, 73, was working as a reserve deputy for the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office on April 2 when he was involved the arrest of Eric Harris in a weapons sting operation.
Over the weekend, one of Bates' lawyers released most of his training documents and said they prove Bates had proper law enforcement training.
