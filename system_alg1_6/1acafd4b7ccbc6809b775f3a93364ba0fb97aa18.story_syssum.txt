A Florida judge Friday sentenced Michael Dunn to life in prison without parole for the 2012 shooting death of 17-year-old Jordan Davis.
"Mr. Dunn, your life is effectively over," Healey said.
Outside court, Davis' father, Ron Davis, said the judge sent a strong message.
"I did what I thought I had to do," Dunn said.
She said she forgave Dunn.
Davis said he life was changed forever.
...
"For me to forgive you, you have to have remorse," he said.
Dunn has said he shot at the vehicle because he thought Davis had a weapon and feared for his life, but the prosecution said Dunn was the aggressor and pointed out that he kept firing even after the teens fled.
He returned to his hotel, ordered pizza, walked his dog and went to sleep.
