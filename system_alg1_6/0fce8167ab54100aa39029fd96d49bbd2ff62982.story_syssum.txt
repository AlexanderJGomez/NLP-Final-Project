Thomas Murray says doctors have responsibility for welfare of children conceived through IVF procedure.
What this case really does is split wide open a fault line running through infertility treatment in American medicine.
The point of infertility treatment, after all, is to create a child.
What happens if a woman in her early 30s with six children wants eight embryos implanted all at once?
Carrying more than a couple of fetuses is dangerous to the pregnant woman and to the health and survival of the fetuses in her womb.
The American Society for Reproductive Medicine acknowledged in a 2004 report that fertility programs may withhold services when they can provide "well-substantiated judgments" that the child will not receive adequate care.
Providers can abdicate almost all responsibility to anticipate the welfare of the children they help create by claiming "an obligation to treat all patients who would benefit from medical treatment."
