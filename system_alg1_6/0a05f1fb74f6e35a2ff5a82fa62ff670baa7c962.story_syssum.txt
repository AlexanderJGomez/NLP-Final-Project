The man -- named by British media as UBS trader Kweku Adoboli -- was held on suspicion of fraud in an early-morning operation in London's banking district hours before the loss was announced on Thursday, officers said.
The bank is large enough to take a $2 billion hit, experts said.
Its review of UBS will focus on "ongoing weaknesses in the group's risk management and controls" as revealed by the reported loss, Moody's said in a statement.
The European Central Bank, along with the Fed, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the Swiss National Bank, said three U.S. dollar auctions would be held to help out European banks that need the currency to fund loans and repay debt.
"Trading has been incredibly difficult over the last year," said van Dam.
But the "unauthorized trading by a trader in its investment bank" could cause UBS to post a loss in the third quarter of this year, it said.
UBS is not likely to collapse, but the scandal could prompt the bank to split its investment bank into a separate company, van Dam said.
"The banks are too large," van Dam said.
