"In light of the MH17 incident, Malaysia Airlines will be waiving any change fees for passengers who wish to make changes to their itinerary to any MH destinations," said the airline in a statement.
Shortly after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 went missing in March, the carrier renamed the flight MH318.
Rival airline Singapore Airlines apologized on Sunday for what many social media users said was an insensitive series of tweets and Facebook postings relating to its own flight path.
