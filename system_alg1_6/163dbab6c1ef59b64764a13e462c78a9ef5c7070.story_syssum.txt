The draw sees Milan stay in second spot, one point behind champions Inter, who were held to a 1-1 draw at Palermo on Saturday.
Napoli, who are still chasing a Champions League place, had chances to reclaim the lead and home keeper Abbiati had to show his mettle either side of the break.
Sampdoria later completed a miserable week for Juventus with a 1-0 home win in the battle for the final Champions League spot.
