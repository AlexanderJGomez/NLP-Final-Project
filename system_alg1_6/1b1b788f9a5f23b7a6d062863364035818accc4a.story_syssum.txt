(CNN)So now the real trial is underway: What does the surviving Boston Marathon bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, deserve and why?
Cruelty really provides us a lens into the worst of the worst of the worst.
Tsarnaev may take the stand to beg for mercy, but only if he now feels or at least can fake remorse.
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was the lesser of two evils, the defense will insist over and over.
In 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the death penalty for those younger than 18 when they killed, repeatedly quoting an article by psychologists Laurence Steinberg and Elizabeth Scott.
Confronted by surviving victims and images of their dead loved ones, hearing offsetting pleas to "move on," balancing the real suffering in the courtroom against the  imagined punishment of life that awaits Tsarnaev, I expect the jury will vote 10-2 (or 9-3) for death.
Why?
