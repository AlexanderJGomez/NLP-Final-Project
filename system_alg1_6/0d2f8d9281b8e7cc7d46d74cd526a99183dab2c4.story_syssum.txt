(CNN) -- Spending 24 hours in Le Mans is not for the faint-hearted.
He finished 15th overall on Sunday in his first Le Mans race since 2001, competing alongside his son Alex on Father's Day.

The potential rewards for car manufacturers at Le Mans are no less significant.

Le Mans is a brilliant event to "endure" with relish -- but perhaps it's a relief that it comes but once a year.
