"Jacques Cousteau changed the way ocean exploration was done," said Eric Stackpole, who along with partner David Lang is behind a submersible robotic watercraft -- sort of an underwater drone -- that could open a whole new world of undersea exploration.
"R-O-V stands for remotely operated vehicle" Stackpole said.
This affordability is how Stackpole and Lang hope to bring OpenROV to the masses, turning average people into Cousteau-like undersea adventurers.
That's not something that I get to do,' " Lang said, "I think that's what we're trying to instill back in everyone."
"
"We have people from well over 50 countries in our community who can all contribute to how to make the design better and how to use it better," Stackpole said.
"OpenROV is an open-source community," Stackpole said.
And our answer certainly is, 'both,' " Stackpole said.
