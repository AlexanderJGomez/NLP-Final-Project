(CNN) -- Congolese rebels took control of the eastern city of Goma and part of the border with Rwanda on Tuesday after days of heavy clashes, a Congolese reporter there said.
An M23 rebel spokesman, calling his group the Revolutionary Army of Congo, went on the radio Tuesday afternoon to address the people of Goma.
Any remaining pockets of the army should join the rebels or the M23 will fight against them, Kazarama said.
Soldiers from the M23 group were part of the national army as part of peace negotiations brokered in 2009.
The United Nations and some donor countries have accused neighboring Rwanda of backing the M23 rebel group by providing it with arms, support and even soldiers.
Rwanda will not engage in any talks with M23, Mushikiwabo said.
