NASCAR driver Carl Edwards grew up in Columbia, Missouri.
But through all of the excitement and acclaim, Edwards remains grounded and true to his Missouri roots.
The park boasts 15 miles of trails and endless possibilities for adventure, from hiking and biking to canoeing and even cave exploration.
Edwards says it's one of the oldest in the state and thinks that it is one of the coolest spots along the trail.
For what he calls the best burger in the world, he heads to Booches Billiard Hall, one of his high school hangouts.
These are just some of the hidden gems of Carl Edwards' Columbia, but this town has much more to offer.
It's a perfect weekend getaway from its larger surrounding cities.
