The glasses can be adjusted to the right strength by the wearer without the need to visit an optometrist.
His self-refraction glasses mean people can correct their vision without needing an optometrist (see Fact Box).
He told CNN that about 80 percent of those who try the glasses are able to correct their vision, but there are limitations.
Silver estimates that one billion people in the developing world don't have access to the glasses they need, and he has said that he would like to see all of them wearing glasses by 2020.
Silver says far more research is needed before those one billion people get their glasses, but he sees his self-refraction technology as a step toward that goal.
There's an immense amount of interest in solving it and self-refraction is one route that can assist with that."
