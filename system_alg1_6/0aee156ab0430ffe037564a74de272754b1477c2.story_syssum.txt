William Earl Lynd was the first inmate to die by injection since September, when the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to consider whether the three-drug combination represented cruel and unusual punishment.
Georgia became the first state to resume executions since the court validated the lethal injection process last month with a ruling in a Kentucky case.
In the Georgia case, Lynd was convicted of fatally shooting his girlfriend, Virginia "Ginger" Moore, in Berrien County in 1988.
As the sentence was being carried out, about 20 opponents of the death penalty prayed and sang songs outside the prison, located 45 minutes south of Atlanta, said Laura Moye, chairwoman of Georgians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty.
"We're here to express our opposition to the state of Georgia taking human life on behalf of U.S. citizens of Georgia," she said.
There have been 40 executions in the state since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, ruling in a Georgia case.
If she is executed, she would be the first woman put to death in three years.
