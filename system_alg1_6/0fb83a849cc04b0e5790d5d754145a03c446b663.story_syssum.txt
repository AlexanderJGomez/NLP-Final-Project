The case of Chandra Levy, a 24-year-old Washington intern whose body was found in a Washington park in 2002, is back in court, but the actions of a D.C. Superior Court judge have given it a mysterious air.
Carome predicted the secrecy surrounding hearings in the Levy case could last months.
Despite Fisher's restrictions on information, CNN has learned some key details of these unexpected hearings from Carome and court papers.
Two women testified that Guandique attacked them in the same park.
The Levy case generated a swarm of media coverage in 2001 and 2002, in part because it was revealed that she had had an affair with Gary Condit, then a U.S. congressman from California.
Robert Levy said he's concerned that something will happen with Guandique's conviction, and "we don't like that it's all coming up again."
