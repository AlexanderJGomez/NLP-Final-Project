Corruption accounts for a loss of about 2% of Morocco's GDP, officials have said.
The king is widely revered in Morocco, yet many Moroccans are skeptical about whether real reforms will be implemented in a new political landscape he hopes to unveil in mid-June, after a special constitutional commission finalizes its work on the blueprint.
"The main areas of concern when we talk about corruption in Morocco are the judiciary, police and hospitals," Transparency International's local chief Rachid Filali Meknassi said.
Despite numerous reports commissioned by the government on corruption in the judiciary, along with the establishment of an anti-fraud body and a special "accountability" court, not one prosecution has been processed against a judge.
"We want a new constitution, which will define exactly what the new rules and regulations are in place to stop corruption," explained Said Benjebli, one of the movement's architects who edits the main Facebook page.
