Gina, the owner of a busy graphic design firm, started giving herself -- and her employees -- four-day workweeks after she had knee surgery and found it tough to get around.
By most accounts, the American workweek is now at its most saturated: Nearly 86% of American men and 67% of women work more than 40 hours in any given week, in the name of productivity, financial necessity and, according to at least one study, happiness.
In fact, 44% of female doctors now work four or fewer days a week, up from 29% in 2005.
Many have argued for the four-day workweek, or flexible hours in general, as a way to retain talented female workers who might otherwise quit altogether in order to have children.
Though unlikely to affect higher-ups like Mendelsohn, the four-day week tends to work best when the entire office is involved.
One reason many employees may feel reluctant to take on a four-day week is because of the fear of "missing out" on access to the boss or to the flow of ideas and information.
Three years later, Gina's knee is healed but the four-day workweek remains.
"I'm sure that can't account for all the growth," Gina said.
