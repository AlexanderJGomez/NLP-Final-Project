Her name is Nway, and that's how she looked when aid workers found her after Nargis destroyed her isolated village.
A year later, an aid worker returned to the village to see how Nway was doing.
Pam Sitko, the aid worker, said Nway -- like thousands of people in Myanmar -- is slowly recovering one year after Nargis demolished their country.
"Most of the people are going back to their livelihoods," Marina said.
That hope appears to have spread to Nway.
The pair joined a group squeezed in to the village headman's house to survive, Sitko said.
Nway wouldn't talk about the cyclone after aid workers found her a month later.
Nway told Sitko that she's made "four new best friends."
Nway doesn't know, though, where she would attend school as she gets older, Sitko said.
The shocked girl who aid workers met a year ago has changed, Sitko said.
I think she's been really transformed by our experience."
