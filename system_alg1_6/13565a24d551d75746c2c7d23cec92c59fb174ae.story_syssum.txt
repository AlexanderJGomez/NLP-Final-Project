(CNN)Just over a month ago, Kamron Taylor sat in an Illinois courtroom to hear a jury convict him of murder.
Looking for Taylor is job No.
No.
By then, Taylor was gone.
Taylor walked out the door and into the detention center's parking lot, where, authorities said, he clicked the correctional officer's key fob to find the Chevy Equinox.
After the verdict was read, Taylor sat down, looked back, then got up and ran, according to The Daily Journal in Kankakee.
