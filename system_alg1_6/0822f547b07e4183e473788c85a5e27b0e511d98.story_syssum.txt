In particular, one area where life seems to be imitating art is the fledgling field of 'swarm robotics', in which scientists are creating teams of robots that can work together toward a single goal -- from mending a leak to clearing mines -- with minimal or no input from humans.
At the moment researchers are still working to make teams of robots complete more basic tasks.
That's important because it means the robot may not need any memory, and possibly not even a processing unit, so this technology could work for nanoscale robots -- for example in medical applications."
Other researchers are investigating ways to use swarming robots in diagnosis, so that problems are detected before they become life threatening.
The Israeli Defense Force is also investigating how one can use miniature robotic mosquitoes in the same context."
