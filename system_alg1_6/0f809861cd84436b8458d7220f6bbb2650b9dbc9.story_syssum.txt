The father, Justin Ross Harris, has pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and second-degree child cruelty.
Police in Cobb County, just outside Atlanta, have been tight-lipped and haven't said whether what they found on the computer is one of the reasons they arrested Harris.
Harris, who worked as a web designer, has been placed on unpaid administrative leave, she said.
On the day Cooper died, Harris stopped for breakfast at a fast-food restaurant and afterward strapped his son into a rear-facing child restraint seat on his SUV's back seat, police said.
But that day, police said, Harris left him in the car seat.
The organization says its tally is likely incomplete and much lower than the real toll.
Another, set up at YouCaring.com, has raised more than $22,000 for the Harris family.
As Harris sits in jail, his wife, Leanna, would not discuss the case with the media.
