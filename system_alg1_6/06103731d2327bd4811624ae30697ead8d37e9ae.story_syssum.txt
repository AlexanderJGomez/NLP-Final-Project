At the same time, what was once one of the highest-rated dramas on TV, "Heroes," progressively lost viewers, ending its run on NBC after four seasons.
But that doesn't mean that networks are giving up on the genre: two more series, one with a caped crusader and another about a superheroic family are coming soon.
Executive producer Brian Peterson said, "[Series creators Al Gough and Miles Millar] created a world you could see walking into every week.
Another show that hopes to emphasize the humanity in the superhuman (without costumes as well) is ABC's new series "No Ordinary Family" (premiering September 28).
"The first season should feel like the first act of a superhero movie," said "Family" producer Zack Estrin.
Tim Kring, who created the NBC series "Heroes,"  certainly agrees about making the characters relatable.
"There was that kind of transparency between your life and characters on the show.
Actor Dorian Missick described the show as being "in the tradition of crime drama that just takes place in this fantastic world.
He's quite suited for the role, having had a hand in the TV series "Lost" and "Heroes."
If you don't care about characters, you're not gonna care about the show.
So, for an up-and-coming series like "The Cape," the villains were seen as extremely important.
"No Ordinary Family" producers hinted that the family will come up against a major villain as the first season goes along as well.
When asked to share advice for producers of superhero programs like Wheeler, Estrin and Feldman, "Heroes'" Kring said, "My advice would be stay away from time travel."
