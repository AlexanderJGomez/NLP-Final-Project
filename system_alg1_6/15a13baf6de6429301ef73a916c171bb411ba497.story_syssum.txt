(CNN) -- A smoky fire broke out aboard an empty Japan Airlines 787 Dreamliner in Boston on Monday in the latest glitch for the much-heralded Boeing model.
Everyone had disembarked when the fire was discovered, the airline said.
Monday's incident is not the first mechanical problem for the 787 series, which was delivered to airlines starting in 2011 after years of manufacturing delays and cost overruns.
In December, another relatively new 787 operated by United Airlines diverted safely to New Orleans after experiencing mechanical problems.
Boeing said it was investigating the incident and noted it was too early to draw any parallels.
"It's one of our 'most wanted list' issues, fire in transportation," Eric Weiss, a board spokesman, said.
