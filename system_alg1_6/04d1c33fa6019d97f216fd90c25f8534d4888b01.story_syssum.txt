Gamez was inspired to dream up his list of goals after watching MTV's "The Buried Life", a reality TV show about four friends who set out to accomplish the tasks on their joint bucket list.
Gamez said he tuned in every week, but he knew he wanted to live his own version of "The Buried Life" five minutes in to the first episode.
"[The guys on the show] inspired me and they pushed me to [go skydiving]," he said.
"The more I watch 'The Buried Life' and the more I've seen them experience things, the more I've wanted to do it," Megan Fulton said.
The loss prompted Fulton and her friends to create a bucket list made up of kind gestures, long-term goals, personal achievements and travel destinations.
One of Fulton's favorite aspects of the show is that every time the cast members cross something off their bucket list, they help a stranger accomplish one of his or her own goals.
Just one bucket list wasn't enough for 21-year-old Kevin Cheaney.
"You might think [a bucket list is] just a list of goals, but if you're really thinking about things you want to see, experience and feel before you die, then the whole concept of setting goals is totally different," Chua said.
That's why he's not ending his "buried life" with skydiving, which he said he would do again in a heartbeat, by the way.
"I'm hooked," he said.
