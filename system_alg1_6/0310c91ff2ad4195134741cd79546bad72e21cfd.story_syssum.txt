What Awuah wanted to begin was to create a university in his native Ghana, a state-of-the-art education hub that would help educate the country's next generation of leaders.
"Africa needs to have a renaissance," says Awuah, as he explains what drove him to take the risky decision.
Awuah, who grew up in Accra, left Ghana in 1985 to pursue his own education in the United States.
"I won't lie to you -- it was tough," says Awuah.
Awuah says the university brings together a diverse mix of students from different backgrounds, including scholarship-winning undergraduates from humble beginnings who are the first in their families to attend college.
Looking ahead, Awuah says he hopes Africa's universities will cultivate a new generation of bold and innovative leaders, helping the continent to transform itself.
