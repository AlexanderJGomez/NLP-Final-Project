The Pentagon unveiled plans Tuesday for fully integrating women into front-line and special combat roles, including elite forces such as Army Rangers and Navy SEALs.
Despite the past official ban on combat, some women who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan found themselves in firefights.

"I just want to see what happens," he said.
In many cases Congress would be notified.
