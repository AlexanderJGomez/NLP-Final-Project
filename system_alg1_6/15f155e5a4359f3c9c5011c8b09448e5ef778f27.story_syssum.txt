Pierson walked into Arapahoe High School carrying a shotgun and made no attempt to hide it, Robinson said.
I said, 'They are shooting in the school.'"
In addition to the shotgun, authorities found two Molotov cocktails inside the school, Robinson said.
While authorities hunted for the student gunman inside the school, students were locked in their classrooms.
Leytoldt said she was in yoga class and that her teacher told all the students to get into a closet to protect them.
They soon heard people yelling, and walkie-talkies crackling, and then they heard police asking someone to drop the gun, put the gun down, and hold his arms up, she said.
Within about 14 minutes of the initial report, "we had information on the radio that my deputies believed they had the shooter down inside the school," Robinson said.
