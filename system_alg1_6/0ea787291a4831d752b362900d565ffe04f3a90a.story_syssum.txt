(CNN) -- Lionel Messi scored his 91st and final goal of 2012 on Saturday as Barcelona enjoyed a comfortable 3-1 win over Real Valladolid at the Estadio Jose Zorrilla.
Isco opened the scoring for the home side four minutes after the break before a Sergio Sanchez own goal made the scores level in the 66th minute.
Benat gave the home side the lead in the fifth minute before strikes from Victor on the half-hour mark and a 47th minute penalty from Javi Marquez sealed three points to lift Mallorca out of the relegation zone.
Granada also lifted themselves free of relegation trouble with a 2-1 win at fellow strugglers Osasuna.
