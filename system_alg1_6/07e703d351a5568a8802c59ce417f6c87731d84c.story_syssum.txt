Doctors knew the mother was HIV positive and administered the drugs in hopes of controlling the virus.
"We didn't have the opportunity to treat the mom during the pregnancy as we would like to be able do to prevent transmission to the baby," said Dr. Hannah Gay, a pediatric HIV specialist at the University of Mississippi Medical Center.
Once it was determined the Mississippi mother was HIV positive, Gay immediately began giving the infant antiretroviral drugs upon the baby's delivery in an attempt to control HIV infection.
HIV-positive mothers given appropriate treatment pass the virus on in less than 2% of cases, Luzuriaga said.
Investigators said the Mississippi case may change that practice because it highlights the potential for cure with early standard antiretroviral therapy, or ART.
The early treatment likely led to the infant's cure, she said.
Researchers say the only other documented case of an HIV cure is that of Timothy Brown, known as the "Berlin patient."
"I've been tested everywhere possible," said Brown, who now lives in San Francisco.
Even then, some HIV experts said that doesn't matter, that he's been cured.
