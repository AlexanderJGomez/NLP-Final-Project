The first claim of responsibility for the bombing in the Afghan capital has come from a militant Sunni group in Pakistan with a history of sectarian attacks against Shia.
LeJ has a long history of targeting the Hazara Shia community in Pakistan.
The Hazara are numerous in both Pakistan and Afghanistan, and make up much of Afghanistan's Shia minority.
But other Sunni militants -- especially factions among the Pakistani Taliban -- have established a presence in some Afghan border provinces.
The Taliban are not a monolith, as one Afghan observer puts it, and it is possible that at local level there may have been collaboration between a Taliban operative and LeJ.
And after capturing Mazar e Sharif in 1998, Taliban fighters killed hundreds of Hazara in retaliation for the mass execution of its own soldiers the previous year.
On all sides, Clark says, there is a realization that sectarian conflict is a no-win situation in which tit-for-tat attacks would claim hundreds of lives.
