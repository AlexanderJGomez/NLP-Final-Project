(CNN) -- ISON, the most closely watched comet in recent years, may be falling apart as it nears its close encounter with the sun.
But other observers say images taken by NASA's STEREO spacecraft are "encouraging evidence that the comet still exists," Padma Yanamandra-Fisher with the ISON campaign told reporters on the campaign's Facebook page.
Whatever its final fate, she said, ISON has "provided a wonderful window into the world of comets.
Confusion about its fate isn't new for ISON watchers.
"I am excited at marking the progress of this comet that has captivated the world from its discovery and the possibility of it being a Great Comet," Yanamandra-Fisher told CNN.com.
