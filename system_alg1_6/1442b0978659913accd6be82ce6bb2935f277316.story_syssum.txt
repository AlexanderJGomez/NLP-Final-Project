(CNN) -- Casey Anthony must serve a year of probation after being convicted on check fraud charges, a Florida appeals court ruled Tuesday.
The attorney general's office wrote that Anthony "upon her release (July 17), should have reported" for probation -- something she did not do.
Orange County Circuit Judge Stan Strickland had earlier ordered Anthony to serve a year of probation after her release in the charges involving her daughter, but a clerk misunderstood the judge and prepared an order that the judge later signed, instructing that Anthony would serve the probation while in custody awaiting trial.
Perry ruled earlier this month that Strickland's verbal order was binding -- a ruling the appeals court upheld Tuesday.
