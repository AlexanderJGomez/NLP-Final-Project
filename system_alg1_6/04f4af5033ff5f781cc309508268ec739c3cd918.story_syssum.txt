The world may be watching the U.S. election, but China isn't concerned with who wins.
The mainstream Chinese media aren't reporting on the U.S. elections, nor are mainstream websites, which is exactly how the Chinese government wants it.
While the Chinese people desire democracy, they are skeptical of the U.S. system because its elections don't seem to engender progress for Americans.
I don't think people like the way the debates and elections are designed, but at least they're an outlet for people to make a stand.
The one-party system in China is inhuman.
But while China desires to understand the world, it fails to accept its universal values.
It is impossible to compare Chinese society with the U.S., as each system has its own dangers.
