Chris Christie blasted Democrat Mary Burke on Monday, saying the Wisconsin gubernatorial hopeful can't be trusted after her campaign hired a political consultant who appeared to plagiarize parts of her job plan from other candidates.
According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Burke said last week that her jobs plan did not violate her principles.
"And this is not anything more than bringing good ideas to Wisconsin, to the plans on how I'm going to move Wisconsin forward.
"She is in this for the right reasons," the first lady said at a rally for Burke.
