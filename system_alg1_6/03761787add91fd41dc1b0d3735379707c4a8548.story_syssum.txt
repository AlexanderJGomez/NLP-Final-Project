(CNN)Valentine's Day is big currency in China, a nation obsessed with love, romance and dating.
Every weekend in China a strange, albeit charming, ritual takes place -- the parents of China's singles frequent their local park in order to match make on behalf of their children.

The family remains the cornerstone of Chinese life -- and love.
Then there's the common clich√© that Chinese women "marry up" and Chinese men "marry down."
Following on from the above point, China's alpha females reputedly struggle in love.
China now has the largest number of online daters.
The pressure to wed has become so extreme in China that an entire industry has sprung up around faux dating.
Do not despair -- there are now love gurus in China, who, taking their cue from American TV show "The Game," will offer men advice on how to successfully chat up women.
