"What he does after this Ironman, I don't know," his wife, Annita Rucker, said with a laugh.
Change is a funny thing, Rucker says.
"She was devastated; I was crushed," Rucker said.
The day after the 2011 Super Bowl, Rucker woke up in pain.
"Something clicked," he said.
"I did it to myself.

"That was a huge motivator to me," he said.
"The focus he has, the drive he has ... it's so refreshing," Annita Rucker said.
Their son and daughter -- two children from Rucker's first marriage -- came to visit often, and Annita Rucker found herself entertaining the young kids while her husband remained stationary.
"My wife jokes, 'I've got a brand new husband,' " Rucker said with a long laugh.
Rucker is now training for his first Ironman competition.
He's a beast, but one who feels pain.
Rucker wants to become a motivational speaker, to be that inspiration for others that Mills was for him.
"When I was so overweight, I felt so dead to everything," Rucker said.
