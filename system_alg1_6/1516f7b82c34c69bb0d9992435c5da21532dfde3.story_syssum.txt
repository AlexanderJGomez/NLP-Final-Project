Singer-songwriter Regina Spektor has just released her third album.
And in the music video for her peppy song "Dance Anthem of The '80s" she gets her face so close to the camera that at times you think she's going to gobble it up.
CNN: Your song "Eet" is about forgetting the lyrics to your favorite song.
Regina Spektor: Yeah.
Spektor: I'm not really thinking that much of anything.
It was a time of big, fast spenders and people who just didn't really think about the consequences of their greed.
Spektor: No.
I like things that are just all over the place.
Spektor: Yeah and some of the bad ones stick, and some of the good ones get forgotten.
Spektor: Well (with) some of them I'm very involved.
Spektor: No I've never been that not involved.
And I just got to come in and be directed more, be part of his take on a song, and that was really fun, too.
I don't know.
