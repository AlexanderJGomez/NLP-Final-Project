While the exact number of hours owed by Tevez has not been made public, he must complete his punishment within the 12 months of it being handed out.
Meanwhile, Tevez revealed his delight Thursday at being handed the iconic number 10 shirt following the completion of his move to Turin.
This number is certainly a great challenge.
Mancini's departure at the end of last season failed to persuade Tevez from seeking pastures new -- although he denies that he turned down a move to AC Milan following claims by the club's vice-president Adriano Galliani.
"Real Madrid incorporates a new project with one of the best Spanish football players," the club said in a statement.
