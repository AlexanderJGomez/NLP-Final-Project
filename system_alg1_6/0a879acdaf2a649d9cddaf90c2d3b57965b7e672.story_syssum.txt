Detective Chief Inspector Paul Fotheringham of Kent police told the inquest that Geldof had been addicted to heroin for a number of years but had ceased taking the drug more recently.
Police who searched the house where she died found a black cloth bag hidden in a cupboard above the door of a spare bedroom, he said.
A pair of knotted black tights was found under her body, and a burnt spoon containing a small amount of a brown residue in the bowl was found under the bed, Fotheringham said.
She was not under the influence of alcohol at the time of her death, tests revealed.
