A day after the first protest blaze was put out, prisoners in the same prison once again set fires in the dormitories, this time injuring 42, according to the semi-official Anatolian Agency.
"Overcrowding is the primary problem," said Ozturk Turkdogan, president of the Human Rights Foundation in Turkey, or IHD, pointing out that the Sanliurfa prison is equipped to house 375 prisoners but currently houses nearly 1,200.
Turkey is in the process of upgrading its prison system and will increase its capacity nearly twofold by 2017, according to officials.
According to Human Rights Watch researcher Emma Sinclair-Webb, it is not only the problem of overcrowding, which is present in many of the world's penal systems, but also the lack of transparency that prevents prison conditions in Turkey from conforming to accepted international standards.
Sanliurfa prison has been in the headlines before.
