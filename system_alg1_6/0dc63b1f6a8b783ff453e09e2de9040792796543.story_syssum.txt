"I think it is too hard for men to talk about gender," says Sandberg.
If 86% of the top jobs are held by men and they tend to be older than the women who have just joined their companies, inviting this group of decision makers to help mentor women into top roles is the logical way forward, explains Sandberg.
Most women, if they get senior, have never worked for a woman, because again, 86 percent of the top jobs are held by men.
In a recent Harvard Business Review article, Cox argues Sandberg is insulting women by suggesting they need to be more like men to succeed and even suggests she's blaming them.
What's more, Sandberg has also noticed it is women, not men who've been most vocal about the book.
"Lean In is not about fixing women.
And to start having an honest conversation about women in the workplace."
