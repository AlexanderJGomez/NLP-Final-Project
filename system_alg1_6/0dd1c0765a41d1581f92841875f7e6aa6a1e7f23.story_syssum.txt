I thought about him yesterday as I read about Jason Collins coming out as the first openly gay player in NBA history.
Can he play?
"Is this really still news?"
It shouldn't be.
But it is.
Yes, he can play.
Our sexuality is just one of a thousand pieces of our identity, not the sole determining factor.
Jason Collins is gay.
I'll bet that Jason Collins will be the first in a string of professional athletes to openly acknowledge their homosexuality.
I think my dad would agree.
