Monsanto claimed that the seeds could only be used for one growing season, meaning their offspring could not be saved and replanted without compensation.
"Bowman planted Monsanto's patented soybeans solely to make and market replicas of them thus depriving the company of the reward patent law provides for the sale of each article," said Justice Elena Kagan.
Those soybeans cost more and farmers must agree not to replant their progeny, thus buying seeds each year.
But Bowman said there were no restrictions on how he used the mixed-variety seeds, which he did for eight consecutive fall crops.
Bowman argued the soybeans naturally replicate or sprout themselves and had done so without much input from him.
The case is Bowman v. Monsanto Company (11-796).
