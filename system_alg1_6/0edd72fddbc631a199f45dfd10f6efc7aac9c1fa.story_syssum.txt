(CNN) -- The Connecticut Senate on Thursday voted to repeal the death penalty, setting the stage for Connecticut to join several states that have recently abolished capital punishment.
Capital punishment has existed in Connecticut since its colonial days.
Since then, Connecticut juries have handed down 15 death sentences.
"We believe in the death penalty because we believe it is really the only true, just punishment for certain heinous and depraved murders," Petit told CNN affiliate WFSB.
Advocates of the existing law say capital punishment can act as a criminal deterrent and provides justice for victims.
The Senate's proposed law is prospective in nature, meaning that it would not apply to those already sentenced to death.
