Steve Harvey could not respond at the time because of a gag order in the case, said attorney Bobbie Edmonds.
Edmonds said in late January Marjorie Harvey was "contemplating" filing a defamation suit against Mary Harvey because of the accusations against her.
Harvey "is authorized to publish this order for the limited purpose of refuting the allegations of respondent Mary Lee Harvey," the documents said.
Edmonds said that hearing is on contempt of court allegations against Mary Harvey.
