For example, New York Rep. Tom Reed has been late paying his property taxes at least 46 times since 2005.
Reed likened the late tax payments to missing a utility bill, saying that while he was late -- and paid penalties because of it -- the taxes never went unpaid.
But they do.
At that time, while he strongly disagreed with decision to levy taxes retroactively, Jim Renacci paid the assessment in full, including interest and penalties," the statement said.
And Indiana Republican Rep. Todd Young paid $1,500 in tax penalties after a mortgage escrow mix up.
Florida Republican Vern Buchanan's run-ins with the IRS make him the frontrunner for most expensive tax problem, costing him $2.5 million.
In 2002, after years of fighting, he paid $1.2 million in taxes -- the amount he insisted he owed -- plus another $1.3 million in penalties and interest he racked up during the fight.
