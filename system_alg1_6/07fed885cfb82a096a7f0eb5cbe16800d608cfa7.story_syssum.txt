One suspects that HP is a little too venerable.
Yet HP hasn't stayed ahead of the innovation curve, failing for instance to adapt well to the tablet craze.
The HP layoff will consist disproportionately of older workers.
It's no coincidence that many of the U.S. core engineering openings at HP have titles like Recent Graduate, Intern and Post Doc, all aimed at the younger crowd.
Those who survive this round of HP layoffs will likely find themselves being asked to not only do their own jobs, but also those of the departed.
Unlike Livermore's explicit position on cheap labor, former HP CEO Carly Fiorina said that HP offshores work because the American educational system doesn't develop good math skills in its students.
Probably so, but the message here is that engineers, like many others, will have to get used to a life of layoffs in a globalized economy.
