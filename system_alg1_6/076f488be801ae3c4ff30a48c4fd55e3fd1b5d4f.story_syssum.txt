The FBI said Friday it has taken the lead role in the investigation of Thursday's crash into the 7-story building in northwest Austin that held offices for nearly 200 IRS workers.
Though the remains found in the IRS building have been identified, their identities will not be revealed until after a forensic examination, Diaz said Friday.
"Some folks saw it coming and sounded the alarm yesterday, and some folks started running away from that side of the building," he said.
Police said Sheryl Stack spent Wednesday night in an Austin-area hotel but did not say why.
"I saw it written once that the definition of insanity is repeating the same process over and over and expecting the outcome to suddenly be different," the online message says.
IRS investigator James L. Neff said that Ross is not under investigation; officials just wanted to make sure he was OK. "We didn't know if he was alive or dead," Neff said.
Friends and former colleagues said Friday they had no inkling of the rage apparently building inside Stack.
"We liked him," said Furley.
