Taxi drivers play tango music on their radios, and giant billboards promote choreographed tango shows.
The men would practice together to perfect their dance -- and hopefully impress the women.
Boys would sneak out to the dance halls to see the older men (brothers and fathers) dancing.
Tango is a dance that stresses elegant walking and close attention to the music.
A number of "milongas" (dance halls dedicated to tango) offer late night shows with either live music and/or authentic exhibition dancing.
Meanwhile, those concerned with the history and culture of tango should stroll to the former fruit and vegetable market area of Abasto in the Balvanera neighborhood, which is very much connected to Carlos Gardel -- the definitive tango icon.
Tango is a dance that takes years to master.
One of my favorites is Nuevo Chique at La Casa de Galicia.
