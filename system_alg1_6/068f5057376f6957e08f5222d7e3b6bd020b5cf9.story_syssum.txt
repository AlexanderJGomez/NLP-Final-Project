It was a very ugly incident."
In a strong blow to one of Mexico's most notorious drug cartels, Mexico's navy killed Arturo Beltran Leyva, head of the Beltran Leyva cartel and one of Mexico's three most wanted criminals.
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration said that its cooperation with Mexico played a role in Wednesday's action.
On Thursday, authorities presented to the media two women and a man who were arrested in the raid.
On December 11, the navy got into a firefight in Cuernavaca with gunmen of the Beltran Leyva cartel.
Three navy personnel were wounded by hand grenades, one fatally, the navy said.
The death of the leader of a major drug cartel is a victory for the government, but it could also spur more violence, said Payan, an expert on drug trafficking in Mexico.
One of the Beltran Leyva brothers, Alfredo, was arrested by Mexican authorities last year and remains imprisoned.
The Beltran Leyva cartel is known for air transportation expertise, Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Michael Sanders said.
"Calderon has finally understood two things: that the army is susceptible to corruption, and that the army is not sufficient," Payan said.
