Sebelius became the 44th governor of the state of Kansas in 2003.
But the governor has paid her political dues, with stints as a Kansas state representative and state insurance commissioner.
Sebelius has won two gubernatorial elections in a state with roughly twice as many registered Republicans as Democrats.
When Sebelius was elected governor, Kansas faced a judicial order to increase school spending in the midst of its worst budget crisis since the 1930s.
Democrats close to the campaign of Sen. Barack Obama told CNN Sebelius will announce after tonight's State of the Union speech that she's endorsing Obama.
