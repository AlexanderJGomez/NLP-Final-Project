Bellefonte, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Matt Sandusky, one of six adopted children of Jerry Sandusky, said through his attorney Thursday that he was sexually abused by the former Penn State assistant football coach, adding that he had been prepared to testify against him in a high-profile child rape case.
During closing arguments, his defense sought to poke holes in the prosecution's case, pointing to inconsistencies with the testimony of Mike McQueary, a former graduate student and assistant coach who said he saw Sandusky apparently sodomizing a boy in a university shower.
"The commonwealth has overwhelming evidence against Mr. Sandusky," he said.
Cleland said one count of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse duplicated another charge.
There are likely "many young people who would come forward and say that my methods and what I had done for them made a very positive impact on their life," Sandusky said.
Sandusky then emerged from the shower area, he said.
The witness, the first accuser to take the stand, said Matt Sandusky looked "nervous" when he saw that Jerry Sandusky was about to start a soap fight.
I didn't want to lose him to whatever other fates might have awaited him, so I kept trying and trying to pull him in."
"He had the strength and the courage to stay loyal to us even when we weren't sure what would happen," Sandusky wrote.
"When he found out there were others, he was in real misery," Hamilton said, adding Sandusky tried to adopt Weaver.
