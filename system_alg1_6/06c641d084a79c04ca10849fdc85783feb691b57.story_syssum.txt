Their AdTrap device intercepts online advertisements before they reach any devices that access your Internet connection, allowing you to surf the Web -- even stream videos -- without those annoying ads.

"I think it speaks to the mindset of people right now of their experience on the Internet," Russell said.
"At some point, it's gotten a bit much," Russell said, referring to online ads.
"We're not trying to be against all advertisers," said Julie Russell, Chad Russell's mother, who handles finances for AdTrap.
