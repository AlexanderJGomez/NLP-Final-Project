Washington (CNN) -- Fueled by a close call on a runway two years ago involving a U.S. senator, general aviation pilots will soon have increased leverage when facing FAA disciplinary action under a bill awaiting President Barack Obama's signature.
-- Requiring the FAA to inform pilots when they're being investigated and notify them that any response by the pilot can be used as evidence against them.
"This bill remedies many of the most serious deficiencies in the relationship between general aviation and the FAA, and ensures that pilots are, like everyone else, treated in a fair and equitable manner by the justice system," Inhofe said after the bill passed by voice vote in the House.
Since there was no accident, there appeared to be no significant problem."
