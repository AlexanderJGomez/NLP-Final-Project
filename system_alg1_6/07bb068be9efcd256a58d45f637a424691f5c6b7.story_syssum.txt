I know I don't go there.
I don't care if a man sees a woman bald at the office on Wednesday, with blond finger waves at the club on Friday, and with jet black hair down to her butt at church on Sunday -- if anyone asks if she wears a weave, the answer is "I don't know."
Muhammad joked that if the smoke from the candle set off the studio sprinkler system, "I'm done for the day."
"I knew the first rule about not talking about fat, but I didn't know the second," he said.
Stewart, who is bald, said the two actually talk about weaves on the show quite a bit, something he attributes to his latent hair envy.
But Muhammad said while she was comfortable with Stewart and others knowing, she was shocked "he put all of my business out there like that."
...
That's when I stepped in and reminded Stewart that while "weave-gate" was bad, hair is not the last taboo.
I know the rules.
