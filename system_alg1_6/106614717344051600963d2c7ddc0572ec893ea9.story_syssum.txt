At 21, Angie Sanclemente Valencia was crowned as Colombia's "Queen of Coffee."
Interpol had issued an arrest warrant against her in December of the previous year after she was connected to a 21-year-old woman who was arrested just before she was to board a flight to Cancun, Mexico, from Buenos Aires carrying 55 kilograms of cocaine (120 pounds).
It was all a big misunderstanding," Sanclemente said.
She says her Argentinian boyfriend and his uncle, who are also in prison, were indeed involved in drug trafficking, but not her.
Moving to Argentina from Mexico, Sanclemente says in retrospect, was a big mistake.
"I'm very capricious and a lot of [bad] things have happened to me for not listening to my mother," Sanclemente says.
