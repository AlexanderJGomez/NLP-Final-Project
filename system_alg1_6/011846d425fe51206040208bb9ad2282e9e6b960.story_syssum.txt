"The gender gap has been closed in education in many Arab countries, which is a big achievement of recent years," said Dima Dabbous-Sensenig, Director of the Institute for Women's Studies in the Arab World at the Lebanese American University.
In Europe and the United States, women also make up the majority of university graduates -- 60% according to the European Union and U.S. Department of Education.
Nawar Al-Hassan Golley, Associate Professor in Literary Theory and Women's Studies at the American University of Sharjah, in the United Arab Emirates, said both the high percentage of women in university and their absence from the workforce can be explained in the social upbringing of girls.
"Therefore, for many girls school is their only opportunity to make friends and socialize outside the family, so it is something they look forward to.
While the high numbers of women getting a good education has not yet translated into parity in the workforce, it is a step in the right direction, both women agree.
Al-Hassan Golley added: "I think it will take a long time before women break through these cultural and societal expectations.
