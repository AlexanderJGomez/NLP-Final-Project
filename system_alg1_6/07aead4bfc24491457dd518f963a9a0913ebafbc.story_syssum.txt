Some of the victims said they had consumed only one or two beverages before becoming ill, Cle Elum-Roslyn Police Chief Scott Ferguson said.
"Whatever occurred up there wasn't consensual," Ferguson told CNN.
She exhibited signs of having ingested a spiked drink, Ferguson said, and was taken to the hospital and later released.
The party took place at a rental home about 30 minutes from the university campus in Ellensburg, police said.
The owner of the home was not at the party, police said.
