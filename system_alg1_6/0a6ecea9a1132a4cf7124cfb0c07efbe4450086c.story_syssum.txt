When the May 26 directive was issued, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said dispersant use should be cut by 75 percent.
The directive states that BP must ramp down dispersant use by "75 percent from the maximum daily amount used."
The EPA and Coast Guard say they're trying to keep dispersant use to around 18,000 barrels a day.
The EPA continues testing the chemical dispersant Corexit 9500, which has been used by BP since the beginning of the oil disaster.
"I think it is obvious we can never again allow for a repetition of what is happening right now, where the science experiment is being conducted without having any idea what the impact on marine life long term will be," said Markey.
