It's what he does.
Below, Clancy reflects on the story and what makes it so unique and baffling -- one that might take years to unravel.
CLANCY: Very early on, at the very first news conference they hinted that the plane may have tried to reverse course, make a "turn back" as they called it.
CLANCY: While this was not Malaysia's first air tragedy, it was an unprecedented situation where a plane had gone missing -- not because something happened that forced it down, but because it abandoned its flight course and we don't know why.
How could they?
They included accusations that the Malaysians may have shot down the plane and they are covering it all up, that there was a hijacking and the Malaysian government was negotiating with them and they weren't telling the families.
CLANCY: They knew they were overwhelmed, confused and sending mixed signals in the first week.
Their logic has been: If we find the plane and unravel what happened here, people will overlook the first few days of confusion and know we were never hiding something.
But again, they knew that they had to find the plane to make the whole thing work.
CLANCY: I've never covered a story like this one that had so few facts and so much speculation in so many different directions.
When I began to see it unfolding, I was more determined than ever to avoid speculation and conjecture about what happened to the plane.
Once CNN broke the story this plane had flown out of the South China Sea, back across the Malay Peninsula, I understood this was a bizarre, unprecedented event.
They couldn't do that.
I can't.
How does a plane with a catastrophic mechanical malfunction go on to fly another seven hours?
There's a very good reason for us to want to extend the resource necessary to unravel this mystery.
