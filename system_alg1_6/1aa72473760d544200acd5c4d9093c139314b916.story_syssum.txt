In a country where bleaching creams are frequently used to chemically lighten skin tone, one savvy entrepreneur is fighting against the disfiguring practice.
Alhaji Mustapha Oti Boateng: I started with Chocho cream -- the natural skin restorer and beauty soap.
AB: When I found that my children were growing up, I told [one of my taxi clients] that I had to find something to do so that I would be able to look after my children very well.
AB: They gave me the opportunity to go and I traveled to Japan where I started odd jobs...
AB: This name "Chocho" is in the memory of a dear friend, who has passed on.
AB: The economy is always fluctuating.
AB: I'm not educated but I'm always happy when I see children in school.
We can always educate ourselves wherever we go.
