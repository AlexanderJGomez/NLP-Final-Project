The film -- directed by the brilliant Stanley Kubrick in 1980 -- is now regarded as a masterclass in movie-making but at the time it was largely received with the scratching of heads and a mood of disappointment.
Kubrick adapted the film from the book written by horror novelist Stephen King -- and that's where my connection begins.
There was one on the wood-panelled ceiling of the ballroom and later, when we checked back through all the pictures, we discovered that another had appeared on the photograph we took of the reception before meeting or tour guide.
The images were taken in different places, with very different lighting and of the 200 photographs we took during our holiday no orbs appeared on any other photograph -- nor indeed on any photograph ever taken on that camera before or since.
But for some fans of the film, ambiguity leaves a void which must be filled with conspiracy theories.
"It's a great compliment to Kubrick that people go into orbit about it."
And if there is anyone out there with a good theory (conspiratorial or otherwise) about those we'd love to hear from you.
