(Rolling Stone) -- Denver's stately Ellie Caulkins Opera House hosted the kickoff of Death Cab for Cutie's intimate theater tour last night, beginning a 22-date jaunt that finds the indie-pop band collaborating with San Francisco's Magik*Magik Orchestra.
The domino effect of audience members rising to see over the folks in front of them took hold during "Codes and Keys," though it quickly subsided when Gibbard eased into the pensive "No Joy in Mudville."
"Jason looks like he stole that drum kit from Tito Puente," Gibbard quipped, in one of the night's few unscripted moments.
