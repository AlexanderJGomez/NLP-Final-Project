Brittany is believed to be with Easley, who met the girl's mother on the internet, authorities said.
"As to what relationship Jeff Easley and Brittany may have between them is irrelevant," Lavinder said.
Easley and Brittany are believed to have bought several other items at a Salem, Virginia, Walmart before they disappeared.
Lavinder asked Easley to safely return Brittany so that she could attend Tina Smith's funeral.
Police are "confident" that the girl is with Easley, Lavinder said.
After finding Tina Smith's body, police soon got information that Brittany Smith's whereabouts were unknown, leading them to issue the statewide alert.
They have asked anyone with information to call 911 or Roanoke County police at 540-777-8641.
