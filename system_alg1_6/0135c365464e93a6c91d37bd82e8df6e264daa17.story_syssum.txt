(CNN)For Frank Clegg Leatherworks, "made in America" is not a seasonal trend or marketing slogan meant to evoke classic workwear looks or to drive sales of limited edition brand collaborations.
How can brands like Frank Clegg that are in it for the long haul convince the Target generation that one of their leather satchels is worth the triple-digit investment?
The first Northern Grade launched in 2010 as a menswear market in Minneapolis, expanding to other cities amid growing demand for classic looks inspired by American heritage brands.
The brands (and price tags) at Northern Grade's markets for men and women are not for everyone, said market co-founder Katherine McMillan.
Stephanie Beard, founder of Austin-based brand esby, said working in menswear inspired her to start her own line for women.
"Staying in the United States was always the plan," she said.
"Made in USA is about knowing the people behind product," she said.
That matters more to them than whether it's made in the USA," she said.
That's why markets like Northern Grade exist, McMillan said: so consumers can meet designers in person.
