On February 16, Republicans in the House of Representatives held a hearing designed to undermine President Barack Obama's decision to guarantee women free access to contraception health care regardless of their workplace.
Voters, including Catholics, overwhelmingly support health care coverage for contraception.
But contraception isn't just a basic health care issue for women, it's also an economic issue.
... You know, back in my days, they used Bayer aspirin for contraceptives.
I respectfully ask members of Congress to not be blinded by the desires of a small but vocal anti-contraception community that could put the physical and financial health of millions of American women and families on the line.
