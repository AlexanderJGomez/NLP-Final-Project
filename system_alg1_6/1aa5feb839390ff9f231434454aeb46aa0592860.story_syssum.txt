Then, when the company's intentions to buy Motorola surfaced, Google execs said they were mainly doing so in order to protect themselves and their partners against patent litigation.
Sony Ericsson CTO Jan Uddenfeldt said at a conference last week that Google still maintains it is buying Motorola primarily for the patent portfolio of one of the world's oldest mobile-phone companies.
In the nearly three months since announcing a bid for Motorola, the strategy to remain a neutral player "has been clearly communicated to us by Google, and it makes sense," Uddenfeldt said in an interview.
"Google is a great software company, but they are not a consumer brand," he said.
Even more so than Motorola, Samsung has been very close with Google over the last two years.
Being chosen as the lead-device partner is a competitive advantage, Packingham said, because the company gets direct access to Google engineers and to Android code before rivals.
The Google spokesman declined to comment on how exactly the process works.
