"All these movements they do with their hands," Valle said.
Valle said that in recent years, increasing amounts of Badjao are transitioning to a life on land.
"They don't speak Malay or even know how old they are," Valle said.
"I wanted to show who they are," he said.
This project was the first time Valle photographed underwater.
"They're posing in all of the pictures," Valle said.
The soft light and the way the Badjao pose in the water reflect the "imaginary stateless nation" Valle wanted to convey, causing the viewer to examine the relationship between place and identity.
