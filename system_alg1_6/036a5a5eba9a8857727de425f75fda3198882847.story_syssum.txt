More travelers now connect London and Paris by train than by air -- and high-speed rail between these two cities may get even faster and cheaper in the near future.
Direct Eurostar service from London to Brussels also takes 2.5 hours.
In January, Eurostar's monopoly on using the Chunnel -- the tunnel beneath the English Channel -- expires.
Fares can change without notice, but typically a one-way, full-fare ticket (with no restrictions on refunds) runs about $425 first-class and $300 second-class.
I like to ride in second class (Standard class) to save money.
Since the days of Napoleon there had been talk about a tunnel under the English Channel, but it wasn't until 1986 that the two countries finally reached an agreement to build it together.
High-tech know-how, a shared European vision, and people's love of travel have created incredibly fast trains that crisscross, link and strengthen Europe.
