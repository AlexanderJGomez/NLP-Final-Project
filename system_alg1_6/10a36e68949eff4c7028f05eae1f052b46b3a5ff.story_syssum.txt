But even while Clinton was in Beijing, the Chinese government was maintaining a heated diplomatic back-and-forth on another territorial controversy, this one concerning a set of small islands in the East China Sea also claimed by Japan and Taiwan.
And China doesn't seem eager for the United States to get involved in the quarrel.
Chinese officials said Xi would send a letter to Clinton.
"Both President Obama and I have said frequently that the United States welcomes the rise of a strong, prosperous and peaceful China," she said Wednesday.
The territorial disputes over islands in the South China Sea complicate that role.
Analysts have expressed pessimism that the disputes in the South China Sea will be defused soon.
