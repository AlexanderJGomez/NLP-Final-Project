(CNN) -- For years, Alfonso Torress-Cook followed the rules in his quest to eliminate hospital-acquired infections.
Torress-Cook is part of a growing movement in medicine that no longer accepts hospital-acquired infections as inevitable complications.
Under Torress-Cook, Pacific Hospital's infection rate for the so-called superbug MRSA is down to 0.01 per 1,000 discharges, 430 times better than the national average.
Pennsylvania, which requires the most extensive reporting of hospital-acquired infections, saw the annual rate for all infections drop 8 percent, according to the most recent figures available from the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council.
Simply requiring hospitals to report their infections has forced them to be more accountable to their patients, says Lisa McGiffert, who heads Consumers Union's Stop Hospital Infections campaign, which among other things has pushed for more transparency.
Simply putting the spotlight on hospital-acquired infections keeps the staff focused, he says.
"I think it's moving us toward eradication of infection or at least where infections are rare and will not be accepted," she says.
