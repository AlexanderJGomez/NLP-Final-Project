Common also performed at "CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute" last year.
Common: I grew up on the South Side of Chicago with my mother and my stepfather, and I was provided a nice home, a home with love in it.
As a teacher, she's an educator and also would just go the extra mile to help people.
I want to empower them first by letting them know that they are loved and people do care.
My mother told me before going there: getting invited there, that is an important place to be because that is where a lot of people that do the real work are.
These are people who do work for real in the world helping people.
Common: A hero to me is someone who is able to take whatever talent, gift, personality, quality and utilize it to help build others.
