(CNN) -- It's been a busy year for the British royal family.
With more private and public income, Prince Charles' household spending increased by 4.1% to $15.3 million, and all 135 full-time staff members received a pay raise of 3%.
Royal aides champion the continued success of the prince's group of 16 charities as the greatest example of the royal family giving back to the public.
Between April 2011 and the end of March this year, the Prince of Wales directly or indirectly raised more than $200 million for his charities, which support young people, the environment and enterprise.
