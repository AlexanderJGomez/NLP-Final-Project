After celebrity gossip site TMZ released footage of Baldwin shouting profanity at an aggressive videographer (with muffled audio that may or may not have contained a gay slur), Baldwin published a bitter "goodbye to public life" essay in New York Magazine.
In fact, it's staring all of us in the face.
This kind of world is too much for Baldwin, who is prone to losing his temper.
Go about your daily life, but have a trusted and well-paid photographer at your side, documenting just how rude, invasive, and aggressive the celebrity chasers can be.
All of this might sound extreme.
It may be too late for Baldwin, but not for other celebrities.
It's time for a 21st century solution.
