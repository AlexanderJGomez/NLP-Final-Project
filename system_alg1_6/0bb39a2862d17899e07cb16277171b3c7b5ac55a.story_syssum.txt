President Barack Obama has failed on immigration policy.
Obama broke his campaign promise to make reform a top issue and eroded trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement by expanding 100-fold the program known as Secure Communities, which ropes local police into enforcing federal immigration law.
A few months ago, I said this would never happen and now it looks like it might.
Besides, if Obama offers deferred action to parents, it will validate what conservatives have always insisted about how the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants can be used to keep their parents from being deported.
Now, if he goes too far, Obama could prove them right.
In the post 9/11 era, conservatives shouldn't need a reminder of something they've been telling us for years: how sweeping can be the executive power of the president.
As head of the executive branch, Obama naturally has the power to set priorities for the enforcement of immigration law.
It's just a legitimate exercise of the power that any president would have under the Constitution and our system of government.
