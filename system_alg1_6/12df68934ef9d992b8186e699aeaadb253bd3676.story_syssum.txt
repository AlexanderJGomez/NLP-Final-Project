The family behind  A&E's "Duck Dynasty" rallied around its patriarch Thursday, one day after the network suspended Phil Robertson over controversial remarks he made about gays and blacks in a magazine interview.
We are in discussions with A&E to see what that means for the future of Duck Dynasty," it said.
It's just not logical," he's quoted as saying.
But homosexuals aren't alone, Robertson said.
"We are extremely disappointed to have read Phil Robertson's comments in GQ, which are based on his own personal beliefs and are not reflected in the series Duck Dynasty," the network said in a statement Wednesday.
...
They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues," GQ quoted Robertson as saying.
But by early Thursday night, more than 70,000 people had signed a change.org petition calling for A&E to bring Robertson back.
Just because homosexuals do not agree, does not mean Mr. Robertson needs to be suspended."
"Duck Dynasty" follows a Louisiana bayou family that has "made a fortune on duck calls," as A&E puts it.
