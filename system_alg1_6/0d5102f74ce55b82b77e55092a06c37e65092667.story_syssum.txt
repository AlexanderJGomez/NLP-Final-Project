Difficulty getting Flash to work properly on the PlayBook is probably another one of RIM's woes.
First, other tablet makers have had trouble with Flash.
Without great Flash support, a PlayBook tablet would practically have nothing to do.
It's been six weeks since Motorola released the Xoom, and April 19 is probably as long as Adobe can wait before Flash can no longer be considered "a few weeks" late.
