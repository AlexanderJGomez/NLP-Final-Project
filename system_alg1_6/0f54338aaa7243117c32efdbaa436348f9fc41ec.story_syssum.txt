(CNN) -- Are you still shopping for holiday gifts?
This isn't about being ungrateful.
Earlier this week, I posted a simple question on Twitter and Facebook: Have you ever received a bad holiday gift?
The most astounding gift was a voucher for a Botox treatment given to Hanadi Kalla -- she was 26 years old at the time.
These gifts are fine if a person asks for it.
But there's a right way and a dreadfully wrong way to do this.
Re-gifting should be in the original packaging and the gift should look new.
Gifts that have no connection to the person
Ask the person what they would like
After all, if you are going to expend the effort to get someone a holiday gift, then why not give a gift they will truly enjoy and appreciate?
