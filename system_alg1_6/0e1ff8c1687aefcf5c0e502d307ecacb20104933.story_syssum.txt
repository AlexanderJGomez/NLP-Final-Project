(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal has called for stricter doping controls and more transparency to help eradicate drug cheating in tennis.
Nadal, who made his return to action in February following a seven-month absence with a knee injury, said tennis needs an all-encompassing approach to drug testing in order to maintain the sport's image.
"The implementation of the athlete biological passport is an important step in the evolution of the tennis anti-doping program as it provides us with a great tool in the fight against doping in our sport," said ITF President Francesco Ricci Bitti.
He denied using HGH and never tested positive for it.
"I wasn't tested with blood for the last six or seven months," he told reporters.
