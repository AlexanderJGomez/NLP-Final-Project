Ang Tshiring's body was taken to Lukla, a tourist town where most who embark on a trip to Everest Base Camp start out.
Ang Tshiring, 57, was a high altitude cook.
His son Pemba, 37, lives with the family in Thamo, a small village of 50 souls located in the Thame Valley in the Khumbu, where the country's greatest ethnic Sherpa climbers live, well off the beaten track of Nepal's Everest Base Camp trail.
In Ang Tshiring's home, feelings of sadness are eclipsed by spiritual duty.
Ang Riku is concerned.
Ang Riku and Ang Tshiring's private quarters have been transformed into a prayer room, and we all sleep together on the floor of the main hall.
"You are my porter," Ang Riku says, bursting into a laugh, and I'm glad that she finds my presence amusing.
Then Ang Riku offers money for the lama to perform the puja.
Next, Ang Riku prepares a copper plate full of rice, the equivalent of $30, and a ceremonial white scarf that the lama will use for the prayers.
Ang Riku also sends bags with salt, butter, rice and money to 500 families in the valley, so they'll recite prayers for Ang Tshiring.
Although the world regards them as high altitude guides and porters, most Sherpas don't want to be mountain climbers on Everest.
"Every time I go on a climbing expedition, I wonder if I will come back alive," says Pemba.
I offer a puja in the monastery for Ang Tshiring in the afternoon and ask Lopsang, a young monk who says he escaped from Tibet, the reason behind the bad luck.
