So it's no surprise that when photo of Crawford was shared all over social media, many people commended White for making it public and Crawford for having "the guts" to open herself up to such scrutiny.
But the photo was not, it turns out, from Marie Claire, as White acknowledged.
In releasing the image, White made an example of one woman's body to satisfy a personal agenda -- that magazines should show more "realistic" images of women.
To be sure, there is some comfort to be found in that photo.
We don't like Crawford's image because it's "real."
We're also not cheering Crawford's bravery in showing the world what even the most genetically blessed 50-year-old women look like, since the photo was very likely shared without her permission.
