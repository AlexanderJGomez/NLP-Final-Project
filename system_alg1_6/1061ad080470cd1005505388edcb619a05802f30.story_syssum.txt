NEW YORK (CNN) -- Ben Folds didn't realize how great his music was until he heard a bunch of college students singing it.
And so an idea was born: Folds would travel to university campuses around the country and record an entire album of a cappella covers.
Ben Folds: I think it naturally kind of is.
...
I mean these guys, they'd just do a live take and they just don't know that the pros don't do it that way.
Folds: I'm not sure what that is.
So I think they get it.
Folds: Well, I think that we get very uptight when it comes time to record because there's a process, an imminent process that has to do with just selling the record, mostly.
I think things were kind of cool.
...
Folds: Oh, that too.
I wouldn't know about that with my (jokingly flexes muscles) -- it doesn't really occur to me, those things.
