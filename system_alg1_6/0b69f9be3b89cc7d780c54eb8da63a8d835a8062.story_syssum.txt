Facial recognition is a computer-based system that automatically identifies a person based on a digital image or video source -- which is then matched to information stored in a database.
Facial recognition is a key part of the agency's ambitious $1 billion Next Generation Identification System (NGI) -- a state-of-the-art biometric identification system that also includes iris scans, DNA analysis and voice identification.
But facial recognition technology isn't always so straightforward.
UK-based company NEC IT Solutions, which also specializes in identification of terrorists and criminals, has created a system that analyzes the faces of potential customers as they enter shops.
A Finnish company, meanwhile, aims to streamline sales by using facial recognition technology for payments.
Facial recognition is secure by nature and is fundamentally a biometric technology since you need to be in the store to use the technology."
In spite of this, Facebook recently announced plans to extend facial recognition to profile photos in other parts of the world.
