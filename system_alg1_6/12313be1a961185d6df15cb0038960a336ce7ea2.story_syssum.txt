The company, dubbed "The People's Opera" by former New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, was founded on the principle that every New Yorker should be able to afford to go to the opera, Steel said.
"We need the help of the people we were founded to serve to put on our season this year," Steel had said, speaking to New York residents and opera fans everywhere.
This year marked the 70th anniversary of the New York City Opera, which opened in 1943 as the second opera house in the city.
