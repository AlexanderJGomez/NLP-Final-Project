BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Liu Yan, regarded as China's top classical dancer, was to give the performance of a lifetime: She was to dance a solo at the opening ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
I was dancing on a thin layer of electrical mat, I was standing on that, and there was a platform powered by a vehicle moving underneath," Liu said from the Beijing 306 Military Hospital.
But then, I could see the fireworks from the rehearsal," Liu said through tears.
Liu began attending the Beijing Dance Academy in 1993.
But I believe I will keep dancing or at least doing work related to that, because that is what I love."
But I think of it as a process," she said.
"I think I will use the word 'unfortunate.'
She also said she did not know about reports her family and witnesses to the accident were told not to talk about what happened afterward.
I will live with hope."
