The spark that began the revolution was something called Europe: a trade agreement with the European Union that many Ukrainians saw as a chance to enter a world of free trade rather than government syndicates, and the rule of law rather than overwhelming corruption.
Then Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared with a proposal.
Although the Russian side promised that the loan was without conditions, Russian leaders then explained that disbursements could only follow when political stability had been established.
The Ukrainian protesters did not do what most of us would have done.
The Polish and German foreign ministers arrived to negotiate the transition that many people had wanted for weeks: a weakening of the Yanukovych's power and accelerated elections.
Yanukovych disappeared.
What happened in Ukraine had little to do with the outside world.
The Ukrainian revolution took place without outside help.
Now Western financial aid will be needed to transform that revolution into stability.
The Ukrainian revolution, like any revolution, can fail.
Russian parliamentarians are now in Crimea, promising Russian citizenship to ethnic Russians there and suggesting that Russia will support a referendum on the detachment of Crimea from Ukraine and its attachment to Russia.
The cause of the Ukrainian protesters was not to change the world, but only to change their world.
If we don't understand the revolution in Ukraine, then we miss something special and unusual: a chance to support democracy.
