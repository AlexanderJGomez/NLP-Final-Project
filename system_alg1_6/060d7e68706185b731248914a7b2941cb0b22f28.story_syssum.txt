Since its start as the multimedia portion of the SXSW Film Festival in 1994, the event -- which runs Friday through Tuesday -- has its roots in community-driven tech creativity.
Both events were turning points for SXSW Interactive -- known to festival veterans as "South By" -- which at the time was still recovering from some lean years after the dot-com bust.
They're tasked with deciding what the future of Interactive will be in the face of more people, more programming and more interest in what is the festival's hot new tech.
"One of the tensions we faced this year is we've got lots and lots of the start-up stuff and that's very exciting, but at the same time, it's not completely what we're about."
For the first time, the festival will give out a Hall of Fame award at its Interactive Awards ceremony.
Last year Interactive got attention for a community effort that was completely unplanned and that didn't spring from the fest itself: After earthquakes and tsunamis devastated Japan on the opening day of the festival, attendees launched "SXSW4Japan," which raised funds for relief efforts.
Like any ambitious 19-year-old, SXSW Interactive is restless, driven and hard to pigeonhole.
The festival may be unsure where it will end up, but it's convinced it knows how to get there.
