(CNN) -- After he announced the resignations of four top officials in his administration in 1973, Richard Nixon swore he was done with talking about Watergate, according to the last batch of tapes released by the National Archives.
Nixon would be forced to deal with Watergate over and over again in the next year or so, culminating with his own resignation in August 1974 -- a development forced by the discovery of conversations like those released Wednesday by the National Archives.
Bush, then the Republican Party's chairman, told Nixon, "I was really proud of you, and my golly, I know it was tough, and I just wanted to tell you that."
Nixon replied, "Well, good for you, George."
The tapes captured a June 1973 summit meeting between Nixon and Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev, in which Brezhnev bemoaned complaints about the world's two superpowers.
"We said no conditions.
And it worked."
