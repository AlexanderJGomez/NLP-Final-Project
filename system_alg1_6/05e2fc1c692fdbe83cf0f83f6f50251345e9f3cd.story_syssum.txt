The man on the phone was offering us young children with the casualness of a market trader.
We were told he was one of the men running this "unofficial" displaced camp -- one of the many that has mushroomed in the town of Yola as the influx of people fleeing Boko Haram has grown beyond the capacity of the official camps.
When our colleague want to see them, he was shown a group of children and asked which one he wanted to take.
I told him we wanted to know what we'd need to do, if we decided we did want to "foster" the children.
At the camp where we finally met the man face to face, there was no attempt at subterfuge.
I could have had one of them, I was told, but because I'd specified a younger child, they'd only identified one so far -- a 3-year-old.
Our last phone conversation revolved around what an appropriate "donation" would be in exchange for the children.
