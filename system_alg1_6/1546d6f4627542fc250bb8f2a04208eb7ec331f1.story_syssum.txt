New York (CNN) -- A day after saying homosexuality is not "an equally valid or successful option," New York gubernatorial candidate Carl Paladino denied being anti-gay Monday but said it was "disgusting" that his opponent took his children to a gay pride parade.
Paladino defended that remark Monday, telling both "Today" and ABC's "Good Morning America" that he was referring to the difficult path homosexuals face because of discrimination.
Asked whether he believes homosexuality is a choice, Paladino said, "I've had difficulty with that.
Paladino emphasized in a statement Sunday night that he did not include those lines when he delivered his remarks, and said Monday he had crossed them out from his prepared remarks.
Paladino told CNN he didn't know who wrote the remarks.
I don't think they should be married," he told CNN.
"Don't misquote me as wanting to hurt homosexual people in any way," Paladino said Sunday.
Paladino also criticized Cuomo for marching in New York's gay pride parade in June.
New York "celebrates our diversity" with festivities such as the Columbus Day parade and the gay rights parade, he said.
However, they are not," said Christopher Barron, chairman of the gay conservative group GOProud, in an e-mail to CNN.
It isn't."
"Watch," Paladino said before walking off.
