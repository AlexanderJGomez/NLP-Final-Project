The London Underground costs only $6 (£4) but takes an hour.
For a drink: Two of the oldest London pubs include Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese (145 Fleet Street, EC4A) in the City of London and The Prospect of Whitby (57 Wapping Wall, E1W) a short walk along the Thames from Canary Wharf.
Staying dry: Improve your swing at one of London's indoor golf centers.
Shelter can also be found in some of London's iconic department stores.
Transport: Be warned: a single-stop tube journey in central London costs $8 (£4).
