The Earned Sick Time Act, which now goes to Mayor Michael Bloomberg, will require private businesses with 20 or more employees, to provide five paid sick days annually, beginning in April 2014.
The bill now goes to Bloomberg, who vowed Wednesday to veto it.
Washington and Milwaukee followed in 2008, and Connecticut became the first state to pass statewide paid sick time laws in 2011.
