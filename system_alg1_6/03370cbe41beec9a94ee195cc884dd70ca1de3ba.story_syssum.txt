Welcome to John and June Sturgeon's indoor train garden, a collection of model trains the couple have been sharing with friends and neighbors every holiday season for nearly 15 years.
"I venture to say, each year I put at least a hundred hours in here," John says.

The Sturgeons open their collection for 20 nights each year leading up to Christmas.
