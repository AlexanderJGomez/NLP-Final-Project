Weinstein was abducted early Saturday when gunmen, posing as neighbors offering food, pistol-whipped him and his driver and tied up his guards, U.S. Embassy and Pakistani officials said.
The men tied up the three security guards and duct-taped their mouths, he said.
He said Weinstein is in his 60s.
Three weeks after their abduction, Pakistani authorities said they believed the couple was still alive.
