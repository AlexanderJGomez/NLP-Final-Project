Now, the prominent Ohio conservative will be known for something else: reversing his hardline position against gay marriage.
"I'm announcing today a change of heart on an issue that a lot of people feel strongly about that has to do with gay couples' opportunity to marry," Portman told CNN.
Portman says his son, now a junior in college, helped him work through his decision to announce his change in position on gay marriage and blessed the idea of publicly announcing Will Portman's sexuality.
"I told Mitt Romney everything," said Portman with a laugh.
"Well, because they told me," said Portman.
You know, I followed my heart," he said.
Portman admitted that when the protest occurred, he already knew his own son was gay.
Again, my focus has been on other issues over my public policy career," said Portman.
"Well, I would say that, you know, I've had a change of heart based on a personal experience.
"He wanted to tell us that there's something about him that we didn't know," Portman said, reflecting on the day two years ago his son Will first told his parents he was gay.
Did it change the way you think about same-sex marriage or gay men, lesbians or bisexuals in general?
