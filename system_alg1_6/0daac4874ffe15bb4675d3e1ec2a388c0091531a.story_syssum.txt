The woman's revelations come as police look into a journal written by Aguilar.
According to police, Aguilar took a taxi to The Mall in Columbia on Saturday morning and then fired as many as nine shots from a Mossberg 500 shotgun into a skateboard apparel shop, killing Benlolo and Johnson before fatally shooting himself.
Several hours later, she went to check on him, and the store manager said Aguilar had never showed up, according to Cropper.
According to Cropper, police -- who were aware of the mall shooting -- then asked if Aguilar kept a journal.
She loved being a mother," McDonald said.
Police said the woman wasn't in Zumiez; rather, she was on the first floor when she was hit.
Cory Brown, the co-owner, said Aguilar walked in with a friend and after spending about 30 minutes in the store, he was approved to purchase the Mossberg 500.
Brown said Aguilar came back just before Christmas with the same friend and purchased another box of shotgun shells.
Police said Cody Cousins, 23, an engineering student, killed Andrew Boldt, 21, of West Bend, Wisconsin.
Last Monday, a student was shot and critically injured near a gym at Widener University near Philadelphia.
