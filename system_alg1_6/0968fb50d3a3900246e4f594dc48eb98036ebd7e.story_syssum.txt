Washington (CNN) -- In less than a month, the government may shut down.
It is a legislative tool designed to keep the government running when the president and Congress can't get it together.
And the one key duty laid out in the Constitution for Congress is to pass spending bills that fund the government.
In the past year, Congress hasn't passed any of the 12 different spending bills that fund the much of the government, including defense programs, transportation projects and education.
And before 1977, they were so common that Congress changed the start of the fiscal year from July to October to give lawmakers more time to pass the spending bills.

House Speaker John Boehner has proposed a short-term spending bill that would fund the government until December 15.

The next fight will be over the debt ceiling -- permitting the government to borrow more money to pay off its past spending debts.
