"Everyday when I wake up, I thank God that I can sing," she says.
"I went there just because I wanted to study opera but I didn't realize that it could be that difficult," she says.
Despite the difficulties, Jo went on to achieve incredible success.
Jo says she was destined to be an opera singer before she was even born, as her mother had dreamed of being a singer herself and had been thwarted by political upheaval.
"I still think that pushing a child too much could also could be quite cruel and unfair," she says.
"My mother told me by phone she said, 'You should stay there to sing for your public because for me you are not a simple a daughter for me.
At the age of 49, Jo is still working to achieve the balance between work and home life that she craves.
I still feel like a beginner even if I had been singing many years."
