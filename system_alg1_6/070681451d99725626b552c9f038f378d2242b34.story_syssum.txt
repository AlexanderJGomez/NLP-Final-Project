A five-year-old ban on the use of trans fats in New York City restaurants has sharply reduced the consumption of these unhealthy fats among fast-food customers, a study by city health officials has found.
Although the analysis was limited to New York City, many of those chains have chosen to eliminate trans fats nationwide as a result of the ban, Curtis says.
Trans fats have been shown to raise "bad" LDL cholesterol while lowering "good" HDL cholesterol, and even moderate consumption has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease.
The New York City ban, which was phased in between 2007 and 2008, was the first of its kind to target trans fats in restaurants, bakeries and other food-service establishments.
At the time the ban went into effect, some health advocates, including the American Heart Association, expressed concern that reducing trans fats would lead to an increase in the use of saturated fat, which also contributes to heart disease.
The researchers looked only at large fast-food chains, which are generally required to publish the nutritional content of their products, so they can't say how the ban has affected trans fat content at non-chain restaurants and other establishments.
"These changes are just small drops in that bucket, but we have to keep an open mind and try multiple approaches if we want to find more strategies that really work."
