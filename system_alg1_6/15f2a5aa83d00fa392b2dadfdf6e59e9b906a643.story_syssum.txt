(CNN) -- Scores of people died Thursday in and around the restive Syrian city of Hama, activists said, corroborating reports of widespread casualties a day after the start of a new military clampdown targeting protesters.
One resident who spoke to CNN by satellite phone said some of the casualties who were taken to hospitals died there because the facilities were without electricity.
People who tried to leave, he said, were being shot.
One of the sources is a representative of the Syrian Revolution Coordination Union, an opposition group.
The move came a day after the U.N. Security Council issued a presidential statement condemning the Syrian government's crackdown on protesters and calling for an immediate end to violence by all parties.
"It's crucial that a U.N. Human Rights Council fact-finding mission to Syria is able to investigate the situation as soon as possible," said Jose Luis Diaz, Amnesty International's representative to the United Nations.
It said an opposition leader in the city reported that the government had launched a series of measures to punish residents.
Syrian lawmakers had already passed a law granting citizens the right to establish political parties with the aim of contributing to political life "through peaceful and democratic means," the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported.
