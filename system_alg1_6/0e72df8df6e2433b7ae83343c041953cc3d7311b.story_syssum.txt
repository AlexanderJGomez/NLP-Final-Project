(CNN)  -- E. Lynn Harris, the author who introduced millions of readers to the "invisible life" of black gay men, was a literary pioneer whose generosity was as huge as his courage, friends said Friday.
Though Harris wrote primarily about black gay men, some of his biggest fans were black women.
Tina McElroy Ansa, author of "Taking After Mudear," met Harris at the beginning of his literary career when he was selling his first book "Invisible Life."
She came across a scene where Harris depicted two black men playing in the snow with one another.
Harris was as generous with his fans as he was with his friends, some said.
She said Harris had been a cheerleader in college "and a spirit of joy followed him through his life."
Some said Harris was a mediocre writer who stumbled on a winning literary formula.
Boykin said Harris received most of his criticism not from outraged straight critics, but people within the black community.
Harris took a little of that pain away with his life and his books.
"He helped us all breathe a little better."
