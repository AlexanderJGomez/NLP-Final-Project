Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- At least three people were killed and 174 injured during clashes in Egypt on Sunday, officials said, exactly one year after the country's first democratically elected president came to power.
"Egypt is on the brink of a volcano," government-run newspaper Al-Akhbar said.
Morsy's opponents stood their ground in the square, where protests two years ago helped topple Mubarak's 29-year rule.
A sit-in that started on Friday continued in Rabaa Al-Adawiya Square, where thousands of supporters gathered in support of Morsy.
Andrew Pochter, a 21-year-old American in Alexandria to teach children English, was stabbed to death Friday while watching the demonstrations, his family said.
On Sunday, a spokesman for the group said that its headquarters in Cairo fell under attack from between 100 and 150 "thugs."
"Peace is our weapon," Sabahy said in a video message posted Saturday.
But Morsy is not Mubarak.
The United States has approved the departure of embassy and consulate employees and their dependents because of the unrest, a senior State Department official said.
