Cairo (CNN) -- When Azza Hilal Suleiman saw Egyptian military pummel the veiled woman, she stepped in to help and got kicked and clubbed by security forces, a beating that was captured in a video that went viral around the world and also showed live gunfire and the violent removal of a Muslim woman's clothing.
Suleiman is one of three people in the video interviewed by CNN, with one of them saying he was shot.
The military has denied the use of live ammunition.
More than a thousand people gathered in Tahrir Square for a "Million Woman" march Tuesday.
Others came to Suleiman's aid, such as businessman Ehab Hanna, who was also beaten up and shot after he tried to help the woman with the veil.
I tried to walk but fell to the ground, so they started beating me and Azza relentlessly," he told CNN.
He told CNN that he is filing a complaint against military leaders because they "dragged, stripped and beat" women and journalists.
He too said he tried to come to the aid of the veiled woman, who suffered serious cuts and bruises.
"Our troops do not just attack people for no reason," he said.
Where is she?"
