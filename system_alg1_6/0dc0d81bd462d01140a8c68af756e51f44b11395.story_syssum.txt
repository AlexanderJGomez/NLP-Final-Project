The story began in May 2009, when Mohammad Sohail of Shirley, New York, was closing his Shirley Express convenience store one night.
According to Sohail, the man immediately started to plead with him, tearfully saying, "I'm sorry, I have no food.
Sohail went to get some milk, but when he returned the man had fled with the money and food.
You are a great American," another reads.
The typed letter begins, "You change My Life (sic)," and goes on to say that the man is sorry for his actions six months ago.
The letter says Sohail's acts inspired him to become a "True Muslim" and that his life has changed dramatically.
So now he is a good person in this community and I'm very glad for that.
