Kate Moore, 15, of Des Moines, Iowa, out-texted more than 250,000 participants for the texting title in New York.
Another round quizzed contestants' knowledge of texting acronyms.
Faced with a do-or-die situation in the second round, Moore seemed to bet on accuracy over speed, finishing well behind her opponent but winning the round.
The pregnant pause before the winner was announced stretched into a seeming eternity because Moore apparently forgot to hit send after finishing her text.
Moments after her victory, Moore agreed to an exclusive text message interview with CNN.

Moore: Hahah not at all!
