(CNN) -- I met Whitney Houston after the debut of her first self-titled album on Arista Records.
As with many famous people, the celebrity she achieved came with public attention beyond imagination -- and some of it wasn't always very kind.
Her ballads were attacked for lacking rhythm.
Of course, I don't know what drove her to drugs in the beginning, but drowning out the intensity around her was surely one of the side effects she came to depend upon.
And of course, then there is addiction.
Like Billie Holiday, Judy Garland, Elvis and others before her, that inner voice of doubt that we all feel sometimes just could never keep up with the public adulation.
Whitney Houston's music legacy will be an inspiration to young artists for years to come.
