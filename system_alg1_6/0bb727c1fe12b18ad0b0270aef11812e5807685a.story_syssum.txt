The IUCN assessed a total of 63,837 plant and animal species around the globe which revealed 19,817 of that number are currently threatened with extinction, with 3,947 described as "critically endangered" -- the final classification prior to extinction.
"The services and economic value that species provide are irreplaceable and essential to our well being," Jon Paul RodrÃ­guez, deputy chair, IUCN Species Survival Commission, said in a statement.
"Recent work on plant assessments suggests that around one in five plants are threatened with extinction," says professor Stephen Hopper, director (CEO and chief scientist), Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, England.
The seed bank at Kew, the largest of its kind in the world, currently stores 11% (around 31,000 specimens) of the world's plant species.
"There is no technological reason why a plant species should become extinct.
"The problem with any consensual approach is that it takes a very long time.
