Until last week, the White House had said final decision on the pipeline would be up to the State Department, following an environmental impact analysis and a public commenting period.
"I'm hoping to God that the president, or whatever higher power, will use rational sense and understand that people don't want this," Willa Tharnish, a senior and environmental studies major at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, said of the project.
The pipeline would transport toxic crude oil from under Canada's Boreal forest, home to many North American songbirds, to refineries in Texas, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council.
"Folks in Nebraska, like folks all across the country, aren't going to say to themselves, 'We're going to take a few thousand jobs if it means our kids are potentially drinking water that would damage their health,'" Obama said.
"There's a way of doing that and making sure the health and safety of the people of Nebraska are protected," he said.
