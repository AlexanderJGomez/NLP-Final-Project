Limassol, Cyprus (CNN) -- Cyprus is known for its sunshine, its ancient ruins and its delicious halloumi cheese, but one thing that is less well known is that it is also home to the oldest named wine in the world.
According to legend, King Richard the Lionheart of England was so taken with commandaria that at his wedding he pronounced it "the wine of kings and the king of wines."
The grapes are then pressed, the wine is fortified (usually with a high percentage grape-based alcohol) and then it is aged for at least two years in oak barrels before being bottled.
Some believe that Cyprus may have been the site of the earliest wine harvests in Europe, stretching back 5,000 years.
Throughout his career, Mohianakis has worked in wineries around the world, and in his view, Cyprus is unique in its ability to grow sweet wine.
It is the sun and the soil.
I am just trying to give the vines the opportunity to express themselves through my wine."
