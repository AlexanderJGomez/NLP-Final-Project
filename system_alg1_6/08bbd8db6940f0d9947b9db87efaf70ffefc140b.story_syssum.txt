Tensions exploded between Syria and Turkey last summer, when Syrian anti-aircraft fire brought down a Turkish military reconnaissance jet, killing its two crew members.
In October, the Turkish government won authorization in parliament for possible cross-border military incursions into Syria after Syrian mortar fire killed five civilians in the Turkish border town of Akcakale.
Government forces dropped more than 10 barrel bombs on the Aleppo province city of Deir Hafer, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said.
The government also said it destroyed a hideout used by the al Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, which has claimed responsibility for suicide attacks in Syria.
In October, the Syrian government said it had not used cluster bombs during the current conflict.
