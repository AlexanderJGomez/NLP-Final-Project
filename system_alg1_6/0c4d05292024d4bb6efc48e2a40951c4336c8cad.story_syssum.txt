A seizure disorder caused the death of Jett Travolta, the 16-year-old son of actors John Travolta and Kelly Preston, a source at a Bahamas funeral home told CNN.
And the risk of seizures is higher for children with disabilities such as autism and cerebral palsy, Shinnar said.
The reports that a seizure disorder caused Jett's death were preliminary, Gupta said.
It rules out brain injury, bleeding on brain, skull fractures, rules out heart problems due to Kawasaki disease, which is the disease the Travoltas say their son suffered," he said.
Someone with Kawasaki could have seizures for one of two reasons, but they would be rare, he said.
"Even with physical evidence and a deeper look by neuropathologists, we still may never have an answer," Gupta said on CNN's American Morning.
