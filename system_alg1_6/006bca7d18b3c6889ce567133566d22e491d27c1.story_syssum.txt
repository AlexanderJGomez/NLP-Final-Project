Encouraged by the French-educated Chinese artist Lin Fengmian, his teacher at the prestigious Hangzhou National College of Art (today the China Academy of Art), he relocated to Paris in 1948.
Apart from brief trips abroad, Zao would remain in France until the year before his death, one of the few Chinese artists from his generation to emigrate to Europe.
At first he made a determined effort to distance himself from ink painting -- the medium most closely associated with the Chinese painting tradition-- and subject matter that might be construed as overtly Chinese.
In the decades that followed, Zao committed himself fully to abstract painting, rarely using even figurative titles after 1959.
No single phrase better encapsulates the union in his person and art of the two often disparate cultures and aesthetic visions of France and China.
"Zao Wou-ki," he mused, "his work isn't representative of either Chinese or French art."
