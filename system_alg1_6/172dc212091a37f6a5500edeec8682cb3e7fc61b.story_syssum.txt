The police offered "a further unreserved apology" for the death of de Menezes in 2005, plus an undisclosed compensation package, the police and the de Menezes family said in a joint statement.
Jurors at a 2008 inquest found that the police who shot de Menezes did not shout a warning before firing at him.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission concluded in 2007 that de Menezes was innocent of anything that might have justified police action.
"I am sorry."
