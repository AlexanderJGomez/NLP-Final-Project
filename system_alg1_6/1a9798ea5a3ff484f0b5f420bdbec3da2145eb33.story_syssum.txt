What are the Powerball numbers, and have any winning tickets been sold?
I bought it in Naples, That's just my luck," Butch Gonzalez, a regular lottery player, told CNN affiliate Bay News 9 outside the Publix in Zephyrhills.
But that didn't stop hundreds from driving to the Trex Mart in Dearborn, Missouri, where one of two winning tickets was sold in last year's $587 million Powerball drawing.
"I figure if the good Lord intends you to win, you only need one ticket," he told CNN affiliate KCTV5.
CNN's Scott Thompson and Jake Carpenter contributed to the report.
