At the same time, contradictory statements made in Tehran make it clear that the Iranian authorities are divided about the implications of the American military's return to Iraq.
At first, there was nothing but silence in Tehran as U.S. F-18s on Friday began to target ISIS militants.
And given his stature inside the Iranian system his words must be seen as a peek into the internal policy debate in Tehran about the situation in Iraq and Iran's options.
Tehran and Washington don't just agree on the need for airstrikes against ISIS.
Tehran desperately wants to keep Iraq intact as a nation state.
As far as the U.S. role in combating the Islamic State is concerned, the Iranian debate is likely to remain split between the moderates and the hawks.
But all the recent trends suggest that the moderate viewpoint in Tehran has the upper hand on the policy question of Iraq and how Iran can best serve its interests.
Time will show if Rouhani and his moderate wing can continue to sit in the driver's seat on the question of Iraq.
