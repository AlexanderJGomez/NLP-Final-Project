(CNN) -- Meat is murder?
And when we grow only the meat we can eat, it's more efficient.
Conventional meat production is also hard on the environment.
In-vitro meat is made from samples of animals conventionally slaughtered.
The Netherlands' Government has also invested around $4 million in Dutch research into in-vitro meat production.
Both conventional and cultured meat is made of muscle tissue.
"If cultured meat looks, tastes, and costs the same as regular meat, then I think acceptance will be high.
If cultured meat looks, tastes, and costs the same as regular meat, then do we care that it's produced in a steel tank, rather than in an animal farm?
The more we learn about how meat is produced now, the more in-vitro meat looks like a better alternative."
Gillian Madill, Genetics Technologies spokesperson for Friends of the Earth, thinks that clear parameters for in-vitro development need to put in place: "If we can successfully develop these products, what is the defining line between lab-grown meat and natural animals?"
"With India and China doubling their meat consumption every decade, there's no sustainable way to satisfy the growing global appetite for meat without a significant improvement in technology," said Matheny.
