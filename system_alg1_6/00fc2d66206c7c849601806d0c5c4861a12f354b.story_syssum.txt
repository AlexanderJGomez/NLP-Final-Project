London, England (CNN) -- Britain's Prince William and fiancee Kate Middleton made their first official engagement as a couple Thursday, launching a lifeboat in Wales.
"It's a very low-key event, launching a lifeboat on the island where they both live...it's a very good debut event for them," said Saunders.
"(The royal family) have learnt many lessons from when Princess Diana first joined the royal family.
After naming the new Atlantic 85 lifeboat, Prince William and Middleton met members of the charity's lifeboat crew along with fundraising volunteers and were given a demonstration of the vessel's capabilities.
