The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools is currently reviewing a scathing report, prepared by former federal prosecutor Ken Wainstein, which showed thousands of UNC students took fraudulent classes, some of them multiple times.
One student was enrolled in 19 different paper classes, Wainstein said.
The last time SACS investigated the paper classes -- when UNC insisted they existed on a much smaller scale -- the association made UNC offer new classes to students who had been enrolled in the fake ones.
From emails that were attached to Wainstein's report, it's clear that some athletes were placed in these classes because they were struggling.
Willingham told CNN that many people were involved and that the paper classes were used as a crutch for underprepared athletes.
His report says paper classes served as "GPA boosters" for athletes who were on the brink of eligibility.
All she could think about were the athletes she tutored who she says were terribly unprepared for real classes at UNC.
UNC said the Wainstein report came to a different conclusion than previous investigations because he had the cooperation of Nyang'oro and Crowder, who previously weren't talking.
Reacting Saturday to the report, Williams told reporters "it's a very sad time for me" as not only UNC's head basketball coach, but also a former assistant coach and student there.
