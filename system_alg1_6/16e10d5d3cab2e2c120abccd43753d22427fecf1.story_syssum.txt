(CNN)An American missionary once held hostage by Colombian rebels has been accused by local authorities of collaborating with his former captors.
A video posted online appeared to show Stendal speaking after his arrest.
"It leaves much to be desired of the intelligence department of the police of Cundinamarca to confuse evangelizing with rebellion," said the statement from the FARC, which is known in English as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.
After his release, he took part in evangelical campaigns across Colombia and set up radio stations to broadcast gospel preaching and music into the conflict zones.
