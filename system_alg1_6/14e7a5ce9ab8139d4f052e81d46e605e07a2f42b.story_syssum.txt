The National Geographic show featured Coots and cast handling all kinds of poisonous snakes -- copperheads, rattlers, cottonmouths.
"Even after losing half of his finger to a snake bite and seeing others die from bites during services," Coots "still believes he must take up serpents and follow the Holiness faith," the website says.
In February 2013, Coots was given one year of probation for crossing into Tennessee with venomous snakes.
"Catching two snakes the first day, 'course we'd hoped for more," Coots says in the video.
