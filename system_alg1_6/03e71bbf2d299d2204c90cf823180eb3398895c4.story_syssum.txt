"Children were not trapped in big schools somewhere and lot of people were outside because it was daytime," he said.
The government's first priority is to continue search and rescue operations and relief efforts, he said, as he thanked all those involved.
Nepali Home Ministry Joint Secretary Sagar Mani Parajuli, who is coordinating relief efforts, said government efforts to get aid to remote areas had been hampered by rugged terrain and poor weather, which limits the use of helicopters.
Of the 8 million people affected by the quake across 39 districts of Nepal, some 1.4 million need food aid, McGoldrick added.
"The United Nations is supporting international operations for search and rescue and strengthening relief efforts," he said.
He said injured people who had been airlifted from some remote areas were often suffering from crush injuries, lacerations and dislocations.
UNICEF, the U.N. children's agency, said Sunday that nearly 1 million Nepalese children urgently need assistance.
