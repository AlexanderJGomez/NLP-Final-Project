Meanwhile, an official with the system stood by the decision to shut off cell phone service ahead of a protest last week.
Last week's protest never materialized.
"All over the world people are using mobile devices to organize protests against repressive regimes, and we rightly criticize governments that respond by shutting down cell service, calling their actions anti-democratic and a violation of the rights to free expression and assembly," Rebecca Farmer from the ACLU's northern California office wrote on the advocacy group's website.
"We made a gut-wrenching decision that was forced upon us by the protesters," Johnson said.
