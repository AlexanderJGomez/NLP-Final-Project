Police officers across the country train on how to make difficult split-second decisions on the use of deadly force.
Investigators said they believe that the two brothers were looking for revenge against those men when somebody called 911, reporting that two men were walking down the street and that one of them might be carrying a machine gun.
Samer Shehada said he and his brother were cooperating.
He said the two men cursed at police and wouldn't put their hands up.

According to police, McCoy ran and fired at the officers.
Police found a gun several days later in Biscayne Bay, but they say they don't know if it belonged to McCoy.
