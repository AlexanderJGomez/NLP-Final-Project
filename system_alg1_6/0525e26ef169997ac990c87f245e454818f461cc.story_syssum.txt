The shoes prosecutors say Hernandez was wearing at the industrial park where Lloyd was killed also have seemingly vanished into thin air.
Investigators photographed a pair of Nike Air Jordan XI Retro Low brand sneakers during one of their first searches of Hernandez's home, according to court papers, but did not take them in as evidence.
That affidavit dated November 14, 2014, says that after studying images and home security video and having "consulted with Nike," investigators believe those three pairs of shoes are "believed to be produced by Nike and Creative Recreation."
Yet, it wasn't until almost a year and a half later, when investigators were making final trial preparations last November, that they "noted" the three pairs of shoes in photographs and realized they could still be at Hernandez's home, a search warrant affidavit states.
Trying to make the case for another search, investigators also quote a jailhouse phone call dated December 25, 2013, between Hernandez and his fiancee Shayanna Jenkins.
"Jurors will wonder why didn't investigators seize the shoes at the same time they seized many other pieces of evidence from Hernandez's home," says University of New Hampshire law professor Michael McCann, who's closely monitoring the trial.
