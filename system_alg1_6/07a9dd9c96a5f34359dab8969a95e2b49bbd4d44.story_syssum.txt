Aung San Suu Kyi is the very embodiment of Myanmar's long struggle for democracy.
Known as the "lady" in Myanmar, Suu Kyi has been compared to former South African President Nelson Mandela, who spent a chunk of his life in jail for fighting apartheid.
In an interview with CNN several years ago, Suu Kyi, in fact, likened Myanmar's plight to South Africa's former brutal race-based system.
When Suu Kyi's mother died the next year, Suu Kyi vowed that just as her parents had served the people of Burma, so, too, would she.
One of them was Nyo Ohn Myint, who participated in the 1988 protests as a college professor and now serves as one of the leaders in Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy.
Over the years, Suu Kyi repeatedly challenged the junta and discouraged foreign investment in Myanmar.
"That's a skill I barely see in other people," Myint said.
Over the years, Suu Kyi has made clear her devotion to bringing democracy to Myanmar.
"Maybe we are good at politics," Suu Kyi told Myint.
Suu Kyi has also asked her lawyers to bring her books in English and French.
Even when Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar in May 2008, Suu Kyi was not allowed to leave her house, though trees were crashing down all around her.
Some believe that Suu Kyi's stubborn defiance has become an obstacle to progress in Myanmar.
