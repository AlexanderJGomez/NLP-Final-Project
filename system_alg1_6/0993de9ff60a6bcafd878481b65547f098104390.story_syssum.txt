Vice President Joe Biden emphasized the issue of income inequality to a gathering of major donors and activists Friday night, telling them Democrats will work to address it to help working people, an attendee at the event told CNN.
"No one responded," said the source.
Biden did not talk about whether he'd run for president, something that he has been openly considering.
