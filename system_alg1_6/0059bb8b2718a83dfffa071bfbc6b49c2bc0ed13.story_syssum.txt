After dating for more than two years, Ferguson and his boyfriend, Justin Mikita, decided to take the next step.
Ferguson and Mitka started the Tie the Knot foundation.
Ferguson: We kind of felt like the only way to legitimize why we wanted to do this was to announce that we were actually engaged.
Ferguson: I hate "lover"!
CNN: A lot of boyfriends, and girlfriends in Maine, Maryland and Washington got some good news on Election Day when same-sex marriage was legalized in those states by popular vote.
I just feel like it shouldn't be up to the majority to vote on a minority's civil rights.
We just want to add to who has the right.
CNN: And whether you're voting or getting married, who doesn't like to wear a nice bow tie, right?
We'll start a bow-tie line and funnel the proceeds into a foundation for marriage equality.
Ferguson: I mean it really is.
I've gotten engaged since meeting these people.
We're always checking in with one another, and some walls definitely go up to protect some people.
CNN: I can only imagine what a "Modern Family" gay wedding will be like.
Ferguson: Well, we're not going to be redefining the marriage ceremony.
I haven't been to the Catholic Church in years so I would feel really weird to try and bring in those traditions -- it's just not us.
And we both do.
But, yeah, we both really want kids very much.
