Martelly's dreams of leading Haiti were all but dead.
Martelly, they said, was a fresh face in politics, untainted by the corruption that has marred many a presidency in Haiti.
"To Haitians, particularly the legions of young and jobless, Martelly is an outsider who can bring change to Haiti," longtime Haiti observer Jocelyn McCalla said on Twitter.
"This was a man who could move millions with a microphone," Pierre-Pierre said.
His supporters took to the streets, angry at what they said was a rigged election.
Haiti, he said then, was on the brink of revolution.
"You know how (U.S. President Barack) Obama said it's not about the man, but it's about the plan?"
he said.
"People are fed up here," he said.
Martelly exuded confidence that he could bring change to Haiti.
"Martelly spoke in a way Aristide spoke to the people," Pierre-Pierre said.
Ultimately, Pierre-Pierre said, what does an entertainer know about Haiti's role in the world.
"Well," he said.
"Look at what the politicians have done."
