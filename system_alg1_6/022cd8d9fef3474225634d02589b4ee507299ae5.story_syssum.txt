Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a leader of the GOP tea party wing, mounted a filibuster attempt to force a 60-vote threshold for proceeding on the debt ceiling measure.
The Democratic-controlled Senate then gave final approval by a 55-43 margin on strict party lines, with McConnell and the other Republicans who helped overcome the filibuster voting against the measure to reduce their political risk.
On Tuesday, the GOP-controlled House passed the debt-ceiling measure on a 221-201 vote, with only 28 Republicans supporting it compared to the 199 who opposed it.
In the end, House Speaker John Boehner gave up efforts to link the measure to a provision repealing a cut in some military pension benefits.
On Wednesday, the Senate also passed the military pension measure after the votes on the debt ceiling legislation.
"And so, let his party give him the debt ceiling increase that he wants."
