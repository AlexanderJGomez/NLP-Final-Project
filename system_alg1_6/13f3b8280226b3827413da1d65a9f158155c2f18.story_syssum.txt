Now, 19 months after marrying Prince William, the couple has given the country -- and the Commonwealth -- another reason to celebrate.
Both were studying art history when they met, but Catherine is said to have played a key role in encouraging the prince to switch to a degree in Geography in his second year.
She uses public transport a lot -- or she did -- but they climb on the buses and the bus driver is having to throw them off," he said.
The split was said to be amicable with the couple determined to remain friends.
In July 2007, Catherine sat in the royal box at Wembley Stadium in London for the Concert for Diana, a massive charity concert to remember Prince William's mother, Princess Diana, 10 years after her death in a car crash.
Then finally, on April 29, 2011, Catherine married Prince William in a televised ceremony at Westminster Abbey in London, becoming Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cambridge, before an audience of millions.
Prince William and Catherine's child will be next in line to the throne after William regardless of whether it is a boy or a girl, the British Cabinet Office said Monday.
Last year, Commonwealth leaders agreed to change British succession laws to allow a female to take the throne ahead of a younger brother.
