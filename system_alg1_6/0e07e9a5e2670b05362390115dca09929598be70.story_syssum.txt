If I'm in the car, I can go from one place to another and see different backgrounds, different people and different surrounding -- and for me this is always interesting to show in my work.
I think it is always important to see the original Dubai, how it used to be, and a lot of it is still there.
I would take a traditional material and maybe wrap it around a Formula One car ... or fit it on an art platform in a new way.
Art Dubai is an art fair that happens every year in March.
I wanted to do something connected to the area, so just a couple of blocks away, if you walked through Bastakiya (one of the oldest most traditional districts of Dubai) you would see the fabric shops and I remembered the textile shops from my childhood.
But right now instead of having fabrics on that barrow, it has got an art piece on it made out of cardboard tubes.
The name of it was Present, Perfect and Continuous -- defining that this tool of fishing that was in the past can still be used in the present and can continue to be used in the future.
It is less challenging when you are a woman because they always think that art is your feminine side.
