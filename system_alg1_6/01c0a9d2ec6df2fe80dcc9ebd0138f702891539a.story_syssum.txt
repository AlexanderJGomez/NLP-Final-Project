(CNN) -- A body found in an Indiana lake has been identified as that of Teleka Patrick, the Michigan doctor who's been missing since December, the Porter County Coroner's Office confirmed.
They led investigators out of the ditch where Patrick's car rested to the highway.
The YouTube videos showed Patrick talking, cooing and singing to someone unnamed and apparently unknown.
In a surveillance video from a Radisson hotel in Kalamazoo, not far from where she worked, Patrick is seen on the night of December 5 around 7:30 p.m., hours before police found her car in Indiana.
Investigators have said they have no evidence of foul play, but they also don't have conclusive evidence that Patrick's movements on December 5 were voluntary.
Carl Clatterback, a private investigator hired by Patrick's family, told CNN that investigators are looking into the videos.
