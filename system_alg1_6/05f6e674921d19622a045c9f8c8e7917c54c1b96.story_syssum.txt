NEW YORK (CNN) -- For someone who claims to be incredibly laid back, Jason Mraz is certainly piling up the accomplishments.
The tour's quirky title was inspired by a wholesome San Francisco, California, restaurant Mraz loves.
Mraz shared tales of his avocado farm, as well as what it's like to get the cold shoulder from Simon Cowell, when he sat down with CNN recently.
Jason Mraz: It's fantastic.
Mraz: I do, thank you.
Mraz: I do.
Mraz: I loved it.
I was like, "What does he think?"
Mraz: It is really tough.
Mraz: Very surprised.
Where were you?
Mraz: This year we're going to explore South America, which I've visited as a tourist, but I've never taken my music down there.
Mraz: No, but I have the Rosetta Stone.
I have begun my level one training.
