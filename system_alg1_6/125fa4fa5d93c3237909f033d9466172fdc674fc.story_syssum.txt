Researchers at the University of California, San Diego, studied MRI scans of 84 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 175 patients with mild cognitive impairment, or MCI, and 139 images of healthy brains.
More than 50 percent of the brains in the MCI group showed atrophy similar to the Alzheimer's disease patients.
The rest of the patients were stable and their symptoms had not increased," McEvoy said.
"If they use a MCI patient with loss of brain tissue, someone who we now know is progressing fast towards Alzheimer's disease, we'd be able to quickly figure out if drug 'X' is slowing things down or not helping at all," Thies added.
Over 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease and an estimated three and a half million have mild cognitive impairment.
