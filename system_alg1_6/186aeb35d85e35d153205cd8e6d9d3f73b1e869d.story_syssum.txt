Almost symbolic of this change is the significant deal between social networking web site MySpace and three major record labels -- Sony BMG, Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group -- to form MySpace Music.

Lefsetz instead sees the future in a new business model for selling music, which offers the sale of bundled music at cheaper prices.
Dubber, meanwhile, is not convinced that the music industry will find a new model.
He questions whether it would be fair to celebrate artists only for their album sales when other musicians may not gain the same recognition for having 500,000 downloads from a Web site.
