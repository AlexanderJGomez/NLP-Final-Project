EW: How much did you know that you were getting evicted?
EW: Yeah, it's true.
McGuire: Ah, well, I was making deals all the way up to the last day, so I didn't know until the last day.
McGuire: Yes.
McGuire: I don't know.
McGuire: Ah no.
McGuire: Yeah, I was warned a little bit about some of the things.
McGuire: Yeah, I'm not racist, sexist, or homophobic, so I mean, I guess everything can be taken out of context.
EW: Well, I don't know how much some of these words can be twisted or misinterpreted.
EW: When we talked to Nick after he got voted out, he said that on some level when you're playing a game you don't want to rock the boat, but then you don't want to be that person who just stands by idly while someone is making such racial slurs and just saying some really unfathomable things.
McGuire: [Laughs] I don't know because I don't know what you're talking about.
McGuire: Yeah, I'm going back to the boat.
McGuire: I think me and Kaitlin will.
How so?
EW: Yeah.
