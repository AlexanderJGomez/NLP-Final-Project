The trade in four conflict minerals -- tin, tantalum, tungsten (the 3Ts), as well as gold -- fuels the war in eastern Congo today.
By requiring that publicly listed manufacturers who use these minerals conduct independent audits of their supply chains, this legislation will help curb the conflict minerals trade.
Some minerals trading companies have also argued that Congress and the conflict minerals movement will force them to pull out of Congo, creating an embargo and hurting miners.
Companies now have an opportunity to achieve this goal and help Congolese communities through three key steps:
Congress has taken the first step, but we still have a long way to go in ending the conflict minerals trade and the war in Congo.
And electronics and jewelry companies should support these processes with a fraction of the profits they've earned from these conflict minerals over the past dozen years.
