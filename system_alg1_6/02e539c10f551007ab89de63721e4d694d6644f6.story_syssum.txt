And it was found in a subway car in Madrid, police say.
The train was sent to a maintenance yard, following protocol, and a worker who inspected the doors found a brown leather wallet that contained the $2 million check, the California driver's license and some credit cards, a Metro de Madrid spokeswoman said.
Police would like to ask the owner of the check that question, too, the spokesman said.
