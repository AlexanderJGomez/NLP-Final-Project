But for Joe Putignano, it wasn't as simple as running away -- it took a lifetime of dedication and a battle against addiction to get where he is today: dangling from the 40-foot-high catwalk above the Cirque du Soleil big top.
And for Joe, it's not just high-flying acrobatics that cause him pain.
"I need to have surgery," he says matter-of-factly.
His left shoulder has just the one injury -- another SLAP tear.
"I suppose there's always a risk that when they do fix it, that it will destroy my flexibility," Joe says.
"Opiates made me feel like I was the greatest human being possible.
Most of these nearly 17 million Americans will need surgery someday, and many of them will be prescribed opioid painkillers to combat post-operative pain.
"We don't have exact numbers of the percentage of former addicts that are going back for surgery, but this is definitely a growing problem in America," said Dr. Boris Spektor, assistant professor of anesthesiology and pain management at Emory University and the person who will be managing Joe's pain throughout the process.
During step four, Joe will see a psychologist the day after surgery and regularly after that to ensure he stays on the right mental path.
"But I think Joe has an incredibly good psychological framework going on.
When you're met with pain, only then you'll know how you'll react to it."
