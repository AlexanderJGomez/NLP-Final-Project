It's no wonder, then, that Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Doha, Istanbul and Riyadh are each vying to throw up the biggest and grandest transportation hub in the region.
Doha's impending Hamad International Airport will house the world's second longest runway, while Istanbul and Dubai are competing for the title of world's largest airport.
Perhaps more telling than the various design features are the airports' planned capacities; combined, they will ultimately accommodate 450 million passengers a year -- a significant jump from the 140 million that currently make their way through the region.
"Maybe they won't fill capacity in the next five years, but I don't think any of the airports will collapse.
"This is a country that sees the value of aviation and embraces it," says Lorne Riley, head of corporate communications at Dubai Airports.
By the end of the year, we should reach 66 million," says Riley.
But they are quite strong, and I have no doubt this will continue into the foreseeable future," he says.
Riley admits that there won't be room for two Dubai airports.
