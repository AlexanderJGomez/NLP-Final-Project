However, African observers say the growth of simple communication technologies like cell phones are assisting many states to progress towards open and fair elections in increasingly democratic systems.
"With communication and cell phones, this is where it is difficult to cheat in elections now.
"During the 2006 local government elections in Senegal, Radio Sud used reporters and correspondents with cell phones to call in what they saw.
"All of this technology is very important and gives a powerful new tool that cuts the ability for cheating," LaGamma said.
Despite the positive developments brought by cell phones and other communication technology, there have still been problems with numerous elections in recent years.
"That said, new technology can be a powerful tool in improving communications between citizens and governments, between civil society organizations and the public.
Gellar said new technology could help achieve those goals to some extent, as communication was the key to overcoming oppression.
Gellar said the changes being brought about by cell phones and other communication technologies could well play a part in bringing more participatory governments to the continent.
