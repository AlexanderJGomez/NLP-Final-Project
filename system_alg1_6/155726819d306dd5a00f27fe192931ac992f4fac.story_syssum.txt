Why?
So -- in essence -- everyone can get free health care if they need it.
But there's no guarantee of prenatal care in the emergency department.
You can't get preventive care in the emergency department.
And even if you could, it wouldn't be free.
You'll get that emergent care, but you'll also be charged for it.
This is problematic because nonprofit hospitals are supposed to provide a certain level of charity care in exchange for their tax-exempt status.
But let's acknowledge that patients will be held accountable for the costs of their care, even in the emergency room.
So it's true that an emergency room won't let you die if you show up at the door, but short of that, you can't get care for a host of medical issues.
