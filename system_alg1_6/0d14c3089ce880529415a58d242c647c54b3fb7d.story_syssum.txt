(CNN) -- Bruce Levenson couldn't cut it as a successful NBA owner.
So if you are going to invest in the Atlanta Hawks of the NBA, a league that boasts the highest share of black television viewers, at 45% -- three times higher than the NFL or NCAA basketball -- and a player roster that is nearly 80% black, well, then you better have a smart business strategy to keep your core customers happy and attract corporate dollars at the same time.
Levenson has apologized for his tirade and said he will sell his controlling interest in the team.
And when Levenson and his partners realized that the arena was half-empty, the first questions Levenson should have asked are: Will sports fans pay money to watch this team play?
Levenson is now getting undeserved credit for reportedly going first to the NBA to confess that he sent the racist email before it was exposed.
And there's no arguing that he was right.
This year, he took his NBA team the Holocaust museum in Washington.
And the NBA is big business.
I say good riddance to Levenson and other NBA owners like him, of which I think there are few.
