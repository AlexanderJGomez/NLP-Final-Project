Police investigate the vehicle destroyed by a car bomb in Spain's Basque region.
The Spanish national police officer killed was Eduardo Puelles, said the new Basque regional president, Patxi Lopez.
ETA has threatened Lopez, who is a socialist and the first non-nationalist Basque president in 30 years.
There are about 600 ETA members or suspected members in Spanish jails and 150 others in French jails, authorities in both countries have told CNN.
