Hoh Indian Reservation, Washington (CNN) -- For the Hoh, life centers on the silver waters just off their reservation.
"We'd see the waves and the logs coming," Benally said standing in the musty ruin of the home.
Although the lowlands where her family lived were always prone to flooding, Benally said the water rises more often now.
There is little room for new buildings and even where there is it's unlikely they could be put up -- more than 90 percent of the reservation is in the flood plain, according to tribal leadership.
To rescue the tribe's future the Hoh leadership decided to move most of the reservation to higher ground and purchased new land for the expansion.
For Tribal Chairperson Maria Lopez, the move away from the water won't come soon enough.
"What would happen," Lopez asked, "if a tsunami comes while we are here?"
