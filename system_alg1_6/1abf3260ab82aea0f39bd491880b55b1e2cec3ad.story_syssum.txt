Mundane physical objects all around us are connecting to networks, communicating with mobile devices and each other to create what's being called an "Internet of Things," or IoT.
Smart homes are just one segment -- cars, clothing, factories and anything else you can imagine will eventually be "smart" as well.
Many standards already help smart devices communicate, though none has emerged as a dominant option yet.
"Because (the Internet of Things) is so vast and varied, it will be hard to come up with a 'one size fits all' standard," said Bartleson.
It also sells the chips that will go inside smart thermostats, security systems, cars and everything else.
Ben-Zur predicts the Internet of Things will be the third revolution.
But it's still to early to say for sure how all these devices will chat with each other and whether Qualcomm's AllJoyn or some other option will take off.
"Exposing that, how your toothbrush and your water heater and your thermostat ... are going to interact with you, with your school, that's what's next," said Ben-Zur.
