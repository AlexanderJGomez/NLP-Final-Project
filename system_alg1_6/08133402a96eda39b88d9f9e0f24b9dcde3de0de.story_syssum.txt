On the one side of the federal government shutdown are the people whose job it is to run that government: the Congress and the White House.
We pay federal income tax with one solitary and bedrock expectation: We are handing our money over so that the federal government will run.
We had no choice.
The people we have paid to operate it can blame each other all they want for what has happened.
The government is hurting for funds -- it needs the money.
When it doesn't, the people who paid for it to do just that have a right to propose that they are owed -- for services not rendered -- their money back.
