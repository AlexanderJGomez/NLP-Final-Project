To start, protesters say they're looking for answers about what happened to Freddie Gray, and why.
Police say when Gray saw police on April 12, he started running.
Protesters want to know exactly what happened in those 30 minutes, and say it's clear police used too much force when Gray was in their custody.
Five of the six officers involved in Gray's arrest have provided statements to investigators, the Baltimore Police Department said Wednesday.
Baltimore Police officials say they're being as transparent as they can about the case while their criminal investigation is ongoing.
The police union said it's 100% behind the officers and compared protesters to a lynch mob, accusing them of calling for charges against officers without knowing the facts of the case or giving them a day in court.
Some protesters say it's not the only time they've seen police brutality on the streets of their city.
The police union said in a statement on Wednesday that the reason for the settlements was simple: City officials believe lawsuits are too costly.
