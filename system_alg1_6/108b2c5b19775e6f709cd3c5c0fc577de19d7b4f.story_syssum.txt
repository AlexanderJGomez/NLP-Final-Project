(CNN) -- Once again, North Korea has violated an important international agreement by launching a long-range missile.
At the end of February, North Korea made an agreement with Washington to stop all missile tests and uranium enrichment in exchange for the United States to deliver 240,000 tons of food.
The United States and its allies warned North Korea to stop the launch, saying plainly, "Don't do it."
The true consequences of obtaining nuclear weapons, as North Korea has done, are becoming increasingly clear.
Since North Korea tested its first nuclear weapon in 2006, the country has become more of a threat to the region and the world.
And according to a leaked report from the United Nations, North Korea has become a supplier to the nuclear programs of Iran, Syria and Burma.
Because North Korea obtained nuclear weapons, its erratic behavior and appalling actions have become almost impossible to stop.
