Baras stumps for money from evangelical Christians to support Jewish settlements in the occupied territories -- land she calls biblical Israel.
They support Israel -- which to them includes Jewish settlements on the occupied West Bank.
Christofaro and Baras are part of a growing alliance between evangelical Christians and Israelis.
One of the most successful Jewish fundraisers, Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, raised $39 million last year from Christian Zionists to fund human services and humanitarian work in Israel and the settlements.
Baras said God called her to this work.
I was strengthening the Jewish presence here in Samaria," she said, referring to a biblical name for the northern part of the West Bank.
She said she fought back by encouraging support from evangelical Christians in America.
"It is a controversial issue here in Israel as to whether we should be partnering with the Christians in any way," Baras said.
But Baras said she isn't worried.
