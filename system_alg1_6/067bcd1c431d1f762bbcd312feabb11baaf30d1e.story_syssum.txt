Sean Penn plays San Francisco City Supervisor Harvey Milk in "Milk," directed by Gus Van Sant.
Civic elections might seem like small beer, but the persecution that compelled Milk to run for office is no trivial matter.
The strategy is sound; the execution, nearly flawless.
Penn is studied and thoughtful, impassioned and immediately sympathetic as Milk.
"Milk" may be a little too homogenized for some tastes.
