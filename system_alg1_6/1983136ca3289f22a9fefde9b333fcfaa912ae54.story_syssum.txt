The ground-based interceptor missile, launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, destroyed a long-range ballistic missile launched from Kodiak, Alaska, the Defense Department's Missile Defense Agency said.
In Friday's test, however, the target was a mock warhead and was supposed to be accompanied by "countermeasures similar to what Iran or North Korea could deploy," according to a missile defense agency official.
But O'Reilly said that the interceptor did differentiate between the actual missile target and the upper stage of the missile it had detached from.
But he later said he would support missile defense systems if they work.
Last month, the outgoing head of the Missile Defense Agency said that not only are U.S. missile defenses workable, they are up and running.
