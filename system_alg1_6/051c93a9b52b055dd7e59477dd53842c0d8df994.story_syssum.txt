Xiang first garnered attention for her sculptures of women.
Xiang says her work is always a kind of ongoing philosophical inquiry.
"I think art is possibly one of the ways, one of the channels, to help us to find out certain truths," she says.
One of the first artists to make an impression on her was Tian Shixin, a sculptor from Guizhou whose work Xiang first saw when she was at high school.
"I don't think art is like design, when one can have an inspiration here or an inspiration there."
Although her sculptures are strikingly lifelike, Xiang says she isn't aiming for realism.
"I want my art to awaken the sensibility of each onlooker, to awaken his body, so that his body can experience the sculpture.
And contemporary Chinese art has been born and developed within these last 30 years."
The ways for us to get to know the world have become more and more diverse.
In fact, it can be enormous."
