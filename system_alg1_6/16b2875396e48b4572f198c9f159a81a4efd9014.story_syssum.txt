China is the fastest growing market in robotics, and by 2014 it will top the global market, according to the International Federation of Robotics.
China is the world's largest auto market and European car manufacturers are setting up facilities in the region, all of which will be reliant on robotics.
As China's robotics industry catches up with others, the country's manufacturers are also looking at other ways to bring in income.
"Manufacturers will think --- hold on, if we put money into branding and charge more for products, we can retain our margin," said Thornton.
