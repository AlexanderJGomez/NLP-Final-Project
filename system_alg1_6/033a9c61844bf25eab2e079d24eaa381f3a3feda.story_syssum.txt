Speaker Nancy Pelosi says House Democrats will return to their districts ready to defend the bill.
The fate of health care reform also remains uncertain in the Senate, where the Finance Committee recently postponed its long-awaited vote on a bipartisan compromise plan until after the August recess.
On Thursday, 57 members of the House Progressive Caucus sent a letter to Pelosi and others complaining that the agreement with the Blue Dogs weakened language creating a government-funded health insurance option.
Opposition from progressive Democrats and some conservative House Democrats who want additional cost cuts could defeat the bill.
She also pointed out that the bill could change when the House and Senate negotiate a final measure in coming months.
Democrats had hoped the Finance Committee could finish its work before the August break to show progress toward health legislation.
