(CNN) -- Khaldoon Khalifa Al Mubarak is CEO of Mubadala Development Company.
CNN's John Defterios met Mubarak in Abu Dhabi and began by asking him about Mubadala's recent purchase of a 7.5 percent stake in the U.S. investment firm, Carlyle Group for $1.35 billion.
Mubarak: We've met with all the executives at Carlyle, we've looked at their track record.
We're confident in all the due diligence work we've done, and I think this investment will pay off handsomely for us in the years to come.
Mubarak: It's been a tremendous roller coaster ride over the last couple of years, and the growth in Abu Dhabi, the growth in the region and the growth that Mubadala has gone through is tremendous.
Mubarak: Well Ferrari has been a very exciting and interesting investment for us.
Two years later, we have a Grand Prix in Abu Dhabi.
Mubarak: Mubadala now is focusing on creating a good corporate institution.
Mubarak: Abu Dhabi has typically been very conservative in its approach.
