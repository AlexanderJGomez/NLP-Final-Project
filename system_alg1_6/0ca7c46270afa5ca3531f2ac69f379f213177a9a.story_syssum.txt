Daniel Muvia, a resident of Chibok who witnessed the attack on his village, says he is too scared to take his daughters to school.
"I am scared of sending them to school," he says.
Analysts say that if the Boko Haram attacks on schools continue unabated then those levels of illiteracy will significantly increase, further compromising the future of the country's young people.
"If in Chibok, I'll never go again," she says.
