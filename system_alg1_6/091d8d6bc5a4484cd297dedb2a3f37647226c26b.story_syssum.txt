San Francisco, California (CNN) -- Attorneys supporting the voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage in California filed a notice of appeal in the case Thursday, one day after a federal judge ruled that the measure is unconstitutional.
Walker's 136-page decision does a good job in laying out a compelling case for the unconstitutionality of the proposition, Callan said.
"The court's disregard for the historical purposes of marriage would require California to embark on a novel experiment with the fundamental institution of marriage," said Charles Cooper, lead counsel for Proposition 8 supporters, in a statement.
A lot of cases will be decided by the lower courts, and then they'll move in and make the big decision as to whether it's legal or not, gay marriage," he said.
Elated supporters of same-sex marriage gathered to celebrate the judge's opinion in the Castro district of San Francisco.
In a national survey, conducted by Gallup in May, 53 percent of respondents said such marriages should not be recognized by law, while 44 percent said they should.
We expected nothing different from Judge Vaughn Walker, after the biased way he conducted this trial," said Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage.
