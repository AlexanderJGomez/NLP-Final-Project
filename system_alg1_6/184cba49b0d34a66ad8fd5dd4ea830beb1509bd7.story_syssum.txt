"It's very, very important to keep that place open, giving good services" to the people of Juarez, De La Vega says.
Despite the violence, De La Vega's hospital and its staff -- which treats about 900 patients daily, regardless of their ability to pay -- have remained unharmed.
Why would they be against that?
De La Vega says she has lost friends and neighbors in the conflict, but she insists she's not afraid -- and she's determined to help the people of Juarez continue receiving the medical care they need.
De La Vega has always been passionate about health care, volunteering with the Red Cross when she was 8 years old.
One of De La Vega's first clinics was built in the early '70s where the Hospital de la Familia sits today.
For now, the hospital is funded entirely by a nonprofit organization called FEMAP-SADEC that was founded by De La Vega.
The Hospital de la Familia is just one of the organization's many health care facilities.
This is what gives me meaning to my life."
