It's commonplace in this country now: A deranged shooter appears, armed to the teeth, out of his mind.
The Second Amendment!
In the South, they were called "slave patrols," and they were paramilitary groups that regularly patrolled slave plantations to make sure restive slaves weren't going to rise up against their white overlords.Remember the line in the movie "Django Unchained"?
Patrick Henry, George Mason and James Madison knew, as they considered the Second Amendment, that it would be essential if they hoped to get the Southern states to ratify the brand-new U.S. Constitution.
James Madison, a slave-holder himself, had no doubt about the need to keep these slave militias going in the South.
In fact, at its headquarters in Washington, the words of the amendment are emblazoned right in front of the entrance.
The idea that owning a gun in America was an individual right only dates to the 1980s.
Of course, the Supreme Court did an end run in recent years around what the framers of the Bill of Rights actually intended.
It should be just fine to belong to a gun club and shoot skeet or whatever.
It's time for us to revisit the Second Amendment and get every assault weapon off the streets, for good.
