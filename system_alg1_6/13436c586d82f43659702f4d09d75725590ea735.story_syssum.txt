The Department of Energy this June specified "33 clean energy projects" of a larger scale as part of its "loans program."
Accounting for things like that, a report from the Brookings Institution non-partisan think tank this April tabbed the total green stimulus spending at $51 billion.
It is fair to say that the 2009 stimulus authorized $90 billion for green energy, as Romney asserted.
Most of the large projects that benefited from the Department of Energy loan program remain in operation -- contrary to Romney's assertion that "almost half" of them had closed.
