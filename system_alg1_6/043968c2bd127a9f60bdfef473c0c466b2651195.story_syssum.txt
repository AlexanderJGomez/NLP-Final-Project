The country's federal state of Lower Saxony became the last region to scrap tuition fees in mid-October, which means that studying in Germany is now completely free even for international students.
Germany has had a long tradition of free education, introducing fees only in 2006 when the constitutional court ruled that moderate tuition fees were not at odds with the country's pledge for education for all.
Social life for international students can also be harder to form, as many German students study in their home town and often live with their parents, or share an apartment with friends.
But if you negotiate those challenges successfully, Parke says that the German system offers freedom to expand your interests: "There is a lot less pressure on students because they are not paying for it, so it's more about the pursuit of learning than just passing an exam and forgetting everything.
