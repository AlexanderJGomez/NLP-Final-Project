Geoffrey Portway pleaded guilty in May to distribution and possession of child pornography and solicitation to commit a crime of violence, according to court documents.
When his home in Worcester was searched last year, authorities found tens of thousands of computer images and videos of child pornography and 4,500 exchanges of child pornography between Portway and the people he chatted with online.
"Geoffrey lived in a fantasy world where he did live-action role playing, did things online unrelated to child porn and cannibalism.
Photographs reviewed by CNN show handcuffs, rope intended for bondage, mouth gags, and castration tools.
"Portway's collection is truly chilling and demonstrates a real risk based upon which the Court should sentence Portway to a substantial term of years in order to protect the public," prosecutors said.
