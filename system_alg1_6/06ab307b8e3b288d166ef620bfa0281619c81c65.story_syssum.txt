And so it is.
To begin with, Marathon Monday is a holiday â€” Patriots Day, an annual commemoration of the Battles of Lexington and Concord.
To complete the celebration, Patriots Day marks the annual 11 a.m. Red Sox game at Fenway Park, an utterly local tradition concocted so baseball crowds wouldn't get in the way of marathon crowds.
To be honest, I have never attended the marathon in person, let alone run in it.
Sadly, the marathon will not be the same after today.
And we are.
