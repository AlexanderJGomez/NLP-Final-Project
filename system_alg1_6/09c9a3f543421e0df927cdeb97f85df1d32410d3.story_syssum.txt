The man Junger met was Ahmad Shah Massoud, the "Lion of Panjshir."
Massoud had a reputation for integrity and strength, says Junger, who traveled to Afghanistan in 2000 to profile Massoud for his book, "Fire."
Massoud became Afghanistan's most famous resistance leader after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979.
Shorish-Shamley, the women's rights activist, says Massoud was assassinated just before the 9/11 attacks because bin Laden feared Massoud.
After the Soviet army left Afghanistan, various Afghan resistance leaders cobbled together a coalition government to run the country.
When they gained control of Afghanistan, they pushed Massoud's army into the Panjshir Valley.
Marcela Grad, author of the book "Massoud," says he was the only Afghan resistance leader who never left the country to live abroad.
Junger, who had interviewed Massoud the year before, says he was crushed by Massoud's death.
"I want to follow in my father's footsteps," Ahmad said.
