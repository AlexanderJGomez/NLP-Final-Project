Michelle Phillips, Denny Doherty and John Phillips, here in 1998, were members of the Mamas & the Papas.
John Phillips, the band's primary songwriter, was at least six years older than the others and did not shy from the task of addressing the group's pain and confusion in song.
There was a 1971 reunion that produced the contractually obligated album "People Like Us," but the experience was "horrible," John Phillips recalled in the liner notes to the group's anthology, "The History of the Mamas and the Papas."
Michelle and John Phillips divorced in 1970; late that year, Michelle was married to Dennis Hopper for eight days.
According to Mackenzie Phillips, the affair with her father lasted 10 years.
She told Chynna Phillips, her half-sister, about the affair in the late '90s, according to an interview with Chynna in Us magazine.
John Phillips also underwent rehab but struggled for the rest of his life.
