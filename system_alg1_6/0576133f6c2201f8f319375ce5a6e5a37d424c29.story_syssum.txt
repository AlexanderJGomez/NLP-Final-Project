Sowell, 50, faces rape and kidnapping charges as well and also has been charged with brutalizing three other women and raping two of them, Mason said.
Authorities have said they are looking at the unsolved slayings of three women in East Cleveland to determine if they share any similarities with the remains found at Sowell's house.
Sowell has pleaded not guilty to charges in the September 22 rape.
Sowell threatened his victims and warned them not to contact police, Mason said.
He was required to register as a sex offender.
After the discovery of the 11 women, police in mid-November used thermal imaging in an attempt to see if any additional human remains were on the property and dug certain areas by hand.
