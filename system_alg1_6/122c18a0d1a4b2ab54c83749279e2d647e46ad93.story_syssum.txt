Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Hurling rocks and brandishing daggers and sticks, supporters of longtime President Ali Abdullah Saleh plunged into a crowd calling for his ouster in Sanaa on Friday as rising momentum in Yemen sprouted similar protests in other towns.
"I'm out here today because we want the president to go and we want to make sure that he and his family don't stay in power," said Khalid Amer, a student.
In Taiz, more than 10,000 anti-government demonstrators, including 4,000 women, gathered Friday in Freedom Square in a seventh straight day of protests, witnesses said.
Five people have been killed in Aden since Wednesday, hospital and government officials said.
Saleh has called for an investigation into the Aden violence, and Vice President Abdu Rabo Mansour Hadi met with the governor Thursday, Saba said.
In an attempt to quell growing discontent, Saleh, a U.S. ally in the fight against an offshoot of al Qaeda in Yemen, has announced he won't seek another term in 2013.
