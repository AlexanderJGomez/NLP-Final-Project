"Although it looks gorgeous and beautiful it is a park under pressure -- there are a lot of vulnerable species in this national park," said Tara Cameron, a local teacher and President of Blue Mountains Conservation Society.
Mark Jarvis, who runs a hotel in Katoomba, the main tourist town in the Blue Mountains, just an hour and a half from Sydney, said: "We're very concerned because the uniqueness of area revolves around the fact that we sit in between World Heritage parks.
She said: "Everybody is looking for how we can make national parks relevant into the future.
"I think national parks and nature is worth more than just being the new thing, the sort of new product," she said.
They're the bits that we've put aside for nature -- do we really need to encroach on those as well.
