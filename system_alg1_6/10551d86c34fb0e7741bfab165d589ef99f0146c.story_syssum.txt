London (CNN) -- Seven men have been arrested in the United Kingdom on suspicion of terror offenses, West Midlands police said Friday.
Those arrests were not related to the Olympic or Paralympic Games, police said.
However, it is understood that the individuals arrested in the West Midlands and West Yorkshire were not targeting the Olympics, nor did they have any links to those arrested Thursday in London.
The Metropolitan Police is leading the "largest peacetime operation" seen in the United Kingdom as it seeks to keep the public safe, it said, with up to 9,500 police officers from London and elsewhere to be deployed on the busiest days of the Olympics.
