A candidate's every word can now be captured by modern technology and live in e-perpetuity.
How can Mitt Romney contend with some of the things he said during the primary campaign which will come back to haunt him in the general election?
Romney desperately needs to improve his numbers with Latinos.
So, what's Romney to do?
From now until Election Day, when Romney gets asked an immigration question, he needs to start and finish by reminding Latinos that Obama promised, without caveats, to get immigration reform passed in his first year in office.
Romney needs to go from playing defense to playing offense on immigration.
If Romney can neutralize the immigration issue by moderating his tone, giving more nuanced answers and taking the offensive against Obama, then he can focus on other issues.
If he expects to make up the lost ground, Hispanics cannot be an afterthought.
Come Election Day, I don't know whether Romney is going to do better with Hispanics than the polls indicate or if Obama is going to do worse.
