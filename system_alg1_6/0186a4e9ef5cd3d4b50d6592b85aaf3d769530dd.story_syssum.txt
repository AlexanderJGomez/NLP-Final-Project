In nine out of the 10 burger samples, the horse DNA was found at very low levels, the authority said, but in one sample from Tesco, Britain's largest retailer, the horsemeat accounted for about 29% of the burger.
Alan Reilly, the chief executive of the Irish food authority, said there was a "plausible explanation" for the pig meat finding its way into the burgers, since meat from different animals is processed at the same plants.
Some Twitter users said they weren't surprised to hear about the questionable origins of the burgers, while others debated the ethics of eating horsemeat.
