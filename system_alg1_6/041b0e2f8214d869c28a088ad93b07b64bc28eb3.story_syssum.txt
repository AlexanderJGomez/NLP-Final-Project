(CNN) -- No one will know until June how the Supreme Court will rule on President Obama's Affordable Care Act.
The president may say he is confident the court will uphold the law, but it seems he's not entirely optimistic.
Although it may be hard to rouse conservatives to action right now since they don't know how the court will rule, it's better to be ready than not.
Voters will want to hear something from Republicans that indicates they know, care and want to deal with this problem.
If ObamaCare is rejected by the court, it would present a huge opportunity for Republicans.
