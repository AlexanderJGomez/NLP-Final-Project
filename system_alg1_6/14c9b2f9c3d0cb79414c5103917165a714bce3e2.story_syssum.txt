(CNN) -- Netflix has a new logo, but you're forgiven if you didn't notice.
Nor has Netflix mentioned the new logo on its social media pages, its website or even its iconic red DVD envelopes, which continue to show the traditional branding.
But a commenter on Reddit called the new logo a significant downgrade.
"I can see why they'd want to move away from a logo that says 'this service is mostly for movies' since they're making a big push for original TV-style content, but this revision loses the cinema aspect without gaining anything to replace it."
