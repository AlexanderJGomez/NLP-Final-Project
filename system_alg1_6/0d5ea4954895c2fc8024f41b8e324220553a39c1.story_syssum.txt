(CNN) -- The opening day of the World Cup brought joy and sadness to the host nation as Brazil won its first game, rallying to defeat Croatia 3-1.
With reporters descending on Sao Paulo for the opening match, protesters tried to make their way toward Arena Corinthians stadium and were met by tear-gas firing riot police.
"We did it!!!"
First, referee Yuichi Nishimura awarded Brazil an undeserved penalty kick.
Well, it appears from media reports that at least one -- possibly two -- didn't live to see themselves home.
It wasn't the first misstep of the day.
Perhaps they should have rescheduled and traveled during the Brazil-Croatia match; the roads of Sao Paulo were practically empty then.
