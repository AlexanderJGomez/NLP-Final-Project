Anneke van Woudenberg, senior researcher with Human Rights Watch, told Christiane Amanpour that 200,000 women and girls have been raped in Eastern Congo since 1998, and the condition of women has become more dire as the Congolese army has pressed a military campaign against armed groups in the countryside.
It's protecting them from rape," van Woudenberg said.
There have also been reports of members of the Congolese army, particularly high ranking officers, attacking women.
"No general has yet been held to account in Congo for rape, and it's high time that that changes."
Jean-Marie Guehenno, the former head of U.N. peacekeeping, told Amanpour that the international forces face a serious problem: Too few troops assigned to the vast inaccessible reaches of eastern Congo.
"What needs to be done is to have a state in Congo that can control its territory and that has the confidence of the people," Guehenno said.
My hope is that the women and girls of -- of eastern Congo in particular -- will continue to speak out.
