"I was excited and amazed that my bottle traveled all the way across the Atlantic Ocean," said Swearingen, 18.
"He was walking along the shore, and he saw the bottle and opened it," Swearingen said.
Swearingen said he had yet to speak with the Irish duo who found the bottle, but was looking forward to hearing their take on the find.
But he said the fact that it travelled thousands of miles ensured he learned a lesson from the experiment -- more than a year after taking part in it.
