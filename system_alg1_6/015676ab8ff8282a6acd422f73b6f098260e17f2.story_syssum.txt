(CNN)  -- Canada reserved the best to last as its ice hockey heroes beat arch-rivals the United States 3-2 with an overtime goal from Sidney Crosby to claim the final gold of the Winter Olympics.
The momentum now appeared to be with the United States, who had beaten Canada 5-3 in a preliminary round match.
It's the first victory for a host country in Olympic ice hockey since the famous United States triumph at Lake Placid in 1980.
