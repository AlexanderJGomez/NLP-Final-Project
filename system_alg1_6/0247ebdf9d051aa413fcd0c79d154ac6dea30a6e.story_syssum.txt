It is a society of potential, innovation, and opportunity.
It is said that Arab youth have faced tough challenges since the Arab Spring.
But unemployment in Jordan and the Middle East did not take us by surprise during the Arab Spring.
When it hit Jordan it was, by coincidence, around the same time of the Arab Spring.
Many of the world's young are uncertain of their future and their ability to find meaningful employment.
And we must remember that divided we are as fragile as separate fingers, but united we are a strong fist.
I do not believe the Arab Spring caused a "disrupted society."
Such an Arab Spring encourages innovation and creativity; it allows for thoughts and ideas to sprout that were once dormant.
