(CNN) -- Nearly 35 years after a Texas judge sentenced him to death, Ronald Chambers was found dead Monday morning on the floor of his cell.
On December 18, 1975, a jury found Chambers guilty of capital murder and a judge subsequently put him on the state's death row.
Excell White, who killed four people in 1974 and wasn't executed until 1999, spent more time -- 8,854 days -- on death row before being put to death than any other Texas convict.
