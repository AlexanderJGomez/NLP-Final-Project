With extreme eating habits like these, it may be some surprise to learn that within the Olympic Village there lurks a culinary trap that can potentially tip athletes over the fine line between success and failure at London 2012.
"For the younger athletes it's an exciting new experience," says sports scientist Jess Corones, who works with the Australian Olympic swim team.
Jamaica's 100-meter world champion Blake says he eats so many bananas to keep up his potassium levels.
However, it's rare for athletes to eat quite that much, says Corones, who first worked with Australia's track and field team at the 2004 Athens Games.
"We had our camp in Italy and all he used to eat every dinner was a bowl of raw mince.
You wouldn't get many athletes doing that these days."
"You can get vitamin D in food sources (such as eggs, dairy and fish) but it's not as effective as sunshine production," Stevenson said.
"Most athletes are using quite a few supplements.
We have hotlines where the athletes can call up and check anything, so it's pretty easy to find out if it's okay to take."
A big part of Corones' job is making sure athletes learn the right food habits -- and this generally means breaking eating patterns formed at a young age.
It's about trying to break those cycles and get them eating as well as they can."
