Given what Underwood did in the first season of the show, probably more than anybody anticipates.
It's a long way from the beginning of the first season, when Underwood was denied his desired job as secretary of state.
Willimon added that "House of Cards" isn't necessarily a show about politics, despite its Washington setting.
Naturally, Willimon and his stars have been tight-lipped about how far Underwood will take things in a show The Kansas City Star nicknamed "Mr. Macbeth Goes to Washington."
A New York Times Magazine profile of Willimon mentioned a "super-duper-double-major spoiler."
However the second season concludes, "House of Cards" has already been a winner.
In the meantime, one can only wonder whether a better Shakespearean parallel for Underwood is "Othello's" Iago, dropping poisoned hints in the president's ear.
"And we need to own that."
