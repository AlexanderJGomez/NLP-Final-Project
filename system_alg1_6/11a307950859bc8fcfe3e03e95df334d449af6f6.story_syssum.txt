"And I am going to detain Mr. Reeves, pretrial.
"...
Was the younger, more physically imposing Oulson killed in self-defense, as Reeves' lawyer claims?
Or did Reeves overreact -- to the idea that Oulson was texting his toddler daughter as movie previews played -- by taking out his gun inside the theater and firing, as the prosecution argues?
Soon after that, a "very agitated" Reeves left the theater, then returned a few minutes later.
Reeves and his wife both told police that Oulson began using foul language, and Reeves left to talk to a theater manager.
Asked, though, whether she saw Chad Oulson strike Curtis Reeves, she replied no -- though she said it's what her husband told her after the shooting.
None of whom said that they saw Reeves getting hit by anything beyond perhaps a bag or some kernels of popcorn before he opened fire.
That's when a hand extends in front of Reeves, from the seat where victim Chad Oulson was reportedly sitting, and appears to snatch something from Reeves -- the defense has repeatedly said Oulson threw popcorn -- and throws it into Reeves' face.
