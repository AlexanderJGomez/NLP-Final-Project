Zlitan, Libya (CNN) -- Firefighters battled a blaze caused by NATO airstrikes at a food-storage complex Monday in Zlitan, increasingly a front-line city in the conflict between Libyan government troops and rebels fighting to oust longtime ruler Moammar Gadhafi.
And another attack two days ago demolished what he described as a military base several hundred yards up the road, killing at least two people, he said.
"People here call NATO the crazy one which lost its sanity," said Ramadan Mohamad Ramadan, an official from the local city government.
Government officials said they were looking for the bodies of three people believed to be buried underneath, and said the bodies of eight people had been pulled out earlier in the day.
NATO forces had hit a number of targets near Zlitan that were "military in nature" Monday, the representative said.
In the afternoon, government minders brought journalists to the ruins of a mosque and school located in an all-but-deserted residential neighborhood several kilometers to the east of Zlitan's city center.
Monday's government tour of Zlitan was over, but the fighting there appeared to have barely begun.
