This is Japan's exclusion zone.
That's what strikes you first about the exclusion zone -- what you can't see, the people.
The signs of life can oddly be found among livestock roaming the region.
Tomioka, in the southern end of the exclusion zone, has a lower level of contamination than towns to the north and northwest of the plant.
On the pavement, the surface reads a radiation level of 0.042 millisieverts per hour, which is 10 times what you're exposed to in a dental x-ray.
But the rest of Tomioka sits empty, of people, of progress and an apparent future.
