(CNN) -- A severely disfigured woman received the nose, cheeks, upper jaw and facial tissue from a female cadaver in the first near-total face transplant in the United States, the woman's surgeon said Wednesday.
The patient is doing well, the doctors said.
Siemionow said the patient never saw a photo of the donor and said, "the donor never looks like the recipient.
Siemionow had medical and ethical clearance for a full facial transplant since 2004.
Dr. Eric Kodish, the professor and chairman of the Cleveland Clinic's Department of Bioethics, said doctors thought she would adhere to medications after the surgery.

The current face transplant patient understood the risk of rejection and of immunosuppressants, doctors said.
Doctors at the Cleveland Clinic said that because the patient has limited vision after the surgery, she has yet to see herself.
Siemionow said the patient will need re-educate her facial motion and need three to six months of nerve regeneration.
