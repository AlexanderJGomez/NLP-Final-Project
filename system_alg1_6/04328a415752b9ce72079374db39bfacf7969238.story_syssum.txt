In a written statement marking the formal end of U.S. combat there, Obama said the remaining 10,000 or so American troops in Afghanistan would still face danger but that the longest U.S. war ever was now history.
"Afghanistan is still a very dangerous place," Obama said at the New Jersey base.
Other U.S. officials — including Vice President Joe Biden and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel — have also marked the end of the U.S. combat mission in Afghanistan.
