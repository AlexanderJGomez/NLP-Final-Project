You eat too much sugar.
Most adults in the study, which looked at average adult sugar consumption between 2005 and 2010, ate or drank more than 10% of their total calories in added sugar.
About one in 10 adults took in 25% or more of calories from added sugar.
As a doctor, I see the consequences of excessive sugar intake every day.
In the study, those who consumed approximately 17% to 21% of calories from added sugar had a 38% higher risk of cardiovascular disease mortality  -- that means death because of heart or blood vessel failure -- than those who consumed approximately 8% of calories from added sugar.
Real life is another.
Look for yourself to see how much sugar is in the foods that you are eating.
