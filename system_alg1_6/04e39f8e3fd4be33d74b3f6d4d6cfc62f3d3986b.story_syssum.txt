The police dashcam video, released Friday, shows Cottonwood Police approaching the group of eight people -- all identified as members of the Gaver family -- around a large SUV in a Walmart parking lot on March 21.
The video then shows a police officer being put in a headlock and knocked to the ground.
Police charged four members of the family with assaulting an officer and resisting arrest.
