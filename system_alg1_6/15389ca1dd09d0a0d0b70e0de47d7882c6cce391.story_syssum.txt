Andrew Cuomo is calling for calm amid a back-and-forth of finger-pointing between activists, police leaders and elected officials following the execution-style murder of two New York City police officers this weekend.
And the leader of the city's largest police union directly blamed New York Mayor Bill de Blasio for the murders, saying the officers' blood is "on many hands," starting "on the steps of City Hall in the office of the mayor."
"I think Mayor de Blasio is doing the best he can under very difficult circumstances to hear all sides of the matter.
Cuomo also said the grand jury decision in Garner's chokehold death at the hands of a police officers "was seemingly wholly incongruous with what you saw in that video."
