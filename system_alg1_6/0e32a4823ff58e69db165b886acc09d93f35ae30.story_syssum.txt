Jonathon Walters didn't know where to begin.
Walters received his high school diploma through home schooling in 2006.
Walters was despondent.
Already heavy, Walters began packing on more weight in the weeks after his father died.
I was done feeling pain every second of every day.
"I was done quitting everything I started.
He left the doctor's office and started exercising the next day.
Soon, he was up to 3 miles a day and was down 50 pounds.
Walters now runs 10 miles a day, lifts weights and works out on machines at the gym.
This time, Walters is determined not to quit.
... Imagining my sons and wife without me, makes every ounce of effort I put in worth it."
