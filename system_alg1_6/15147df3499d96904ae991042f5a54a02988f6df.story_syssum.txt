Chelsea is in the middle of a heroin epidemic.
Betz says in Chelsea, one small dose of heroin runs $10 to $40 depending on size and quality.
They search the informant to make sure there is no pocketed  heroin or cash, and have the person hand over the drugs.
But Betz says Chelsea is not so different from any other town when it comes to drugs.
Betz says small cities often have a tougher battle against drugs than bigger cities because of lower income and resources.
What's more, much of the drug problem in Chelsea doesn't come from inside Chelsea, Betz says.
Still, Betz knows that each day is a new day, where the effort to end the heroin problem in Chelsea continues.
