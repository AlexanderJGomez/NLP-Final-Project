And even while Americans complain about how the current crop of immigrants aren't like their predecessors, they miss the irony: At the time, there were people who said the same thing about their ancestors; the Germans were thought to not be like the English, the Irish weren't like the Germans, the Italians weren't like the Irish etc.

Chinese and Indian immigrants have low levels of cultural assimilation.
Assimilation happens, whether the immigrants are ready or not.
That is something else that hasn't changed.
