"Beating is not the cause of death," said Meredith, who confirmed he'd met twice with McMillian's family.
They said McMillian had told "family and close friends that he was very concerned for his personal safety."
Reed, 22, was found in McMillian's wrecked SUV on Tuesday morning and was taken to a hospital.
He also received a master's in philanthropy and development from Saint Mary's University of Minnesota.
Patricia McMillian said that even though media reports since her son's death have labeled him as openly gay, his death likely had nothing to do with his sexual orientation.
