Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Fighting continued Monday as rival Libyan militias battled for Tripoli International Airport and the interim government said it was considering asking for international military help.
It said any commander that orders attacks on civilian facilities, including the airport, will face charges of murder.
The government said the customs building, maintenance building and some national security department planes had been destroyed.
"This is a temporary measure," the United Nations said in a written statement.
Other militias have tried to wrest control of the airport from the Zintan brigades for years.
The U.S. State Department said this past weekend it was concerned the fighting could lead to widespread conflict and backed the new government.
