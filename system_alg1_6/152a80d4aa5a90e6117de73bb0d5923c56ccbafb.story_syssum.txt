"Today, I came to here to select my next president and I hope that whoever it is... is a good person, who will help the people and bring changes to Afghanistan," said one voter at a Kabul polling station.
As much as they killed our children, our journalists and innocent women, we say no, we will go and vote because we are fed up.
"We need a good president so the bombings and war stops," said a Kabul voter who has two children.
Meanwhile, Afghan security forces killed more than 80 insurgents across the country and foiled several attacks against voting centers, Daudzai said.
Outgoing President Hamid Karzai was among those to cast his vote Saturday, adding his voice to those of Afghans across the nation as they chose their next leader.
The relatively trouble-free election day came in welcome contrast to the violence that overshadowed the run-up to the vote and is seen as a credit to the progress made by the Afghan security forces.
While formal turnout figures are not yet available, recent polling by the Free and Fair Election Foundation of Afghanistan found that 75% of Afghans said they wanted to vote despite the threat of violence.
But the two leading candidates in Saturday's election have said they would, and the third has said that he is in favor of signing the agreement.
The other frontrunner is Dr. Abdullah Abdullah who is associated with the Tajik ethnic group.
Abdullah is an eye doctor by training, who became Afghanistan's foreign minister under Karzai.
Karzai was chosen by Afghan leaders to head the country after the fall of the Taliban and won two subsequent presidential elections in 2004 and 2009.
