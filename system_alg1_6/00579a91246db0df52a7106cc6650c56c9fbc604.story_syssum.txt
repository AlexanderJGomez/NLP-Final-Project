Police were hunting for Ryan Alexander Jenkins after the death of Jasmine Fiore.
Earlier Sunday, Canadian authorities said they had credible information that Jenkins was in Canada and called on him to turn himself in.
Jenkins reported Fiore missing last Saturday night to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, authorities said.
According to court records in Las Vegas, Nevada, Jenkins was charged in June with battery for allegedly striking Fiore in the arm with his fist.
51 Minds is investigating what went wrong and taking steps to ensure that this sort of lapse never occurs again."
