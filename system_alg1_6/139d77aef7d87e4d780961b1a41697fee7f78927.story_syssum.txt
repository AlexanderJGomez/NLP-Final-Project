In response to a report that his health was failing and that he had been rushed to the hospital, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said Thursday that he had the best proof that his recovery from chemotherapy is advancing fine.
"I'm going to start practicing baseball or softball, both things," he said.
"I am my own answer," he said.
"It's normal now, but it could be lower," he said.
"The body was protecting itself," he said.
I used to box."
Chavez said that he called and wrote to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad seeking the hikers' release at the behest of actor Sean Penn.
Chavez said he considers Penn a friend, and after the two spoke about the hikers, he agreed to add his voice directly with the Iranian president.
