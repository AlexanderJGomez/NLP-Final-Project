A California artist is turning people into paintings.
Meade's work comes together in four steps -- painting, photography, art installations and performance art.
"A lot of people ask me where I went to art school, but I didn't study art.

Meade got her big break when a post about her work went viral.
And my friend wrote in the comments, 'You should check out Alexa Meade's work,'" she said.
"When I first started out, it was impossible to get people to model for me," she said.
"It's always a risky thing to go for the improbable," she said.
