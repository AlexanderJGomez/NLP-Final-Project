I spent much of my time in line for the next ride of the day, the Batman roller coaster, reading about the potential for roller coaster deaths and accidents.
There's something about a roller coaster death that is uniquely terrifying in a screenplay kind of way.
After Esparza's death, Sen. Ed Markey, the Democrat from Massachusetts who recently took the seat vacated by John Kerry, has reportedly renewed his call for federal oversight of roller coaster inspection.
Tracy Mehan, from the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, said that relatively little is known about the prevalence of roller coaster injuries and deaths because the federal government doesn't enforce safety inspections and investigations.
Would-be roller coaster regulators have been criticized as needlessly scaring people about the dangers of roller coasters.
But that framing is misleading, given how little is known about national roller coaster injuries.
Regardless of the stats, however, it's the joy-gone-wrong factor that makes roller coaster deaths particularly horrifying.
Roller coaster fans should support a review of safety requirements.
