Pilot Sam Egli took John Paskievitch, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey, and Lopez, a post-doctoral researcher, about 6,500 feet up the volcano on Wednesday.
Some volcanic earthquakes quakes are caused by moving magma, water or gas, Lopez said.
"Even though it wasn't that cold, it was pretty foul when you were outside," Lopez said.
"I felt really luck to be with those people," Lopez said.
Lopez said he hoped to check on the condition of the helicopter, where the researchers had to leave their instruments.
