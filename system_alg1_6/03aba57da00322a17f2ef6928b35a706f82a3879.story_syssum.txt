So how do you become a Davos delegate?
And once in Zurich there's the small matter of the transfer to Davos.
Finding accommodation in Davos during the week of the World Economic Forum is not easy, with a limited number of large hotels.
With all the above boxes ticked, it is essential to have a plan once you have run the gauntlet of airport-style security -- there are 4,000 Swiss troops in Davos this week -- and made it inside the newly-extended Congress Center with the correct color of identity pass.
$40,000-per head well spent.
