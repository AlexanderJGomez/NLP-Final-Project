David Croom of Apache Junction, Arizona, hasn't seen his 18-year-old son in more than a week.
"He's never been in the wild before," David Croom said.
Like McCandless, Johnathan Croom is apparently traveling with very few belongings: perhaps a small backpack and his phone, his father says.
The teen has been a main topic of conversation in Riddle, a logging and ranching community of about 1,300 with no traditional grocery store and no movie theater.
"It's 2Â½ miles from the major interstate; it's right in town in Riddle," Huston said of where Croom's car was found.
"
"He's been watching the movie a lot," he said.
Now joining searchers on foot and driving up logging roads in and around Riddle, David Croom hopes McCandless' story may hold some answers.
"I got a phone call from a logger who said he saw a young man with the same grin as my son on one of the logging roads, so a bunch of local volunteers are going to blanket the area."
"They are doing the best they can, every drop of sweat, every footstep, I just wish we can do more," he said.
