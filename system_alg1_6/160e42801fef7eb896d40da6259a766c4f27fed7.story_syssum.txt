(CNN) -- With her glamorous looks and exceptional talent, Nigerian movie star Genevieve Nnaji is one of Africa's most successful actresses.
GN: Nigeria is a unique and a peculiar country, and as the people, we are too.
We do have that bond and I think it has to do with our background and how we are raised....I would never live anywhere else to be honest, no.
GN: You never get completely used to it, like the last time I was here for the other premiere -- "Bursting Out" -- it was pretty overwhelming.
GN: Thanks to Oprah (Winfrey), it's very, very flattering, I mean not just because I'm compared to (Roberts) but because of who compared me to her.
So it's an honor to be honest but I think it's probably the vein we have on the forehead, I think that's what we have in common.
