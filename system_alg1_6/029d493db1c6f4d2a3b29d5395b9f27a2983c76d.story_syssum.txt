Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- The man accused of killing 77 people in a bomb-and-gun rampage in Norway last summer said his actions were justified to save the country from multicultural forces as he went on trial Monday.
Breivik says his rampage was meant to save Norway from being taken over by multicultural forces and to prevent ethnic cleansing of Norwegians, said his lawyer, Geir Lippestad.
The police were so close," said Jorn Overby, who rescued some 15 people from the waters off Utoya during the massacre.
But Breivik's defense will try to prove he was sane at the time of the killings, Lippestad said Monday.
It is important to Breivik that he be considered sane, Lippestad said after the hearing.
But lawyers for the victims said: "No one thought he was crying for the victims."
In a report released this month, two court-appointed psychiatric experts said Breivik was sane at the time of the killings.
That's part of our democratic society," Stoltenberg said.
We didn't go down that road, and that was, I think, a big victory."
