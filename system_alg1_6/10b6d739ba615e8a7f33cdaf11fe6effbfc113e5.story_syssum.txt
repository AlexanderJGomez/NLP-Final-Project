(CNN) -- A federal court has ruled in favor of Texas, which wants to ban state funding for Planned Parenthood affiliates participating in a health program for low-income women because the family planning network performs abortions.
The Texas Women's Health Program provides about 130,000 low-income women with family planning exams, related health screenings and contraception.
Planned Parenthood sued Texas, winning an injunction against the law by arguing that abortion is constitutional and Texas' efforts would block women's access to preventive health care.
The program does not pay for abortions, and participating Planned Parenthood clinics in Texas do not perform the procedure.
Planned Parenthood says 3% of all its health services are abortion services.
Texas also slashed funding for family planning clinics.
