Even the most sprawling modern-day gaming experiences, such as "World of Warcraft" and "Call of Duty: Black Ops," still bow to the classic game design principle of keeping play easy to learn but hard to master.
It's that although the games are easy to start playing and enjoying, they increase in depth and complexity as the player gains more skill.
Make no mistake: Hardcore gaming enthusiasts do demand more value and substance from their titles than casual gamers.
No designer appreciates admitting that behind all the fancy mission types, play modes and monsters, their basic play concept amounts to "checkers with a twist," or simply tapping the right keys on cue.
