I couldn't tell when it would end because I couldn't even see my hands.
They weren't.
Within a year, I had co-edited "Covering Catastrophe: Broadcast Journalists Report September 11," donating the proceeds to 9/11-related charities.
The president called the museum a "sacred place of healing and of hope."
We were covered in the same ash and were choking on the same smoke.
Museum officials tell me it's one of several survivor artifacts and is displayed alongside a written portion of my story.
My hope is that by supporting the Memorial and Museum, I am, in some small way, honoring those who died and recognizing fully that I am still one of the lucky ones.
