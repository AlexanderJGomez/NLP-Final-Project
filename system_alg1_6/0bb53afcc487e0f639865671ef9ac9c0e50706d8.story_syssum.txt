says our Boeing VIP tour guide.
We're about to walk knee-deep where Boeing gives birth to some of the world's biggest and most advanced airliners, including the 747-8 Intercontinental, the 777 Worldliner and the 787 Dreamliner.
But not so fast -- before we go inside, Boeing has laid down some rules: no photos, no video, for our eyes only.
Suddenly, we're surrounded by partly assembled airliners in a room so big it takes on the feeling of an entire world.
Boeing paints the tails before they're attached to the planes.
The "Wing Build" area -- where workers attach wings to the planes -- is the loudest part of the entire facility.
"Conversation-restricted area," says one sign.
In fact, Boeing says it's so big you could fit the body of a 737 airliner inside it.
Just a few hours earlier, a handful of aviation geeks were hanging out at a hotel next to Paine Field, the airport Boeing uses to test and deliver the factory's planes.
In the entire world, there are only four of these giant planes.
Boeing uses them to ferry big sections of the 787 for final assembly here in Everett.
"It's someone who always looks up in the sky when they hear a jet roar," says Ryan Ewing, 14, who runs airlinegeeks.com out of his Bethesda, Maryland, home.
The following day southeast of Seattle, Boeing opens up yet another factory for us to tour.
"Avgeeks love getting access to places that are off limits," says Brown.
— Workers attach wings to the fuselages.
—The planes also get "winglets" — the tiny, upward pointing wings you see on the wingtips of 737s and other airliners.
Driving off the property, we spot a train loaded with brand new wingless 737 fuselages headed to the factory behind us.
