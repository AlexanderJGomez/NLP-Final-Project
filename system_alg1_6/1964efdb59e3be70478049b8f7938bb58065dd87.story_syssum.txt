The NTSB says the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority reported the problem during a post-accident review of track circuit data, but it was not immediately clear if operators were aware of the problem before the accident.
According to the NTSB, which is investigating the crash, maintenance records show that an "impedance bond" for the track circuit where the accident occurred was replaced June 17.
Since the accident, the transit authority has stopped using a computer system designed to avoid collisions and is operating the trains manually, leading to delays.
