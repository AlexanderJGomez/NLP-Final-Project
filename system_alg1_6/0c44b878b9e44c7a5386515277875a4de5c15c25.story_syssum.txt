The 30-second commercial was paid for by Americans for Job Security, a conservative-leaning group which, according to the nonpartisan watchdog group OpenSecrets.org, has spent nearly $8 million against Democratic candidates nationwide.
"We have no idea who these individuals are," Boucher said.
Groups such as Americans for Job Security are outside the Democratic and Republican parties and are likely benefiting from a Supreme Court decision earlier this year.
Another conservative group, Americans for Prosperity, expects to raise and spend about $35 million this election.

Phillips said the president's attacks have actually helped Americans for Prosperity raise more money.
Democrats have their own groups supporting them, such as Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund and Citizens for Strength and Security Action Fund, which are not disclosing their donors.
Our Community Votes is yet another Democratic group that does not disclose its donors.
Craig Varoga, a longtime Democratic strategist who runs Patriot Majority, told CNN his group will significantly step up spending in the final three weeks before the election.
"They don't have to do it [reveal donors] in real time," said Levinthal of OpenSecrets.org.
And although American Families First Action Fund is required to disclose who funds it, CNN is told that the group itself was one of the secret donors to the Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund in its ad against Pearce.
These sources say the president has made it harder to persuade Democratic donors to contribute to their outside groups, which for better or worse, are emerging as significant players in this year's election.
