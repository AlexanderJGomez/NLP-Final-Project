Since 2008, an independent panel of experts that advises the federal government on preventive care has discouraged the use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests -- a type of blood test -- to screen for cancer in men ages 75 and up.
National survey data shows that 43% of men in that age bracket underwent PSA screening in 2005.
The media coverage surrounding the 2008 guidelines has been hard to miss, he says, and although there may be a "subset" of specialists who are "consciously or unconsciously" overscreening and overtreating their patients, most PSA tests are ordered by primary care physicians with no financial stake in a diagnosis.
"Physicians and patients latch onto the concept of screening for cancer and catching cancers early," Eggener says.
Even among men in the 75-and-over bracket, Eggener says, screening might make sense for certain patients.
