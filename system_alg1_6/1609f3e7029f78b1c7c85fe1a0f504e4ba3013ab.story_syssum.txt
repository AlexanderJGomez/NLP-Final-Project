His family said he was arrested in August while visiting his grandmother and other relatives in Iran and that his statement had to have been coerced.
"I really like him," said Condon, who identified Hekmati from the images released by Iranian state television.
"We are deeply concerned that Amir is not receiving a fair trial and has not been afforded due process," said a family statement released last week.
The family said their son was being represented by a government-appointment lawyer.
And Condon said Hekmati recently worked for a company that produced language-training material for the U.S. military.
Condon said she fears Hekmati's military history drew him unwelcome attention in Iran.
"You feel so helpless, because it seems like there's nothing you can do."
