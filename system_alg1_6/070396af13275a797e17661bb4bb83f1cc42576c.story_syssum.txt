(CNN) -- Microsoft's Bing search engine will not follow Google out of China.
Will Microsoft manage its legal obligations to the Chinese government in a way that helps legitimize and prolong current censorship practices, or in a way that helps reduce censorship over time -- or at the very least increases transparency and accountability to Chinese citizens?
While Microsoft intends to stay engaged in the China market, he said it does try to push back quietly against efforts to restrict peaceful political expression.
As it happens, the way Microsoft handles censorship in China has changed since it launched a Chinese version of its search engine and rolled out a Chinese-language blog-hosting service in 2005.
In February 2006, executives from Cisco, Yahoo, Microsoft and Google were summoned to a congressional hearing in Washington.
Then why, human rights activists and legal experts asked, were they responding to requests made by Chinese authorities using no pretense of legal process?
Bing seems to censor a bit less than the Chinese Baidu but a bit more than Google.cn did.
Earlier this month, Chinese Minister of Industry and Information Technology Li Yizhong told the international press that foreign Internet companies must obey Chinese laws.
Will Bing comply only with those censorship requests that have a clear basis in Chinese law and which are made through a legally binding, documented and accountable process?
