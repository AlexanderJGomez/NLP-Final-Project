The Hastert Rule is named after former Speaker Dennis Hastert, who did not bring bills to the floor unless those bills were supported by a majority of House Republicans.
But the shutdown and the upcoming showdown over raising the debt limit underscore Boehner's leadership dilemma -- almost any bill that a majority of House Republicans support is dead on arrival in the Democratic-controlled Senate.
In 1995-96, when the federal government last shut down, 34% of House Republicans represented districts that Bill Clinton won in 1992.
There is almost no electoral incentive for these members to compromise.
Convincing House Republicans to pass the Senate's funding bill and re-open the federal government will require him to lead in a way that may not be possible, should he wish to remain speaker.
No House speaker wants to go down in history for a legislative record opposed by the majority of his or her own party.
