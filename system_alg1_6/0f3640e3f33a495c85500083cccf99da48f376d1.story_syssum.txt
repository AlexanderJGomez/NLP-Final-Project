The good news, however, is that the Google Maps app is excellent.
Google Maps has years of experience perfecting data accuracy and the latest app shows it.
Now, people love to talk about how much they hate the Apple Maps app.
One of the biggest gripes about Apple Maps was that it didn't come with public transportation directions.
Although Google Maps incorporates 2D and 3D views via Street View, as well as the rotating and tilting of maps with gestures inside the app, we still prefer Apple's design.
As a bonus for developers -- and app users alike -- Google announced Google Maps SDK for iOS, which gives app developers the opportunity to use maps within apps for the iPod Touch, iPhone and iPad.
