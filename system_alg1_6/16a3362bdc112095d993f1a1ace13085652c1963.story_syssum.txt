(CNN) -- Syrian security forces were commanded to shoot unarmed protesters, according to military and security agency defectors interviewed by a human rights watchdog.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group, said 1,410 civilian and 348 members of army and security forces have been killed over the last four months.
The United States and other countries have denounced Syria's tough crackdown on peaceful protests, and a visit to the restive city of Hama by the U.S. ambassador to Syria this week has drawn sharp criticism from the Bashar al-Assad regime.
