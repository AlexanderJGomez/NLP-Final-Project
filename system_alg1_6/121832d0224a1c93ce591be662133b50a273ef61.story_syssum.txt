Fans of all ages were filling the huge stadium, not to see a professional game but to watch the state's high school football championships.
It was an incredible view of the massive stadium.
These young men's lives had been changed on the gridiron; would they feel strange about going back onto a football field?
Canales and the Gridiron Heroes were thoroughly enjoying the game.
Eddie was excited about the gesture of support from the "governing bodies" of Texas high school football.
The game ended, and we headed onto the field, which was swarmed with players, coaches, fans and the media.
This was one experience I'll certainly remember for a long time.
