There were three children -- all cousins -- at the home at the time of the incident,  said Detroit Deputy Chief Rodney Johnson.
There was an adult present in the house, but that person was a family friend and unrelated to the children, Johnson said.
He died after accidentally shooting himself in the head, police said.
