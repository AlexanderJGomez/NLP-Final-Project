Up to 1 meter (3.2 feet) of water was expected in some areas, said Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, as the Chao Phraya River spilled into the city of 12 million people.
"Many are exhausted and some problems cannot be controlled and were not caused by (the center)," Yingluck said, according to MCOT.
"We are confident that we will not be affected," Toopetch said.
Thanyarat Hemkittiwat said she was planning to leave Bangkok to stay with relatives outside the city.
The floods, caused by monsoon rains that saturated rivers, have killed 373 people nationwide and affected more than 9.5 million people, authorities said.
