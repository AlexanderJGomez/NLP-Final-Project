The PS4 sold 1.25 million units in the United States during November, while the Xbox One sold 750,000, said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Morgan, in a recent note to investors.
"These are two systems that are well-balanced to keep the furious battle between Xbox and PlayStation going for the next decade ... which can only be good for gamers everywhere," says David Hutchinson, chief video games writer for The Times of London.
Both systems are essentially PCs in a console shell," explains Hutchinson.
Seven years ago, Microsoft pushed development on the Xbox 360 so that they could put their console on the market a year ahead of the PlayStation 3.
"Xbox were wise to backtrack on their initial idea that you wouldn't be able to easily resell secondhand games or pass old games onto friends more than once," says Hutchinson.
"Casual gamers I think have moved on most likely to mobile platforms.
Smith says: "[Xbox One] does gaming as well, but it is targeted towards a much broader audience and I think there is a risk in that gamers look at it and say: 'This is not for me, this is not built for gamers first' ...
Long may this continue."
