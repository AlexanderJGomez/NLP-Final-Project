Akmal Shaikh, 53, has been informed by the Chinese authorities that he will be executed, said Seema Khan and Latif Shaikh, first cousins of the condemned man.
But Khan and Shaikh said they are nevertheless "hoping the Chinese government will show some compassion."
Britain too has asked China not to execute Shaikh.
He would be the first European Union citizen executed in China in 50 years, Reprieve said.
"We deeply regret that mental health concerns had no bearing on the final judgment despite requests by Mr. Shaikh's defense lawyer and repeated calls by the prime minister, ministers, members of the opposition, as well as [the] European Union," the British Foreign Office said last week.
The man said he knew people in Kyrgyzstan who could help Shaikh become a pop star.
Forensic psychologist Peter Schaapveld said he suspects Shaikh is suffering from a severe mental disorder.
