Marshals Service, the number of threats against federal judges and prosecutors has mushroomed from 500 in 2003 to 1,278 in 2008.
There are no statistics on the number of threats against state and local judges.
Marshals Service, which is responsible for the protection of federal judges, installed an elaborate camera surveillance system at Walton's house.
Fagan says the people sending the threats are "individuals frustrated with the legal system" who "feel that they have not gotten their day in court."
Fagan says the threats often escalate as a case moves through the legal system.
That tragic case has led to better reporting of threats against judges, according the the U.S.
But Walton has his own theory on why the volume of threats has increased.
