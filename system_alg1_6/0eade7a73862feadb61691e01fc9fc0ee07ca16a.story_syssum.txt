Speaking to anchor Brian Williams in a Moscow hotel, Snowden said he considers himself a patriot, and he wouldn't have gone to such lengths to reveal secret U.S. government surveillance programs if he didn't have to.
Snowden has been living for nearly a year in Russia, where the government has granted him temporary asylum.
"I have no relationship with the Russian government at all," he told NBC.
Snowden said he would eventually like to return to the United States.
They don't seek asylum in Cuba.
In another excerpt from the interview, Snowden sought to bolster his credentials, arguing that the U.S. government has tried to downplay his skills and work experience.
"I was trained as a spy in sort of the traditional sense of the word -- in that I lived and worked undercover, overseas, pretending to work in a job that I'm not -- and even being assigned a name that was not mine," Snowden said.
But civil libertarians, technology companies and others oppose it, noting the lack of transparency.
