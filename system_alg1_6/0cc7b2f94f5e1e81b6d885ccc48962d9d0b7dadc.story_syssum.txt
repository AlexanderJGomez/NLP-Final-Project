HOLLYWOOD, California (CNN) -- Director Antoine Fuqua, the force behind films such as "Training Day" and "Shooter," turned his focus to creating CNN's exclusive short film "From MLK to Today," which airs at 7 p.m.
Antoine Fuqua: Because it's Martin Luther King, and because it's Barack Obama's story.
So why wouldn't I be here?
I don't think you can ever forget Martin Luther King and many other people who sacrificed, whose names we don't even know.
I didn't really know what it meant.
Fuqua: I remember a lot of racism.
Fuqua: Not really.
Fuqua: When I was a little kid, I used to sleep in my grandmother's basement, and I would read magazines, and books and things -- and I would dream of places I would go.
It reminded me of my world -- in the sense of being a young kid on the streets, growing up, seeing a lot of provocative images that I was probably too young to see -- and I would express them, and I would do little illustrations or I would paint on a wall.
Fuqua: Never.
You know, you need to have a white movie star in it."
So if Hollywood's not ready to embrace more stories about African-Americans -- and that's based on the money that the movies make -- then would the country really be ready to embrace a president?
[Fuqua directed Washington in the 2001 action-thriller "Training Day."]
Fuqua: It is the passing of the torch between Martin Luther King and Barack Obama.
Fuqua: Hope.
