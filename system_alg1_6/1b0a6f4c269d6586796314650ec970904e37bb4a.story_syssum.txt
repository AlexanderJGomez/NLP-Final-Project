(CNN) -- Manchester City's misfiring start to the English Premier League season continued on Saturday with a 2-1 loss to West Ham United at Upton Park.
The win keeps West Ham in fourth place with 16 points, one point behind City who failed to make up ground on league leaders Chelsea.
The win gave Arsene Wenger a first league win in four matches and lifts the Gunners up to fifth with Swansea City one place behind following a 2-0 win at Leicester City.
Their spectacular lack of league victories -- the latest defeat leaves Dortmund hovering above the relegation places in 15th -- is in stark contrast to the club's Champions League form where they are riding high in Group D with three wins from three matches.
Bremen are without a win this season and are currently anchored to the foot of the table with four points from nine matches.
Bayern Munich will go six points clear at the top of the table if they beat Borussia Monchengladbach on Sunday.
