NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Viewers may have to get used to a steady stream of reruns now that television and film writers have gone on strike.

While studios have been hoarding scripts for months in anticipation of a strike, some television shows that are more topical -- particularly late-night TV talk shows -- are expected to immediately go to reruns.
However, he said, the writers need new contracts that incorporate new media's impact.
The union's statement early Monday morning said that while it chose to withdraw its DVD proposal -- which they say would have doubled writers' residuals -- the studios and production companies were still insisting on a framework concerning Internet distribution that "makes a mockery of any residual," the statement said.
And, as video iPods and Internet downloads increasingly supplant traditional television and movie theaters, writers confront a changing industry.
If the strike lingers, the WGA faces the danger of writers opting out of full membership for "financial core" status, which would allow them to return to work.
