WASHINGTON (CNN) -- There is "no remaining hope" of finding six men trapped for almost a month in a Utah coal mine alive, a federal official said Saturday.
"We basically told the families that at this point in time we've run out of options," Stickler said at a news conference late Friday.
There were no public statements Saturday from Bob Murray, president and CEO of Murray Mining, co-owner of the Crandall Canyon Mine, who was the outspoken face of the rescue operation for the first three weeks, then largely disappeared from public view.
Murray said last week that the search effort would stop if no signs of life were found at the sixth hole.
MSHA's Stickler said that hole was drilled into the Crandall Canyon Mine on Thursday, but there were problems with a robotic camera that teams were trying to lower into it.
Murray said last Saturday he has already filed paperwork with federal regulators to permanently close and seal the Crandall Canyon mine.
