Professor Elwood, whose previous work showed that prawns endure pain, said his research highlighted the need to investigate the treatment of crustaceans used in food industries.
In the research, wires were attached to shells to deliver the small shocks to the abdomen of some of the crabs within the shells.
"There has been a long debate about whether crustaceans including crabs, prawns and lobsters feel pain," said Professor Elwood in a press statement.
But Professor Elwood says that in contrast to mammals, little protection is given to the millions of crustaceans that are used in the fishing and food industries each day.
"There is no protection for these animals (with the possible exception of certain states in Australia) as the presumption is that they cannot experience pain.
