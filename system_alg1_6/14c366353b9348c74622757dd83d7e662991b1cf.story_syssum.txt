What I didn't realize at the time was that soccer would do more for me than I could ever imagine.
That's why I wrote the book series, "The Kicks," to show girls the importance of maintaining confidence when faced with new (and sometimes scary!)
I joined a team with women who I had looked up to for years, and at just 20, how was I supposed to fit in with them?
It's important that as women, we stand up for ourselves, stand up for our peers and show the power that confidence can have for women everywhere.
