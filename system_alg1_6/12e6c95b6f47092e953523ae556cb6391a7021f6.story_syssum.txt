"We're having a generation of amputees," said one medical worker.
"What I fear is that if I can't walk, I can't go to school and I can't go to church," said a boy who lost his foot in the earthquake.
Amputees may have trouble getting to work, she said, and the problem is compounded if those people perform manual labor, which requires greater use of their limbs.
Parents of children with lost limbs may also find it hard to adapt, she said.
Even before the earthquake, he said, "we were only really touching the need at the time."
Used prosthetics will be particularly beneficial in Haiti, where manufacturing artificial limbs is likely to be difficult, said Heather Mills, a U.N. Association goodwill ambassador.
"I'm fully aware that they're not going to need the limbs for weeks, but it takes weeks to coordinate," Mills said.
Handicap International is also expanding its staff to around 100, and they will train local prosthetic technicians to meet the needs of amputees in the long term, Stuart said.
"Prosthetics need to be fitted -- they're not off the shelf -- so you need technicians there," Stuart said.
