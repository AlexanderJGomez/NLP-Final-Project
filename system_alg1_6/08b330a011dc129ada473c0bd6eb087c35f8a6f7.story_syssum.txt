Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- The gunbattle was so close it rattled the walls.
I saw at least 20 wounded people carried away.
Then there was another rumor about what was in the lobby of this hotel.
And then I saw the bodies.
We were told that the priest had blessed the bodies even though people were still trying to find out who the victims were.
We were told later that in all 13 people had been rushed into this hotel, three of them clinging to life.
Outside, gunfire still rang out.
