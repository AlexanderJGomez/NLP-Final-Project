(CNN) -- Just one week ago Republicans were united, railing against the man-made evil known as Obamacare.
So the plan to defund Obamacare -- and tie it to a measure to fund the government -- was hatched.
At that moment, Cruz morphed from the Pied Piper of House Republicans into the man on the Most Wanted sign.
The Senate passed a clean bill to fund the government, and the rest is history.
So Republicans had accomplished the seemingly impossible: They trampled their own message on Obamacare.
Great strategy.
So what to do?
And some cooler heads I have spoken with are privately making the same point: Wasn't it always unfair to promise people something the Republicans knew they could never deliver (defunding Obamacare)?
In the end, they will probably find a short-term way to fund the government and raise the debt ceiling and continue to argue over spending and taxes.
But the House GOP scheme, abetted by Cruz and outside conservatives, will become a case for the civics classes.
