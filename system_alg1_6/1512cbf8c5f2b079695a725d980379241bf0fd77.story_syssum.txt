(CNN) -- A graduate student is suing a Georgia university, alleging that professors are requiring her to change her "biblical views" on homosexuality or be expelled from the counseling program there.
In a statement to CNN, Augusta State said it "does not discriminate against any individuals on the basis of their personal, social, political, or religious beliefs or views.
French said the remediation program itself seeks to change Keeton's beliefs.
French said Keeton has repeatedly told the counseling department she would uphold the valid code of ethics of the American Counseling Association.
French said the counseling department has imposed its own set of values to "cleanse" Christianity from students' belief system, violating its own ethics code.
