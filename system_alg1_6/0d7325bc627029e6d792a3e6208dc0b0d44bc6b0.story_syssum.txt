Those who have been following the recent soap opera at the University of Virginia may think that it has to do with the blundering dismissal of the president, Teresa Sullivan, and her subsequent re-engagement by the Board of Visitors under instruction by the governor of the state to put their house in order or resign.
But in place of chanting "Close the university," on this occasion the students, faculty and others assembled on the quad claimed the right to open the university as their own and called for the right to select their own leader -- their own president.
When the president was furtively fired without a legitimate process, we witnessed a back-of-the-hand slap by Marie Antoinette.
Process becomes substance.
In the case at the University of Virginia, the leader of the board, Helen Dragas, was exposed as having disregarded "the way we do things."
In this case, the fact that the media have not made much about the women in the showdown demonstrates how far we have come in contemporary America.
