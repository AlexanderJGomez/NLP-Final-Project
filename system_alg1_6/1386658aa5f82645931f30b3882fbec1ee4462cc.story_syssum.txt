(CNN) -- If body language is a good gauge of political standing, Li Keqiang is looking very much like China's premier-in-waiting.
When he visited Hong Kong University last year, he delivered part of his speech in English -- a gesture that prompted debate in the mainland.
The son of a minor county official in Anhui, a poor province where Hu was also born, Li was a teenager when the decade-long Cultural Revolution interrupted his schooling.
"Like everyone in our generation Li Keqiang was keen for new ideas," recalls Yang Baihui, an international politics major.
Li did not stand for elections -- he happened to have an off-campus internship -- but as chairman of the student federation he spent time with politically active students like Wang Juntao, who campaigned but failed to get a seat.
Li rose through the ranks of CYL while completing a master's degree in law and then an economics doctorate under Li Yining, the guru of market reforms in China.
Wang has been in exile in the United States since 1994 and is now co-chair of the China Democratic Party, which advocates radical change in China.
Li also survived three major fire accidents in Henan.
Like his mentor Hu, Li has risen to his high position more by avoiding big mistakes than through bold ideas and major accomplishments.
