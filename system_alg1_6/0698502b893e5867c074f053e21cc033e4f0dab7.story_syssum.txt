Mizoram, India (CNN) -- The world's population hits 7 billion this week, but Ziona, the patriarch of what may be the biggest family in the world, is not bothered.
"I never wanted to get married but that's the path God has chosen for me," he says.
"There is no discrimination amongst us, he treats us all equally," fifth wife Twangi says.
Like a well-oiled machine, everyone carries out their individual chore, so dinner for 160 is ready within an hour and utensils are washed and put away within minutes.
But while he likes living in a big family, he himself doesn't want more than one wife.
Ziona is the caretaker of the self-reliant sect.
Some are doing carpentry work, some take care of the piggery and poultry farm and others cultivate crops," Ziona says.
The family is not listed in the Guinness Book of World Records because Ziona says he doesn't want the publicity.
