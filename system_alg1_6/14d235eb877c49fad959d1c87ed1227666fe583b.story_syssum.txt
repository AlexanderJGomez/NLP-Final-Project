Price, who will captain the international team at this week's Presidents Cup at Muirfield Village, Ohio, has taken the long road to the top.

"Our three kids were born here and I've just had the best time ever here," said Price, who lives in Florida.
"I'm a big one for confrontations," said Price.
Price realizes his team faces a difficult challenge to triumph in Columbus, Ohio but says he will do all that he can as captain to inspire his men to a momentous victory.
I'm going to be there."
