(WIRED) -- Facebook has rolled out its new Timeline feature to the masses.
To hide a Timeline element, click the pencil icon at the top of the offending post, then choose "Hide from Timeline."
If you prefer to keep your profile public, but don't want everyone to see what you posted back in high school, for example, you can also tweak your Timeline settings more generally.
These events aren't listed on your Timeline, but they can be.
First, you can add a cover to your Timeline.
Once you click that, you can select an image from your photos, or opt to upload a new image.
If you decide to make a number of posts and photos private or hidden from your Timeline, you can still get the full, complete view of your Facebook action history.
You can choose to see only your posts, posts by others, posts from specific Facebook apps ("Hmm, let's look at my past Farmville accomplishments"), photos and more.
Click that, and you can choose "View As..." and either enter a friend's name or click the "public" link to see how your profile looks to strangers.
You can change it to "Only Important" updates or "All updates," and you can also filter what types of posts you're interested in seeing: things like life events, status updates, or photos.
