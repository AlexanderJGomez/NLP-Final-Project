I'm pretty much there with my songs, and I'm really just sitting on the fence in regards to a producer.
Both of those productions really appeal to me, and the direction that they took -- just trying to get ideas for myself.
So it's just really determining where am I really at and just looking through that.
I've just got to get myself to that next stage.
That's what scares me the most, really.
And I've had a lot of fun just being creative with it and just floating around, changing my mind.
The show took well over a year to put together, so that was a production in itself, like making a record.
So I'm only recently freed up from going into one production and just getting geared up to go into another one, which should be the record.
I want people to hear the songs they know.
Sting I've seen a few times and he really inspired me, in the sense that he breaks the songs down a lot and will take a different approach.
So I did some of that.
