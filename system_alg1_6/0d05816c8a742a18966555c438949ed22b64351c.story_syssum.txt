At night it is very dangerous.
Sandimhia and 1.25 billion other women around the world, find themselves in similar situations every day, where they have no choice but to put themselves at risk of disease, harassment or even violence because they lack access to something as simple as a safe and clean toilet.
In total one and a quarter million men, women and children will die this year from preventable diseases brought about by a lack of access to these basic services.
Such words from leaders in diplomacy and in business are hugely welcome.
One of those targets is a commitment to halve the proportion of people lacking access to what is called "improved sanitation."
Even when this goal is finally reached, one in four people will still not have access to safe sanitation.
World Toilet Day is an opportunity to celebrate the progress that has been made and recognizes how much more needs to be done.
