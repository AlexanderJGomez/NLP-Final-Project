Radar data from air traffic control can provide tracking data that will indicate the flight path, altitude and direction the A320-200 followed.
With Malaysia 370, radar data was sketchy; satellite data has been the primary source in determining the track and thus the search area.
Experience dictates much of the decision process that airline pilots use to deviate around convective weather.
And let's not be misled by the reported request of Flight 8501 asking air traffic control for a higher altitude.
Perhaps a high altitude stall occurred and the airplane never recovered.
For the moment, I am keeping my fingers crossed that a search and rescue operation will find survivors.
