But the world, Greek brothers Thomas and George Douzis realized, did not.
Take Greek olive oil's reputation around the world.
The brothers chose the brand Ergon -- the Greek word for project -- and set out to find the country's best produce.
In the tiny Kolymvary region of Western Crete, they found the olive oil they wanted to promote.
As the Douzis brothers developed their business plans, the country's finances were beginning to unravel.
In London, Reload Greece is typical of this change.
Like many of his compatriots, his Greek bloodlines run strong and he set up Reload, in his words, to "let people do whatever they do, and find ways to connect them to Greece and help Greek communities."
"Greece used to be a country with lots of entertainment, tourist sector, big summers... now it is much more stressed environment," Douzis says.
"Truthfully, if I didn't have Greece, I wouldn't be in business," Sifakis says.
Ergon, born as Greece's economy collapsed, now has a network of 150 producers who support seven stores and delis in Greece, one in London and another being prepped for Brussels.
"Greece was wealthy back then, so we had to convince them that these two young brothers from Thessaloniki can do that job, that we can help them sell their products," he says.
It is the oil made by small-scale farmers, under the sun of the Kolymvary region, in Western Crete.
