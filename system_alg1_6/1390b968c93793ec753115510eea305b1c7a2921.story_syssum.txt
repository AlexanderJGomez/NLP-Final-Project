(CNN)  -- Actor Wendell Pierce's biggest role today is running the Pontchartrain Park Community Development Corp., which is hard at work trying to rebuild the New Orleans neighborhood devastated by Hurricane Katrina.
...
PIERCE: It was devastation.
I put out a call to action to people in my generation.
We have the properties, the homes; we have people qualified with the bank, and we are still trying to access the money.
That's because the state is hostile to the city and is trying to reappropriate the money to other parts of the state and not to the city of New Orleans.
PIERCE: Right now in New Orleans, it's worse than the week of the storm.
Because it's a concerted effort to reappropriate the money and keep the poor and black people out.
There is a concerted effort to redistrict the city, a concerted effort to keep thousands of people out, change the demographics of the city and hope people give up on a mass scale.
CNN: The government's not rebuilding New Orleans.
What surprised me the most [when I began this] was the lack of skill and competence on the government's part to know how to put this together, and how strong the effort to stop people from moving back to New Orleans is.
Our goal is 7,000 in the city, about 550 in the Park.
PIERCE: Yes, I do play the trombone, but I play very poorly, so they turn my mic off, and my sound double plays.
