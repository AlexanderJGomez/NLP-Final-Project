Traditionally, the usual way of catching a ride was to venture into any street corner packed with tens of boda bodas or simply waiting for one to pass by.
For now, the Uber-like startup operates mainly in the northern districts of Kampala, where a click on the SafeBoda app -- in addition to the traditional method of hailing them on the street -- will bring you a Safeboda bike, complete with a uniformed driver in a bright orange jacket, helmet and fully trained in road safety.
Lalunga has been a boda driver for four years and joined SafeBoda four months ago to learn more about road safety.
"People in Uganda don't wear helmets," says Sussock.
The main need for safe driving is in the congested streets of downtown Kampala where the company plans to expand into next.
"With over 1,000 drivers we can begin to change the entire boda industry," says Sussock.
