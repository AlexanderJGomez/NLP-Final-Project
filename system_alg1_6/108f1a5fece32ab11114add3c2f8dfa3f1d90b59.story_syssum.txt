Not me.
I'd like to say that I believe every president in United States history, including the stupid one we have now, is smarter than me.
Obama is a great leader.
We need someone stupid enough to understand that the president of the United States can't solve many problems without taking away freedom and therefore shouldn't try.
I don't want anyone as president who promises to take care of me.
You gotta be smarter than me to do all that, but you don't have to be as smart as Obama, and you sure don't have to be a great leader.
If we could find a lazier, less charismatic, stupider person than me to be president, I'd be all for it.
