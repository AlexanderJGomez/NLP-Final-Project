President-elect Barack Obama greets Sen. John McCain on stage after praising him at a bipartisan dinner.
"I am very grateful to the president-elect and to all of you for this very considerate gesture, and for allowing me to play a small role in the inauguration of the 44th president of the United States, even if it isn't the one I had in mind a few months ago," McCain said.
"I'm here tonight to say a few words about an American hero I have come to know very well and admire very much -- Sen. John McCain," Obama said as he opened his speech.
Obama's speech at the bipartisan dinner capped a day filled by appearances, including visiting wounded soldiers and exhorting Americans to spend more time in the service of others.
Wigal said Obama's inauguration has given residents hope that change actually will happen.
Obama visited a National Day of Service project, stopping by the Sasha Bruce House, an emergency shelter for homeless teenagers in the Washington area.
Wigal said Obama's actions and words make her believe the president-elect has the skills needed to help the country move forward.
"If everybody did their job as well as he did [his] job, we would be in pretty good shape," Obama said.
"I am making a commitment to you, as your next president, that we are going to make government work," Obama said.
