The jury is still out on whether Freddy Adu -- like Lamptey Ghanaian-born -- will fall into the first category or the second, but the footballing world should soon be a little closer to finding out after the 18-year-old's move this week from the shallow waters of Real Salt Lake and the MLS to Benfica of Portugal.
In 2003 an MLS coach told Sports Illustrated, shortly before Adu signed a $1 million contract with Nike, that Adu would start for the U.S. at the 2006 World Cup.
Both subsequently moved onto greatness at Barcelona; U.S. soccer fans will be willing Adu to make a similar leap upwards from Benfica sooner rather than later.
