Here's why.
The federal government chartered Fannie Mae in 1938 and Freddie Mac in 1970; these two mortgage lending institutions are at the center of the crisis.
The obvious alternative to a bailout is letting troubled financial institutions declare bankruptcy.
In contrast, a bailout transfers enormous wealth from taxpayers to those who knowingly engaged in risky subprime lending.
Further, the current credit freeze is likely due to Wall Street's hope of a bailout; bankers will not sell their lousy assets for 20 cents on the dollar if the government might pay 30, 50, or 80 cents.
Anticipation of the bailout will engender strategic behavior by Wall Street institutions as they shuffle their assets and position their balance sheets to maximize their take.
The bailout will open the door to further federal meddling in financial markets.
Someone has to pay for that.
