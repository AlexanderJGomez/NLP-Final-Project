(CNN) -- The Ohio state Senate passed a bill Wednesday that would curb the collective bargaining rights of public workers and strip away their power to strike.
It reflects the diverse interests that our members have around the state of Ohio," he said.
Earlier Wednesday the measure sailed through a Senate Labor Committee following a last-minute GOP shuffle that resulted in the replacement of Republican Senator Bill Seitz.
The bill now moves onto the Republican-controlled House where lawmakers are expected to take up the measure on March 10.
