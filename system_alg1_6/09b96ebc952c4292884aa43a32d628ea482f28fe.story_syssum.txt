"When they announced I was the winner of the challenge, it was a very emotional experience for me," Smith said.
"During the first day of the program I thought I wouldn't be able to keep up with it because it felt very intimidating and I worried about my weak knees," he said.
The grandfather of three said an e-mail in his work inbox announcing the "Fit 4 Change Mississippi Fitness Challenge" was the final push he needed to jumpstart his journey toward a healthier lifestyle.
"The fitness event was one of the hardest things I have ever done in my life," Smith said.
Smith said his goal was simply to get in shape, and he never aspired to win the fitness challenge.
"Paul's program was the jumpstart I needed, and now I am continuing my weight loss journey on my own," he said.
