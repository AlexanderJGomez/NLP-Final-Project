(CNN) -- It was a day of firsts at the World Cup as France got a boost from technology and Bosnia and Herzegovina scored a groundbreaking goal.
It turns out the deciding goal was Argentina's second tally, by none other than Lionel Messi, arguably the world's greatest (and most scrutinized) player, who has a history of underperforming in the World Cup.
Seferovic's 93rd minute goal was the latest anyone has ever scored in World Cup group play, according to ESPN.
A player barely gets a toe on a ball to poke it away from an attacker.
While the fans at the stadium watched replays and booed the referee's call, new goal line technology showed it was indeed a goal.
Only?
While the number of goals per game had been trending down since the 1994 World Cup held in the United States, this tournament has seen an early explosion in the number of balls hitting the back of the net.
