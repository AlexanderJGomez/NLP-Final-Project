WASHINGTON (CNN) -- House Democrats on Thursday failed to override President Bush's veto of a children's health insurance bill that opponents said was too expensive.
Bush proposes increasing the program by $5 billion.
See veto record Â»   On its first go-round, the House passed it with 45 Republican votes -- about two dozen votes short of the two-thirds majority.
"The American people support this issue because kids do not need to suffer for what is basically a broken health care system, and this provides those children  with that health care," Emanuel said.
"I made clear that, if putting poor children first requires more than the 20 percent increase in funding I proposed, we'll work with Congress to find the money we need," said the president.
House Republican leaders have complained that Democrats postponed the override attempt for two weeks to use the issue for political advantage.
Meanwhile, of the eight Democrats who voted against the bill in September, only one has said he will reverse his vote and support an override.
