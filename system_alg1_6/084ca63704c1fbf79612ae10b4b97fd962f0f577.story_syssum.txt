Actress Skye McCole Bartusiak, who played Mel Gibson's youngest daughter in "The Patriot," died Saturday at her home in Houston, her mother said Sunday.
Bartusiak had been preparing to produce and direct her first feature film in recent months, her mother said.
She's suffered epileptic seizures since she was a baby, although they disappeared for a few years until returning last week, her mother said.
"The girl has lived such an amazing life," she said.
