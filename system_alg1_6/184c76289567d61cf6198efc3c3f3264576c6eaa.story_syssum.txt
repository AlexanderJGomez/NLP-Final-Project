(CNN) -- "The Normal Heart," written by my friend, the brilliant playwright Larry Kramer, and based on his story during the earliest days of the AIDS epidemic, tells a tale that many of us lived through, and many others did not survive.
Worldwide, another than 1.6 million people will die of AIDS this year.
And, just as in 1985, it is silence, fear and stigma that continue to drive the epidemic.
I hope HBO's production of "The Normal Heart" will compel a new generation to act up.
As Larry so forcefully taught us nearly 30 years ago -- and as he and Ryan Murphy, the director of the new HBO film, continue to remind us today -- we must speak out against injustice, act with compassion, and fight for equality.
