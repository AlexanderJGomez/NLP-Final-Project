Despite two days of intensive negotiations, Iran and six world powers "remain far apart" on Tehran's controversial nuclear program, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said Saturday in Kazakhstan.
"The quality of the discussion was different because there was this back and forth, this Q and A," the official said.
"The UK went to Kazakhstan ready with our partners to negotiate in good faith with Iran," British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement.
He repeated Tehran's position that Iran has the right to a peaceful nuclear program.
The so-called P5+1 governments are demanding that Iran come clean about its nuclear program, which they suspect includes covert development of nuclear weapons.
Iran's deputy chief negotiator said the Iranian proposal tabled Friday was based on a previous PowerPoint presentation that the Iranian delegation submitted during a round of talks in Moscow in June 2012.
"It is the right of the Iranian people to peaceful nuclear energy and most importantly to enrichment," Jalili said.
The report, titled "Iran's Nuclear Odyssey," highlighted the fact that Tehran's quest for a nuclear program has been going on for more than half a century, beginning under the rule of the pro-American shah, Reza Pahlavi, and continuing under the revolutionary Islamic republic that overthrew him.
