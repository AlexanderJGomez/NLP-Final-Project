SAO PAULO, Brazil (Reuters)  -- A Colombian man who authorities say is one of Latin America's biggest drug traffickers wants to be extradited to the United States from a Brazilian jail and is willing to cooperate with U.S. anti-drug agents, his attorney says.
Ramirez Abadia wanted to be extradited to the United States, but he hoped to cut a deal for a maximum 30-year sentence to avoid the death penalty, he said.
Police and media reports detailed a business empire run by Ramirez Abadia that included property, car dealerships, import and export companies, even a jet-ski store on a busy Sao Paulo avenue.
U.S. authorities have described him as extremely violent, and Brazilian police said he was behind at least 15 killings in the United States and more than 300 in Colombia.
