(CNN) -- Take one dentist, a catsuit, a horse and a barrel, and you have a world champion.
You can compete as an individual (where Eccles excels), as a pair (the "pas de deux") or as a team of six.
"The lunger is in constant contact and communication with the horse," explains Craig Coburn, a leading vaulting judge.
John Eccles is not the first parent to revise their opinion of vaulting.
"When Megan first wanted to ride a horse, they said she was too young to go into the regular riding program, but they would let her vault -- because an adult controls the horse, and a three-year-old can do it with the horse at walking pace.
A vaulting barrel is the answer.
You practice new moves on a mat and then go on to the barrel, says former competitor Lucy Bell, who now manages the British team at big events.
"A new move sets you apart from the rest and nobody else had done a one-handed handstand before," Eccles says.
"What Megan had going for her was her upper-body strength," Sheri Benjamin says of her daughter, who played ice hockey before taking up vaulting.
They're not springing off the horse like it's a trampoline, they are in motion with the horse as if they are one," he says.
"She is the person to beat," says Benjamin, whose daughter retired from vaulting in 2012.
Eccles herself is, for now, secretly watching vaulting clips over lunch with her dental nurse at the surgery.
