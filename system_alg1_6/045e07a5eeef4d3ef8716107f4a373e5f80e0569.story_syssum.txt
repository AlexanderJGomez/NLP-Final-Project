London (CNN) -- A British man suffering from "locked-in syndrome" who fought a long legal battle over assisted suicide died Wednesday, his family said.
Police in the county of Wiltshire, where he lived, said that a doctor had been seeing Nicklinson over the past week, and that they were not investigating the death.
"The cases raise profoundly difficult ethical, social and legal issues, but (the court) judged that any change to the law must be a matter for Parliament to decide," a statement from the court said.
The only difference between you and me is my inability to take my own life," he said.
Jane Nicklinson said the family did not intend to go to Switzerland, which has an assisted suicide law, because it was expensive and her husband did not think he should have to go overseas to die.
