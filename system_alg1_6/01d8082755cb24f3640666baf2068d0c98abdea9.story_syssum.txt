An intense search led by the U.S. Navy was launched to find Earhart and her plane, but after several weeks, nothing was found.
Experts believe that the jet continued on dumb autopilot until it was, like Earhart's Lockheed Electra, out of fuel, plunging into the sea.
Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan, disappeared just a few years before World War II erupted and a new world order emerged: what is often called the American century.
According to some reports, this is the most expensive search effort in history.
That sort of nationalist land grab reminds me less of the Cold War than of norms of the 18th century and just about every century of history prior.
So what's left to be seen is whether this unprecedented international coalition assembled to scour the ocean for the remains of Flight 370 is one of the few bright spots in an otherwise devastating tragedy for the families of the 227 passengers and 12 crew members.
I prefer to see the goodness here, that the world can come together and work together when it counts.
