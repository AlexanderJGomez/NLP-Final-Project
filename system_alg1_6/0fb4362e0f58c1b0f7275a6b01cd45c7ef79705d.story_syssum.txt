"My son was murdered as he was leaving a bar in Greenville, South Carolina," the 48-year-old woman told CNN about her son, Sean, who was 20 when he came face-to-face with what she calls a hate crime.
The men got back into their car and drove off, leaving Sean on the ground, his brain separated from his brain stem, she said.
Had hate crimes been a federal offense in 2007, the FBI would have been able to investigate the attack, and Sean Kennedy's killer might still be in prison, his mother said.
"We are going there representing so many people," she said.
But Attorney General Eric Holder has said that any federal hate-crimes law would be used only to prosecute violent acts based on bias, as opposed to the prosecution of speech based on controversial racial or religious beliefs.
They contended that existing federal hate-crimes laws were sufficient to protect the rights of people based on sexual orientation and gender identity.
