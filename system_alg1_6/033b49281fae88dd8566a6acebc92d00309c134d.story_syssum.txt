"They're sensual," says Madeleine Pickens, owner of Nevada's new Mustang Monument: Wild Horse Eco Resort.
Wild horses are protected under federal law.
Charged with maintaining the ecological balance of public grazing land, the federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has found itself in the middle of disputes related to mustangs and wild horses.
In Nevada, the BLM agreed with ranchers that wild herds threaten the range, but also said it doesn't have the resources to conduct the popular roundups.
Mustang Monument: Wild Horse Eco-Resort is a new boutique, luxury ranch that may offer a partial solution.
Six hundred wild horses roam in a 4,000-acre enclave at the front of the ranch.
"Horses are sacred to our people," the Native singers say.
The 35-mile Ruby Crest Trail is a great way to see some of the best parts of the range and usually takes about three days to hike.
