The Nigerian government says that more than 200 girls abducted by Boko Haram in April are to be released as early as Monday, after it signed a ceasefire agreement with the Islamists.
But Boko Haram remains silent on the deal the government says it signed with the Islamists in neighboring Chad last week.
"It remains to be seen whether this truce will actually materialize, whether it is merely an election ploy for Nigeria's embattled president, Goodluck Jonathan, and most crucially whether it will bring about the release of numerous captives taken by Boko Haram during the past year," he wrote in an analysis for CNN.
He fears that after so much war, the group may be disjointed and any ceasefire deals made with some members may not be heeded by others.
On April 14, Boko Haram militants raided the village of Chibok and kidnapped an estimated 276 teenage girls from a boarding school.
Three weeks later, a man claiming to be a Boko Haram leader threatened to sell the girls into slavery.
In spite of many promises to find and free them, the girls have remained in the terrorists' hands.
