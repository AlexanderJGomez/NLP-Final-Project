"Oddly enough, a lot of cemeteries aren't that haunted," said Richard Senate, a historian and ghost hunter of 33 years.
Senate shared what he regards as some of the most haunted cemeteries in America.
Cemetery No.
"She haunts her tomb," Senate said.
She is seen not only within the cemetery but just outside of the gates.
Often, "Mary" vanishes in the car or steps out at the cemetery and fades into darkness, Senate said.
Not only is this cemetery full of Hollywood legends from the silent film era to our recently departed celebrities, Senate says it is also full of ghosts.
Both her and Valentino's ghosts have been seen by his grave, Senate said.
They now rest in Boothill Cemetery, alongside gamblers, smugglers and outlaws, Senate said.
"Tombstone is a true place for ghost hunters to go," Senate said.
But Senate notes that one of the most persistent ghosts is really just there to be social.
"You should be like a ghost: No one should know you've even been there," Senate said.
