Madonna, that is.
1 on the album chart and she has two singles on the dance-chart Top 10.
She's an '80s child whose 2005 single "Hung Up" holds the Guinness Book record for topping the charts in 41 countries, while 2012's MDNA was No.
The two pop icons released debut albums within two years of each other, Madonna in 1983 and Houston in 1985.
And that, in a nutshell, is why Madonna is who she is.
"Seriously... like your Madonna?"
But then again, it wouldn't be Madonna if a song like that was.
