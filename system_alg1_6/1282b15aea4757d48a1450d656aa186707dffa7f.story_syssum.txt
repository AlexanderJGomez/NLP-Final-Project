ISIS is believed to be holding a number of Americans, including Sotloff, a U.S. official told CNN.
Also Wednesday, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said in a written statement that the United States attempted a rescue operation earlier this summer to free a number of American hostages held in Syria by ISIS.
As the President spoke, the Pentagon confirmed the United States carried out 14 airstrikes against mobile ISIS targets in the vicinity of the Mosul Dam, which Kurdish forces recaptured from the terror group with the support of American airpower.
A plane carrying the first load of humanitarian aid as part of a multiday operation to help hundreds of thousands of displaced people in northern Iraq has landed in Irbil, the U.N. refugee agency said.
Now that the dam is cleared of ISIS militants, Iraqi forces are moving to grow their area of control, the Defense Department said.
If approved, the troops would number less than 300, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
