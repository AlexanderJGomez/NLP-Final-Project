Charlotte (CNN) -- Four years later, consider the role reversal: As he closes his convention, Barack Obama's greatest challenge is to make the case against change.
Four years ago, the goal was to expand the map, and the Obama campaign ultimately succeeded.
While Charlotte has had plenty of contrast with the GOP convention in Tampa, there has been virtually no specific talk of the president's policy goals for the next four years.
For Ronald Reagan, the second term was wrapped as "Morning in America."
Again, that is the strategy behind the convention agenda: careful targeting of the different pieces of the Obama 2008 coalition.
Just hours after the convention closes, the government will release August jobs data -- and that data could significantly shape morning-after reflections on the president's big moment.
