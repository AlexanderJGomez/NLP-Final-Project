WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Former Vice President Dick Cheney said Monday that he does not believe Saddam Hussein was involved in the planning or execution of the September 11, 2001, attacks.
Cheney restated his claim that "there was a relationship between al Qaeda and Iraq that stretched back 10 years.
Tenet "testified, if you go back and check the record, in the fall of [2002] before the Senate Intelligence Committee -- in open session -- that there was a relationship," Cheney said.
Hussein was captured by U.S. forces in Iraq in December 2003.

Cheney said Monday that the memos previously released also were the subject of ongoing lawsuits.
He has said that the interrogations saved the lives of "thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands."
