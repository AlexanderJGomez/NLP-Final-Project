CNN recently spoke to writer Rick Remender on what to expect with this big change.
Sam will not be working as closely with S.H.I.E.L.D.
Remender: Steve Rogers -- who has aged now; time has caught up to him -- will still be a tactician, providing his military experience.
Remender: The feedback's been great!
Remender: I wanted to put Sam into something that felt like a traditional "Captain America" comic book but wanted him to come up against an insurmountable wall unlike anything Steve has even faced.
Hydra has already won before Sam realizes that they're up to something.
