Sarah Palin let the "Road to Nowhere" go ahead because the contract had been signed.
But Palin, now the Republican vice presidential candidate, let the access road go ahead because the contract to build it had been signed, a campaign aide said.
Palin could have stopped construction of this road," said Weinstein, who wore his "Nowhere, Alaska" T-shirt to an interview with CNN.
Campaign spokeswoman Meg Stapleton said Palin would not have allowed the road project to go forward under normal circumstances.
But Weinstein, a Democrat, said Palin instead spent $26 million to build a road "that will not go to a bridge."
