That's when Congress passed, and President Reagan signed into law, the Immigration Reform and Control Act, which married border control and the legalization of millions of illegal immigrants.
The Immigration Reform and Control Act, the bill resulting from the 1986 grand bargain, proved to be a spectacular failure.
But the 1986 grand bargain taught today's immigration restrictionists a simple lesson: Don't make any more grand bargains.
Similarly, immigration reformers must start with the strongest claims to legalization: students and soldiers.
Supporters of comprehensive reform and legalization worry that the DREAM act will take away the impetus for further reform and benefit only a fraction of the illegal immigrants in the United States.
Border control and enforcement, like legalization, needs to move forward incrementally and be paired with a scaled-down sweetener: DREAM.
Legalization forces can get DREAM, but they must also support increased border enforcement.
