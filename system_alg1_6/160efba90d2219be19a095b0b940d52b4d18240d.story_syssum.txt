Investigators said this week that they found a single feather and evidence of "soft-body impact damage" on the aircraft.
Meanwhile, a pilot program involving "birdstrike avoidance" radar systems will be expanded to include LaGuardia, said a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
