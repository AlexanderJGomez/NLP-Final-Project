"And I'm also making a bigger and maybe even more controversial point that radical Islam is a grave threat, we need Muslim leaders to denounce the individuals, not just the acts of violence," he said, adding that "it is absolutely correct to insist on assimilation" of immigrants in the United States.
During his London speech, Jindal said, "In the West, non-assimilationist Muslims establish enclaves and carry out as much of Sharia law as they can without regard for the laws of the democratic countries which provided them a new home," according to prepared remarks.
Jindal also suggested the rise of such no-go zones has contributed to growing anti-Semitism throughout Europe, which has prompted many Jews to emigrate from their home countries.
But a Jindal aide said the governor stuck largely to the text as prepared, which included the criticism of the zones.
"It's no surprise that Bobby Jindal would go abroad and butcher the facts in an effort to divide people -- this is exactly what we've come to expect from Jindal here at home," Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Rebecca Chalif told CNN.
