But in other ways, Fort Hood is like no American city.
Lt. Gen. Russel Honore, who served at Fort Hood in the late 1990s, said the nearly eight years of war in Afghanistan and Iraq have created difficulties for the U.S. armed forces.
"One of the biggest things on re-entry that the Readiness Center does is to help those soldiers cope with being back home and dealing with the extremes of [post-traumatic stress disorder]," Honore said.
"Some of these soldiers have lost some of their closest friends, seen some of the horrific things associated with warfare including these roadside bombs," Honore said.
U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said the post has a robust support system for families of deployed troops, which would help troops and civilians there handle Thursday's violence.
