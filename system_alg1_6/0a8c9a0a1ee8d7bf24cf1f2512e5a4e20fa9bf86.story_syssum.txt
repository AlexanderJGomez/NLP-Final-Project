(CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of marriage equality this week.
In 2013, the vast majority of Americans have moved beyond prejudice toward gays and lesbians.
Four out of five young voters, of all faiths and political parties, support marriage equality, and even those who continue to oppose marriage rights for same-sex couples can see that it is inevitable.
Importantly, the court also strengthened the foundation upon which advocates and officials will one day achieve marriage equality nationwide.
