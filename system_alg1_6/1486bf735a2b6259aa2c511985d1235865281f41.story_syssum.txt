Henry Ford, pictured in 1942, unsuccessfully attempted to increase the rubber supply with a plantation in Brazil.
In theory, this setup seemed like one of Ford's ideas that would shake out pretty well, and in 1928, Ford sent a barge full of supplies from Michigan down to his new plantation town, which was dubbed "Fordlandia."
Ford didn't check to see if the plantation was suitable for growing rubber.
Obviously, the rubber production part of the Fordlandia got off to a rocky start.
The catch here, though, was that the indigenous Brazilians who farmed the rubber weren't used to living in a stylized American community.
Another sticking point for the workers was Ford's insistence that his model community be entirely free of alcohol and tobacco.
Although Ford spent 17 years trying to produce rubber on the plantation, no Ford car ever rolled off the assembly line with a single bit of Fordlandia's rubber in it.
