Norwegian interior designer Marte Deborah Dalelv has spoken out after being handed a 16-month prison sentence in Dubai -- after she went to police to report she had been raped by a colleague.
That was pretty much the last thing she said she remembers before the alleged sexual assault.
That is what you do.
She was then taken to Bur Dubai police station, she said.
Dalelv said she managed to call her parents on the third day to tell them she had been raped and ask them to contact the Norwegian Embassy.
It was the first time she was made aware that she faced charges, Dalelv said.
A statement released late Saturday by Al Mana Interiors spokesman Hani El Korek said the company was sympathetic to Dalelv "during this very difficult situation."
Dalelv was convicted Tuesday on all three charges and was sentenced to one year in jail for having unlawful sex, three months in jail for making a false statement and one month for illegal consumption of alcohol.
Norwegian Foreign Affairs Minister Espen Barth Eide called his UAE counterpart, Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed al-Nahyan, on Friday night to protest Dalelv's sentencing, a statement from the Norwegian ministry said.
Dalelv told CNN she received a call from Eide on Friday reiterating Norway's support.
In January 2010, a British woman told authorities she was raped by an employee at a Dubai hotel.
