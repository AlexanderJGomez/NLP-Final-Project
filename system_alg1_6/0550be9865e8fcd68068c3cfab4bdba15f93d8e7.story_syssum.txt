(CNN)  -- Jordan Belfi has a great job: He plays Adam Davies on the HBO show "Entourage," a comedy series that takes a look at the life of a young actor, Vincent Chase, and the old friends who surround him in Hollywood.
CNN:  A lot of fans really missed that rivalry between you and Ari Gold.
Belfi: Adam Davies has become ... one of the few characters on the show that really knows how to get under Ari's skin and push his buttons.
Belfi: I started way back on season one in the beginning of the show.
...
Belfi: What gives Ari a little bit of his soul, his heart, is that we have all these scenes with his wife and his family, and you really get to see him as a dad.
They're really kind of the same in a lot of ways.
...
And that's really funny.
But in terms of the really exciting stuff between Adam Davies and Ari, I guess I'll say this: At the end of season two, when Ari is trying to form his coup, to break up the agency, and Adam is the one who rats him out and gets him fired and humiliated and causes that whole thing ...
There's this one thing that happens that will really stand out and that people will talk about.
