Climate change is driven by emissions of a range of heat-trapping gases, especially the total emissions of carbon dioxide, which have been pumping out since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.
Per capita carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. may be lower now than they were in 1990, but the average American still emits three times the global average.
Taking action now is also cost-effective.
The global energy system producing most of the carbon dioxide emissions is massive, and includes thousands of power plants and more than a billion vehicles.
It will involve a wide range of technologies that emit little or no carbon dioxide, with greatly increased energy efficiency in vehicles, buildings, and equipment.
Today is the day to start.
