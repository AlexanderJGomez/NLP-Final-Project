(CNN) -- My son Cole died two and a half years ago from neuroblastoma, a common childhood cancer, after suffering through multiple surgeries, chemotherapy injections and painful radiation therapy.
By talking to many other parents who have lost children to childhood cancer, I have come to understand that this pain will last until I am gone.
And more than 11,000 children are diagnosed with cancer each year.
I just wanted the same for kids fighting cancer.
But there is another reason to light gold: It helps to heal the hearts of parents such as myself who have lost children to cancer.
After my son died, I had a difficult time going back to Boston; there were too many painful memories there.
