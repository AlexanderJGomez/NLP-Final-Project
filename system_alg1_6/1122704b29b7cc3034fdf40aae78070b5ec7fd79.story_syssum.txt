Jeb Bush's decision to step down from his advisory role at British bank Barclays at the end of the year became the latest indication he's gearing up to jump into the presidential race — and underscored one of the main liabilities he could face if he does run.
But Bush's ties to Barclays point to another potentially prickly issue for him — his support for the 2008 Wall Street bailout known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which initially authorized $700 billion in loans from the U.S. government to the banking sector.
Other potential presidential contenders are on record supporting TARP, including Rep. Paul Ryan, who voted for it, and Texas Gov.
Bush's comments, and his role with the bank as it emerged from the financial crisis — as well as his work for investment bank Lehman Brothers, which he left after it collapsed in 2008 — could be fertile ground for Republican opponents looking for avenues of attack against him.
