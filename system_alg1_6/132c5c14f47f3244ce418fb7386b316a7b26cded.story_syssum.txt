ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Nearly a year after assassins killed Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, her widower won the country's presidential election and hailed his triumph as a victory for democracy.
According to the chief election commissioner of Pakistan, Qazi Muhammad Farooq, Zardari received 481 votes.
"The democracy talks, and everybody hears," Zardari said in a televised address Saturday evening.
Zardari took over Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP) after her death late last year.
Siddiqui was nominated by the Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N), led by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
The PPP, which led the coalition, said it believed the coalition should focus on picking a successor for Musharraf before it decided on reinstating the judges.
As the voting took place, a suicide car bomb exploded in northwestern Pakistan, killing at least 25 people, including eight police officers, local police spokesman Fazal Karim said.
