(CNN) -- This week's devastating crash of a high-speed train in Spain, which left nearly 80 dead, has drawn renewed attention to rail safety at a time when the Obama administration has prioritized the construction of fast new rail links.
The trains will be fast.
Other countries' experience shows that high-speed rail can be even safer than the much slower U.S. trains.
Improvements in the design of German trains and a review of maintenance operations in China have also prevented repeats of previous train accidents in those countries.
Modern train control equipment is designed to brake trains automatically when they travel too quickly or come too close to another train.
No more sitting in traffic, grinding teeth at the wheel.
Train service similar to that already offered in European and Asian countries would require a significant investment, but for many routes, an improved rail system is a worthy endeavor.
