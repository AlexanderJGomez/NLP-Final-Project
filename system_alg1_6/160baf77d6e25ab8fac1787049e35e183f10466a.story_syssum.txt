The controversial issue of team orders in Formula 1 has once again tested respect between teammates -- and ahead of Sunday's race Vettel said he would probably do it again given he felt Webber had not supported him in the past -- and raised question marks over the purity of the sport's racing.
"I don't think there's the same respect now for other drivers," British racing legend Stirling Moss told CNN.
"When a team had the lead, the number one driver would hold position and not pass him, says Moss.
"Because (Red Bull) had specifically said to (Vettel) let Webber have it, that made him a naughty boy but he felt, 'well dammit, why shouldn't I win?'
On the other side of the garage, the Malaysia team orders drama may have more emotional, career-defining consequences for Webber, whose Red Bull contract expires at the end of the season.
"The year before in Austria I had let Michael by when I was second and he was third and I had that conversation with the team afterwards when I said: 'Listen, what would happen if I was first?'
Ironically, it was another infamous incident between two Ferrari drivers in 2010 -- when Felipe Massa was told to surrender the lead to teammate Fernando Alonso -- that led to a ban on team orders being stripped from the rulebook in 2011.
"The team has always been the most important thing," said Moss.
"I don't think drivers accept that," says Barrichello.
"I suppose he was a naughty boy," Moss says, "but he is a racing driver who's paid to go fast.
Vettel, Webber and Red Bull will begin to find out how much crossing that line in Malaysia has hurt them when they reunite in Shanghai.
