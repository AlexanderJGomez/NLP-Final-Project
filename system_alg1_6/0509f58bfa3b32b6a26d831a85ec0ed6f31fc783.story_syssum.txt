(CNN) -- I love you Rihanna.
It's why Rihanna is so upset that CBS pulled her song "Run This Town" from Thursday Night Football because, well, in Rihanna's words: "Y'all are sad for penalizing me for this ... CBS you pulled my song last week, now you wanna slide it back in this Thursday?
As Rihanna tweeted, "The audacity..." and forbade CBS to use any of her songs in its Thursday Night Football lineup ever again.
It would have been a colossal mistake to bully Rihanna into singing for the NFL.
Dare I say again, I love you Rihanna.
