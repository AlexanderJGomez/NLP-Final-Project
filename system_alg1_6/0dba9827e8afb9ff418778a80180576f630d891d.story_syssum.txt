HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- It's small, affluent, tech-savvy and it has a very obvious pollution problem -- Hong Kong is arguably an ideal destination for electric cars.
Hong Kong is not without EVs though.
"[Hong Kong Electric] only use them inside their private site and they have to get a very special licence and they can't drive outside their site and they are restricted to certain uses," she says.
"This will only happen with market pressure - it is hard to see it otherwise," says Masset.
Hong Kongers are not familiar with EVs he says, and are concerned about the technology so they need to be shown that EVs are just as good as petrol cars.
"Taxis, minibuses, buses can be forced to go electric but the government isn't doing anything," says Cheng.
Cheng says the amount of money his department received to design MyCar was nowhere near enough and to him, it told him how important the government view EVs.
The government needs to give them financial support and I am not talking about one or two million Hong Kong dollars.
"We want to come here -- as long as the policy is there to make it happen," says Chung.
