Commissioners in Jackson County, Florida, have filed a court motion to thwart the efforts of the state attorney general, who filed a motion earlier this month seeking the excavation of nameless graves on the grounds of the Dozier School for Boys in the Florida panhandle town of Marianna.
Thirty days later, he said, his uncle, Thomas Varnadoe, was buried on school property.
"Look how they buried these people," he said.
State authorities have said in the past that there were 31 burial sites at the school, and a 2009 state investigation found no wrongdoing in connection with those deaths.
At the time, the law enforcement agency said it could not determine where another 50 boys, who it said died at the school as a result of illnesses or accidents, were buried, blaming poorly kept school records.
Glen Varnadoe is quite happy that the school is closed.
"I don't know why you'd want to try to prevent anyone from returning a loved one after having been buried the way they have been buried," he said.
