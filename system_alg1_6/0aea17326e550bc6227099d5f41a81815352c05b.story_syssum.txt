In rainy weather it curves to increase downforce for a safer drive, and straightens out when the downpour clears.
The self-assembly process has been described as 4D printing.
"More materials, more energy sources," Tibbits says are the current priorities.
"We can develop material compositions that respond to many different triggers, or find solutions that haven't been programmed but fall within an acceptable range.
Demand for 4D is reaching a fever pitch, says Dr. Junus Kahn, founder of Carbitex, which produces the materials used by the Self-Assembly Lab, as well as supplying them to major business clients.
"Everyone is always scared that technology will take our jobs," says Tibbits, rolling his eyes.
If the full scale of his vision is realized, we might need to do little else.
