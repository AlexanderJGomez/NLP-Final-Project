After months of dramatic testimony full of so many twists and turns that people lined up for seats in the Phoenix courtroom, jurors began deliberations Tuesday to decide whether Arias should get the death penalty or life in prison for murdering her ex-boyfriend.
Arias pleaded for her life to be spared, telling jurors Tuesday that she could teach people to read in prison and make a positive impact on inmates.
Explaining her decision not to request the death penalty, Arias said Tuesday that her family -- to whom she pointed in the courtroom -- gave her the strength to continue living.
Her previous comments about her desire to die were sincere when she expressed them, Arias said.
Prosecutor Juan Martinez said pointing to Arias' artwork as evidence that her life should be spared wasn't a valid defense.
"I said years ago that I'd rather get death than life, and that still is true today," she told Phoenix television station KSAZ.
The penalty phase of the trial took a sudden break Monday, when the judge said that proceedings could not continue and that Arias would make the statement to the jury.
If Arias is given a sentence of death, she would be the fourth woman on death row in the state.
