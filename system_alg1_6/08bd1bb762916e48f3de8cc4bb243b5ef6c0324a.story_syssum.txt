(CNN) -- It's not easy taking over from one of the greatest managers in football history, but David Moyes has been assured that one trophy in his debut season at Manchester United will be considered a success.
The most important person in the club is the manager and that must always be sacrosanct.
Januzaj sent Wayne Rooney clear on goal and, although the England striker's shot was saved by Artur Boruc, Robin van Persie fired home from the rebound.
Chelsea came from behind to beat promoted Cardiff 4-1, as former African player of the year Samuel Eto'o scored his first goal for the London side since joining from Russia's Anzhi Makhachkala in August.
However, the Cameroon striker's cheeky dispossession of David Marshall when the visiting keeper bounced the ball -- which allowed Eden Hazard to equalize with the first of his two goals -- left Cardiff boss Malky Mackay fuming.
In the late match, Manchester City won away for the first time this season, beating West Ham 3-1 thanks to a double from Sergio Aguero to move above Southampton into fourth place.
