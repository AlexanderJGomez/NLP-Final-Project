Oxford Dictionaries' word for the year for 2013 is "selfie."
Yes, the first-ever known mention of the word "selfie" stemmed from an inebriated mouth with teeth protruding through its bottom lip.
"Selfie" is not slouching on its thrown, Oxford says of its word of the year.
"Selfie" has also been busy pumping out offspring in its namesake.
Fitting, since a drelfie in Australia was the first "selfie" that ever bore the name.
