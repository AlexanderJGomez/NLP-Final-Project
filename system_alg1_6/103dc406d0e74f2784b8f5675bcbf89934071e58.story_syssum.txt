"In this case, my office examined newly discovered scientific evidence that was not available at the time of the trial," Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth P. Thompson said in statement to CNN.
"Based on this new evidence, I believe a jury would have been more likely to return a different verdict," Thompson said.
Wilson was offered a deal by the district attorney's office for a nine-years-to-life sentence, but his case was disputed after he wrote Yarbough's family in 2005 saying that he had lied at the trial.
Yarbough's attorney and the district attorney's office began revisiting the case in 2010.
When asked about his relationship with Wilson, Yarbough said he has no animosity.
"It was hard to keep my hopes up, but God is good now, I'm out now, I'm free, thank God," Yarbough said.
