Maria Ressa, Editor in Chief of the online news agency Rappler in Manila, said Wednesday morning that conditions in the city were extreme, with howling winds and strong rain.
Fears over storm surges eased as the typhoon began to move away from the city, weakening from a Category 2 storm to a Category 1, with maximum sustained winds of about 150 kilometers per hour.
He said that, at that time, more than an inch of rain was falling per hour in the city, many areas of which are susceptible to flooding.
As the storm passed Legazpi, James Reynolds, a freelance videographer who spent the night in the city, ventured out and saw what he described as a "community effort" to clear the fallen trees and power lines, and repair some of the property damage.
"The problem with this storm is that it seems to have caught a lot of people off guard."
The storm cut across the main island of the Philippines, hitting numerous population centers across southern and central Luzon.
The storm is expected to brush the northern part of the Chinese island of Hainan on Friday evening local time (Friday morning ET) as a strong typhoon, likely still a Category 3.
