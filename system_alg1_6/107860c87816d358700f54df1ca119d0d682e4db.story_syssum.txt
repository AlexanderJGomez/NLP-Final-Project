U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan said Monday they were investigating reports that 10 Afghan civilians, including eight students, were killed Saturday in a coalition operation in the Narang district of Kunar province.
Coalition forces said they killed their targets, he said, but a delegation sent by the governor to investigate reported the civilian casualties.
"It is better to miss a target than to cause civilian casualties," he said.
