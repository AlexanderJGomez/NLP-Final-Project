One of the sources said the businessman had a visa to enter North Korea.
North Korea has detained several Americans in recent years, increasing tension levels in what is already a rocky relationship between Pyongyang and Washington.
South Korea accuses the North of torpedoing and sinking one of its warships in March 2010, killing 46 sailors, and last November, North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island, killing two South Korean marines and two civilians.
