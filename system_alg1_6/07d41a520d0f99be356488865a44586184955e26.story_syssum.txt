says Huntsman.
His family "has put about $400 million into the cancer center, and we've raised about a billion dollars for cancer research (overall)," he says.
After selling that company, he founded Huntsman Chemical Corp.
That dedication goes back decades.
Huntsman himself has also battled cancer, and has survived prostate cancer, mouth cancer and two types of skin cancer.
