But the popularity of the tournament also spawns another kind of madness -- one that includes college applications, vasectomies and HDTV upgrades.
Thanks to exposure from the NCAAs, such teams as Florida Gulf Coast and George Mason see rises in applications and endowments.
And those franchises may benefit more from losses than wins.
For all that, employers say the tournament is a net positive on morale.
Odds of picking a perfect bracket are 9.2 quintillion to 1, assuming each team has a 50% chance of winning every game.
Good luck!
