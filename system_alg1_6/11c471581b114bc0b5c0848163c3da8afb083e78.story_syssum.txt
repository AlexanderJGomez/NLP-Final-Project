The office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said it was still trying to determine exactly what happened at Camp Ashraf, near Baquba.
But Shahriar Kia, a spokesman for the MEK, said 44 of its members were killed.
The U.N. Assistance Mission in Iraq said Sunday that only 100 members of the MEK remained at Camp Ashraf.
"The priority for the Iraqi government is to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured and to ensure their security and safety against any violence from any side," Busztin said in a statement issued Sunday.
Sunni-Shiite frictions have escalated since an April incident in Hawija, in northern Iraq, where Iraqi security forces raided a site used by Sunni protesters to demonstrate against the Shiite-led government.
