Except for a handful of exceptions, for over 200 years the presidential nominees of both major political parties have been WASPs.
But it's over.
The demographics of our nation are changing and, by 2042, minorities are expected to become the majority in the U.S.
There's little doubt that we will see more diverse presidential candidates.
So, how did we get to where we are today where the white Protestant establishment seems to be losing power?
Back in the days when our nation was founded, only white men who owned land could vote.
In our first presidential election in 1789, no women, no blacks, no poor white men, and in many states neither Catholics nor Jews, were permitted to vote.
So WASPs, you've had your great run.
And there is no doubt that another white Protestant will rise up one day against the growing odds and win the White House.
