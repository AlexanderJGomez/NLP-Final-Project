Tarino Lightbourn said in his statement to the Nassau, Bahamas, jury that a doctor told medics to keep administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation on Jett Travolta despite knowing the teen was dead, and that the ambulance company was told to transport him to the hospital -- something not usually done if a person was already dead.
Travolta testified he initially told the ambulance driver to rush them to an airport where his private jet was parked and where Travolta, who is a pilot, planned to fly his son to a West Palm Beach, Florida, hospital instead of driving him to one in nearby Freeport.
At the hospital, the actor was told his son "wasn't alive," he said.
Lightbourn said Wednesday that he asked attorney Bridgewater to assist him in negotiations with Travolta's attorneys.
Lightbourn said his eyes popped when Travolta's attorney offered him $15 million for the document Travolta signed.
Murrio Ducille, who represents Bridgewater, said to Travolta's attorney, "you came to the island with evil in your heart."
