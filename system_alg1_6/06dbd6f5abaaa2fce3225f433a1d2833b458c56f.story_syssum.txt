As the school year wound down, Matthew's health worsened.
"When we put him back in school this year, within three weeks, he missed 10 days with a respiratory infection," Melissa Asselin said.
When he was in school, he became ill," Asselin said.
Even when children don't miss school, he said, the medications they take for asthma and conditions like rhinitis, an allergic reaction to mold or dust, can make it harder for them to do their best work.
"It takes a lot to make you sick, but it takes very little exposure once you're sensitized to provoke symptoms," Santilli said.
Researchers and others who follow the issue say school air problems have probably been exacerbated in recent years by funding cutbacks that have resulted in less money for building upkeep and maintenance.
Kids aren't the only ones affected by school air.
More than half of Chicago teachers responding to the same survey also reported fair or poor school air quality.
Tests this fall at Matthew Asselin's school, Hinsdale Elementary, showed elevated levels of mold in the gymnasium/cafeteria and two other areas, and the school district spent $16,000 for a thorough cleaning.
"He's a different child," she said.
