(CNN) -- "Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens" director J.J. Abrams has come up with a nostalgic way to reveal the names of the movie's characters.
According to the cards, Isaac, the X-wing pilot seen in the first trailer, is playing someone named Poe Dameron.
And Daisy Ridley, the actress we see speeding through a desert landscape in the trailer, is playing a character named Rey.
That's all Abrams has shared for now, but we're still a long way off from "The Force Awakens' " release date.
