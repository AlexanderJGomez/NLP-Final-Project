"Our 44 fallen heroes from our police force, the youngest at 26 and the most senior at 39 years old, pushed themselves and exerted all their effort to do what they could, not only for themselves and their families, but for our beloved country," he said.
"Capturing Basit Usman is number one on our list of priorities," he said.
I'm sure if you will ask them, it is worth it."
Secretary of the Department of Interior and Local Government Mar Roxas said that the commandos were retreating from the assault on their targets when they came under fire from members of the BIFF.
On Wednesday, Aquino delivered a speech to the nation vowing that the deaths would not derail the deal with the MILF, saying the fallen police had given their lives for the cause of peace.
But Benigno said in his speech that "even if the MILF and BIFF now constitute two different groups, many of them are related by blood or by affinity.
The statement reiterated the MILF's "full commitment" to the peace process, extended sympathies to the families of the fallen police and announced its own investigation into the incident.
