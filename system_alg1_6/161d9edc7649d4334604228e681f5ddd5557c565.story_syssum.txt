The one movie I wrote in my mind a hundred times and on paper nine or 10 times, though, was "42."
Well, once upon a time, I was encouraged to bring Robinson's life story to the screen, only to be discouraged by the way reel life turns out.
I spent many hours with Rachel Robinson cramming to learn details of the life they shared.
The man I mean is, naturally -- well, not Jackie Robinson, but an equally monumental gent.
We fought to get it made.
To them, it isn't the story of a man.
"For what?"
Someone familiar with our script slips a copy to Rachel Robinson, in the hope she will give her blessings to Pepper and me taking a crack at Mr. and Mrs. Robinson's remarkable tale.
"The Jackie Robinson Story" is under way.
I spend all morning and afternoon in New York at the Jackie Robinson Foundation, conferring with Rachel and doing research.
The producer wants it one way.
She wants the life beyond baseball.
I read in Bill Rhoden's column in The New York Times that director Spike Lee is teaming up with Rachel Robinson to do a Jackie movie.
She is quoted: "I really felt, and I still feel, that a black man can understand another black man and all the nuances of his life better than anyone else can."
Rachel, you made it.
I give it thumbs-up and, hey, I haven't even seen it.
