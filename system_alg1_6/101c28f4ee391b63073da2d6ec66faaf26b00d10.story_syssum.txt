I'm not mad at Tiger Woods, or Nike.
Back in 2009, when Woods took his public plunge into disgrace by cheating on his wife with a long list of silicone-enhanced beauties, we criticized him for being a fake.
His wife and family -- and Tiger himself -- really were the only ones hurt by his actions.
Don't be mad at Tiger.
Tiger has nothing to do with my life or relationships.
Or, "One win will make my bosses happy and all will be forgotten?"
Why?
Tiger got back up.
And I hope this time around he can relax, be himself and enjoy the game.
