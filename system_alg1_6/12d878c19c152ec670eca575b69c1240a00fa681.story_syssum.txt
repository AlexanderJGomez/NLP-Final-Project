Of the six universities where I have worked, the University of Virginia stands out among them for not only the frequency of rape allegations but also for the unresponsiveness of administrators.
To an outsider this might seem like an admirable first step.
Recent interviews with university administrators show that they are highly reluctant to expel a student who commits rape (watch this eye-opening video).
I also sat through sexual assault board hearings where clear cut cases of rape occurred and supported survivors when they found out that the perpetrator was found "not responsible."
Let's remember that while recent news makes the University of Virginia seems more egregious than most institutions, a lot of students there are making a big difference -- men in the One in Four chapter and women in the One Less organization.
We also need to remember that ultimately, we don't do a lot of good focusing on just one university.
