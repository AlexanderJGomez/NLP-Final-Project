"I think it is loud and clear from everybody in Egypt that Mubarak has to leave today, and it is nonnegotiable for every Egyptian.
I think if you listen to the street, they are not asking for democracy, they are not asking for anything except the removal of Mubarak.
-- Edward Walker, former U.S. ambassador to Egypt, "State of the Union"
"People in Egypt have shown during this time a great deal of solidarity, a great deal of desire to see their country develop and prosper.
And I'm not prepared to comment on what kind of democratic process the Egyptian people can construct for themselves.
But we obviously want to see people who are truly committed to democracy, not to imposing any ideology on Egyptians, and therefore we would like to encourage that people who have been the voice of protests and been the voice of civil society be the ones at the table trying to design what would be an orderly transition to meet the democratic and economic needs of the people."
"What's important to us is Egypt, it's not Mubarak.
"I think that President Mubarak, he knows what's going on in his own country.
And we have authorized voluntary departure, which means that we will assist American citizens to leave Egypt.
...
And I don't think the American people will tolerate increasing the debt limit without serious reductions in spending and changes to the budget process, so that we can make sure that this never happens again.
-- House Majority Leader John Boehner, "Fox News Sunday"
"The president has said he's open to changes to this.
I came here to do something on behalf of the American people."
-- Boehner, "Fox News Sunday"
