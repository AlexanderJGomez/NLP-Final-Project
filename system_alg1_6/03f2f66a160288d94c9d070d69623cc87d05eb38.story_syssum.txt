Baghdad (CNN) -- Some Christians in Iraq's capital were considering leaving, following a wave of bombings targeting members of their religion that left two dead and 16 others wounded.
The violence has prompted a "slow but steady exodus" of thousands of Christians from Baghdad and Mosul, the U.N. refugee agency said recently.
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Baghdad and Mosul Christians have headed to other destinations in Iraq, including the Kurdish region and the Nineveh Plains, which have a strong Christian presence.
Many Christians in Iraq said they toned down their Christmas celebrations this year because of threats by militants in recent weeks.
