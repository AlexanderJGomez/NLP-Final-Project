London (CNN) -- South African double-amputee sprinter Oscar Pistorius, who made headlines at the Olympics, set a world record on Saturday in London in defense of the first of his three Paralympic titles.
Britain's Neil Fachie, piloted by Barney Storey, smashed the world record to earn gold in the men's individual B 1-kilometer time trial, an event on a tandem bicycle for the visually impaired.
Britain's Sarah Storey, wife of Barney Storey, made it a double gold for the household Saturday with victory in the women's individual C4-5 500-meter time trial, while U.S. cyclist Jennifer Schuble took silver.
British medal hope Ellie Simmonds, also 17, won her heat in a time a fraction faster than Arlen, the world record holder.
That order held up in the finals, with Simmonds setting a world record in finishing a second ahead of Arlen -- with the two of them both 13 seconds faster than any other competitor.
In another display of dominance, Nigeria took its fifth powerlifting medal of the Games on Saturday, compliments of Esther Oyema in the women's -48 kilograms competition.
