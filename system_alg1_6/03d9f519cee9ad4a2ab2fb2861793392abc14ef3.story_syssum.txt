But in recent years, the fishing industry has come under severe threat as a result of the ongoing risk posed by Somali pirates roaming the waters off the Horn of Africa.
"Anything that disrupts the tourism or fishing industry or the maritime equilibrium is a very big problem for us," he adds.
"There's no fish," explains local fisherman Patrick Pierre.
He says fish intake has fallen nearly 25% in the last five years.
Since 2006, the year the World Bank report takes as the starting point of piracy, exports of fish products from piracy-hit countries have declined by 23.8%.
"Five years ago, there was a lot of fish," says Pierre.
