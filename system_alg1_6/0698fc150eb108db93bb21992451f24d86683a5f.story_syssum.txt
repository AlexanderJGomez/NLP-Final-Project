Jett Webb killed the massive animal last month in eastern North Carolina.
Webb, 34, said hunting isn't about bagging trophies for him.
"The meat the pig provided and the memory that hunting provides is worth more than any trophy," he said.
It topped out, but Webb said he didn't think the boar weighed much more than 500 pounds.
In North Carolina, wild boar may be hunted year round during normal hunting hours.
