(CNN) -- "The Borgias" are back for a second season and according to star Jeremy Irons we can expect even more nefarious plotting and lustful encounters.
Irons: Yes life was more on the edge.
People were used to fighting, people were used to dying.
Irons: I don't think about it.
Irons: Often (speaking with a full mouth).
Irons: That's very nice.
Irons: It's strange because it's always the experience of making it that's the great thing.
Irons: I like the youth of the city and it has a slightly crumbly nature about it because they haven't quite got the money to finish everything off.
