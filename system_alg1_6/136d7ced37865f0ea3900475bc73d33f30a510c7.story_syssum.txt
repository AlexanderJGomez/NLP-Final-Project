Beijing (CNN) -- Dozens of Chinese workers angry over a pay dispute have held their U.S. boss hostage for five days, the American businessman said.
Starnes said the problem came when workers who already moved to another division also wanted severance packages.
There is no reason to be doing this other than bad information," he said.
Capella said the company has offered protesting employees a lesser severance package if they want to leave.
But he said the 80 to 100 employees at odds are demanding about $500,000 -- which would bankrupt the company.
