I had no experience whatsoever; I just wrote the first four songs in my life, which were "Bad Motor Scooter," "Make It Last," "One Thing on My Mind," and "I Don't Want It," played them for Ronnie upon first meeting, shook my hand, and said, "Let's start a band."
I told my guitar player, "I want you to be like that" -- like Ronnie Montrose.
I was talking to a guy a couple of days after the show, and he said, "That's Ronnie Montrose, and that was his last show.
He said, "Come on in.
I played him my four songs, we shook hands, and he said, "Let's start a band.
Like I said, I went from zero to a hundred in the blink of an eye -- all because of Ronnie.
We butted heads and I got thrown out of the band [after one more album, 1974's Paper Money], but I carried on with that "first Ronnie Montrose" I saw.
He said on the first Van Halen record, he took the first Montrose record in there and said, "Boom.
Eddie had a totally new twist on the whole guitar style thing, but as far as the chording goes -- not his soloing as much as the chording -- yeah, he took some of that big open chord thing [from Montrose].
Montrose, the whole band, has not been there.
And he was in, we were all in.
[I would like Montrose to be remembered] as one of the pioneers of American heavy/hard rock.
But if you're going to remember him for anything, put on that first Montrose record.
