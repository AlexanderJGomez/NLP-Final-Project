WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Chinese military continues to increase spending on efforts to break into U.S. military computer systems, expand its Navy, and invest in intercontinental nuclear missiles and weapons to destroy satellites, according to the latest U.S report on China's military power.
The United States conducted a similar strike last month on a broken U.S. spy satellite before it re-entered the Earth's atmosphere.
The United States is also concerned about the purchase of more submarines by the Chinese navy as well as plans for more aircraft carriers.
Pentagon officials worry the continued increase in Chinese military spending is slowly tipping the balance of power between China and Taiwan in China's favor.
