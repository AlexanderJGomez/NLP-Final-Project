Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan's nuclear watchdog on Wednesday said a toxic water leak at the tsunami-damaged Fukushima Daiichi power plant has been classified as a level 3 "serious incident" on an international scale.
The operator has stored hundreds of thousands of tons of the contaminated water in huge tanks at the site.
But more than two years later, they are still being used.
