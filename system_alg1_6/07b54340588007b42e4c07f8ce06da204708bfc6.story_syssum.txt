NEW YORK (CNN) -- The chairman of India's UB Group, which includes Bangalore-based Kingfisher Airlines and United Breweries, made the winning $1.8 million bid on a number of Mahatma Gandhi's personal items on auction.
Still, the government had hoped Otis would not allow the public to bid on the items.
Soni, the culture minister, said that India's government exercised several options to stop the auction at the Antiquorum in New York.
He did not even have a home to live in."
