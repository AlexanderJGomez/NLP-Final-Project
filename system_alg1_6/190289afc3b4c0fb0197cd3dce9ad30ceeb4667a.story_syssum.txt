Kellen Winslow recently had a second staph infection and has accused his team of covering it up.
The Browns said in a statement Saturday that the team and Winslow had worked through their differences, and that the team looked forward to his return.
Experts say Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, a form of staph resistant to common antibiotics, has become a more prevalent problem in settings such as contact sports that involve skin-to-skin touching.
Athletes often get cuts and abrasions; MRSA can enter uncovered skin breaks and cause infection.
A report from the CDC said that the deaths of four children from MRSA in North Dakota and Minnesota during the late 1990s "demonstrate the potential severity of community-acquired MRSA infections."
Larson said she is not directly familiar with Winslow's situation but understands the dilemma that a team would face if a player contracted a staph infection.
On Thursday, the Brown's General Manager Phil Savage said the team did not alert players to Winslow's staph infection partly because of the health privacy laws and partly because the team was in "game mode" when Winslow had a confirmed diagnosis.
Winslow said in a statement released through his publicist, Denise White of EAG Sports Management, that he had been discouraged from making the issue public.
