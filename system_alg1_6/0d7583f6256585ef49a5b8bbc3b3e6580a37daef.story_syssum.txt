Washington has thus far been cautious in dealing with Syria, favoring strong words and sanctions against the regime and supporting Arab efforts to stop the violent military crackdown.
Meanwhile, Syria continues its slow, steady descent into sectarian strife.
Syria is tightly linked both to the evolving Arab politics -- as influenced by the past year's Arab popular uprisings -- and to the ongoing shifts in the Saudi and Iranian-led regional axes of powers that have resulted from withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq.
Iran has described the violence in Syria as part of a Western-Israeli conspiracy against the regime.
Washington will most likely confront urgent Arab and Syrian opposition requests for direct involvement in Syria.
The regime has life support from Iran, Iraq and Lebanon, and thrives on terror and Arab schisms.
Washington's policies should focus now on expanding and organizing its cooperation with Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which have deep interest in a change of power in Damascus; supporting the Free Syrian Army through Saudi Arabia and Turkey; strengthening sanctions against Syria in concert with regional and international allies, including placing sanctions on Sunni merchants closely associated with the regime.
