(CNN) -- Hurricane experts are throwing cold water on an idea backed by billionaire Microsoft founder Bill Gates aimed at controlling the weather.
Hurricanes are fueled by warm water, and cooling the waters surrounding a storm would slow a storm's momentum.
The idea itself isn't groundbreaking, according to Gray, who said it could only be feasible if the barges were put into place at the beginning of hurricane season with the idea that storms will come.
Even if the technology does work, Gray said it won't completely halt a hurricane.
But the coldest water is usually at the rear of the storm, so sometimes it's too late to weaken [the storm], Emanuel said.
A spokeswoman for Intellectual Ventures, which holds about 27,000 technology patents, didn't elaborate on the cost associated with the patent.
"This type of technology is not something humankind would use as a 'Plan A' or 'Plan B,'" Paul "Pablos" Holman, an inventor in the Intellectual Ventures laboratory, wrote on the company blog.
"I would love to see Bill Gates, with all his money, use some of it to experiment."
