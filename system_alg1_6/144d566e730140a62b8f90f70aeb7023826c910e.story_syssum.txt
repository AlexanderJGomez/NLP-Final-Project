But Blaszczykowski struck a superb left-foot equaliser on 57 minutes to earn Poland a second successive 1-1 draw and ensure that Group A remains wide open.
Either way, as it had been in their first game against Poland, Greece's first-half luck was completely out.
The victory means Bilak's Czech side now have three points from two Group A games, but leaves Greece knowing that only a win against Russia in their final group game will give them any chance of reaching the knockout stages.
Instead, it was Russia who took control eight minutes before half-time.
That was a trait which ultimately came to haunt Russia as, from one such stray ball, Poland broke with devastating effect.
