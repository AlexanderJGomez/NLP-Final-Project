Former flight engineer George Hopkins says he remembers vividly being hijacked to Cuba in 1968.
"I can still remember very vividly," said Hopkins, 71.
Hopkins said he felt a burning sensation where the gun was pointed on his face.
"He said don't worry about it, we've done this before," Hopkins said.
The hijackers left the plane after it landed, but Cuban authorities held Hopkins and the rest of the crew on board for about six hours before they were allowed to fly back to the United States.
Hopkins wonders now whether he would even recognize Pena Soltren.
