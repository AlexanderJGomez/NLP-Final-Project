Bush has said he is aware that the opening of his presidential library would reopen debates over the Iraq War and the policies he pursued after the September 11 terrorist attacks.
Bush kept his word and acted, Carter said.
"This is a Texas-sized party," Obama said.
"That's what President George W. Bush chose to do," Obama said.
"You know, I'm really not that concerned about why people did what during my presidency," he said.
As the son of another former president, Bush said he wouldn't mind seeing his brother Jeb Bush run for the highest office.
In addition to the library and museum, the Presidential Center includes the George W. Bush Institute, a public policy institute.
