BAE said Thursday it is working with American Airlines to put laser systems on the planes, which will be flying between New York and California.
DHS, American Airlines and BAE Systems were all careful to assure there will be no test firing -- through simulators or otherwise.
Military systems require frequent maintenance -- not practical for commercial airplanes that fly for extended periods between maintenance checks.
The airline believes protection is best accomplished by preventing terrorists from getting shoulder-fired missiles, or by using ground-based systems, spokesman John Hotard said.
