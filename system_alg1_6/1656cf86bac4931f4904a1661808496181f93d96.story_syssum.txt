BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN)  -- Daniel Rendon Herrera, Colombia's most-wanted drug kingpin suspect, was arrested early Wednesday, Colombian President Alvaro Uribe announced at a news conference.
The United States had issued an extradition order for Rendon, whom 300 members of an elite police unit captured.
Authorities nearly captured Rendon twice in the past few months, but he escaped, Santos said at the military airport.
Santos also issued a message Wednesday to a cartel suspect he identified only as "El Cuchillo," the Knife.
