Stunning photographs purport to show the leopard leaping across rooftops, squeezing through a hole in the wall of the Meerut Cantonment Hospital, and snarling at a baton-wielding official through a window.
No sightings were confirmed on Monday and Sushant did not rule out the possibility the leopard had retreated into the forests.
The incident is the latest in a series of big cat attacks in India, including at least one alleged man-eater, also in Uttar Pradesh, home to one of the world's last remaining tiger habitats.
Officials said at least nine people have died from tiger attacks since the end of December.
However, he agreed that if a particular animal was positively identified as one responsible for human deaths, "then one option is taking her out."
