Xinhua said that Zhuang, who was considered one of the best players in the world in the 1960s, had met U.S. table tennis player Glenn Cowan at a tournament in Japan.
Pictures of their encounter spread around the world, and, under the orders of Chinese leader Mao Zedong, the U.S. team was invited to visit China.
Their journey turned out to be the first public move in a rapprochement between the two bitter enemies.
Zhuang later returned to Beijing, where he coached table tennis to teenagers.
