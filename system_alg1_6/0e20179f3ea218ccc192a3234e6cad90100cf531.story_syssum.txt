Almost all those varied metrics of social wellness have improved by more than 20% over the past two decades.
Americans enjoy longer, healthier lives in more stable families and communities than we did 20 years ago.
Even though the world's population has doubled over the past 50 years, the percentage living in poverty has declined by 50% over that period.
Household debt soared over the past 20 years, though it has dipped slightly thanks to the credit crunch of the last few years.
But no one takes out a prime-time ad campaign to tout the remarkable decrease in air pollution that we have seen over the past few decades, even thought that success story is far more important than a trivial improvement in laundry soap.
The most striking example of this can be seen in the second half of the 1990s, a period in which both economic and social trends were decisively upbeat: The stock market was surging, but inequality was in fact on the decline; crime, drug use, welfare dependence, poverty -- all were trending in an encouraging direction.
The one positive social trend that did generate a significant amount of coverage -- the extraordinary drop in the U.S. crime rate since the mid-'90s -- seems to have been roundly ignored by the general public.
We should celebrate these stories of progress, not so we can rest on our laurels but instead so we can inspire the next generation to build on that success.
