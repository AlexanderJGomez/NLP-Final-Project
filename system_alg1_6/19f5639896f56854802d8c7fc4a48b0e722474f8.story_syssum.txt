I had no conscience," Santos said at a boxing gym in El Paso, Texas.
Customs and Border Protection officials in El Paso and San Diego report that in recent months, they've seen a rise in the number of juvenile drug smugglers getting busted at border checkpoints.
Drug cartels "just need someone who can legitimately cross the border," said Bill Molaski, the El Paso Port Director for U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
"I can't say I wasn't nervous," Santos said.
Santos, who is now 21, says he was arrested once but spent only a few days in jail.
Federal and state authorities say drug cartels recruit young smugglers from schools.
Santos says he got out of the smuggling business two years ago.
Santos is working two part-time jobs, and he says it takes him two months to earn the money that he used to make in one day of drug smuggling.
"The peace of mind is good," Santos said after a bruising workout.
