Bogota, Tennessee (CNN) -- Those who say no man is an island never met Danny Hayes.
Whatever comes, Hayes said he will not be moved.
To get to dry ground, Hayes paddles a small boat about 50 yards to Highway 78.
Since the waters began to rise, Hayes said, all manner of animals have swum by the trailer, looking for higher ground.
But his and his neighbors' homes are safe, Hayes said, while he patrols his small "island."
But with the water slowly receding, it appears that Hayes will be spared from the flood's wet grasp.
Asked what he will do while the floodwaters retreat, Hayes replied with a ready joke.
