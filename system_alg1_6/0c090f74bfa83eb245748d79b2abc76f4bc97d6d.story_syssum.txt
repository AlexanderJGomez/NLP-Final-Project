(CNN) -- After the vote in the House of Representatives to slash the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, I wrote a column against cutting food stamps.
But who are the people using food stamps?
Unemployment increases food stamp rolls, not people with children who go looking for aid.
Also, of course, welfare is not the same as food stamps.
As for food stamps, more than 72% of all SNAP beneficiaries are families with children.
Being on food stamps can be demeaning.
Some food stamp recipients say some cashiers have made them feel uncomfortable and embarrassed.
