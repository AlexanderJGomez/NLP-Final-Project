(The Frisky) -- Dan had a big grin in his profile picture, like he'd just said something super funny.
!
It was.
"You like fettuccini, right?"
he asked, shoving pasta in his face.
"I hate it when they do that," Dan said.
Dan asked.
Dan beat me to it.
I have no idea if you'd like to see me again, but a part of me would strongly like to ask you to do so.
But--
So.
Dear Dan, There are so many things I'd like to tell you.
Yeah, thanks for sending me that message.
Enjoy being single, Dan.
Dan doesn't deserve my heated words, or the three minutes of my life it'd take to write them.
