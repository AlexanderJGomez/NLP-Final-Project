A new survey reveals that one in seven Americans -- more than 46 million people -- relies on charitable programs and services to get the nutrition they need to remain healthy.
The federal government defines "food security" as all people in a household having enough food for a healthy lifestyle at all times.
Of the households included in the Hunger In America survey, 66% reported having to choose between paying for food and paying for medicine or medical care, 79% of households purchased the cheapest food available, even if they knew it wasn't the healthiest option.
It falls to charitable organizations, such as Feeding America's network of 200 member food banks to make up the shortfall.
Still, hungry Americans are left with hard choices about how to keep their families healthy.
Another emphasized the importance of advance planning, writing, "I'm homeless and I am still able to buy food and sometimes even meat!
In Aiken's eyes, the struggle for healthy food is one that all Americans must first acknowledge, and then help shoulder.
