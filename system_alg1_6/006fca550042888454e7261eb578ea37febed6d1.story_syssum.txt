Judge Antonio Cassese, the president of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon, said in an open letter to the four men accused in the 2005 attack that they will be treated fairly if they appear before the court or even participate in the trial proceedings without being present.
Supporters say he was killed because of his opposition to Syrian influence in Lebanon.
Cassese said the tribunal "will appoint the best professionals to represent them in court" in their absence.
I therefore strongly appeal to the accused to take advantage of the broad legal possibilities offered by our Rules of Procedure and Evidence, thereby contributing to the establishment of truth and the conduct of fair proceedings," he said.
