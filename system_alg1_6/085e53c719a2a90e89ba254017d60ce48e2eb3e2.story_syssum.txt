Most of these cases -- 208, to be specific -- have been linked to Ohio State University in Columbus, the city's health department said.
Melanie Amato, an Ohio Department of Health spokeswoman, attributes the spike to many students heading home, where they could end up spreading mumps or at least be seen and diagnosed by doctors.
There is no specific treatment for mumps, and patients usually recover after a week or two, but occasionally the disease can cause serious complications such as encephalitis, meningitis, deafness or inflammation of the breasts or ovaries in girls who have reached puberty, the CDC said.
Mumps isn't the only infectious disease outbreak that Ohio is dealing with.
