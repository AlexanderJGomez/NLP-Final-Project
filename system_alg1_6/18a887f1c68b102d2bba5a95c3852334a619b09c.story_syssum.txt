But Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis said that, after extensive debate, the delegates said they wanted more time to discuss the contract with union members.
As of Sunday, though, Lewis said a "clear majority" of union delegates did not want to suspend the strike given the proposed contract.
Lewis, from the teachers union, said that one problem is that "there's no trust" of school board members.
Another point of contention involves the teacher evaluation system, Lewis said.
In addition, "highly rated teachers" who lost their jobs when their schools were closed can "follow their students to the consolidated school," according to a summary of the proposed contract from Chicago Public Schools.
"There is no reason why our kids cannot be in school while the union reviews the agreement," Vitale said.
