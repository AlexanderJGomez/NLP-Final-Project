Howard, who premiered the follow-up in Rome, Italy, this week, said there was "residual antagonism from 'The Da Vinci Code,' " but Vatican officials ignored the movie by not responding to suggestions that the church was offended.

"I think there's some residual antagonism from 'The Da Vinci Code,' " Howard said.
Howard said he tried to reach out to the Catholic Church.
"As a general rule, no commercial films are filmed in churches in Rome, and no exception was made for 'Angels & Demons,' " Wauck said.
"One thing that was important to me and to all of us was to be as authentic as we possibly could be about what Conclave was like, that period when they're trying to elect the pope," Howard said.
"There are so many reasons to do it, and when I really looked at 'Angels & Demons' and realized that it was going to feel different," he said.
Howard said he will wait to decide whether he will make a movie based on Brown's third Langdon novel.
