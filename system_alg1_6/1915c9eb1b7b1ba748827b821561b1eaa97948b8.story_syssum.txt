BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Samar Saed Abdullah's entire body trembles as she speaks about her impending execution.
She had been on death row for about two years, and she was terrified.

Amnesty International issued a report Tuesday saying that at least 1,000 prisoners sit on Iraq's death row and that Iraq now has one of the highest execution rates in the world.

Me?
Samar feels betrayed, both by the man she once loved and by a judicial system that is about to send her to her death.
