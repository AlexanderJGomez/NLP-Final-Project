Among the dead were two Boeing employees, among four onboard the flight, their company said late Thursday in a posting on its Web site.
Among those injured in the crash, 63 remained hospitalized Thursday, six of them in critical condition, said Theo Weterings, the mayor of Haarlemmermeer municipality, where Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport is located.
"I want to express my deepest sympathies again to the victims of TK flight 1951," Weterings said.
In the wake of the disaster, Turkish Airlines executives and officials from Turkey's Transportation Ministry said the Boeing 737-800 had last been inspected December 22.
"There was no problem with maintenance in the records of the plane," Candan Karlicetin, executive board chairman of Turkish Airlines, said in a news conference just hours after the crash.
Aviation experts say Turkish Airlines has a relatively good safety record, though in 2003, more then 70 people were killed when a Turkish Airlines domestic flight crashed in fog near the southeastern city of Diyarbakir.
An employee in Turkish Airlines' advertising department said the promotional campaign was suspended in the wake of the fatal plane crash.
