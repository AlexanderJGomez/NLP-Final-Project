(CNN) -- Security forces under Hamas rule have tortured Gaza prisoners during the group's five years of rule, a new report said Wednesday.
Abdel Karim Shrair, for example, was charged with collaborating with Israel, the report said.
Also this report did not discuss the basic human needs of the Gaza people by discussing the Israeli siege on the Gaza Strip and did not indicate to any of the violations committed by the Israeli Zionist enemy to our Palestinian prisoners inside the Israeli jails and prisons," he said.
CNN's Kareem Khadder in Jerusalem contributed to this report.
