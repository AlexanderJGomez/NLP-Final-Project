While unwavering in their belief in the treatment, Ashley's parents continue to insist on anonymity.
In the year since Ashley's parents went public, not only did the hospital that sterilized Ashley admit it broke Washington state law, but also the doctor who treated Ashley committed suicide.
When Ashley was 6, her parents approached Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center in Seattle, Washington, for the operations.
"If parents of children like Ashley believe this treatment will improve their children's quality of life, then they should be diligent and tenacious in providing it for them," her parents write.
"We know from reliable sources his treatment of our daughter was a source of energy and motivation for him," Ashley's parents write.
Another complicating factor -- some doctors remain adamant the treatment shouldn't be available.
But like many other people with disabilities, 43-year-old Anne Rader, who also has cerebral palsy but in a much less severe form than Ashley's, sees the treatment as dehumanizing -- and perhaps most significantly -- irrevocable.
Ashley's parents remain convinced what they did for Ashley is the most loving choice they could have made for their daughter and want that for other disabled children.
