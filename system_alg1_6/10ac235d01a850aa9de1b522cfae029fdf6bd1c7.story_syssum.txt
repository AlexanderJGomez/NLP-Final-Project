(CNN) -- Josep Guardiola has confirmed he is to step down as Barcelona coach at the end of this season, saying four years in charge of one of the world's biggest clubs is an eternity.
"I had to announce this today because I didn't want to continue with the confusion.
Guardiola joined Barcelona as a 13-year-old and won six La Liga titles and one European Cup as a player with the club.
"Because of the emotions I feel I preferred not to be present at Pep's press conference and to stay away from the press because I know they will look for the pain on the players' faces.
"I know this is the best possible place, but it is my time to go.
Day by day for so many years they made it possible."
"I need to recover that feeling," he said.
