Obama said his administration is trying to clean up "a mess" left behind by the Bush administration.
In the past two months, the former vice president has become a frequent critic of the new administration in numerous national media interviews.
"The administration asserts that transferring terrorists from a detention facility on an isolated island to a prison inside the U.S. will make Americans safer.
Obama on Thursday pledged not to release any Guantanamo Bay detainees who threaten the United States.
But Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin said he thinks the U.S. can safely house terror detainees.
The sooner that we bring Guantanamo to a close, the better," he said.
Former Navy lawyer Charles Swift, who won a landmark Supreme Court ruling that knocked down the Bush administration's system of military commissions, said U.S. laws already cover the "vast majority" of cases the Obama administration will face.
"I want to ascribe to people the best of motives, and I presume that the former vice president believes for whatever reason that force is the only thing that works," he said.
