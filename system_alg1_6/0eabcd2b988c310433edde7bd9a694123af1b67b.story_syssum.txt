Nolen was trying "to get revenge on certain people he felt responsible" for his job loss, Mashburn said.
The FBI is also investigating the attack because Nolen "was saying Arabic terms in the attack," Mashburn said.
Vaughan arrived at the plant with a rifle and shot Nolen as he was charging with knife in hand, Mashburn said.
In unrelated incidents, Nolen was convicted of assault and battery on a police officer, escape from detention and possession of marijuana, all in January 2011, according to court papers filed by prosecutors.
