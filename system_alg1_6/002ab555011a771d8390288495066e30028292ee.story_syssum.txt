Most of the time I slap on some makeup in the morning so I don't look bad if somebody snaps a picture.
Very rarely do I go out without makeup.
I mean, it's basically moldy milk, and it doesn't smell that great--but it's so good!
Always take an hour for yourself to go do something positive.
Plus, I get a decent cardio workout every night onstage.
I don't do smelly soaps or wear perfume, so lotion is kind of my perfume.
And Gwen Stefani's perfume [L], is good too.
I'll put on lip gloss and go, "That needs to shimmer."
I know I'm doing myself a disservice, but I'd rather put on a muumuu and have people at least think there might be a skinny person underneath than put on something tight and have them think, Look at that gut!
I just laugh because the audience thinks this is so glamorous--and here I am under the stage with these ropes and equipment, my butt pressed against plastic!
