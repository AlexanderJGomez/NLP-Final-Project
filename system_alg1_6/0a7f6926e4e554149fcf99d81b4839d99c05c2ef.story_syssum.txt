LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Michael Jackson's ex-wife and the mother of his two oldest children, Debbie Rowe, has agreed not to challenge the singer's mother for custody of the children, according to a joint statement from lawyers for Rowe and Katherine Jackson.
Katherine Jackson gained temporary guardianship of the three children soon after his death last month.
"We were all united in our goals to do what is best for Michael's wonderful children, and both Mrs. Jackson and Debbie Rowe were on the exact same page," McMillan said.
McMillan, in a statement issued Wednesday, said Katherine Jackson was not disputing the will.
A daughter -- Paris Michael Katherine Jackson -- was born the next year.
Rowe gave up parental rights to Jackson in 2001, but she changed her mind more than two years later and sought temporary custody of the children.
