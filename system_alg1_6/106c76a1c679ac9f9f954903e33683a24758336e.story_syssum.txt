(CNN) -- Rioting has flared near Belfast on Saturday after the arrests of three men in the killings of two soldiers in Northern Ireland last week, police said.
Two masked gunmen with automatic rifles shot them as the soldiers picked up a pizza delivery at the barracks, authorities said.
Two days after the soldiers were killed, a police officer was killed in a shooting southwest of Belfast.
The party is widely thought to be linked to the Irish Republican Army.
