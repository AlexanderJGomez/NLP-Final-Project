Arora, who shared the video with CNN on Sunday, said he also turned it over to authorities investigating Lisa's disappearance in hopes it will help in the search for the girl.
Bradley said she last saw Lisa at 6:40 p.m. the night before.
The attorney for Lisa's parents said the release of the affidavit Friday was "unfortunate," as it could derail the search for the missing girl.
"I was the last one with her," a tearful Bradley said.
I know the kind of mother she is."
