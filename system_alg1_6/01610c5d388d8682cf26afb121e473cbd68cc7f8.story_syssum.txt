Armitage said he had seen a memo that said Plame was publicly chairing a meeting, so he assumed her CIA employment was not a secret.
"Well, even Mr. Novak has said that he used the word 'operative' and misused it," Armitage said.
Neither Armitage nor Rove was charged with a crime in the leak.
Wilson and Plame have accused Rove and other Bush officials of leaking her identity as a CIA officer in retaliation for her husband's emergence as an administration critic.
