We concluded that groups of children from disadvantaged and remote settings can learn to use computers and access internet resources, on their own, if given appropriate free, public and unsupervised access.
What came through unequivocally in this and further work on self-organizing systems in education was that groups of children -- irrespective of who or where they are, or what language they speak -- given free and public access to computers and the internet can:
Improve their English pronunciation on their own.
Form independent opinions and detect indoctrination.
This has been attributed to the lack of teachers willing to work in these areas.
Schools can access this "cloud" over Skype and children can interact with the mediators over free videoconferencing.
