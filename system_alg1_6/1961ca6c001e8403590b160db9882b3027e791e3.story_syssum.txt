WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A lawsuit filed in California against Kellogg, Brown and Root on Wednesday alleges the company and its subcontractor were involved in a human trafficking plan that forced Nepali men to work against their will in Iraq.
When the Nepali men arrived in Jordan, according to the lawsuit, the contractors took their passports and drove them into Iraq.
Gurung worked in a warehouse managed by KBR and was released 15 months later by the company, according to the law firm.
Handley says the other Nepali workers who were sent to Iraq with Gurung did not come forward for the lawsuit after they were eventually released from KBR.
However, the case led to increased awareness and enforcement of trafficking laws by the U.S. military.
