(CNN) -- Zara Phillips is not one to rest on her laurels.
But come back quickly she did.
"I always wanted to get back for the Worlds at the right time," Phillips says.
"When you come out of the Olympics you just go, 'Let's just do it all again,' " Phillips says.
"We're lucky because we can ride and go back and forth a bit, it fits in really well.
I'm lucky, she's really good."
Phillips' equestrian career, though, has not come without its setbacks.
"I think you get to see the signs when things are really good and when things aren't so good," Phillips reflects.
It was great fun, you know," Phillips says.
I'm very lucky."
