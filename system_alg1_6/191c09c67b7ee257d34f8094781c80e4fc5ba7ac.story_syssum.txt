Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama said Wednesday his administration will respond to new Ebola cases "in a much more aggressive way," taking charge of the issue after a second Texas health care worker was diagnosed with the disease.
Doing so, he said, "is an investment in our own public health.
"We will continue to press the administration for better information about what steps will be taken to protect the American people, including our troops, from this deadly virus," he said.
Everyone working on this challenge -- from the medical professionals at the bedside to the public health officials addressing containment of the infection -- is working to end the threat posed by this disease," Perry said in a statement.
"Every relevant agency at the local, state and national levels is working to support these individuals."
