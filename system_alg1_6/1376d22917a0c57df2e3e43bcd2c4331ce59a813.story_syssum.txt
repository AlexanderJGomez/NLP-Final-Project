The NTSB identified the problem as a cracked fan midshaft on a Dreamliner General Electric GEnx-1B turbofan engine, the group said in a written statement posted on its website Thursday.
The first Dreamliner engine problem occurred on July 28 during a taxi test at Charleston International Airport in South Carolina.
The Federal Aviation Administration, General Electric and Boeing are involved in the Chinese investigation.
