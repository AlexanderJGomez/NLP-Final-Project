They first saw Anastasia from a distance in the audience of a talent show and later met her face-to-face accompanied by a nurse and doctor, Josh Johnston said.
U.S. citizens adopted 17,416 children from foreign countries in 2008, accounting for 13 percent of adoptions that year compared to approximately 136,000 children in the United States, according to a 2011 report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Children's Bureau.

She sympathizes with Russians who want their children to stay in the land where they born but thinks the children are the ones who will suffer.
"Our son had been in that baby home for 12 months when we came along," she said.
