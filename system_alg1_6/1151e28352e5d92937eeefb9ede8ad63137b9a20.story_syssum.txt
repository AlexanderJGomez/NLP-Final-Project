Legitimate environmental claims can be certified by independent outside third-party auditors.
There are certainly efforts underway to provide consumers with additional information about the environmental impacts of their purchasing decisions.
Some particularly savvy green consumers, however, want additional information beyond knowing that a product has been certified as meeting a standard.
As a result, those products are becoming more widely available for consumers too.
Now that the information is available, consumers can use the EPEAT information to make their own purchasing decisions.
There are persistent rumors of efforts underway to use the legislative power of the federal government to encourage greater transparency regarding the environmental footprint of a product and to make it easier to share that information with consumers.

Make sure the standard covers the environmental issues you and the environmental community are most concerned about.
Other programs -- including EcoLogo, Green Seal, and the Chlorine Free Products Association -- independently review product test data and visit the manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with the standard.
