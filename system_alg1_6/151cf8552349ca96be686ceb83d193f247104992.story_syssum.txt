New York (CNN) -- The father of a 4-year-old boy tortured and beaten to death in New York will be freed from jail to attend his son's funeral, authorities said Thursday.
A memorial service for Myls will be held Tuesday night at First Corinthian Baptist Church in Harlem.
Kryzie King, 27, was indicted in connection with the boy's death in Manhattan criminal court Wednesday.
In a statement last week, King's attorney, Bryan Konoski, said: "My client is not charged with homicide at this time and she is presumed to be innocent of allegations against her.
King told police that Myls' father dropped the child off for her to watch December 17 and that she was the "child's primary and sole caretaker" until the time of his death, the complaint said.
"Each one of these tragedies, it's our job to try to stop," he said.
