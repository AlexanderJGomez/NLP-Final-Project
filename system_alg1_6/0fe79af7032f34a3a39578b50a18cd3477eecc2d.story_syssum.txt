"This is pretty clearly somebody manufacturing fentanyl and selling it as heroin," Williams said.
Williams said fentanyl can be 10-100 times more potent than morphine, the base molecule in heroin, and it's only distributed as a powder when someone is manufacturing it illegally.
In 1988, Williams said, 17 people died when a chemist distributed fentanyl as heroin.
