(CNN)The family of James McNair, the late comedian known as "Jimmy Mack," has settled a lawsuit with Walmart over the auto accident that killed him and injured fellow comedian Tracy Morgan, McNair's family says.
Pamela McNair said the family will continue carrying on James' legacy as a humanitarian, and the finances from the settlement will help.
Little things that he's done are truly missed," McNair said.
