Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Scores of bodies were found in a mass grave outside the capital city of Port-au-Prince on Friday, a sign of Haitians' desperation three days after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake devastated the impoverished nation.
Meanwhile, a crucial 72-hour window elapsed Friday afternoon -- the time to free those who still may be alive trapped under the remains of buildings.
Aid workers continued to trickle into the country Friday, trying to provide water and food to survivors in the capital, which still was being rocked by aftershocks Friday.
Ban announced Friday that he will travel to Haiti on Sunday.
The United Nations announced Friday that at least 37 of its personnel had died -- 36 with the U.N. mission and one with the World Food Programme.
U.N. entities in Haiti employ more than 12,000 people.
