(CNN) -- Nearly one in four people worldwide is Muslim -- and they are not necessarily where you might think, according to an extensive new study that aims to map the global Muslim population.
There are about 1.57 billion Muslims in the world, according to the report, "Mapping the Global Muslim Population," by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life.
"Overall, the number is higher than I expected," he said, noting that earlier estimates of the global Muslim population have ranged from 1 billion to 1.8 billion.
One in five of the world's Muslims lives in a country where Muslims are a minority.
"In the rest of Europe -- Russia, Albania, Kosovo, those places -- Muslims are an indigenous population," he said.
One in three of the world's Shiite Muslims lives in Iran, which is one of only four countries with a Shiite majority, he said.
"We don't care only about Muslims," Grim said.
"We're trying to get the overall picture of religion in the world."
