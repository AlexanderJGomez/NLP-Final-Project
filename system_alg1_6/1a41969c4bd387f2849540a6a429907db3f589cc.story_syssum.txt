New York (CNN) -- A New York man has been charged with murder and attempted murder in connection with the stabbing of two children in Brooklyn, police said Thursday.
Mayor Bill de Blasio said the two children were "on their way to get ice cream" at the time.

Police initially said Mikayla was in critical condition.
A law enforcement official said Wednesday that DNA evidence from that knife helped police identify the suspect.
"Our family is strong, but we just want justice to be done."
Investigators are considering the possibility the suspect may be responsible for another fatal stabbing that occurred just two days earlier and blocks away.
Copeland was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital, police said.
