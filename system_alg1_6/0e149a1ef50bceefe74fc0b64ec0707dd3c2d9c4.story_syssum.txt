Connecticut Gov.
At least one Newtown church rang its bells 28 times, marking the deaths of the school's 26 victims; the gunman's mother, who was slain before the shooter went to the school; and the gunman himself, who authorities say committed suicide after the shootings.
In the state Capitol building in Hartford, a bell was rung for each of the school's 26 victims after their names were read.
Gov.
Perry also asked that churches ring their bells 26 times in honor of the victims at the school.
Flags are also flying at half-staff this Friday.
More than 2,200 miles west of Newtown, in Ogden, Utah, the hometown of shooting victim Emilie Parker was festooned Thursday with pink ribbons as her parents brought her body back for burial.
Seeing the pink -- his daughter's favorite color -- made him and his wife, Alissa, "feel like we were getting a big hug from everybody."
Funerals also are scheduled Saturday in Connecticut for Ana Marquez-Greene, 6, and Josephine Gay, 7.
