LONDON, England (CNN) -- British television audiences will be shown an assisted suicide for the first time Wednesday, when a documentary is aired about a man taking his own life at a Swiss clinic.
This is where the person who is going to die needs help to kill themselves and asks for it.
No.
Since then several attempts to legalize assisted suicide in the UK have been rejected.
Who does it?
Dignitas takes advantage of Switzerland's liberal laws on assisted suicide which suggest that a person can be prosecuted only if they are acting out of self interest.
