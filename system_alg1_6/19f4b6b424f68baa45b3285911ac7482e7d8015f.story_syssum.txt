South Africa is a country adrift.
The spat over the apparent failure by government to make proper arrangements for Nobel laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu -- a fierce Zuma critic -- to attend Mandela's funeral added to perceptions that a small coterie of arrogant, out-of-touch leaders around Zuma were at the helm of the country.
Thabo Mbeki, Mandela's successor who was removed from the presidency by Zuma in 2008, said last week that there was increasing frustration among ordinary people about the direction the country was taking.
Ordinary South Africans inured to corruption told me last week that they have no doubt that his hiring was corruptly influenced.
Members of the ruling ANC and society are now asking questions about the current crop of leaders' ability to get South Africa out of its current slump.
Is South Africa about to descend into racial conflagration because Mandela is gone, though?
It is highly unlikely that these challenges will unseat Mandela's ANC from power - yet.
In the meantime, South Africa will have a noisy election in 2014, remain on an unremarkable growth path and fail to live up to the promise it showed when Mandela became president in 1994.
