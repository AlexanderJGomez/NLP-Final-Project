(CNN) -- Day after day, men and women from Soweto, a township near Johannesburg, wake up at the crack of dawn to battle bumper-to-bumper traffic and cramped public transport to show up at work in time.
"It's not acceptable for people to have to take multiple legs of a journey to get to work," says Rehana Moosajee of the Mayoral Committee for Transport in Johannesburg.
For Colossa, the grind of commuting means he has to dedicate five hours a day to travel to and from work.
In Lagos, one of the world's megacities, getting to work often requires strong nerves.
"They might charge $1 in the morning for one trip one way and by afternoon they can go to $3," says Dayo Mobereola, managing director of the Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority, noting that commuters spend on average 40% of their income on transportation.
"The people of Lagos are yearning for regulated means of transportation," says Mobereola.
