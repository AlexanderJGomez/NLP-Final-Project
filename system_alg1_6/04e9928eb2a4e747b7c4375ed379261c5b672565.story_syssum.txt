Brisbane, Australia (CNN) -- Emergency services and Australian military personnel stepped up the search Friday for dozens of people still missing in Queensland as authorities and residents tried to assess the damage caused by the state's worst flooding in decades.
Residents in Brisbane were being urged not to enter floodwater because of the risk of illness after sewage plants along the river were inundated.
Bligh said 11,900 homes in Brisbane were fully flooded and 14,700 were partially flooded.
Queensland police have arrested 10 people on 18 charges of looting, Atkinson said.
Some 600 members of the Australian Defence Force were helping and more were expected, said Bligh.
So far, 70 towns and cities in Queensland have been affected by the flood, Bligh said.
By late Thursday, the brown, murky water had risen more than half a meter above the second floor.
"We've been coming back and forward just to check" on the hostel, Jackson said.
Elsewhere in the city, floodwater rose to rooftops, submerging houses and creating a logistical and financial headache for homeowners waiting for the water to drop so they could check the damage.
