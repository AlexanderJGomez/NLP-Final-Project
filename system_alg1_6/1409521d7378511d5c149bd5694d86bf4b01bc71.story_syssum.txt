But it did -- sort of -- on Monday for a man who boarded a long-delayed Delta Airlines flight from Cleveland to New York to find that all his fellow passengers had been rebooked on other flights.
"They rebooked everyone but me on another flight to LGA, so I am literally the only person on this plane," he posted.
As it turned out, O'Leary was not the only passenger on the flight.
"It was definitely the most memorable flight I've been on in recent memory if only for the sheer lack of passengers to become bothersome," he told ABC News.
