(CNN) -- Milagros Martinez endured losing one of her sons to cystic fibrosis before he could get a lung transplant.
Judge Michael Baylson granted a temporary injunction and ordered U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to direct the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network to waive in Javier's case a policy that keeps children younger than 12 from being prioritized for available adult lung transplants.
Currently, it is estimated that 16 or fewer children nationwide are in the same position as Sarah and Javier, Harvey said.
"Like any parent, I'm inclined to do whatever it takes, to help Javier have a normal life, whatever that may be."
