Oracle Team USA, the reigning America's Cup champions, have revealed their unlikely "secret weapon" in the hugely prestigious sailing race is Airbus.
"Look at the importance of wind forces on airplane wings, and wind forces on the sails of a boat.
"The America's Cup is a boat race, but the design technology and engineering are very often the winning factor," said team skipper Jimmy Spithill, who knows what he's talking about -- he also has a pilot's license.
Much like its planes, Airbus will be analyzing the data closely.
And somewhere between sky and sea, the next America's Cup will take place.
