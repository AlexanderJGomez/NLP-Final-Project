(CNN) -- The winner of the 82nd annual Scripps National Spelling Bee said Friday she is "pretty excited" but a little tired.
"I focus so much on my word; I don't really pay attention to all the cameras and photographers and all the media in front of me," she said Friday.
Kavya said she would miss competing in the spelling bee, as the rules do not permit her to enter next year.
She plans on becoming a neurosurgeon.
