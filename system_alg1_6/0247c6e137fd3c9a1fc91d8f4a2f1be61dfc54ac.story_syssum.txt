TOKYO (CNN) -- The U.S. military held a "Day of Reflection" on Friday for troops in Japan after allegations that two U.S. service members committed sexual assaults on the southern island of Okinawa.
Police in Okinawa said Thursday they were investigating a second reported sexual assault involving an employee of the U.S. Army.
The U.S. Army in Japan said it was aware of the incident but did not give further details.
It was taking part in more than 23 locations on Okinawa and mainland Japan, the military said.
More than 40,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Japan, most of them on Okinawa.
"The U.S. military bases in Okinawa and Japan are not welcome," Watanabe said.
