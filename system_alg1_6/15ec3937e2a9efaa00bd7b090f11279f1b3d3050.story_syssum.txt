The house has a minimum age requirement of 60 and can accommodate up to 45 women.
Finally, we spent some time with Paola, a 61-year-old who is still a sex worker and hopes to continue working for as many years as she can.
She also talked about the kids of many of the other women in the house -- none of them present at this party -- to celebrate motherhood.
