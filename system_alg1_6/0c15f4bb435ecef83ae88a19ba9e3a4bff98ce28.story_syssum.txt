Dash cam video released Thursday shows the two talking, then shows Scott get out of his car and run.
Another family lawyer, Chris Stewart, acknowledged that Scott had been arrested previously for outstanding warrants for not paying child support, but Stewart said that had been Scott's lone issue with the law for the past 20 years.
Anthony Scott said he watched the video that showed his brother getting shot dead, footage that has traumatized the family.
"It was a great celebration," Anthony Scott said.
"It's so tragic."
