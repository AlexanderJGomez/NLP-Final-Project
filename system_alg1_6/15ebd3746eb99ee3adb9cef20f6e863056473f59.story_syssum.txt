As national Democrats are jumping at the chance to sink Rep. Steve Scalise, Louisiana Democrats are throwing the House majority whip a buoy.
"While it is sometimes fun to see Republicans in trouble, you'd be wrong to blame Representative Steve Scalise for being racist on account of addressing a (EURO) meeting."
Scalise called the appearance at European-American Unity and Rights Organization (EURO), a white supremacist group founded by Duke, a former Klu Klux Klan grand wizard, a "mistake I regret" and said the group was one of many he addressed when he was a state senator crisscrossing the state to drum up support for a piece of legislation.
While David Duke defends Scalise, Speaker Boehner and Leader McCarthy are refusing to condemn Scalise's choice of allies," Schwerin said.
