A hat and glittery glove represent Michael Jackson at the Apollo Theater tribute.
Fans have been gathering outside the theater since last week to remember Jackson, who at age 9 won a 1967 Apollo amateur night showcase with his brothers in the group the Jackson 5.
"Michael wasn't no freak," Sharpton said.
Sharpton said the theater was home to "the best and the baddest."
"You've got to come from the stage of the Apollo and go all over the world to understand Michael," Sharpton said.
