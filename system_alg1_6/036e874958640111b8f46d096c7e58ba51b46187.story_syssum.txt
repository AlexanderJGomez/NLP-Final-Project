In Galveston, city officials ordered mandatory evacuations for part of the island town beginning at 7 a.m. Thursday.
Farther up the Gulf Coast and closer to where the National Hurricane Center predicts a direct hit, Brazoria County ordered a mandatory evacuation to begin at 8 a.m. Thursday.
ET Thursday, the Category 2 storm -- with top sustained winds near 100 mph -- was about  620 miles east of Brownsville, Texas, and about 285 miles southeast of the Mississippi River, the hurricane center said.
Galveston City Manager Steve LeBlanc issued a warning to residents of the city's West End, citing forecasters' estimates that the area could get tides of 6 feet above normal if the storm arrives there.
"One of the things that the public has to understand if they decide to stay, there will be a period of time during this storm when they will absolutely be on their own," Brazoria County Sheriff Charles Wagner said.
The vehicles were positioned near Houston, Matagorda County, Nueces County and Victoria County, the governor's office said.
Voluntary evacuations were issued in San Patricio and Victoria counties and parts of Jackson County, according to the governor's office.
Naval Air Station Corpus Christi will also move about 75 aircraft to other Texas locations, its public affairs office said.
Also, the United States said it will lift restrictions on cash and humanitarian assistance sent to Cuba for the next 90 days.
