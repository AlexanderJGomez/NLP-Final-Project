The river has been swollen by rain from last week's Hurricane Isaac, forcing authorities to relieve pressure on the structure by releasing water Saturday and Sunday.
That will result in "major flooding" of at least two subdivisions near the banks and threaten areas in the southeastern corner of the parish, according to the National Weather Service.
What's left of Isaac, meanwhile, soaked in and around the Ohio River valley on Sunday, bringing stormy weather from Nashville, Tennessee, to Indianapolis.
Parts of Missouri and Illinois saw up to six inches of rain Saturday, and the National Weather Service issued a flood warning Sunday for parts of southern Illinois.
In Plaquemines Parish, near the mouth of the Mississippi River, homes and businesses flooded after a parish-maintained back levee failed.
Residents began returning home over the weekend in Helena, Mississippi, where National Guard troops rescued hundreds trapped by rising waters brought on by Isaac.
