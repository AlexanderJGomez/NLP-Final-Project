MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Criminal charges were filed against the co-owner of a Florida clinic where a teenager claims she sought an abortion, but instead gave birth to a baby that the woman allegedly threw in the trash.
The baby's mother, Sycloria Williams, sued the clinic, its staffers and Pierre Jean-Jacques Renelique, its doctor, last month.
When she complained of feeling ill, she said clinic staffers told her to lie down in a patient room.
In the affidavit, police said they found out about the incident when they received a tip the following day.
However, according to the police affidavit, the medical examiner could not definitively say that the baby had been born alive.
In December 2007, Gonzalez was convicted of unlicensed practice of medicine for actions between August and December of 2004, and is serving five years' probation, according to the affidavit.
