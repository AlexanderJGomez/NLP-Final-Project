Like many public schools, his doesn't provide cups.
"Since children spend a large percent of their waking hours at school, they should be consuming at least one-half their total water intake at school," says Dr. Melina Jampolis, CNNHealth's Diet and Fitness Expert.
Vista Middle School outside Los Angeles has approximately 1,700 students and four water fountains in the student eating area.
Schools face a variety of challenges when trying to provide something -- water -- that Americans take for granted.
Hillsborough County school district in Tampa says it does not provide cups of water and there is usually one water fountain in student eating areas.
According to the California Food Policy Advocates, filling cups is "likely a slow process at most water fountains."
It's called a water intervention -- a five-week research program that includes a water filter and cups for five schools in the Los Angeles school district, provided free from the UCLA/RAND project.
"We've seen students really gravitate towards the water out here and fill up their cups right before and after lunch to hydrate" says Burt Cowgill, the project manager.
Researchers in Germany found that by installing a cooled, filtered water fountain with plain or optionally carbonated water, providing children with water bottles, educating them on the importance of drinking water and encouraging them to fill up their water bottles, they were able to reduce the risk of children becoming overweight by 31%.
Those children were allowed to store their water bottles at school.
Students have been drinking water from water fountains for decades, but research shows that children are not getting enough water throughout the day.
At Vista Middle School, Principal Nidia Castro says she will do her best to keep cups of water in her school, even suggesting she might pay out-of-pocket to provide cups for her students.
