Baghdad (CNN) -- A brazen insurgent attack inside a provincial council building in Baquba killed at least 12 people Tuesday, Iraqi Interior Ministry officials said.
U.S. troops, who were on routine patrol in the area, assisted with an initial search of the building at the request of Iraqi police and later assisted with security, said spokeswoman Maj. Angela Funaro.
At least 56 people died and 98 others were wounded in that attack, which also ended after Iraqi forces launched a raid to take back the building.
The latest wave of violence raises concerns over the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces as U.S troops prepare to leave the country by the end of 2011 under the terms of a bilateral security agreement.
