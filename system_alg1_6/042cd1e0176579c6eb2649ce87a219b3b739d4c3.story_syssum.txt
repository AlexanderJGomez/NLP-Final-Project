It was not until the Iowa caucus win by Obama that many black Americans started to believe it was possible for a black man to become president.
She further indicated that the black caucus wanted to put pressure on Obama, but could not, due to the fact that black people "love the president."
All seemed well, that is until Saturday night at the 41st annual CBC Phoenix Awards dinner in Washington, where the president told the attendees, "I expect all of you to march with me and press on.
Stop complaining, stop grumbling, stop crying.
The president made clear his dismay with such criticisms during a Monday night BET interview when asked by a reporter why he doesn't "target black  America specifically for economic relief."
For reasons beyond my understanding, the audience at the CBC that heard this rebuke cheered the president.
Obama seemed to be asking black America once again to keep the faith -- to "press on" and to "shake it off."
The cold hard fact is that no group is being as negatively impacted by this recession as blacks, so it is proper and necessary for the CBC and others to continue to press this president to do more.
