Stovell said he had sex with James' mother, Gloria James, after meeting at a Washington bar while she was visiting from Ohio in 1984.
Stovell said his only request was that the child, if a boy, play basketball.
Stovell said he filed the suit two weeks ago because a statute of limitations was about to expire.
The lawsuit states Gloria James was 16 at the time of the alleged encounter, but Stovell said she told him she was in her early 20s.
He filed a lawsuit in 2002 against the agency, alleging racial discrimination.
