Today it's one of China's best-preserved destinations, thanks to the careful stewardship of its pagodas and pavilions, mountain-fringed West Lake, and terraced plantations growing the region's famous longjing green tea.
A number of restaurants offer views of West Lake, but West Lake One (dinner for two $45) stands out with its covered terrace and extensive menu featuring dishes from throughout China.
Tea fanatics might head to Old Dragon Well Imperial Tea Garden to pay homage to the 18 bushes set aside for the Ch'ing dynasty emperor Qianlong.
Nearby is Longjing village, where you'll see plenty of tea farmers peddling their wares.
T+L Tip: Beyond West Lake, Hangzhou is a sprawling city.
