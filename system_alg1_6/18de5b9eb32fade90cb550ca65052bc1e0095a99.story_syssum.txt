Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- Sitting down with the protesters in Gezi Park, the message to the government from demonstrators, young and old, seems simple enough: Don't try to control us.
But for many Turks now massing in the park and on Taksim Square, a new mall is more than just another eyesore; it is a symbol of autocratic rule from a government that, in their view, is harking back to bygone days when this city -- once considered a gateway to Asia -- was ruled by emperors.
Metehan, 19, a university student studying English literature, believes the government's latest policy initiatives and the "brutal" measures taken by police are a true reflection of the state of Turkish democracy.
While the protests rage on in Taksim Square, much of the city remains peaceful.
The government is turning Turkey into a police state and this worries me."
