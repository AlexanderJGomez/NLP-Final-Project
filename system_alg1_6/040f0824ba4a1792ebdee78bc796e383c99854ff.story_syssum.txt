Seventy-four people, including 57 army officers, were killed in the mutiny at the headquarters of Bangladesh's border guards in Dhaka in February 2009.
Several thousand armed soldiers of the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) unit took control of their own headquarters in the capital for two days and massacred scores of people, including officers of the Bangladesh Army who were stationed with the BDR.
The government later renamed the BDR the Border Guards of Bangladesh.
The prime responsibility of the force, which works under the ministry of home affairs, is to guard the country's 4,000-kilometer (2,485-mile) border with India and Myanmar.
