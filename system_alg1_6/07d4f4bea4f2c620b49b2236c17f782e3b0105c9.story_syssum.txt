I didn't doubt Jay-Z was a prime example of success.
If you look at what Jay-Z has done with his career, you might realize that what made him successful is what makes many great leaders successful.
Not content with just being a fan, Jay-Z assembled a team (that included Lebron James) in 2003 to play in Entertainers Basketball Classic (EBC) and then became a co-owner of the New Jersey Nets.
However, we can find a way to make one of our passions part of our everyday life, even if your interest doesn't fit within your current job.
What Jay-Z did: One of the other reasons Jay-Z decided to assemble that basketball team in the EBC?
What you can do: The odds are slim that somebody will walk up to you and say, "Wow, all that great work you do?
Impress them from the beginning.
What you can do: Jay-Z retired, but most of us don't have that luxury right now.
Maybe you need to talk to your boss, find a new job or get into a new industry.
What Jay-Z did: When Jay-Z took over Def Jam records in 2005, he couldn't believe that the business model hadn't changed for decades, and employees had no incentive to work hard.
But workers can get the attention of the boss and other leadership by coming forward with new ideas.
What Jay-Z did: Jay-Z and Beyonc√© are basically music royalty, and when they began quietly dating, everybody wanted to know about it.
Of course, there are a lot of other things Jay-Z's done right in his career, so I suggest checking out "Empire State of Mind."
