(CNN) -- I was walking down 125th Street in Harlem last week when my iPhone beeped to alert me that New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg had proposed saving obesity-prone urbanites from themselves by banning restaurant sales of large sugary sodas and teas.
Autocratically imposing public health measures rather than persuading people of their worth can easily backfire.
No, and no.
They can enhance a sense of community, and avoid the defiance that can sabotage well-meaning laws, such as tobacco taxes that spawn smuggling.
Otherwise, the health of others could be seriously imperiled.
Bloomberg attempts to convince us that the sugar consumers are hurting others, feeding urgency by declaring that the city spends $4 billion a year on medical care for overweight people.
On June 1, the very day after Bloomberg announced the soda ban, he championed supersize doses of sugar and fat when he proclaimed National Donut Day, posing with enormous doughnut props.
