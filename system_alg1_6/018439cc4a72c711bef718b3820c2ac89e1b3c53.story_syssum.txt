He also said he despised men who had luck with women and said he would eliminate them, too.
Authorities say Rodger, 22, fatally stabbed three men in his home before killing two women outside a sorority house and then shooting a man at a deli in Isla Vista, California.
"Males who can easily find female mates garner more respect from their fellow men, even children," Rodger wrote.
Rodger wrote about the website PuaHate.com as a "forum full of men who are starved of sex, just like me.
I had never seen what beautiful girls looked like naked, and the sight filled me with strong and overwhelming emotions," Rodger said in his autobiography.

"I felt very small, weak, and above all, worthless," he wrote.
"I defiantly told him that I didn't believe him, so he played a voice recording of what sounded like him and his girlfriend having sex," Rodger wrote.
"Every day that I spent at my college, the more inferior and invisible I felt," he wrote.
The day before before the rampage, a video posted on YouTube featured Rodger ranting for nearly seven minutes against women who he said rejected him and popular kids who ignored him.
The day in which I will have my revenge against humanity, against all of you."
