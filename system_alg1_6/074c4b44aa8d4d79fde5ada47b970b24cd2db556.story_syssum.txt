But there was one thing more shocking than the double hit-and-run: the seeming apathy by pedestrians, cyclists and drivers—18 of them—who did not stop to help.
The incident has also prompted widespread soul-searching in China about the state of the nation's morality and civic-consciousness.
As the country's 1.3 billion people compete to make money and climb the economic and social ladder, experts say, many people find themselves spiritually adrift.
Psychologists, Hing tells me, have dubbed this phenomenon the 'bystander problem'—the one factor that would predict Good Samaritan behavior was how many witnesses there were to a tragic event: The more bystanders, the less likely someone will step up to help.
One factor is the district where it occurred, which has a concentration of hardware stores like the one Yueyue's father owns.
A joint survey by three universities in Beijing revealed that the root cause of people's reluctance to help others in need is a lack of trust among residents.
Only about 8% surveyed said they still strongly trust other people.
"There must be something wrong when it is considered risky to be a Good Samaritan," China Daily wrote in an editorial this week.
As a netizen puts it, it's not that the good people can no longer be found in our society.
