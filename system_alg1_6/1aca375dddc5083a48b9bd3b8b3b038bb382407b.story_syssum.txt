What remains, however, rather difficult to predict is: what will an el-Sisi presidency bring to Egypt?
The question remains, however: how will el-Sisi govern?
What seems to be clear, however, is that el-Sisi's most oft-repeated themes can be summed up in two: the Egyptian version of the "War on Terror," and an emphasis on the likelihood that Egyptians will not "rest" as the economic difficulties are addressed.
It is, however, unlikely such sentences will be carried out, regardless of an el-Sisi presidency, even though he announced in an interview that in his presidency there would be "no" Brotherhood.
Be that as it may, however, el-Sisi will become president at a time when the Egyptian public is more tired than ever.
The last four years of instability have not delivered what that public expected, and while a significant proportion of it may give him a bit of breathing room in order to produce positive change, he will not be able to count on it indefinitely.
