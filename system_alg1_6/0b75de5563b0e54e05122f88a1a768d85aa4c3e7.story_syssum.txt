Swedish prosecutors announce the courts have approved their request to issue arrest warrants to question Assange, who is now in London.
On November 20, the Stockholm Criminal Court issues an international arrest warrant for Assange, stating he is suspected of several counts of rape, sexual molestation and illegal use of force.
Assange then launches an appeal at the High Court.
Assange flees to Ecuador's embassy in London to request political asylum.
The UK says it is disappointed by the decision and will not grant safe passage out of the country to Assange, who has now been holed up inside Ecuador's embassy in London for nearly two months.
