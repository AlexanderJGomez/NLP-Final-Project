"The world of difference that he made for each and every one of us is unbelievable, incredible," one of the Frank Scholars, 22-year-old Shane Reil, said Sunday.
Frank -- who left Brown after one year in the late 1930s because he couldn't afford to stay -- gave the school a $100 million endowment in 2004.
But he applied anyway, and Brown invited him to campus to tell him about how much the school would award him.

Brown no longer does that, and Frank's gift was "integral" in bringing the change, said Jim Miller, Brown's dean of admissions.
Most recipients are the first in their families to go to college, Miller said.
Frank, though he went to Brown only one year, landed an engineering job at Pratt & Whitney in part because someone there had gone to the school, said his daughter, Cathy Halstead.

As for the Brown scholarship fund, he started it because he saw that Brown had changed the course of his life, Halstead said.
