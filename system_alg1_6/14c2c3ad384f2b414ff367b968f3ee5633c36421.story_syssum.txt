Attempts have been made to boost its support, first with the North American Soccer League (NASL) which kicked off in 1968, and more recently with Major League Soccer (MLS).
"Seattle was a huge soccer market.
The 2009 season was the inaugural campaign for the Sounders, and while the front office will be delighted with its on-pitch performance -- the side reached the Western Conference semifinals and won the U.S. Open Cup -- it has been the enthusiastic response of the city's soccer fans that could be providing most pleasure.
"Every time we walked on the field the atmosphere was great.
With their banners, flags and shirts, supporters have combined to create an atmosphere rare within professional American sports, and wholly typical of soccer.
"The Sounders have done everything right to placate and involve the soccer fans," Kelley said.
The Sounders will be absent from Sunday's MLS Cup final, held at Qwest Field, but Seattle's soccer fans will surely echo Schmid's sentiment.
