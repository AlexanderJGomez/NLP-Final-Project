Pistorius, known as the 'blade runner,' is the man Nike called a bullet and who is now charged with shooting his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.
With Pistorius, Nike had a star able to attract supporters to disabled athletics and who was so fast he could compete against able-bodied runners.
That way, if the star derails, the wider campaign can continue.
Pistorius rejects the murder allegation "in the strongest terms," Van Zuyl said.
It is not the first time Nike has sponsored a scandal-hit star.
In this marketing world, Vorhaus said, with many athletes sponsored by and representing Nike, it is also easier to shake off the bad publicity when a star falls.
