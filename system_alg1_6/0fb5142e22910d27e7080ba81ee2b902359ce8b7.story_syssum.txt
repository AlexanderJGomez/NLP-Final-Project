Ever since October 1, when Healthcare.gov went live, I've tried to go on the site and enroll.
They suggested I try at off-peak hours, such as early in the morning or late at night.
I've covered health care reform for 25 years, first as a print reporter in Washington and then for CNN.
Over the years I've watched countless people suffer because they couldn't get insurance.
But when the big day rolled around, after years of waiting, for many their hopes were dashed as they couldn't enroll on the site.
But Apple's glitch was fixed quickly and, even more importantly, was never a big deal in the first place -- the operating system was functional even with the glitch.
The government continues to work on the site, and Monday morning, I finally tasted some victory.
I shouldn't have had to create a new account, of course, and the site is still spotty -- I couldn't log back in Monday afternoon, and then I could log in Tuesday -- but at least it's a start.
I'll be going back to Healthcare.gov every day to see how it's doing.
