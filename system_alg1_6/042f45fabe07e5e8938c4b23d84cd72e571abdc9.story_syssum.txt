(CNN) -- The exiled leader of the Palestinian Islamic faction Hamas met with Jordan's King Abdullah II on Sunday in his first official trip to Jordan since his expulsion in 1999.
But Abdullah also called negotiations "the sole means to regain Palestinian rights," a stance Israel and the United States have supported as Palestinian leaders seek recognition of an independent Palestine at the United Nations.
Speaking at the start of his weekly Cabinet meeting, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Palestinians "refused to even discuss Israel's security needs with us" in the most recent contacts in Amman.
"The Amman talks were about creating a conducive environment for any future talks," Shtayeh said.
