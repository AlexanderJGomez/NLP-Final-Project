(CNN) -- Photographer Thomas Nybo has captured images of some of the toughest issues facing Africa, from child mortality to access to education.
At the same center he met a boy who was carrying his sister on his back.
One of the toughest places Nybo says he visited was a center for malnutrition in Niger.
