We at Greenpeace, along with the activist group Yes Men, are behind the Shell Oil website ArcticReady.com, which we created to call attention to the company's Arctic destruction.
In the Arctic, the oil giant is exploiting melting sea ice to drill for more of the oil causing global warming in the first place.
An oil spill response barge, the Arctic Challenger, which Shell promised the U.S. Coast Guard was "Arctic ready," is in Washington state, beset with technical problems.
Shell has been relentlessly conducting its own PR campaign to distort the truth about what the company is doing in the Arctic.
And when people realize it's a parody, they like it even more.
But Shell and its sympathizers would like people to talk about Greenpeace and the Yes Men rather than what the company is doing in the Arctic.
We're Greenpeace and the Yes Men, and we're ready to sit down with Shell any time to debate the ethics of Arctic drilling.
