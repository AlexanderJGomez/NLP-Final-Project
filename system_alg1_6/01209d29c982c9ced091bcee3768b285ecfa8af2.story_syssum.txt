(CNN) -- Japan's parliament elected Yoshihiko Noda as the country's new prime minister Tuesday, making him the country's sixth new leader in five years.
"Running Japan's government is like pushing a giant snowball up a snowy, slippery hill," he said Sunday.
An observer of Japan's revolving door of prime ministers said the country's political problems are weighing down one of the world's largest economies.
