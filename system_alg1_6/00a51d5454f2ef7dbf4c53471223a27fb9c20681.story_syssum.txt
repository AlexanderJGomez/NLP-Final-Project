Yet Rubio has been his own worst enemy on what could have been his two signature issues: immigration reform and Cuba relations.
Instead, Rubio has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration.
But when it comes to Cuba policy, Rubio himself seems firmly stuck in the past.
By clinging to the notion that isolating Cuba is better than engaging with the communist country, Rubio has marginalized himself on an issue where he could have provided insight and leadership.
Sure, Rubio is young and charismatic.
By comparison, Rubio seems cautious and ill-suited to the task of rousing Republican voters.
Unfortunately, a fresh face on stale ideas is not a winning combination -- not for Rubio, and not for Latino voters.
