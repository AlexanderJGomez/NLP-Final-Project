Emma Sullivan, 18, said late Sunday that a Brownback staffer had notified her school's principal about the tweet, and the principal told her she had to write an apology to the governor.
"I had no idea what it was about or why I was being called into the office," she said.
The principal then asked her to write a letter of apology to Brownback and his staff.
"The district acknowledges a student's right to freedom of speech and expression is constitutionally protected," the district said in its statement.
At the least, the student said that she hopes the controversy surrounding her tweet will bring attention to the issue of free speech.
"I hope there won't be any consequences and that my principal and the governor's office can move on," she said.
