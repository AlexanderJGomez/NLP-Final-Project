(CNN) -- Spirit Airlines said Thursday it's sorry that hundreds of passengers had flights delayed for hours from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport because of the airline's voluntary engine inspections.
Spirit Flight 165 was heading for Atlanta when the failure occurred, but returned safely to the Dallas airport.
Denver-bound Flight 355 was scheduled to depart Wednesday night at 8:56 p.m., but didn't leave until more than 10 hours later, on Thursday morning at 7:29 a.m.
"Following the engine failure on one of our aircraft last week, and after reviewing routine maintenance procedures, we are completing a proactive and voluntary check on our aircraft engines overnight as a precautionary measure," wrote Spirit spokeswoman Misty Pinson, in an e-mail to CNN.
... As always, the safety of our customers is our number one priority."
