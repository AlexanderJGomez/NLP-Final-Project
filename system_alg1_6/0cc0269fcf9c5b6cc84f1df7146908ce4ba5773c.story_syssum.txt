(Oprah.com) -- A businesswoman, a mother of four, an international fashion icon, a woman committed to making the world a better place for women and children -- Queen Rania of Jordan is truly changing the world.
Rania says that being queen is not the trait she defines herself by.
I'm Rania."
"For me, it's just real life," Rania says.
I worry about what they eat.
Rania says her family tries very hard to remain down to earth.
Helping others is something Rania says she feels compelled to do.
"Once you feel that others are like you, then you want for others what you want for yourself," she says.
To understand what life is like for the women in Rania's kingdom, "The Oprah Show" spent a day with a few women in Amman, the capital city of Jordan.
Though Queen Rania says she has never worn a veil, she understands why a woman would want to.
Rania says that when people focus on differences between cultures -- especially stereotypes and things like veils -- they fail to realize just how similar all people are.
In the future, Rania says she hopes for a more open and secure world.
Rania says solving problems that stem from intolerance -- like terrorism -- require cultural dialogue, education and increased opportunities.
