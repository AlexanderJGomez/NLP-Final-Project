Michael Ratley will spend the rest of his life in jail, without parole, for killing his wife with a hammer.
On Tuesday, a Nassau County Court jury in Yulee, Florida, said he should spend the rest of his life in prison for the crime.
During the trial, Ratley said he had nothing to do with the slaying.
Witnesses for Ratley tried in court to give a picture of the son, grandson, and friend they said he had always been, with the defense calling the murder a "single, horrible snapshot" in Ratley's overwhelmingly positive life.
This shows his best character," de la Rionda said, showing the jurors gruesome photos of Effie Ratley's injuries.
Michael Ratley met Effie Williams when she was having car trouble.
Michael Ratley's family said that the first time the couple got married, they were worried he wasn't mature enough, that he needed to grow up, and they said the couple definitely had growing pains.
Neither Effie or Michael Ratley's families wanted to speak about the sentencing after the hearing, but de la Rionda said Effie's family was pleased with the result.
Michael Ratley looked over, saw his grandmother upset, and he, too, began to cry.
