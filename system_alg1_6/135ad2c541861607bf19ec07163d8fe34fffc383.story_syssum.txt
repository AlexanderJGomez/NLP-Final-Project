And those who didn't follow party rules came under scrutiny, had their choices of a career and a life limited, and sooner or later became a case for the Stasi, the secret police of East Germany.
That is why the Stasi became an all-encompassing entity in East Germany.
Over the past 20 years Germany through the Stasi archives has examined the exact mechanisms of control through the secret police to better understand their vast network of information gathering and its consequences on the lives of many people.
In its course the Stasi became synonymous for blanket surveillance and for uncontrolled access of a state into its own citizens' lives.
Phone tapping as a source of information gathering is an intelligence tool regardless of the regime using it.
And it also makes one wonder what the Stasi would have done with a vast information hub like Facebook that would have let it pry into many, many lives and gather personal information beyond its wildest dreams.
