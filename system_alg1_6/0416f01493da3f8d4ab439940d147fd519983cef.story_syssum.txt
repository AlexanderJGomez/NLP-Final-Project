The friend who was on the phone with Trayvon Martin when his fatal confrontation with George Zimmerman began said Monday she is "disappointed, upset, angry, questioning and mad" at Zimmerman's acquittal on murder charges.
On the witness stand, she described how Martin told her over the phone that some "creepy-ass cracker" was following him and how he turned toward Zimmerman and asked, "Why are you following me for?"
Zimmerman's lawyers successfully argued for the right to present evidence that Martin had marijuana traces in his system, but never brought that before a jury or presented any testimony about whether the drug could have affected Martin's behavior.
"She didn't ask to be in this place ... She wanted to go.
I just felt sadness for her."
