On Thursday, three teens accused of setting Brewer on fire pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted murder, a public defender for one of the boys said.
Prosecutors say the three boys were in a gang that poured alcohol over Brewer, then set him ablaze in a dispute over $40, a video game and a bicycle.
Detectives say eyewitnesses told them that Mendez used a lighter to set fire to Brewer after Jarvis allegedly poured alcohol over him.
Doctors say Brewer is improving but his condition is tenuous because of the severity of his burns and the possibility of infections.
"And he'll say, 'Am I going to be OK?'
When Brewer did not pay, police say, Bent stole Brewer's father's bicycle.
They'll get theirs is all we can say.
"I can describe both of them as being afraid, being fearful," said Michael Brannon, a forensic psychologist, without identifying the boys.
"It's a horrible event that occurred, but this was not their conceptualization, in my opinion, of what was going to happen."
