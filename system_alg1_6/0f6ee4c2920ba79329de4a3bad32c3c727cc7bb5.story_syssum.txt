Federer recorded the second double bagel of his career when he defeated wildcard Mischa Zverev 6-0 6-0 on Friday to reach the semifinals of a Wimbledon warm-up in Halle, Germany.
Haas and Federer, good friends, played doubles together this week in Halle.
French second-seed Richard Gasquet topped Mayer 6-3 7-6 (4) and Russian Mikhail Youzhny beat Kohlschreiber, the 2011 champion, 6-3 6-2.
"I thought the first set was good, and then he started playing much better in the second," Murray said in a televised interview.
Del Potro, still learning the finer points of playing on grass, missed the French Open due to illness.
Cilic almost exited in the third round, trailing Feliciano Lopez 5-2 in the third set before staging a comeback.
