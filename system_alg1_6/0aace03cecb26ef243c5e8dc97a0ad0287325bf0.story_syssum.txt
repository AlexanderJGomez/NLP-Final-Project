Rio de Janeiro (CNN) -- Security for Pope Francis' visit to Brazil has been raised after an incident involving his motorcade, a Brazilian federal official told CNN.
A large crowd -- braving rain -- cheered as the pope emerged from the helicopter that took him to the site, where he held Mass.
The pope also announced that he will return to Brazil in 2017, the 300th anniversary of the apparition of Our Lady of Aparecida to three fishermen.
