Buenos Aires (CNN) -- Argentina's president is scheduled to temporarily hand over power Wednesday as she undergoes thyroid cancer surgery.
She became Argentina's president in 2007.
Papillary carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer and has a high survival rate, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine.
Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff overcame cancer while she was a candidate for the office, and former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is undergoing treatment for throat cancer.
