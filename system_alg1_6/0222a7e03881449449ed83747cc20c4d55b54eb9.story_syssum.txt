(CNN) -- While Real Madrid signed Gareth Bale in the summer's highest-profile football transfer and added several other big names, Manchester United fans were left largely underwhelmed by the Premier League champion's moves in the off-season.
"It's been pretty disappointing," said Andy Green, a United supporter who tweets about football finances.
United is "delighted to have David Moyes lead our football team into a new and exciting chapter," Woodward said.
