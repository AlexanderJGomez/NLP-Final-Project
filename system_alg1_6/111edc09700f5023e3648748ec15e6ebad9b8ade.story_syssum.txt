(CNN) -- London's new superyacht hotel is so enormous that when it first arrived in the city, authorities had to lower the water level by five meters just to fit it under a bridge.
In a place with some of the most expensive property prices in the world, the Sunborn Superyacht Hotel has turned its gaze to London's many waterways -- and it's not the first European city in the company's sights.
There are also plans for another five-star ship in Barcelona.
"This superyacht hotel creates a new set of symbols for the area -- in terms of the wealth it represents, it's a huge change, " said Georgina Young, senior curator at the Museum of London.
Gazing across the skyline from the sunlit deck of the multimillion-dollar superyacht hotel, the East End of old feels very far away indeed.
