Over the weekend, women rose up in Nepal, protesting outside the prime minister's house against gender-based violence.
According to Eve Ensler, the head of V-Day and One Billion Rising, a movement calling for women to rise up on February 14, 2013, and demand an end to violence, women in Somalia are planning what may be their first-ever major demonstrations against rape and violence.
This is born out everywhere that rape occurs but especially in war zones like the Democratic Republic of Congo, where Dr. Denis Mukwege, the medical director of Panzi Hospital, told me men use objects as a means to mark a woman -- to indicate that she now carries the message of violence impressed on her body.
Nearly 1 in 5 women in this country surveyed said they had been raped or had experienced an attempted rape at some point, according to the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey.
But what about the larger part -- what about prosecuting men who are committing these crimes?
And it's also time for men and women to engage in a consistent dialogue on stopping rape.
Let's understand that rape is not a problem that affects only women: It affects families, communities, entire cultures.
