Some Republican lawmakers and a handful of Democrats are calling for a travel ban on people from the West African countries most affected by the disease.
"I believe it is the right policy to ban air travel from countries that have been hit hardest by the Ebola outbreak."
That travel ban came at a time when AIDS was heavily stigmatized in the United States and amid misinformation and some public fear that the disease could spread through casual contact.
No.
And the United States never banned travel from China, the epicenter of the 2003 SARS outbreak, which tallied roughly the same number of cases -- over 8,000 -- in the same seven-month period as the Ebola epidemic.
Rep. Tim Murphy, who led the house panel that sharply questioned top health officials over Ebola on Thursday, insisted airport screenings aren't enough to keep people out of the country -- especially since infected people can carry  the disease for up to 21 days without showing any symptoms.
But a ban might actually make things worse, he said, because it could encourage people to lie about their travel to West Africa.
A few of the neighboring West African countries have actually sealed their borders altogether while many other countries on the continent are banning travel to and from those West African countries.
Preventing the disease from spreading further in West Africa is crucial to keep Ebola from continuing to spread.
