Tanaka, son of a Japanese salaryman, launched Gree initially as a social network in Japan before moving into mobile social gaming.
People say there is no culture of venture business in Japan, but actually social games and our company, Gree, became successful within seven years.
Gree originally started as my personal business using my money and my spare time.
In that sense we can do our business without having the disadvantage of being on an island, so I think it is a good industry for Japan.
Not just our company but the whole of Japan should consider developing an industry like that.
