LONDON, England (CNN) -- A new sleeper virus that could allow hackers to steal financial and personal information has now spread to more than eight million computers in what industry analysts say is one of the most serious infections they have ever seen.
It is a Windows worm and almost all the cases are corporate networks.
However if an infected laptop is connected to your corporate network, it will immediately scan the network looking for machines to infect.
The worm will also scan company networks trying to guess your password, trying hundreds and hundreds of common words.
Machines can be disinfected.
