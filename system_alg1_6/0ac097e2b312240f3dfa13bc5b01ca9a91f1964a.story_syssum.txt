London (CNN) -- More than six decades ago, the European Movement's founder Jean Monnet shared his vision for the region's nascent union, prescribing money as a means to heal the wounds left by two world wars.
Fast forward to the present day and, though the EU does have some shared organs of government, like a commission and parliament, it certainly isn't the set of "united states" Monnet hoped for.
The EU needs a new vision a new project its people can feel passionate about.
And where better to start then this week's pivotal parliamentary elections.
