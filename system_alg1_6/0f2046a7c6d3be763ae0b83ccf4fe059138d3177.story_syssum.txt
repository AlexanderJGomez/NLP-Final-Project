FBI agents searched the Watergate apartment in Washington where Robert McFarlane resides seeking evidence of his alleged connection with Sudan.
The investigation is more than two years old, and discloses that agents went through trash at a location in Virginia looking for clues to McFarlane's relationship with Sudanese officials.
The FBI said they had found a series of e-mails to McFarlane which agents believed to be from someone in the Sudanese intelligence service.
