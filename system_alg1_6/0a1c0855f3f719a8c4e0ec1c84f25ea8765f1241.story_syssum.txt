But would this be enough to keep the U.S. wireless market competitive for consumers?
In the big picture, it takes a lot of capital to build out high-speed wireless broadband networks that can support an ever-growing number of data-hungry devices such as smartphones and tablets -- especially if streaming mobile video becomes popular, and if the Obama administration is serious about its national wireless initiative to make wireless broadband available to 98% of the U.S. population.
A less competitive wireless market could mean wireless broadband won't get much cheaper.
About 56,000 customers abandoned T-Mobile USA last year, while Sprint, AT&T and Verizon Wireless all boosted their counts."
So if the Sprint merger doesn't happen, T-Mobile does have options -- mainly leasing additional spectrum or access to other providers' networks, such as LightSquared, a wholesale-only wireless LTE network.
