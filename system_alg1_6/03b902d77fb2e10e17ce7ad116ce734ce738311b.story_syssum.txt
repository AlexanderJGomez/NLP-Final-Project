But allegations of American spying have seriously injured German trust, Chancellor Angela Merkel has said.
Top German government officials have candidly spoken about the decision to expel the U.S. official as they poured their disappointment over alleged U.S. spying into microphones and cameras for days.
One of the new cases has landed on top of an existing investigation on federal prosecutors' desks into the possible spying on Merkel.
We have so many problems, and we should, I find, concentrate on the essentials."
Amid the new allegations, the top U.S. and German diplomats are expected to meet in Vienna, Austria, this weekend during multination negotiations about the future of Iran's nuclear program, a senior U.S. State Department official said.
While the official said U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and German Foreign Minister Frank Walter Steinmeier will touch on topics such as the Middle East and Ukraine, it'd be hard to imagine the two ignoring the spy issue.
