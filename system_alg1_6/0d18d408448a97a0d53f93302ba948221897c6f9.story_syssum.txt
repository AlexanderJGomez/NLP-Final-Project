ETA, blamed for more than 800 deaths and listed as a terrorist group by Spain the European Union and the United States, began campaigning for Basque independence in 1959.
The group, whose full name Euskadi Ta Askatasuna means "Basque Homeland and Freedom" in the Basque language, killed what some say was its first victim in 1968.
Spain officially recognizes three Basque provinces, Alava, Guipuzcoa and Vizcaya.
The Basque people are the oldest indigenous ethnic group in Europe and have lived uninterrupted in the same region since the beginning of recorded history.
ETA and its demands for an independent Basque state arose in 1959 in the midst of this suppression.
The Good Friday peace accord influenced ETA to call its cease-fire in 1998.
