KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai said Sunday that his country would join the strategic review of the U.S.-led war on terrorism.
"U.S. forces will not be able to leave soon in Afghanistan because the task is not over," Karzai said.
At the same time, Karzai said the actions of troops currently in Afghanistan have turned some of the public against them.
We'll continue to be an ally.
Speaking via satellite from Kabul, Karzai called former President George Bush "a great person," but said he can work with Obama -- despite the president's comments as a candidate that Karzai had "not gotten out of the bunker" to improve security and infrastructure in Afghanistan.
"Sure, corruption in the Afghan government is as much there as in any other third world country," he said.
He said a government department has been created to deal with corruption and that corrupt judges, administrators and other officials are dismissed "daily" over corruption charges.
