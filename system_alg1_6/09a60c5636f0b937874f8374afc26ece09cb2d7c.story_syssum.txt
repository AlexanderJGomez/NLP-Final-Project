The juncture of a 93-year-old water pipe and a 58-year-old pipe burst under famed Sunset Boulevard on Tuesday afternoon, city officials said, with the ensuing geyser sending an estimated 20 million gallons of water shooting into the sky and streaming into nearby open areas and buildings -- notably parts of the UCLA campus just to the south.
Those vehicles that aren't trapped appear to have some level of water damage, Schmader said.

UCLA athletic director Dan Guerrero said in a written statement that he was confident the arena and court will be ready by the time basketball season begins in late October.
The John Wooden recreation center and the Arthur Ashe Student Health and Wellness Center were without power because their transformers, like the vehicles, were submerged in the parking garages, Schmader said.
Repair work on the pipe won't be completed Wednesday, but thanks to water rerouting, no one was out of water service because of the break, said Jeff Bray, superintendent of the city's Department of Water and Power.
