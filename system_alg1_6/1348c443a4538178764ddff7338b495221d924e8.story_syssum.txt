Milledgeville police said they were called to Creekside Elementary School on Friday for an unruly juvenile, who was allegedly throwing a tantrum.
The girl was released to Ruff after numerous attempts to reach her parents failed, the police report said.
Johnson's mother said her daughter was suspended and cannot return to school until August.
Police notified the Department of Family and Children's Services about the incident, which is not the first of its kind in recent memory.
She was later turned over to her mother, who came to the school.
