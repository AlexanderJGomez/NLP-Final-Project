Keith vowed to create his solar attic fans entirely out of parts made in the United States.
Keith's company, SunRise Solar, steadily grew to the point that he couldn't keep up with the influx of orders.
"He said he was with the Obama transition team looking for small companies," Keith recalled.
Keith and his wife were asked to come and -- prodded by his wife -- he stood up and told the president about his solar business.

At these events, lawmakers talked about "how I created a solar product, how it's good for the environment, for business," he said.
The irony is not lost on Keith: A man whose profile and company soared because of the administration's energy policy is now falling apart because of a new Obama anti-dumping policy involving China.
While 95 percent of Keith's fans are American-made, he has yet to find a U.S. company that can make the small customized solar panels that make his fans run.
Keith said the U.S. Customs Department has accused him of using Chinese-made solar panels, in violation of a tough import policy adopted in May at the behest of major U.S. solar companies.
"These guys are going to put me out of business," Keith said.
So he went back to the well one more time, pleading with Greg Nelson, deputy director of the White House Office of Public Engagement who Keith said had been his contact with the Obama administration.
Keith asked in the e-mail.
"When Obama came in office, there were a lot of small business owners who said, 'Hey maybe he'll help break barriers and help owners' or he says he will, but it never trickles down that far to help us," Keith said.
