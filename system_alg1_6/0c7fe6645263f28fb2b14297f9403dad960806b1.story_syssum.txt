District Court Judge Jackie Glass sentenced four O.J.
The four apologized to the state and the victims in the case before their sentences were read in court Tuesday.
Glass ordered Fromong removed from the courtroom Tuesday after he made a comment during the sentencing of McClinton, who admitted brandishing a gun in the hotel room.
The four men sentenced Tuesday walked meekly from the courtroom to report to law enforcement officials and get details on their probation.
