(CNN) -- Rapper Heavy D died of a blood clot in his lung and other conditions, a coroner's report revealed Tuesday.
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are serious medical conditions that are often undiagnosed, but they are preventable, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Among those factors is obesity, and Heavy D was known for being overweight.
