New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton said Tuesday he is disappointed in himself and feels regret over a scandal that has left him suspended for the entire 2012 season.
It also found that Payton lied about the bounty program.
Asked whether anyone on another team was injured as a result of the bounty program, Payton said no.
Meanwhile, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said Monday he's focusing on punishments for players.
"When interviewed in 2012, Sean Payton claimed to be entirely unaware of the program, a claim contradicted by others," the statement said.
