Spain international Diego Costa scored the winning goal midway through the second half after a much improved Liverpool took an early lead and can count themselves unlucky after having a goal disallowed and strong claims for a penalty waved way.
Liverpool lost that game 1-0, with a much improved performance, which some saw as a sort of vindication for Rodgers.
Yet Liverpool will count themselves unlucky not to have won a penalty after Cahill was again involved in another controversial moment in the game.
"It was a clear one," Rodgers told BT Sport after the game.
The win saw Chelsea extend its lead at the top of the Premier League to seven points, but only briefly.
In the final Premier League game of the day, the champions Manchester City took on lowly Queens Park Rangers in west London amid torrential rain.
From the resulting free kick from the first disallowed goal, City goalkeeper Joe Hart passed the ball straight to Austin who slotted the ball home again.
Premier League top scorer Sergio Aguero leveled the score, despite being both offside and handling the ball in the build up, before a late Martin Demichelis own goal appeared to have handed QPR an unlikely victory.
