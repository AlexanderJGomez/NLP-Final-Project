Reality isn't quite so simple as to perfectly apply recent developments on Detroit and Russia to the American debate in 2012, but neither were Romney's arguments on the car industry and on Russia.
"We need to deal with the Russia that is, not the Russia we might wish for.
"Russia has stabbed us in the back," said Sen. Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat.
The headline of Romney's op-ed in November 2008 was "Let Detroit Go Bankrupt."
More damaging for Romney than either the Detroit op-ed or the Russia as a foe storyline was his statement to fundraisers about giving up on the 47% of Americans who would not vote for him no matter what.
How Detroit and Russia and the 47% factored into 2012 are interesting historical questions, but the national dialogue has moved on.
