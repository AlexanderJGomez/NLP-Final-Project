The Mississippi River is not expected to return to its 43-foot flood stage in Vicksburg until after June 14, which is 46 days after it climbed out of its banks, said Amanda Roberts, a National Weather Service hydrologist.
Severe storms are likely Saturday and Sunday in the Mississippi River, Ohio River and Tennessee River valleys, said CNN meteorologist Sean Morris.
It was a big success, he said.
"(I'm) just here to celebrate the river cresting," Roland said.
Law enforcement officials are patrolling evacuated areas to help ensure that abandoned homes and businesses aren't burglarized, Winfield said.
Warren County, which includes Vicksburg, has "several hundred homes that have water" and about 2,000 residents have been displaced, Sheriff Martin Pace said.
A slide was detected on the mainline Mississippi levee at Albemarle Lake, the Corps of Engineers said Thursday.
Farther south, where the Mississippi River has not yet crested, residents were working to clear out their homes and find ways to get by.
About five miles of the Mississippi River at Baton Rouge were closed Friday after four barges broke loose from a towboat, said Seaman William Benson of the U.S. Coast Guard.
Benson declined to say whether the recent flooding could have had anything to do with the incident, but said an investigation was under way.
