Sometimes referred to as a "happy accident of nature," a total solar eclipse occurs when the moon is perfectly aligned with both the sun and Earth, so it appears from our perspective that the sun is completely blocked.
A total eclipse of the sun can only be seen from within what's known as the path of totality, a narrow path the moon's inner shadow travels as it glides across the Earth.
But for any given region, a total solar eclipse only happens, on average, once every 375 years.
It was during a total solar eclipse in 1919 that Einstein's theory of general relativity was tested and confirmed for the first time.
Just before totality, so-called Baily's beads â€” bright spots of sunlight shining through the moon's craggy surface â€” can appear around the moon.
