Two goals from Steven Gerrard, both from the penalty spot and a Luis Suarez strike, condemned United to defeat and gave yet more credence that Liverpool is a serious title contender.
The Manchester United defense will not have had a harder game than against our strikers today.
Last season, United finished 28 points clear of Liverpool on its way to winning the Premier League title.
Worse for United is the success of its greatest rival - Liverpool.
Just 24 second had elapsed when Phil Jones clumsily bundled over Joe Allen in the United penalty area and Gerrard swept home the spot kick.
"We're going to win the league," sang the Liverpool supporters.
The victory moves Arsenal to within four points of leader Chelsea with a game in hand.
