Our destination for the day is the DMZ -- or the "heavily fortified" Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea.
As the tour bus makes its way northward along the "Freedom Highway," the guides brief us on the infiltration tunnels dug by the North Korean army with the intention to covertly invade Seoul and take over South Korea.
Among other food-for-thought tidbits, she points out that there are many more South Korean spies sent to the North than North Korean spies sent to the South (see also the movie "Silmido"), which coincidentally puts the whole infiltration-tunnel propaganda into perspective.
As the bus progresses into the lot where we will transfer to a U.N. vehicle, Sky warns us of previous tourist "incidents" resulting in a sudden tour cancellation for all participants, including one in which a man was carrying an unauthorized flask of newly purchased soju (rice wine).
Both South and North Korea offer tours of the DMZ, while the tourists who take in the sight from the North are predominantly Chinese.
We are led in an orderly single file into one of the small blue U.N. conference rooms that straddles the Military Demarcation Line (MDL), where heated scuffles have been known to break out between delegates of North and South.
The bus makes a final outdoor stop at the highest military checkpoint within the JSA, giving us a panoramic view of the naturally disguised minefields that stretch across to the North Korean mountains.
We are told it's the site where two U.N. command officers were killed by North Korean guards in 1970 as they were axing down a yellow poplar tree that was blocking the view.
