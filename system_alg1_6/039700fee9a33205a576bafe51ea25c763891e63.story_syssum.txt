(CNN) -- A Pennsylvania Methodist minister who was defrocked this week for performing a same-sex wedding said Friday he felt compelled to break church doctrine because it was an "act of love" for his son.
So he was upfront with church officials.
On Thursday, the minister at Zion United Methodist Church of Iona in the small town of Lebanon was found guilty in a church trial for officiating his son's same-sex wedding, church officials said.
He refused again, forcing church officials to defrock him.
I'm a pretty effective minister, so I never thought it would come to this.
His son was recently interviewed, saying that he feels guilt for what has happened to his father, Schaefer said.
The minister said that his views on homosexuality have evolved over the years.
His church is divided, he said, and he's lost friendships.
