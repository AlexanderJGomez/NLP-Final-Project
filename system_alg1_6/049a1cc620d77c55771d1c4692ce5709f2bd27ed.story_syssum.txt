Vitali Klitschko has confirmed that he will defend his world heavyweight boxing title against former champion Shannon Briggs on October 16 in his adopted home city of Hamburg.
"For a long time I have been trying hard to fight a Klitschko.
I will put a lot of pressure on Klitschko and take the fight to him.
People don't know what to expect from Audley Harrison, he's been talking a great fight for years, never delivered it.
