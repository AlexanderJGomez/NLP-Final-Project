This next version of Android, called 3.0 or Honeycomb, is its first designed for tablets but will also run on smartphones.
Previously, you'd have to open the Android app on a smartphone in order to search for and download programs.
But the synchronization features will mean little if Google can't persuade smartphone customers to purchase upcoming Android tablets.
Honeycomb also has a live video chat function that will let tablet users talk with other people who are using Gmail on a computer.
The new Android software includes improved multitasking functionality, so you can see a window of what apps you were previously using looked like when you closed out of them.
CNN  announced onstage it will offer an Android app with iReport functions and live video capabilities.
T-Mobile and AT&T also announced more information on new Android phones this week, none of which will run the Honeycomb software at first.
