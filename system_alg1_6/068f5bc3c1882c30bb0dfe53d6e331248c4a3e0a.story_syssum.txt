Paul Embleton's BRAVE Foundation has trained more than 1,000 volunteer firefighters in Guatemala.
Embleton launched the BRAVE Foundation -- Bomberos Resourceful And Valiant Efforts -- to provide emergency response training and equipment to volunteer firefighters (bomberos) in Guatemala.
"I'd gone back to my hotel to try to think how I was going to teach with the same limited resources they had," Embleton said.
"Basic techniques that firefighters had outside of Guatemala, we'd never learned, and we wanted to learn."

We're educating the people that the firefighters are here to help."
"The firefighters have the motivation, and you get a heart for it because you see how well we have it in the States," Embleton said.
"People call the firefighters when they're in trouble, and they know that the firemen will always be there."
