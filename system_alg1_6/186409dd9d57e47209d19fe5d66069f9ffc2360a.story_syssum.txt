The United Nations and the European Union, and other countries around the world also have sanctions against Iran.
-- In 1995, the United States banned "involvement with petroleum development in Iran," the U.S. Treasury says.
-- U.S. citizens may not export goods or services to Iran or, in general, to a third country knowing it is intended for Iran.
-- U.S. sanctions also targeted groups in Iran -- such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the Basij Resistance Force, and Iran's Law Enforcement Forces -- as well as several individuals in Iran.
-- Assets of Iran's central bank in the European Union will be frozen, and trade with Iran in gold, diamonds, and precious metals will be blocked, the union said.
-- Measures put in place in 2010 include restrictions on "equipment which might be used for internal repression," the official text said.
