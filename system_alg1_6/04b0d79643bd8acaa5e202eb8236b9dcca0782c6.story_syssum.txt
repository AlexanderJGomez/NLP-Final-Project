Paris, France (CNN) -- French lawmakers Tuesday recommended a partial ban on any veils that cover the face -- including the burqa, the full-body covering worn by some Muslim women.
By recommending a ban on full veils in public places such as hospitals and schools and by anyone receiving public services, the commission members said they wanted to assist those working with members of the public when asking that full veils be removed.
Any law directed at full veils is likely to be challenged in the courts both in France and at the European level.
That's despite government estimates that less than 2,000 women in the country actually wear the full Islamic veil.
She said she believes a law against full veils would take away fundamental rights of Muslim women.
He said it is ridiculous to do so in France.
