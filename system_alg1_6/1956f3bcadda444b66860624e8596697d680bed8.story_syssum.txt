We expected Ryan, not Biden, to bring a three-ring binder full of facts and figures to the debate.
He didn't.
An Obama-Biden campaign official said before the debate that the vice president's goal was to try to compare and contrast the two competing campaigns' vision for the future.
If Biden was on a mission to bring the fight to Ryan, then it appeared to be mission accomplished for the vice president.
Biden went where President Barack Obama wouldn't last week in his debate with Romney, bringing up Romney's "47%" controversy as well as the Republican nominee's tax rate.
I don't know if the vice president knew that there was a camera on him the whole time, that there was a split screen," senior Romney campaign adviser Russ Schriefer said.
What did debate watchers think?
Seven out of 10 debate watchers in a CNN/ORC International poll said that Biden was the aggressor.
The Obama campaign said he laid out the facts and made Ryan look, in the spin room words of former Ohio Gov.
In the wake of Obama's wilting flower routine in last week's debate, the full Biden, exasperated and angry with Romney and Ryan, was just what Democrats needed.
Now the pressure is on President Obama to keep that narrative going next week in New York.
Known as an expert on economic and budget issues, early in the debate Ryan showed his smarts on foreign policy.
"And so when Adm. Mullen and Gen. Petraeus came to Congress and said, if you pull these people out before the fighting season ends, it puts people more at risk.
"I think Congressman Ryan was out of his depth and showed clearly the ticket is not ready for prime time on foreign policy, and I think that was a decisive difference between the two sides," said Obama campaign manager Jim Messina.
Six out of 10 debate watchers in the CNN/ORC poll conducted said that Ryan is qualified to be president.
"Malarkey" is one of Biden's favorite Biden-isms.
