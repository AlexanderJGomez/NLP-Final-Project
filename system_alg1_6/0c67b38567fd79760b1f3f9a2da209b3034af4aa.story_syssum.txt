French national police said the 12 suspects were seized in the south of France.
Three have links to a French man -- identified as Riahd Hennouni -- arrested in Italy last month, authorities said.
The man was arrested last month by Italian police in Naples, Italy, on a European arrest warrant requested by France, the chief prosecutor in Naples told CNN Monday.
The militants killed are believed to have been members of the group Jihad al Islami, the officials said.
Jihadists from the German city of Hamburg are alleged to be at the heart of the suspected plots, European intelligence officials said.
According to German intelligence officials, Sidiqi and 10 others left Hamburg in 2009 for the tribal areas of Pakistan -- where most of the group joined a jihadist group fighting U.S. and coalition forces across the border in Afghanistan.
Sidiqi's father said he also did some work in Germany related to computers.
Before setting off, Sidiqi told his family he was going to meet some friends in Pakistan and then go across from there to Afghanistan, according to his sister.
