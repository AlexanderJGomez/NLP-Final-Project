(CNN) -- The blaze that killed two Boston firefighters last week was unintentionally caused by a welding operation, Boston fire officials said Friday.
Fire Commissioner John Hasson told reporters that the blaze was caused by sparks from welding in the rear of the building.
Evans and Hasson said that no fire detail was present at the job site and that the welders did not have a required permit.
