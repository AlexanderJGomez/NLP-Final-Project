The secretary spent 3 Â½ hours testifying before a congressional committee on Wednesday about the awful mess that was the launch of the federal website intended to allow millions of Americans to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.
The consequences would be swift -- the person responsible for the mess would be fired.
Obama needs to keep his eye on the big picture.
Two very tough questions, however, lie ahead: First, what should he do about Sebelius if the mess isn't a whole lot less messy by the end of November?
It's not yet clear where the problem with rolling out the health care website really lies.
Calls to fire the secretary are intended to put Obama in the position of seeming weak if he does not.
But it's true that little changes tend to have small ripple effects, and big changes, like the health care act, have huge ripple effects.
If the circus is to continue, the most important job is to know where the tent poles are and guard them zealously.
