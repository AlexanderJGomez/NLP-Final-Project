Isa Saharkhiz and his son Mehdi haven't seen each other in nearly a decade.
Since 2009, the younger Saharkhiz has led a one-man digital campaign from his home in New Jersey aimed at liberating his father.
Iranian security forces first arrested Isa Saharkhiz, 59, during the summer of 2009.
"In January, in the winter, they sent me on the roof of the jail for two hours when the weather was very cold," Saharkhiz said.
"Saharkhiz is not an outsider to the regime.
As the elder Saharkhiz languished in prison in 2009, his son Mehdi became an opposition activist from the relative safety of exile in New Jersey.
Four years after his arrest, the elder Saharkhiz said there was no formal reason given for his release.
It was the first direct contact between American and Iranian presidents in more than 30 years.
"There's a lot of hope from what Rouhani did in the U.S. and there's a lot of good response from the people," Mehdi said.
"Maybe in a few years I will be able to go back, but it's a really big risk," he said.
"It will be a very emotional time," Isa Saharkhiz said.
