"As the vehicle approached, the agents immediately noticed that the vehicle reduced its speed drastically," forcing cars behind it to go around, the affidavit said.
The Border Patrol agents pulled alongside the car and noticed a single key in the ignition, which can be a sign that a car contains contraband, the affidavit said.
He also told agents that he had driven the car over the border himself and that the vehicle belonged to his friend, whom he knew only as "Eduardo," the affidavit said.
Asked if there was anything illegal in the car, Raygoza-Garcia said he didn't know and gave the agents permission to search it using a dog, the affidavit said.
