"This is the first time we have won the gold in men's doubles, so it's certainly historic," Sharath told the official Commonwealth Games website.
Elsewhere at the games, Australia won a thrilling women's hockey final, clinching the gold medal after a penalty shoot-out victory against New Zealand.
It was also a landmark day for Northern Ireland, who claimed their first boxing medals for 16 years as three of their men won title fights.
