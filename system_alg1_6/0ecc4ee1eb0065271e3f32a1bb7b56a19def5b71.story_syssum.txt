Now, the U.S. team will have to find steelier resolve for its next contest, against soccer powerhouse Germany on Thursday.
A lot rides on that game, if the U.S. wants to advance to the next round.
In 20 games, the U.S. has never recovered when the opposing team scored the first goal.
All the U.S. had to do next was bide time -- keep possession of the ball, keep an increasingly desperate Portugal at bay.
After all, Portugal is ranked No.
That confrontation is an intriguing one for U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann, who played for the German team that won the World Cup in 1990.
A tie would also be good enough to qualify, leaving Team USA second on five points, level with Germany, which would finish top because of a better goal difference.
If Portugal and Ghana tie, the United States would stay in second place on four points.
Portugal would need a big victory or an especially heavy U.S. defeat to tip the goal difference to their advantage.
"We have to make it against Germany."
