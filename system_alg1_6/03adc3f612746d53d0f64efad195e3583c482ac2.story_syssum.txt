"When he pulled him out, he had no heartbeat," Lin Ming-wei's brother, using his English name Chris Lin, told CNN.
"My brother was really grateful for the rescue teams (and) the pilot," said Chris Lin.
Chris Lin said his brother told him the plane suddenly dropped after its left engine lost power.
The Lins were not the only ones to have a lucky escape.
After the plane hit, the taxi driver made a shocking report to dispatchers.
"My car is completely wrecked," Chou replied, going on to explain that it wasn't a remote-controlled plane, but a manned plane.
