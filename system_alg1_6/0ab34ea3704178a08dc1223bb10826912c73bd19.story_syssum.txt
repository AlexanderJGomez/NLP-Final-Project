Sotomayor issued an order that, for the moment, stayed a requirement under the sweeping health law for certain religiously affiliated groups to ensure that employees receive coverage for contraception at no cost.
The Denver-based organization that cares for elderly poor, the Little Sisters of the Poor, objects to complying with rules under the law that would guarantee it an exemption but, in theory, still require a third party to provide contraception insurance.
Toobin said Sotomayor acted "based on her view of the law" in holding up the rule in this case.
Obamacare seeks to extend health coverage to millions of Americans without it and is the President's signature domestic achievement.
