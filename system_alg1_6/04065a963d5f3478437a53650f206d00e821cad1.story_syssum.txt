(CNN) -- Health policy experts agree that any reform in our health care system must include a well-educated, caring primary care doctor who is able to manage the health of his or her patients with an eye to using resources optimally to keep costs down.
Fewer and fewer medical students are choosing primary care and many primary care doctors are leaving the field.
The cost savings to the system is thousands of dollars each and every time I am willing to make the call and go with the treatment.
My reward is about $55 from Medicare and private health insurers.
My reward for years of struggle is a few hundred dollars at best.
My financial incentive to hang in there and work harder is that I now make less than half what I did 20 years ago.
Isn't it a shame that after all this time and with skills honed by decades of experience, many of us can no longer afford to work as a physician?
I know this is true because I am struggling to find a primary care doctor to take care of my wife and myself.
