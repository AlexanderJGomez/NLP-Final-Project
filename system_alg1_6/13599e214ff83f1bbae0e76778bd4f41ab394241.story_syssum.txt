(CNN)  -- The United Nations has sent police and military patrols to a camp in western Sudan after reports fighting there killed civilians, a U.N. spokesman said Tuesday.
The Sudanese government said it entered the camp to look for "huge quantities of arms and criminals," Nezni said.
The U.N. African Union Mission in Darfur said it sent police and military patrols to Kalma to confirm the details of the incident and provide assistance.
