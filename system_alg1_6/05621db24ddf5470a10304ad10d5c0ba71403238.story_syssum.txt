At least 60 people were killed and more than 110 were wounded Sunday in a Lahore, Pakistan, suicide blast near the country's border with India, police said.
Many onlookers were crying as they spoke to reporters.
Authorities were aware of threats of terrorism, and Pakistan's paramilitary security force, the Rangers, was prepared, but the crowds at the border were larger than normal so Rangers weren't able to check everyone as they departed the area, Sukhera said.
