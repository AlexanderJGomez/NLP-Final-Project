Marcos was the youngest person to receive the award, according to his high school, which hailed the news on its website.
"The honorees we celebrate today ... are seemingly ordinary Americans, but far from it, really," said Jim Miklaszewski, the award ceremony's emcee and the Pentagon correspondent for NBC News.
The annual awards, which officials from the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation started giving out in 2008, do make a difference, Brandon Wemhoff said.
As he prepared to head to Washington to receive the prestigious award, Marcos told The Oregonian newspaper that he'd told only a few of his friends.
