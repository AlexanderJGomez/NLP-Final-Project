Naghmeh Abedini said that her husband, Saeed Abedini, went to Iran to build an orphanage but was imprisoned unjustly because of his Christian beliefs.
In January, he was sentenced to eight years in prison, accused of attempting to undermine the Iranian government and endangering national security by establishing home churches.
Iran's detention and torture of her 33-year-old husband constitutes an assault against U.S. national security, she said.
His wife said that the orphanage he was in Iran to set up had the approval of the Iranian government.
Her father, who is still in Iran, has been able to visit the pastor, it says.
On November 3, the pastor was transferred to Rajai Shahr prison, the statement said, where he has been repeatedly robbed at knifepoint.
Naghmeh Abedini said her father showed her husband pictures of the couple's two children when he visited him in prison.
"I think it's the worst torture to see your kids suffering and not being able to do anything," she said.
"...it's not just for my husband, it's for my kids.
He has been jailed in Iran since 2011, accused of being a CIA spy.
