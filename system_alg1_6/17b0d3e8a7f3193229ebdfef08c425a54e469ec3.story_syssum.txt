Dawkins argues that there is no doubt that Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection is true and, unlike some other scholars of the subject, says belief in evolution is not compatible with faith in religion.
"I believe a true understanding of Darwinism is deeply corrosive to religious faith," Dawkins says in his TED Talk.
In an interview by e-mail last week, CNN asked Dawkins about Darwin and religion.
Wallace independently had the idea, and the main reason Darwin is remembered more than the admirable Wallace is that Darwin wrote the book that changed people's minds.
Dawkins: I think it stems from the far greater popularity of religion in America, but that only pushes the question back a stage.
CNN: You maintain that science is corrosive to religion and that religion undermines science.
Dawkins: I think it is mostly because of biblical literalism.
CNN: You make the argument in the TED Talk for atheists to assert themselves boldly and overcome the cultural stigma against opposing religion.
It has since spread ideas in many fields through conferences around the world and through its web site, TED.com
