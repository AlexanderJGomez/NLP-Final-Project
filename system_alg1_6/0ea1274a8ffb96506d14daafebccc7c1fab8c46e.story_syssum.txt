President Barack Obama responded on Monday to House Speaker John Boehner's offer to compromise on tax rate increases with his own compromise on both tax increases and spending cuts, according to a source familiar with the discussions.
Congress had been scheduled to end its work last week, but legislators returned to Washington on Monday and leaders warned members to be prepared to stay until Christmas and return after the holiday until year-end.
"Any movement away from the unrealistic offers the president has made previously is a step in the right direction, but a proposal that includes $1.3 trillion in revenue for only $930 billion in spending cuts cannot be considered balanced," Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck said.
Obama's plan, Republican aides said, does not include a 1-1 ratio of spending cuts and revenue.
Boehner has been under pressure from the White House, Democrats, the business community and some fellow Republicans to give up the staunch opposition to any increase in tax rates.
An aide to Boehner said earlier any such increase would have to be offset by spending cuts and reforms.
