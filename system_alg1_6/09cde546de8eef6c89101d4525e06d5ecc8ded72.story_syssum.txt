(CNN) -- President Obama rallied U.S. troops and pledged continued partnership with Afghanistan during a previously unannounced trip to the country Sunday.
However, Obama made clear that his main reason for the trip was to visit with some of the roughly 80,000 U.S. troops stationed in the country.
To cheers from the combined joint task force that includes troops from all four services, Obama said: "The United States of America does not quit once it starts on something.
Obama then flew on a helicopter to the Presidential Palace to meet with Karzai.
In a briefing with pool reporters on the trip, National Security Adviser James Jones said Obama would push Karzai to improve efforts to meet benchmarks for better governance in his second term, which began last year.
U.S. officials said Sunday there were nearly 80,000 U.S. troops now on the ground in Afghanistan, and the surge announced by Obama would increase the total to 98,000 once fully implemented by the end of the year.
Karzai has said that by the end of 2010, Afghan security forces will be able to take over some security responsibilities from international forces.
On that visit, part of a broader trip to the Middle East, Obama traveled to eastern Afghanistan to meet with U.S. forces and also met with Karzai.
