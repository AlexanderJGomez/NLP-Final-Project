But what Ryan calls a budget is what any CEO would call a firing offense.
The Ryan budget depends entirely on unspecified tax reforms and the replacement of revenues he doesn't care for (such as those associated with Obamacare) with others he doesn't care to actually define or describe.
Her budget is as partisan as Ryan's and offers little common ground with his on controversial issues.
They are just props in the Budget Follies of 2013.
The budget is important.
The Ryan budget cuts transportation spending in a country that has neglected its highways and bridges for over half a century.
Perhaps the Senate budget or the president's will be wiser about investing -- although neither is likely to think big enough about transport spending or an infrastructure bank or, better, a network of regional infrastructure finance institutions.
Washington has grown so shrill that most of this empty debate will be heard only by our dogs.
