On the social-media platform, users can express themselves creatively and get laughs by giving voice to those things that can't speak for themselves.
Novelty nonhuman accounts have been a Twitter staple since Sockington, a Boston-area housecat, joined the service in March 2007 on his way to 1.4 million followers.
When the woman behind pet-centric account @CatFoodBreath began her novelty Twitter account in August 2010, she wasn't planning on sticking around.
"I love everything about the fog," said the man who created @KarlTheFog in August 2010.
Karl already has more than 5,000 followers.
My favorite tweets are when people take pictures of Karl and post them on Twitter or Instagram," the man said.
"I find that hilarious -- people stopping what they are doing in the real world to take a picture of an orange cone.
"Kasey made a Twitter apology and I added about 1,200 followers in the next hour," he said.
I do not like Velcro," he wrote.
The account has more than 200,000 followers.
Added the man behind KarlTheFog, "I think people in the Bay Area like Karl because the fog was already a character in their lives.
"The Cone gets to say and do the things I think we all wish we could do," its creator said.
