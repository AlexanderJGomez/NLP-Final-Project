The report noted "missed opportunities" by Lanza's  mother, the school district, and multiple health care providers.
Lanza had not left his room in his mother's Newtown home for three months before the massacre.
Despite sharing her worries about her son's condition with friends, the report said it does not appear Lanza's mother, Nancy Lanza, communicated any concerns to mental health or medical professionals in her final months.
Warning signs like the book and Lanza's increasing anxiety were improperly addressed by Lanza's mother and educators, the report said.
The report concluded that a pattern of accommodation to Lanza's mental health conditions -- rather than addressing his underlying needs -- by Nancy Lanza and certain health care providers, exacerbated Lanza's mental status.
The report also noted that it appeared Nancy Lanza made no effort to curtail her son's access to guns in the house in the months leading up to the shooting, despite Adam's severe mental deterioration.
