The FDLE investigated allegations made by a group of men who said they were beaten and sexually abused when they attended the school about five decades ago.
The claims provided here are an example," he said.
The FDLE said its investigators interviewed six former staff members from Dozier and more than 100 former students and their relatives.
"There was little to no evidence of visible residual scarring," the report said.
Some of the accusers said the graves -- marked only by white steel crosses, rusted with the passage of time -- contained the bodies of boys who were beaten to death by school workers.
He wanted to save the boy, Colon said, and tried to talk himself into being brave.
Do it!
Colon said angrily.
He said the boys at the school who misbehaved were "spanked."
"Never was a boy beat in my presence," he said.
