It's just one of hundreds of activities and events which Copenhageners have organized to coincide with the 11-day U.N. summit taking place at the Bella Center in the Orestad district in the southeast of the city.
"It is, by far, the largest conference we have ever held and the largest political conference in Europe," the Bella Center press manager, Lars Lemche told CNN.
Outside the conference center solar-powered streetlights are helping light the car parks.
Inside the conference center delegates will eat from a menu that is 65 percent organic and drink water that has come out of a tap rather than a bottle.
And now that the conference has started, 6000 officers will be on duty during the conference.
Last week, police unveiled a 22-ton vehicle armed with a water canon which will be used if trouble flares during the conference.
As Copenhagen hands over to the U.N. for two weeks, the world's eyes are now turning to negotiations which precede the arrival of U.S. President Barack Obama and company.
Earlier this year, Copenhagen announced the aim of being carbon neutral by 2025.
