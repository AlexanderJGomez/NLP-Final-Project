"The tragedy of this is the noncompliance to the directions of law enforcement officers," said Sheriff David Morgan of Escambia County, Florida.
Searching for a cigarette inside his White Lincoln Town Car, he appears to have been mistaken for a car thief by a concerned neighbor who called 911.
But the deputies involved told a different story.
"He came out of the car with more of a lunging motion coming out of the car, and the deputies were standing behind him and he had what appeared to be a metallic object in his hand," Sheriff David Morgan said.
I don't believe that," she said.
He was out smoking a cigarette on his front lawn when the deputies arrived, he said.
"I'm very surprised that all they did was hit him in the leg," he said.
Walker said her son takes pain medication for a bad back.
But his mother disputes the sheriff's theory that her son was a suspect and a victim at the same time.
