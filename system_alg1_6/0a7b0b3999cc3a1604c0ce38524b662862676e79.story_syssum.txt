He's the first foreigner to lead a Russian ballet company in over a century and has been charged with bringing modern choreography to the Mikhailovsky's classical repertoire.
A modern ballet dancer and choreographer with an international pedigree, it is hoped he can revitalize the ballet for Russian audiences.
At first Duato was reluctant to change direction towards classical ballet.
Why not?
It really is a pleasure to be in a place where ballet (has been) part of the cultural tradition for (such a) long time, and at the same time they want to break through and do new things," Duato said.
"In this repertoire, I can show a different side of myself, express myself differently and find something new in me," she said.
"Together we are going to work into something," said Duato.
