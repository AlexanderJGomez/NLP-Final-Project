Gard is one of the organizers of "Occupy Melbourne," a group that started on Facebook that now has more than 2,000 members with plans to protest on October 15 in City Square.
Gard and the planned Australian spin-offs of "Occupy Wall Street" are not alone.
Bankers have got off scot-free whilst the people of this country are being punished for a crisis they did not create," said the group's Facebook invite page.
In Melbourne, "some demonstrators are planning to camp for days, maybe weeks," Gard said.
