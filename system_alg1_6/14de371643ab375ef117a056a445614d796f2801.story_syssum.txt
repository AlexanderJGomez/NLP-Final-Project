Fisher said she has always enjoyed playing games with her family.
After she got an iPhone and iPad, she tried playing some of the downloadable games, but due to her visual impairment, she couldn't find a game that she enjoyed and that allowed her to play with her friends.
Fisher said "Hanging With Friends" specifically works with Voice Over and lets her "see" what's going on and chat with her family and friends who are playing.
Paul Bettner, general manager of Zynga With Friends, said they didn't intend to make a game for the visually impaired, but are pleased that their game can be enjoyed by people like Fisher.
Fisher said there are other games that are Voice Over compatible, but they don't allow for the social interaction that "Hanging With Friends" does.
