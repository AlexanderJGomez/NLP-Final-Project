(Wired) -- Twitter confirmed Tuesday evening that its microblogging site has been shuttered by Egyptian authorities.
In a separate tweet, San Francisco-based Twitter added, "the experts are those using Twitter on the ground and those coordinating with them around the world."
"Twitter, it's almost across-the-board inaccessible in Egypt," he said.
Jillian York, who compiles a crowd-sourced ledger of unavailable websites across the globe for the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University, said the center had received about a dozen reports of Twitter being inaccessible inside Egypt.
