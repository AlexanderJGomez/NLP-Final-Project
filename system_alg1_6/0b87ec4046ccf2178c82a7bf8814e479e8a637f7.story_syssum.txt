(CNN) -- First, let's be clear: No one can blame voters if they a) are turned off by this election, b) are worried more about other things in their lives and c) don't think that it matters much who controls the Senate, which is what is up for grabs this year.
Except for this: When the show is over, and if control of the Senate changes to the Republicans, it could matter.
In a midterm election, that can work: Obama is unpopular, tie all candidates to Obama.
He's got a legacy to think about, and he'll be thinking about it, you can be sure.
But if the GOP actually wants to win a presidential election, author Nate Cohn writes, "the Republicans will need a substantial number of Hispanic votes."
Then there's another logic that takes hold when you try to set the table for a presidential candidate, and campaignâ€”no matter what some party diehards argue.
Sure, it depends on the GOP candidate.
And how would Democrats react to that?
