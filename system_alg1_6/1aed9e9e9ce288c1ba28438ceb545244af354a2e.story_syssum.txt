Estadio da Madeira, Portugal  At first glance this 5,500-capacity stadium is not at all unusual, although two ends of the ground are wire fencing with no seats.
Driving up the narrow road it is hard to believe you are heading to a ground which has hosted Europa League football, until after a couple of kilometers you can spot the floodlights, high above the tree line like a scene from the film "The Field of Dreams" and its imaginary baseball ground.
Built in 2003, in time to be one of the venues for Euro 2004, Moura carved the stadium into the face of the adjacent Monte Castro quarry which overlooks the city of Braga.
Like Braga's ground, one side of the arena is dwarfed by a giant cliff face.
But what really sets it apart is the paneling that makes up the facade, which can be independently lit with white, red, or blue light depending on which team is playing there -- something no other arena in the world can do.
Although not officially the highest stadium in the world -- that honor goes to a ground in Peru -- this one makes the list because of its national importance and controversial history.
It's the largest club ground in French football, holding 60,000 fans, and has hosted two World Cup semifinals (in 1938 and 1998) as well as numerous top rugby matches.
Svangaskard Stadium, Faroe Islands
Possibly the most beautiful stadium in the world for a variety of reasons.
And, as if it didn't have enough going for it, the stadium also played host to some of the best matches during the World Cup, with Germany beating Argentina 4-0 and the five-goal semifinal thriller between the Netherlands and Uruguay just two of its highlights.
