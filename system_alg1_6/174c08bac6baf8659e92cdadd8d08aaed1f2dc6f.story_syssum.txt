But his luck was about to run out in the chaos of Mogadishu, where the frontlines in the battle between the weak transitional government and al Qaeda affiliate al-Shabaab shift almost weekly.
Mohammed was killed, but to begin with the Somali security forces had no idea who he was.
The forged passport found in the vehicle had a recent exit stamp from South Africa, according to Somali officials.
Ugandan officials suspect Mohammed -- who was probably in his late 30s -- advised on the bombings of two bars in Kampala last year, in which 79 people were killed.
Al-Shabaab attacked Uganda because it had troops in Mogadishu as part of the African force (AMISOM) protecting the transitional government.
The United States has had some success in tracking down al Qaeda militants in Somalia -- with special forces killing Saleh Ali Nabhan two years ago.
And al-Shabaab does not seem to have been knocked off its stride by Mohammed's death.
Two days after he was killed, Somalia's interior minister was assassinated at his home by a female suicide bomber.
