While at the car repair facility, look for certifications displayed on the wall.
I get the same question from my readers over and over: "How do I find a good auto repair shop?!
Before I start, I want to emphasize that the question "How do I find a good auto repair shop?"
In jest, I pointed out to him that I was not proficient in camel repair and would have to decline.
First of all, start shopping for a repair facility BEFORE you need one.
Why?
For instance, to become a AAA Approved Auto Repair Facility, a shop must undergo a rigorous investigation.
Ask customers in the shop, "Why do you do business with this shop?"

Another factor to consider when choosing a repair facility is the equipment available.
Don't be afraid to ask the shop if they have this equipment.
Why?
Some people think that the cost of repair varies with the size of the shop (a large shop or dealership is probably more expensive).
These days, with the high cost of equipment, training, and information systems, the cost of repair at dealerships, large repair facilities and small shops is balancing out.
Pick your repair facility like you would your family doctor.
