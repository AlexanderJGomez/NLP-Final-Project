The divers stopped searching months ago because of the winter and water conditions, and the South Korean ferry remains on the bottom of the sea floor.
Park's case is an unsettling one -- emblematic of what remains unresolved a year after the Sewol ferry sank.
On April 16, the Sewol ferry, carrying hundreds of high school students, began sinking after taking a sharp turn.
The Sewol ferry is over 20 years old and there are fears it could fall apart during the extraction, according to the South Korean Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries.
Since the days immediately after the disaster, families have criticized the government over its response.
The captain of the first coast guard ship sent to rescue the Sewol passengers was found guilty of negligence and making false reports.
In the case of Sewol, the ferry was found to be loaded with double its capacity.
In the immediate aftermath, South Korean prosecutors arrested the captain, crew members and business associates.
Whether the ferry will be raised and an independent investigation will be held remains to be seen.
