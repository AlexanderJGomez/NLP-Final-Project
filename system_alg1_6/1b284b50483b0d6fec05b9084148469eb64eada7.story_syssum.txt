Chris' parents said that in short-term treatment programs, he made new connections with other users that caused him to relapse when he got out.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says U.S. drug poisoning deaths involving heroin went up 45% from 2006 to 2010.

"There have to be long-term recovery programs," she said.
Chris says he believes his 11 months at Outreach saved his life.
He'll begin that future next week, when he graduates from Outreach, moves back home with his parents and faces the challenge of staying sober.
