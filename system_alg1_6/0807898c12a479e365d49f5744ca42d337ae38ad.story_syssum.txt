And now, as House Republicans weigh a resolution to sue President Obama for not quickly enough implementing a law the same Republicans voted more than 50 times to repeal or stall, all hell has broken loose.
Meanwhile, at least Republicans aren't going full-political-stunt and impeaching President Obama ... yet.
Republicans bash President Obama for issuing executive orders.
Republicans had long criticized the President as anti-Israel.
Witness Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn, who last week called President Obama "tone deaf" for not visiting the border during his trip to Texas.
Then, when pressing Congress to pass immigration reform, President Obama went to the border and ... Republicans criticized him for doing so.
Republicans damn President Obama he does it and damned if he doesn't.
But while blaming and condemning President Obama has been Republicans' sole strategy since the moment he was elected, they've taken that crazy irresponsibility to the next level -- including suing the President of the United States of America for doing his job and carefully implementing laws, even the ones Republicans hate.
