New York (CNN) -- On the eve of the 12th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly is questioning why none of the city's mayoral candidates has requested a briefing from the NYPD about its counterterrorism program, strategies or tactics.
"What is their understanding of the terrorist threat to New York City and its immediacy?
"Bill de Blasio believes there is nothing more important than protecting New York City from the threat of terror and keeping New Yorkers safe.
"The public should demand detailed answers from the candidates about their plans to protect New York.
We've come too far and we've sacrificed too much to leave ourselves vulnerable."
