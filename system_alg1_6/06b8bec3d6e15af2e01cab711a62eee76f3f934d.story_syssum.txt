The $165 million animated film topped the chart with $49.1 million out of 3,752 theaters — the strongest debut ever for a Walt Disney Animation production (i.e., not including Pixar titles).
The Robert Zemeckis-directed drama "Flight" soared in second place with $25 million from just 1,884 theaters, giving the $31 million Paramount film the strongest per theater average in the Top 20, with $13,275.
Warner Bros.' $45 million investment is proving to have been a smart one — the film is earning massive Oscar buzz and will pass the $100 million mark in the next few weeks.
That last Ben Affleck vehicle to gross $100 million was 2003′s "Daredevil," which earned $102.5 million.
Though Fox's $45 million sequel will finish a tad below the original "Taken's" $145 million domestic finish, it has more than made up for that fact overseas, where "Taken 2" has grossed $210.8 million (the original "Taken" found $81 million internationally).
"Flight" -- $25.0 million
"Taken 2" -- $6.0 million
"Skyfall" debuts in the U.S. next weekend, and taking into account how engaged the rest of the world seems to be by the film (and taking into account its glowing reviews), it's looking increasingly likely that "Skyfall" will score the best debut ever for a Bond film — perhaps in the $80 million range.
