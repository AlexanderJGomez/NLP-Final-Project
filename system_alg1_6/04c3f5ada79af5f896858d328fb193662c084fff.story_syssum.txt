How many Ferraris does it take to impress a hotel valet in Boca?
But there was even more money here this week: The resort was playing host to the the Republican Governors Association's annual meeting, always a magnet for major GOP donors, corporate fixers and political consultants looking to get some some face time, and maybe a contract or two, with the 31 Republican governors and governors-elect who now control state houses around the country.
Perry joined a half dozen other potential 2016 presidential candidates, including Chris Christie, Rick Perry, Scott Walker, Bobby Jindal, John Kasich and Mike Pence.
All of this means that money is in the air at events like the one in Boca, which are as much about donor maintenance and business meetings as they are about electing governors.
The event attracted the usual pack of political press — including the "Hambycast" crew — eager to flee the freezing temperatures of Washington and meet sources, interview new governors and get an early bead on the Republican presidential race, which doesn't seem like it will start as soon as reporters would like it to.
Swarmed by reporters every time he showed his face, Christie swatted away questions about his presidential thinking and insisted that he just wanted to reflect on a winning cycle and celebrate with his fellow Republicans.
"People said to me during the campaign that I seem like Christie with a softer edge," he said.
Few people thought Hogan could win when he announced his campaign — including Christie.
"They were like, Christie have you been drinking?," Hogan chuckled.
And maybe he'll retire in Boca.
