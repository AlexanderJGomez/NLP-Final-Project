(CNN) -- Protesters took to St. Louis streets for a second night Thursday after an off-duty officer killed a teen who fired at him three times, authorities said.
One officer suffered minor injuries and two police cruisers were damaged, Jackson said.
Police said the teen fired a pistol three times at an off-duty St. Louis officer who was wearing his uniform while moonlighting for a security company.
One big difference: Police said Brown was unarmed.
But Van Jones, a civil rights activist and CNN contributor, said there's a lot of police mistrust after the Brown killing.
The officer tussled with one teen, who ran off, then turned around and fired at least three shots toward him, Dotson said.
