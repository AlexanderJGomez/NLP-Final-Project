(CNN) -- With its $315 million purchase of The Huffington Post this week, a company best known for distributing free CDs has succeeded where mainstream media outlets failed: Spotting the potential of one of the Web's fastest growing media brands.
Perhaps it's simply that the news media, comforted for years by the defensibility of its distribution channels -- ordinary citizens couldn't afford a printing press or start a television channel -- has been slow to mobilize in response to the threat of a million niche blogs and thousands of new ways to discover, parse, aggregate and reorganize the news.
The effect, I think, will be to shock the news media into action.
