The Middle East refuses to acknowledge that the United States has decided to pivot toward Asia.

The answer will help set the future of democracy in the Arab world, where Egypt leads in ideological, political and cultural trends.
Some will insist the concern is about oil, but the U.S. could still buy oil from a nuclear-armed Iran.
Separately, U.S. officials told CNN that Tehran is already finding ways to ship weapons to the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas in Gaza, just days after the U.S. helped broker a cease-fire between Hamas and Israel.
It would be nice if the American president could decide which regions will command his attention.
