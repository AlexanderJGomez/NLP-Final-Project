(CNN) -- Lexi Thompson struggled to describe her delight after she won the Navistar LPGA Classic on Sunday to become the female golf tour's youngest-ever winner.
Thompson was accompanied on the course by her father and caddy Scott, and the world number 124 said it was an emotional experience to walk up the final fairway with her Dad.
Just finishing that with my dad on the bag, it was the best experience.
It's just amazing that they do that.
