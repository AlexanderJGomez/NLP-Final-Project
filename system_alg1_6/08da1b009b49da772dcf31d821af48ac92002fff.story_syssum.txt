Oxfam invited us to Haiti to meet some of the Haitian farmers and chefs who are planting seeds of hope in a country that has faced more obstacles than any community should rightly be expected to overcome.
Oxfam hoped we could  learn about the inspiring work being done in Haiti and share our own experience with sustainable food systems.
Oxfam is working in Haiti to empower farmers with tools and sustainable models of production that will help them build thriving farms and businesses that feed their communities.
The gardens offer the prospect of a new way to earn a living -- growing fresh, healthy food for their community.
The innovation, ingenuity and hope we saw can create the foundations of a Haiti known for its food, culture and beauty rather than its poverty.
