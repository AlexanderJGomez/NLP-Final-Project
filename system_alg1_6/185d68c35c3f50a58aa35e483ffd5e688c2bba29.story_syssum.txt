We started with the FIFA world ranking for each team going into the World Cup, starting with Spain ranked number one, all the way down to Australia at 62.
England came a distant second, with Italy, Brazil and Switzerland rounding out the top five.
It was the second-largest country in the tournament, ranked third in the world by FIFA, and with manager Luiz Felipe Scolari's $3.8 million salary putting him fourth.
Yes, it was ranked fifth in the world going into the tournament, but it didn't shell out big money for a manager -- Alejandro Sabella was the 22nd-best paid coach -- and Argentina falls in the middle of the population table.
Ranked third in the CNN table, it actually came 23rd.
Russia actually came 24th, while Team USA came 15th.
Both teams did better than we predicted.
