Sean and Carolyn Savage with daughter Mary Kate (now 18 months) and sons Ryan, left, and Andrew.
In a tragic mix-up, the Savages say the fertility clinic where Carolyn underwent in vitro fertilization implanted another couple's embryos into Carolyn's uterus.
"He walked in and was as white as a sheet," Carolyn said.
"I don't think I've ever cried so much in my life," said Carolyn.
"That was a scary time for us," said Carolyn.
With five embryos left over from IVF -- and despite the risks to Carolyn's health -- the Savages, guided by their religious beliefs, refused to let the unused embryos at the clinic languish.
"They didn't choose this path either," Carolyn Savage said of the DNA parents, who declined to speak with media.
"As the process has gone along, it has been exceptionally difficult imagining this playing out," Sean Savage said.
"I know that tug will be there every day wondering if the baby's happy, healthy and OK," said Carolyn.
"We gave him up because it was the right thing to do."
