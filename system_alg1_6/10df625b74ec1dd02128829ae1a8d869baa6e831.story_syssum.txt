(CNN) -- A property dispute between family members apparently led to a shooting in which a man killed two people in the central Virginia town of Louisa before he was shot by police, authorities said.
Two people were killed and four were wounded, said Sgt.
"Based on evidence at the scene, as soon as deputies arrived they were in an active shooting situation," Geller said.
