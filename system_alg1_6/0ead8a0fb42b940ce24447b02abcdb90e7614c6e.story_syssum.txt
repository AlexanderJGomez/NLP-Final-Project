Police said Haskell entered the home demanding to know the whereabouts of his estranged wife, who was not there.
Haskell, apparently posing as a parcel delivery driver late Wednesday afternoon, entered the home of one of his estranged wife's relatives while only the children were there, Hickman said.
Haskell approached the second home and saw officers there; he drove away and the officers pursued him, Hickman said.
Haskell has children with his estranged wife, but those children were not believed to have been in the Spring-area home where the shootings happened, Hickman said.
