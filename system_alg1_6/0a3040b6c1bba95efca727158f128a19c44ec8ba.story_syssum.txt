What Domingues did was legally register the trio as a "stable union," a civil union that extends all of the benefits of marriage, though there is debate about what rights the threesome will actually enjoy.
Brazilian law defines marriage as a union between two people, so it is impossible for a civil union of three to be granted the rights of a marriage of two.
The controversial civil union "is proof that there is a plurality of familiar relations, though not all deserve judicial or legal standing," Rolf Madaleno, director of the Brazilian Institute for Family Law, said in a statement.
While Brazil appears to be a permissive place, it is also a a country where more than 86% of the population identifies as Catholic or evangelical.
The trio considers themselves a family and is entitled to be seen as such in the public record, Domingues said.
The trio from Rio, having been rejected by other public notaries, found their way rural Sao Paulo state and to Domingues because she is a student of polyfidelitous relationships -- ones involving more than two partners, but where there is fidelity between the members.
Domingues doesn't hesitate to call herself married, though she and her husband are bound by a "stable union" and not a civil marriage.
Domingues is studying the cases of a quintet (two men and three women) and another trio (one woman and two men).
