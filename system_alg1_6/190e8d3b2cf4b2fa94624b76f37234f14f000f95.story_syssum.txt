Addison shares a cell with two other women and has received treatment for an abscess at the prison clinic, her mother said.
"Never in a million years would I have thought that she'd be spending her birthday today in a prison," Kero said with tears in her eyes.
The package was found to contain methamphetamine, Addison said on her Facebook page.
"The person who picked up the package, he told the police and he testified before the judge that he didn't know my daughter," Kero said.
But rather than giving Addison her papers and letting her go, the court detained her again and sent her to Gleno prison outside Dili, a U.S. State Department official said.
For her first five days in Gleno prison, Addison was held on her own, according to Kero.
Kero said embassy staff have been "extremely supportive" in the case -- they brought Addison a birthday cake recently.
