People in cars and on bikes whizzed by Moustafa Mohamad as he sat on a sidewalk in Washington one day not so long ago.
"America: Support Kurdish boots on the ground," one sign said.
The 15th day of his hunger strike began like most others before that.
This one said "ISIS Slave Sale: $500.00 for Kurdish Women."
Many of his friends and family lived in Kobani when ISIS attacked this year, he said.
"He now prays five times a day," Mohamad said.
"Two of the boys who escaped told the media that ISIS was forcing the children to undergo lessons in Sharia and jihadist ideology, and one of these boys said that ISIS beat the children who misbehaved," Human Rights Watch said.
Thousands of miles away in Washington, Moustafa Mohamad hoped his hunger strike cast a spotlight on the suffering of people like the Kurdish teenagers kidnapped by ISIS.
So the next day, surrounded by friends and supporters, Mohamad enjoyed a bowl of lentil soup there on the sidewalk he had occupied for more than three weeks.
Mohamad mulled the question a few weeks after ending his hunger strike.
That's a hard question to answer, he said, but he has no regrets.
