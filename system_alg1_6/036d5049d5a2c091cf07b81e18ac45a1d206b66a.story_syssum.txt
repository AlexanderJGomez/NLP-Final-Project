At some levels, the contrast in the views of Obama and Clinton is yet another chapter in the extraordinarily tense personal relations that began with the 2008 Democratic primaries, when then-Sen. Hillary Clinton competed with Obama.
But at another level, the debate between these two men is part of a bigger debate about what kind of campaign the Democrats should run: a campaign of articulation or a campaign of triangulation.
The other kind of campaign, the campaign of "triangulation," is one that Bill Clinton mastered in 1996.
This was the kind of campaign Obama has always promised voters he would not run.
In 1996, Clinton perfected this kind of campaign.
Obama understands that the danger of a campaign of articulation is that he would not be able to capitalize on the issues that convince many moderates to go to or stick with the Republican Party.
If he does not, and he takes the triangulation bait, Obama could end up becoming a surrogate for the Romney campaign.
