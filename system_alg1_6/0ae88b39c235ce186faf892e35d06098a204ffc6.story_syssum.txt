Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- In 1998, Kevin Warwick became what some people call "the world's first cyborg."
He is certain that without upgrading, we humans will someday fall behind the advances of the robots we're building -- or worse.
Warwick doesn't want to turn into a robot: He wants to be a better human.
"Technology, directly integrated with the brain, can help overcome some problems people have," says Warwick.
Someday, says Warwick, humans could become "a curiosity for the machines."
