Calvert County, Maryland (CNN) -- Getting out of her car, the wife of a furloughed government worker walked toward a small building full of free food.
And if the government shutdown continues, Hahn said he anticipates his group will continue this sort of offering.
Men and women were on both sides of the help on Monday in Calvert County -- those receiving and those distributing food.
Still, the woman said she is struggling to put food on the table.
Hahn, who has worked for Chesapeake Church for 20 years, said many of the men and women he saw collect food on Monday were new faces who had never sought their help in the past.
"I would say this to the president and Congress, your job is to solve problems, not to create problems," Hahn said.
