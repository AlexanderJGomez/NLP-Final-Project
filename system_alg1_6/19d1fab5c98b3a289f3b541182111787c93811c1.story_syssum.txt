Montevideo, Uruguay (CNN) -- The passage of a landmark marijuana legalization measure Tuesday means Uruguay is set to become the first country in the world to have a system regulating legal production, sale and consumption of the drug.
Critics said legalizing marijuana could have dangerous consequences.
Conservative critics of the measure have said it promotes drug addiction and have suggested that Mujica's comments were uninformed.
The proposed law would allow individuals to grow up to six plants of marijuana and possess as many as 480 grams for personal use.
The same debates about marijuana that exist in the United States -- about medicinal properties, recreational use, the impact on the justice system -- have been happening in Uruguay for a long time, Calzada said.
"It's a very bad piece of legislation, mainly because it increases the availability of marijuana in the market," he said.
