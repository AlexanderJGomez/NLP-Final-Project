It's a phrase coined by South African marketing agency The Creative Counsel, describing individuals who live, breathe and promote a brand in specific zones of South Africa.
The Creative Counsel is a $50 million company helping multinationals to reach these million consumers; through doing so they are pioneering African marketing solutions.
Zonal champions will inform and educate members of the emerging middle class in South Africa on what to buy, and why they should buy it.
Vodacom is one of The Creative Counsel's clients; it too utilizes zonal champions to spread its marketing message to consumers who are hard to reach.
For the community, a big multinational such as Vodacom now has a face and a voice and can give one-on-one advice on a daily basis.
Apart from bridging the gap between the big multinational and the consumer this marketing strategy also provides employment opportunities for South Africans.
"It means that if you're a brand that needs to support me in the community, create employment opportunities, gives me real product information, I will support you and buy your product -- one hand washes the other.
