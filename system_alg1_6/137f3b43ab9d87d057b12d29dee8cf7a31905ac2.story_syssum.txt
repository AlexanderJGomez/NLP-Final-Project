But prosecutors are fighting that, saying Hinckley has been deceptive about his activities while on visits to his mother in Williamsburg, Virginia.
Hinckley's attorney, Barry Levine, said the issue is not whether Hinckley has sometimes been deceptive but whether he is dangerous.
Jones said Hinckley had been diagnosed years ago as suffering from depression and from an unspecified psychotic disorder.
Jones said he has interviewed Hinckley but has not treated him.
Currently, Hinckley is allowed to visit his mother 10 days a month.
The first step would allow Hinckley to have two visits of 17 days.
On March 30, 1981, Hinckley waited for President Reagan to leave a Washington Hotel after a speech.
Hinckley, who was 25 at the time of the shooting, was enamored of actress Jodie Foster.
