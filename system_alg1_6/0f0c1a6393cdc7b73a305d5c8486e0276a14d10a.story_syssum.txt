The Court of Appeals of Virginia decided differently in weighing the commonwealth's assisted conception statute and denying Bruce's appeal to deny Boardwine visitation.
Boardwine initially was hesitant when Bruce approached him in 2010 with the turkey baster idea, the court document says.
She and Boardwine tried a few more times, and in July, she learned she was going to have a baby.
She thought he could have "some involvement," the appeals court decision says, but she would be the sole parent.
Bruce argued that she used "noncoital reproductive technology" to get pregnant, and Boardwine was technically a sperm donor.
The appeals court affirmed the lower court's ruling, saying the turkey baster doesn't constitute reproductive technology.
