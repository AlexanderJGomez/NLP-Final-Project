(CNN) -- The little-known South African Louis Oosthuizen shocked the world of golf as he stormed to his first ever major win on Sunday with a runaway seven-shot victory at the British Open at St. Andrews.
"It was unbelievable what he (Ernie Els) did for me," Oosthuizen told the official British Open website.
The South African responded to the early setback by making 2007 his best year so far on the golf circuit, winning three titles on the Sunshine Tour including the Telkcom PGA championship.
However, Oosthuizen's stop-start career continued as he failed to play in a major after missing the cuts for the Masters, the British Open and the PGA Championship in 2009.
Having missed the cut at the British Open in 2004, 2006 and 2009, few, if any, envisaged him collecting the trophy at the end of play on Sunday.
