Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- A South African pensioner has died while waiting in a queue to buy tickets for the soccer World Cup, with people lining up for 20 hours in some cases and system problems causing further delays.
South Africans across the country have been queuing since Wednesday afternoon in a last-minute bid to be part of the first football World Cup on the continent, with 500,000 tickets still available.
The tickets couldn't be printed," Mabuse said.
Another problem for local organizers is that South Africans are used to buying tickets on the day of events.
"It has been very difficult for South Africans to get tickets," Mabuse said.
