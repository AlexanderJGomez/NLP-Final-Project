(CNN) -- My participation in the British Invasion came as a total surprise to me.
I loved performing to American audiences, and I still do.
The spearhead of the "Invasion" was of course the Beatles.
Of course "Downtown" was only the beginning.
For me, the buzz was and still is all about the music and being around people who feel the same way.
The British Invasion came and went, but left behind a body of music that lives on today.
