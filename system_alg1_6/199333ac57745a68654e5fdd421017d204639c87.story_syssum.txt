In 2011, the Census Bureau found that 49.7 million Americans were in actual poverty and the national poverty rate topped 16%.
Worse, almost 20% of American children live in poverty.
A 2012 study by the Cato Institute estimates that the United States has spent roughly $15 trillion since then, and yet the poverty rate is close to where it was more than 40 years ago.
Granted, the government has a role in aiding the poor, particularly the disabled, handicapped and those who are poor largely at no fault of their own.
In a landmark study, the Brookings Institution found that young adults who finish high school, get a full-time job and wait until age 21 to get married and have children have just a 2% chance of falling into poverty and a 74% chance of ending up in the middle class.
It should come as no surprise then that the poverty rate in Washington was 18.7% in 2011.
We know that the poverty rate is higher among single parent households than in families with married couples.
A national conversation about poverty must include these critical institutions.
