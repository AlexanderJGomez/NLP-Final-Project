Patients in nine states contracted the deadly fungal meningitis after being injected in their spine with a preservative-free steroid called methylprednisolone acetate that was contaminated by a fungus.
Health officials say 76 medical facilities in 23 states received the contaminated steroid injections from NECC.
Tennessee is reporting the most number of overall cases -- 32 -- which includes three deaths, according to the CDC.
Nearly 10% of drugs administered in the United States come from compound pharmacies, according to a 2003 Government Accountability Office report.
Symptoms of fungal meningitis are similar to symptoms from other forms of meningitis, but they often appear more gradually and can be very mild at first, the CDC says.
Patients might just have one or two of these symptoms, the CDC says.
