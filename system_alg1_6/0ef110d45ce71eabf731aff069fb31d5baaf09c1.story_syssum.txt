(CNN) -- Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso fears Formula One is in danger of becoming a "lottery" and says it could lose its credibility.
Alonso's position at the head of the standings could not have been predicted at the start of this season, when he and his Italian team publicly doubted the race pace of the two Ferraris.
"We were not happy with the car at the beginning of the season.
But as I said it's not enough, we know that and we will keep doing upgrades to the car."
"But he has the talent, he has full support from our bosses, from me, from everybody in the team and we know the talent from Felipe.
Every year in Ferrari it is like this," Alonso said.
"Things are complex and not straightforward and I think it will be quite tight for the championship," said Alonso, who is 25 points ahead of Raikkonen, back on the grid this year with Lotus after a two-year absence.
