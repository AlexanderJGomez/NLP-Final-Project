Nance, a third-year student at the Art Institute of Dallas, was found stabbed to death Saturday in her apartment.
Nance beat out about 60 other applicants to win the partial scholarship to the institute, Stockton said.
Dallas police said officers were asked to investigate after Nance had not been seen for several days.
Reyes said officers are in the process of interviewing people.
"She was a great student, always came to class, always involved on campus," Stockton said.
