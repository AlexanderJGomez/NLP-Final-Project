(CNN) -- A call to the Secret Witness tip line helped police break CNN's first featured cold case: the slaying of college student Brianna Denison, investigators say.
And now, it is also our first cracked cold case.
And, police say, Biela is a suspect in the November 2007 parking lot assault of another UNR student.
Police say they were able to connect Biela's DNA with a sample left on panties found near Denison's body.
Police say Biela's associates told them he left Reno in a hurry in March, shortly after Denison's body was found.
It was an anonymous tip from a friend of his former girlfriend November 1 that broke this cold case wide open, police say.
Lab tests showed that the boy's father -- Biela -- was almost certainly a match for the DNA found on the doorknob and at the crime scene, police said.
When first questioned about the Denison case in early November, Biela refused to submit DNA samples and provided an alibi to police, claiming that he'd been with his girlfriend.
Police are urging anyone with more information to call the Reno Police Hot Line at 775-745-3521.
