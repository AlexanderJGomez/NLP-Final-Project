Now, Bond is proving that he still has a place at MI6 by tackling a much more modern dilemma: tactical cyberespionage and terrorism.
Shaking disbelief: One of the standout moments in "Skyfall" is the film's opening sequence in which Bond, played for the third time by Daniel Craig, and field operative Eve, played by Naomie Harris, chase a man through the streets of Istanbul.
He had everything in one place.
"It's not very plausible that the government is going to put all of their sensitive information on one hard drive that manages to get stolen because that would be a violation of what they call OPSEC," Wright said.
Stirring reality: Wright said many critical infrastructures are connected to Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems, controlling our electricity grid, water, and sewers, and are therefore are a huge soft target for terrorism.
Wright said.
This leads them to the final battle in a place called Skyfall, which fans of Ian Fleming's books know as a very personal place for Bond.
By doing so, Wright and his team were able to see the latest techniques being used and which vulnerabilities cyberterrorists were willing to exploit.
In the case of the latest film from the 50-year-old Bond franchise, it's safe to assume who comes out on top.
