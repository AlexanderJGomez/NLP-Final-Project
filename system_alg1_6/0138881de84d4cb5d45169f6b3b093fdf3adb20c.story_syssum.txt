Matt Sandusky told the grand jury nothing inappropriate had ever happened to him.
In the police interview, Matt Sandusky said that he was molested between the ages of 8 and 15, that he tried to escape from the Sandusky home and once attempted suicide.
Matt Sandusky, a foster child formally adopted at 18, also described Jerry Sandusky rubbing, hugging and showering with him.
By not putting Jerry Sandusky on the stand, the defense ensured that Matt Sandusky would not testify.
The audiotape's leak was the main subject of a meeting hastily called Tuesday by trial Judge John Cleland and attended by prosecutors, defense attorneys and even the judge who has overseen the grand jury that's investigated the Sandusky case, a source with knowledge of the meeting told CNN National Correspondent Susan Candiotti.
"I'm innocent," said Jerry Sandusky, in answer to questions CNN's Candiotti asked of him through his lawyer.
But Jerry Sandusky doesn't regret his decision, according to his lawyer.
"Enough to work up a sweat."
