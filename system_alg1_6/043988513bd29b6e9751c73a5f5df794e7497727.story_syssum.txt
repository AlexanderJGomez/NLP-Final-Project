The second round of stops saw Webber push to the front again, before Alonso rounded him, only for the Spaniard to see Hamilton overtake on the outside to regain first place.
Hamilton was the first into the pit lane to make the required switch onto hard tires late in the race, Alonso leading for two laps before deciding to come in.
Meanwhile in MotoGP, Casey Stoner won the U.S. Grand Prix at Laguna Seca Raceway to consolidate his lead in motorcycling's world championship standings.
