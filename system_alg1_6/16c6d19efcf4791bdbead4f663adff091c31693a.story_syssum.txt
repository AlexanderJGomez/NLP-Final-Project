The three injured students have been released from hospitals, the sheriff's office said.
After the stabbings, students were kept in classrooms for safety and to allow authorities to interview witnesses, said the superintendent of Spring Independent School District, Ralph Draper.
They continued to communicate in the hours after, while he and other students were kept in their first-hour classes, she said.
The district gave automated phone and e-mail messages to parents about three hours after the stabbings, she said.
