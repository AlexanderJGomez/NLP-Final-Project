And Foxy Loxy is concerned there will be massive job losses and our economy will crash.
Here's why:
So, the real reduction in federal spending this year is just 1.2%.
It is true that the cuts are not spread equally across all types of federal spending.
In fact, defense spending would really be cut, in the sense of actually spending less, over the next two years.
If our economy can't survive spending cuts of that size, we truly are Greece.
This will be hard on some communities that depend heavily on government spending, and even harder on those workers directly affected.
Given that the private sector generally puts those resources to a more productive use, it is likely that government spending destroys more jobs over the long run than it creates.
