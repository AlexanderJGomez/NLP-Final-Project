(CNN) -- The John F. Kennedy who was elected in 1960 was not going to change the world.
But chastened by confronting the Russians over Berlin and missiles in Cuba, and reassured by the knowledge that the missile build-up had guaranteed a measure of Cold War stability, Kennedy moved to lessen Cold War tensions and the dangers of nuclear war.
He was the first American president in the Cold War to talk about the Soviet Union as an adversary with whom the United States should peacefully compete, rather than an enemy to be defeated militarily.
Kennedy's assassination and Johnson's masterly leadership guaranteed the eventual passage of the civil rights bill and the tax cut.
But his Vietnam policy in late 1963 in which he acquiesced in the overthrow of President Diem's government was already locked in a policy of sustaining a South Vietnam government that was ready to fight the communists.
David Ormsby-Gore, as Lord Harlech, was the first chair of the Kennedy Memorial Trust which also awarded scholarships to the "best and the brightest" of British students to do graduate work at Harvard and MIT.
Kennedy may not have changed the world and his assassination may not have significantly altered America's future, but 50 years on it is not surprising that his memory still evokes a profound sense of loss.
