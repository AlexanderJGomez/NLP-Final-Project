New video released by ISIS shows militants smashing what they say are antiquities at a museum in Mosul, Iraq.
"Mosul Museum has 173 original pieces, and there were preparations to reopen the Mosul Museum before ISIS invaded the city in June 2014," Rashid said.
Officials there have said ISIS has blown up shrines such as the tomb of Jonah.
ISIS' system of profiteering from antiquities thieving is very complicated, the three said, adding that for some areas along the Euphrates River, ISIS leaders encourage semiprofessional field crews to dig.
