Brazil celebrated a third Confederations Cup triumph following victories in 2005 and 1997.
But Bob Bradley's U.S. team, beaten 3-0 by Brazil in the group stage, took a shock lead when Dempsey found space in the penalty area to guide home Jonathan Spector's fierce right-wing cross for his third goal of the tournament.
But Fabiano struck a killer blow soon after the restart when otherwise-impressive U.S. defender Jay DeMerit allowed him to collect Kaka's pass inside the penalty area and swivel to fire past a helpless Howard.
It was Brazil's third Confederations Cup triumph, having also won in 1997, and represented a 14th victory in the last 15 meetings with the U.S.
