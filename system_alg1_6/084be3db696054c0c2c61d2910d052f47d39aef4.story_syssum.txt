A roadside sign in West Point, Georgia, expresses support for Kia's new factory.
"The revitalization of the community is touching every aspect," Ferguson said.
Overall, West Point stands to gain 20,000 jobs as a result of the factory during the next five years, Ferguson said.
"We think the investment will pay off big time," Ferguson said.
"I came here because of Kia," Williams said.
"We'd go downtown and there was nothing there," Williams said.
"The job that I used to do for a long time, we thought we'd retire there," McManus said.
They want to see where the Kia site's gonna be built," Williams said.
"It's been up at least 70 percent," said the 44-year-old West Point native.
Resident Christy Magbee said West Point is starting to feel like a melting pot.
It's an exciting time," Ferguson said.
