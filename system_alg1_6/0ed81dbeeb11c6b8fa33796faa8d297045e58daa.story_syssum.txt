The Transportation Security Administration "has initiated action to remove the individual from federal service," an agency spokesperson said.
The TSA identified and removed the employee from screening operations, the TSA said Wednesday on its blog.
"It's easy to scapegoat one individual here, but the problem with the note is that it's representative of the bigger privacy intrusions that the U.S. government, through the TSA and other sources, levels every day," she wrote Wednesday after learning of the employee's suspension.
"The note was inappropriate, the agent in question acted unprofessionally when s/he put in my bag, there should be consequences and I'm glad the TSA takes these things seriously.
