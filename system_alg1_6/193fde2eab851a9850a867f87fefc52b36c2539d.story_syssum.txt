Dixon got the tattoos, he said, to send a message to his enemies and the police to leave him alone.
"I was confused, lost, and didn't have the slightest idea of how to be a good father," said Dixon, now 30.
"What we want to do is get these people above ground and back into the mainstream," said Joe Jones, the nonprofit's founder and CEO.
"If we don't crack the code of men having babies for whom they're not responsible for, all of our efforts to build a better Baltimore will be limited," said Jones, 57.
"The one thing that is consistent with all these men is that they want to be involved with the lives of their children, but they just don't know how," Jones said.
When Dixon first came to the Center for Urban Families, he owed $47,000 in child support.
"You have a group of men speaking about issues they are having about their children," Dixon said.
"The first day I took him to school, I got the sense of fatherhood," Dixon said.
"I didn't want to go to jail anymore," Jones said.
"It's my way of giving back ... in ways in which I took from my community many years ago," Jones said.
Jones' turnaround is an inspiration to Dixon and the other men in his program.
Now Dixon feels confident that he can follow Jones' example.
