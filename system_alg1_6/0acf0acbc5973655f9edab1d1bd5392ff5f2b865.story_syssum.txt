The National Transportation Safety Board recommended on Tuesday that all 50 states adopt a blood-alcohol content (BAC) cutoff of 0.05 compared to the 0.08 standard on the books today and used by law enforcement and the courts to prosecute drunk driving.
What will be our legacy 30 years from now?"
Lowering the rate to 0.05 would save about 500 to 800 lives annually, the safety board  said.
In the early 1980s, when grass-roots safety groups brought attention to drunk driving, many states required a 0.15 BAC rate to demonstrated intoxication.
In recent years, about 31 percent of all fatal highway accidents were attributed to alcohol impairment, the NTSB said.
Currently, more than 100 countries on six continents have BAC limits set at 0.05 or lower, the safety board said.
The group said it based that conclusion on a chart it said was used by auto safety regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The safety board also recommend that NHTSA provide financial incentives to states to carry out the changes.
The NTSB recommended last December that states require ignition interlocks for all DUI offenders and said states should improve interlock compliance.
