Kevin Systrom, co-founder of photo sharing site Instagram, said this week he wants to give his users better access to their older images.
One of those people is Phil Libin, CEO of Evernote, a service that allows users to archive images, documents and other data.
"We want people to have to believe that Evernote will be around for 100 years," Libin told CNN.
Delicious still exists today and may continue to thrive long into the future.
"There's no magical technology solution -- it's not like we have a file format that someone will be able to read in 100 years," he added.
"They're planning for thousands of years," he said.
