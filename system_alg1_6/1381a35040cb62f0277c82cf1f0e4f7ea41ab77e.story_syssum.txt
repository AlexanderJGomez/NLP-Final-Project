(CNN) -- This week's New York premiere of Led Zeppelin's forthcoming concert film, "Celebration Day," may have brought out both fans and rock stars, including Mick Jones, Stevie Nicks and Paul Stanley of Kiss, but beyond the 2007 reunion depicted on-screen, don't expect to see the legendary band in concert anytime soon.
"It was clicking again," Jones said.
This week's premiere marks the first time Led Zeppelin has been in North America since a tour in 1977.
Page said the band owes a massive debt to America; Plant says they feel like Americans in a way.
