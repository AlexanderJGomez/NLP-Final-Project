(CNN) -- With mostly mild cases of swine flu in the United States, swine flu fears are lessening.
Is the swine flu outbreak in the United States winding down?
No.
"H1N1 flu could die down soon and return later again this fall when the flu season enters back in full swing," says Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano.
Napolitano adds that public health officials will be keeping a close eye on the Southern Hemisphere, where flu season starts soon.
"In 1918, that pandemic started out as a very mild case of disease in the spring of 1918.
Secondly, the 2009 H1N1 lacks a gene that is present in highly virulent flu viruses, such as the one in 1918.
Will there be a vaccine for swine flu?
Pekosz says there are concerns the seasonal flu shot might not work well if it includes the 2009 H1N1 vaccine, and so the decision might be made to make a separate shot.
Public health officials have emphasized that even if a vaccine is available by fall, it doesn't mean everyone will be encouraged to get it.
