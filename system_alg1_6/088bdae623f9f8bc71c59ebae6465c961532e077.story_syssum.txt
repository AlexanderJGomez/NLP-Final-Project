Head coach of Great Britain's powerlifting squad, Vaughan-Ellis  participated in a course that's designed to boost the leadership and management skills of coaches.
In the run up to the 2012 Olympic Games in London, the desire to develop high caliber coaches is ramping up in the UK, said John Neal of Ashridge Business School, where Vaughan-Ellis took the coaching course.
But coaches also need to make sure they make the best decisions for their athletes.
The program is flexible so coaches can focus on the skills they want to improve.
Neal estimates that about 160 coaches have completed the coaching program since it was launched.
Elite coaches have a lot to offer companies, especially in the current economic downturn, Neal said.
That's an invaluable skill in athletics.
