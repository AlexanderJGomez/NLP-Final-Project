"My son tried to run thinking his life was in jeopardy," Terez Miles said.
Miles' mother said the officers did not identify themselves as police to her son, a viola player and student at the city's Creative and Performing Arts High School.
A hearing in the case was scheduled for Thursday, but it was unclear whether the officers involved showed up, said Miles' attorney, Kerry Lewis.
Lewis said Jordan Miles has no criminal record.
