Washington (CNN) -- In what one member of Congress called "a charade," a couple that showed up at President Obama's first state dinner -- uninvited, the White House claims -- declined to answer questions surrounding the event before a House committee Wednesday.
"The Constitution protects fools," Lungren said.
"Were you there?"
After conferring with his attorney, Salahi said, "Yes, but you didn't offer us any legal protection."
Best said after the hearing the couple received "representations that they relied upon" that they were invited guests.

Tareq Salahi also said the couple has provided phone records, e-mails and other documentary evidence to the committee.
"They are Americans," he said.
"They are proud Americans."
