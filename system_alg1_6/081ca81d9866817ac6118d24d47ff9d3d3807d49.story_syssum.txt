Washington (CNN) -- Three weeks until funding starts to dry up for bridge and road projects across the United States, House and Senate committees Thursday put Congress on track toward a deal to avoid construction shutdowns and to keep the federal Highway Trust Fund operating until early next summer.
The Senate committee adopted a House idea, including something called pension smoothing, which allows employers to set aside less money for long-term pension funding.
"While I won't say I've gotten everything I wanted," ranking Republican Orrin Hatch admitted, " I will say I think we've reached a deal that can satisfy both Democrats and Republicans."
"I commend Chairman Wyden and Senator Hatch for putting together a bill that provides roughly $11 billion, as we did," wrote House Ways & Means Chairman Dave Camp in a statement.
Then the two sides must quickly agree to a compromise bill if they want to keep money flowing and avoid construction slowdowns starting in August.
Hence, what could be a rare ahead-of-deadline deal in Congress looks like continued instability and lack-of-decision to those in road construction.
