Saleh has threatened to withdraw all members of his party from the national government and warned the prime minister he could face imprisonment.
"Saleh informed the prime minister to take orders from him or else he will take him to prison," the aide said.
Senior GPC officials told CNN that Saleh was angered at the president and prime minister's stances.
Saleh is still the president of the largest party in the country and must be treated with respect," said a senior GPC aide who asked to remain anonymous.
