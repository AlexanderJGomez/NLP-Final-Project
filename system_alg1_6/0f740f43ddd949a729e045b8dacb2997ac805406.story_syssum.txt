The company announced a new version of its popular Nexus 7 tablet during a press event Wednesday in San Francisco.
The streaming-video company's new Android app will stream movies at 1080p on the Nexus 7.
The new version of Android 4.3 will have parental controls so you can prevent the little ones from seeing saucy content or inappropriate apps.
Older Nexus devices will also be able to test out the Android upgrade -- existing Nexus 4, Nexus 7, Nexus 10 and Galaxy Samsung devices will receive over-the-air updates for the operating system.
