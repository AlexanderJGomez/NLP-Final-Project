The Clintons left the White House more than a dozen years ago "dead broke" and in debt, according to Hillary Clinton, who defended the hefty speaking fees she commands since stepping down as secretary of state last year.
Bill Clinton made more than $9.2 million in speaking fees in 2001 and more than $9.5 million in 2002.
Although she regularly speaks for free at certain events, Mother Jones reported earlier this year that Clinton made roughly $5 million on the speaking circuit since stepping down as America's top diplomat.
Clinton has become a staple on the paid speaking circuit.
"Well, I certainly would give anything on earth if this had not happened," Clinton said.
