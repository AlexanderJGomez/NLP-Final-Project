Authorities also converged on Danvers High -- where Ritzer taught and which Chism attended -- finding blood in a second-floor bathroom, the district attorney said.
Chism was tied to Ritzer's death after police interviewed him and reviewed video surveillance from the school, a criminal complaint states.
Meanwhile, the tight-knit community of Danvers is at a loss to explain why someone might take the life of Ritzer, a 24-year-old known for posting inspirational messages on her Twitter account and offering students extra help when they needed it.
Chism attended fourth grade at a Clarksville, Tennessee, elementary school, said Clarksville-Montgomery County, Tennessee, school system spokeswoman Elise Shelton.
Chism didn't drink, do drugs and came from a good family, one of his closest friends said.
Blodgett declined Wednesday to offer specifics on the relationship between the suspect and the late teacher, though his office said Chism attended one of Ritzer's classes.
Ritzer graduated from Assumption College in 2011, that school said on Twitter.
"In her application to Salem State she said she was dedicated to 'helping students in times of need.'"
"She always wanted to be a teacher, all her life," Martellucci said.
"She was always the teacher (who would) go the extra mile for students, always the teacher to be there for students after school," said Kyle Cahill.
