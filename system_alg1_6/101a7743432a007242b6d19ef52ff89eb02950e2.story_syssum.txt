"It's not that we have a little money," Jon Brumit said, laughing.
But the couple began entertaining the idea of a permanent nest when their friends Mitch Cope and Gina Reichert, also artists, started taking advantage of foreclosures in the city, where the average home price dipped to $11,533 in April, according to the Detroit Association of Realtors.
Here was a chance for Cope and Reichert, who run a popular Detroit art store, to rehabilitate the 1920s brick house into a bastion of energy savings, with solar panels, LED lights, recycled wood and high-end insulated windows.
"It was much easier than we thought it might be," Cope said.
A neighbor said the house had been set on fire -- twice.
There were no back taxes -- no one seemed to be sure who once owned the house, it had been empty for so long, Brumit said.
"I saw it as a project," the artist said.
She and other housing officials CNN spoke with said Michigan's economy has some extremely frustrating woes.
The Smiths bought their 660-square-foot home for $549.99 from Cope and Reichert, who originally purchased the foreclosed home for $500.
"You have to get over that fear that the house had that history, that you're going to be a victim of a crime or something," she said.
And Zeb Smith, who works at the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit, brings home wood the museum would otherwise toss when installations close.
