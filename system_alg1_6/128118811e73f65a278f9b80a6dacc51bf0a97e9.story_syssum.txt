The 1963 work is a portrait of Picasso's second wife, whom he married in 1961, Christie's said.
The painting was expected to fetch between 3.5 million and 5.5 million pounds ($5.59 million to $8.78 million), according to the auction house, but ultimately sold for 6 million pounds ($9.7 million).
Overall, Christie's said that four of the works offered Tuesday night went for more than 5 million pounds ($7.99 million) and 21 others topped 1 million pounds ($1.6 million).
Immediately following the impressionist and modern art auction will be "The Art of the Surreal Evening Sale," featuring seven works by Rene Magritte, Christie's said.
