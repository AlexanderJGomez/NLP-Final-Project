Now one forensics expert has raised the issue that there appear to be two militants in the video.
The focus has been on a man in the video who has a British accent.
But Ross Patel, a forensics expert who spoke to CNN, said there is another man, and he might be the actual killer.
That could help investigators sift through databases of passport photos.
The dimensions and style of the knives are slightly different, Patel said.
But the executioner appears on the video to be left-handed.
Behind the men is a road going over the hilly terrain.
