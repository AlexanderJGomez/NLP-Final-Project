US Aerospace said its bid arrived at Wright-Patterson half an hour before the deadline.
Because of the late arrival of the bid, the Defense Department will not consider US Aerospace's proposal, according to Pentagon chief spokesman Geoff Morrell.
We cannot review it," Morrell said.
Chuck Arnold, a spokesman for US Aerospace, said the bid proposal was on time.
Morrell said he is confident that the dispute with US Aerospace will not slow the process again.
