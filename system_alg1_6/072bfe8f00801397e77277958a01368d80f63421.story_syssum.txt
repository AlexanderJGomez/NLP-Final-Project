London (CNN) -- Phone hacking was widespread at the Daily Mirror newspaper when Piers Morgan was its editor, a former employee testified Wednesday, stopping just short of saying Morgan definitely knew about it.
It doesn't necessarily follow that it was unethical," Morgan said.
"Piers Morgan has no additional comments re: the Leveson Inquiry or Heather Mills.
A lawyer for Trinity Mirror, which publishes the Mirror, said the company disputed Hipwell's testimony and would go into more detail at a future session of the inquiry.
In the past, Morgan has vigorously denied ordering phone hacking at any point during his career.
Much of the inquiry -- and a related police investigation -- focus on allegations of phone hacking by the News of the World.
Testimony by former staff of News of the World and News International last week focused on how much News International chief executive James Murdoch knew about hacking by his employees.
