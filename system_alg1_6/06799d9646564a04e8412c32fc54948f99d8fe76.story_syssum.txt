Three people in a car came upon the 16-year-old as Abu Khdeir walked between his home and mosque around 4 a.m. Wednesday, then forced him inside, according to authorities and family members.
It was a horrible end for someone who friends and family remembered fondly on Wednesday.
Abu Khdeir hadn't fully made his mark on the world.
Instead, all they can do is mourn, remember him and think of what might have been.
