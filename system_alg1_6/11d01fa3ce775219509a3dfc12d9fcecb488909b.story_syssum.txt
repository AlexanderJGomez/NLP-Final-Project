Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN)A dispute over natural gas supply flared Friday between Russia and Ukraine, even as a ceasefire between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine appeared to be taking hold.
But he also warned that they reserved the right to return the weapons to the front line if authorities in Kiev did not keep their end of the bargain.
A meeting between the European Union, Russia and Ukraine is due to take place in Brussels, Belgium, on Monday to discuss gas supply to Ukraine.
Europe also has the option of reverse supply -- sending gas back through pipelines into Ukraine.
However, the OSCE needs more information in order to monitor their withdrawal effectively, he said, including what heavy weapons each side has, where they are now and where they will be taken.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of arming and training the separatists, as well as sending Russian troops over the border to fight with them.
