"What is Prince William like?"
William was the one who, outside the hospital, fixed his son's car seat in, then drove home for the first time with his new family.
The conversation continued as we walked out of the main building, past the small cottage he's currently occupying with his family and into their walled garden where the interview would take place.
William was very comfortable and revealing about his conservation work, and I can't wait for people to see the full version of the interview in next month's special.
It could be any new dad, and that's what I like about the interview.
