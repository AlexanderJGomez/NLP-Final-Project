Momentum in the Senate may be building for passage of a comprehensive immigration reform bill after a border security deal was announced this week, but House GOP opposition to immigration legislation remains the biggest roadblock to a bill getting to the president's desk, and that opposition only appears to be hardening.
But 62 members, roughly a quarter of all House Republicans, broke with Boehner, who made a rare endorsement of the bill, and joined with the vast majority of House Democrats to take down the bill.

"Anything attached to a path to citizenship even if it secures the border I wouldn't support it," Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Lou Barletta said when asked by CNN about the Senate's new border security plan.
Boehner already made it clear earlier in the week that he would only move an immigration bill if it had the support of the majority of House Republicans.
one senior House GOP leadership aide said when asked about what the farm bill's defeat means on immigration.
Even those in the House who are pressing for major immigration reform say it's unlikely to play out in the House until later this fall.
