Pyongyang, North Korea (CNN) -- The last thing Thomas Hudner said to mortally wounded pilot Jesse Brown was that he would come back for him.
Hudner refused to leave him.
"The Marine pilot pulled me aside," Hudner told CNN, "and said dusk was approaching and he couldn't fly the helicopter in the dark and the mountainous terrain, so he had to leave.
If the Chinese troops didn't claim Hudner, the Korean winter would.
Arms and medical supplies also froze in subzero temperatures.
Hudner told CNN he didn't think the trip would ever happen.
The timing of the invitation to the U.S. veterans is likely intentional, but for Hudner, the focus is bringing closure to his Korean War experiences and to Brown's family.
Almost 8,000 American military personnel are still missing in action in the conflict.
