A painting by the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh, which was previously believed to be a forgery, has been authenticated.
On March 30, 1852, Vincent van Gogh was stillborn in the Netherlands.
He left school at 15.
His brother Theo would write that, very near the end, Vincent said to him: "The sadness will last forever."
You don't have to be an aficionado of fine art to walk into a public gallery, stand before a painting done by someone long dead, and think: One day, many generations ago, whoever created this work decided that this tiny brushstroke here would be preferable to another, subtly different one; that this shade of red in this corner was the ideal one, instead of a shade more vivid or more muted; that the shadows over on this side of the canvas were what was needed to set the proper mood.
The writer, on that day, may not have known whether his or her book would ever be published.
Maybe the book has sat on this library shelf for years without anyone coming along to free it from its hardbound neighbors.
The house is not going to outlast the music of the Everly Brothers; eventually and inevitably the house will fall apart or be torn down.
Immortality: Now that van Gogh's "Sunset at Montmajour" has been discovered and authenticated for the world to see, his every artistic choice that reveals itself on the canvas will be peered at and discussed for centuries to come, by admirers hoping to glean further insights into the man he was.
