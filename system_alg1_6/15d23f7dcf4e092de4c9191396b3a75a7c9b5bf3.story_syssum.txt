(CNN) -- Three men who toppled an ancient boulder in Utah's Goblin Valley State Park have been booted from their Boy Scout leadership roles.
But when CNN affiliate KUTV noted that Taylor didn't look particularly debilitated in the video, he replied, "You didn't see how hard I pushed."
"We have now modified Goblin Valley, a new Goblin Valley exists," Hall is heard saying at the end of his video.
That's what we're all about."
"We thought we were doing a good deed," Taylor told the affiliate.
The men "are currently under criminal investigation," he said ont Friday.
