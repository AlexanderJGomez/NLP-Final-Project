Chiranuch Premchaiporn was found guilty for allowing content prohibited under Thailand's controversial "lese-majeste" law to stay on Prachatai, an independent online news site, for 20 days before it was deleted.
According to The Campaign Committee for the Amendment of Section 112 of the Criminal Code, the petition aims to sponsor a bill to prevent abuse of the current law.
Earlier this month, a 61-year-old man serving a 20-year sentence for lese-majeste and computer offenses died in a prison hospital in Bangkok.
Various banners condemning lese-majeste, or Section 112 of the Criminal Code, were also flown.
