Hoping to tap into the events market, Reykjavik has set to work building its conference infrastructure.
"We may be a small country, but we've got big ideas," says Karitas Kjartansdottir, Harpa's conference director.
Though it may seem like a distant land, the country is a mere three-hour flight from central Europe, and five hours from many North American destinations.
"It will be a long time before we get another meeting as prominent as the Reykjavik Summit," says Gudmundsson.
"The Blue Lagoon brings more energy to business groups, and makes corporate events more fun and productive," notes Magnea Guomundsdottir, the director of public relations for Blue Lagoon Iceland.
As if the setting wasn't unique enough, Blue Lagoon has also arranged DJs, circuses and modern dance performers for corporate events.
