WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush lifted an executive order banning offshore oil drilling on Monday and urged Congress to follow suit.
Bush, signed the executive order in 1990 banning offshore drilling.
Experts say offshore oil drilling would not have an immediate impact on oil prices because oil exploration takes years.
With oil now selling for $145 a barrel, companies are almost assured of profiting from offshore drilling, Scott said.
