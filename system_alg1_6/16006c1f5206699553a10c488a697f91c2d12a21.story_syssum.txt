Yvonne, who didn't give her last name, started by telling me that she had been able to get off Medicaid in the past year.
Let me try to explain: In a state that has chosen not to expand Medicaid, Yvonne is in the staggering position of now making too much money to qualify for Medicaid, and too little to obtain subsidies through the Affordable Care Act.
The tax subsidies available through the health exchanges were intended to make private insurance coverage affordable for those between the poverty line and four times as much -- people who now shoulder the responsibility, by law, of purchasing their own coverage.
Last year, in its landmark ruling that left most of the ACA in place, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Medicaid expansion is optional for states.
In the states that accepted Medicaid expansion, the federal government will pick up 100% of the tab for four years.
Yvonne doesn't have many options.
She can't get subsidies, Medicaid or health insurance.
