For the first time since they regained control of the House in 2011, Republicans have no plans at the moment to bring up a bill to repeal the law -- something they have done nearly 50 times.
Instead, Republicans have gone to great lengths to promote the negative aspects of the law by launching their own public relations campaign.
"It's all negative," Tanner said of the Republican strategy.
With that strategy, Republicans could deprive the President of that argument.
That has caused Republicans to move away from their blanket calls for repeal to highlighting problems with the law.
"They don't have to go down the legislative road to defund Obamacare at this point because it didn't work," Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said.
The latest CNN/ORC poll found that while only 40% favor the law, 14% of opponents say the law doesn't go far enough.
Bonjean said Republican incumbents shouldn't be worried about primary challengers if they drop the repeal argument in the halls of Congress because they can still espouse it on the campaign trail.
Regardless if Republicans continue to shelve the repeal argument, Tanner said repeal will never happen.
If the law proves unworkable and not beneficial for Americans, expect Democrats to join with Republicans to alter the law.
