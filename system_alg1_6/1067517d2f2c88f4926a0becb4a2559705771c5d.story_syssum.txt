In addition to lending, SELFINA loans women equipment to start up their businesses.
Like many of the women she helps, Kisyombe struggled to get financing when first starting out.
Kisyombe sold milk from her cow, Sero, in order to raise money to start her business.
By offering loans to women in a range of industries, SELFINA is effecting change throughout Tanzania, though Kisyombe envisions the women she supports will have a global impact.
Ultimately, she sees SELFINA encouraging women in a broader context than business.
