This was the latest twist in a case that has made international headlines, in part because of the circumstances of the killing but also because van der Sloot was arrested twice, but never charged, in the 2005 disappearance of U.S. teenager Natalee Holloway.
Hours before Friday's court proceedings, his attorney said that van der Sloot would plead guilty to all charges related to Flores' death.
Van der Sloot was arrested twice but never charged in Holloway's disappearance, which is still unsolved.
The victim's family, including her father, Ricardo Flores, had pushed for stiffer charges and said that van der Sloot hasn't looked "remorseful" in court appearances.
Besides the Flores murder trial, van der Sloot also faces possible extradition to the United States.
