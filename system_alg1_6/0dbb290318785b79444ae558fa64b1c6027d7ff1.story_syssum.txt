The controversial law passed by a narrow 33-to-29 vote -- a first for a GOP-led state Senate -- making New York the sixth state in the union to legalize same-sex marriage.
New York, which gave birth to the gay rights movement in the 1960s, will become the sixth state to allow same-sex marriages.
New York state's population is 19,378,102, according to the 2010 U.S Census.
The Assembly passed a new version of the bill that included the amendment about religious institutions.
