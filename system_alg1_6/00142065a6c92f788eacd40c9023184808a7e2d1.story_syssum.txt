The 60-minute initial mental examination of Gonzalez at the District of Columbia jail came as a surprise to the judge and to both the government and defense.
The judge delayed arraignment for Gonzalez on new charges the government filed against him last week.
Collyer said that during the initial examination, the mental health screener found Gonzalez did understand some parts of the proceedings.
