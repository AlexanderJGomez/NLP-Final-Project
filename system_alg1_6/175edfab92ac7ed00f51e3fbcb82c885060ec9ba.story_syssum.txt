(CNN) -- Champagne, Pele and FIFA.
"I cannot stay away from a debate which is so important for the future of football and thus, I support Jerome Champagne and his vision," the 73-year-old said in a video message.
We need to go to a World Cup with total tranquility and serenity," said a man who is bidding to become the first French president of FIFA since Jules Rimet, the founder of the World Cup, in the 1950's.
He believes this will be possible because of his consultancy work with a number of FA's around the world since leaving FIFA in 2010.
Nonetheless, Champagne seems as though he will be happy if he can make how the game should be run into a global conversation.
