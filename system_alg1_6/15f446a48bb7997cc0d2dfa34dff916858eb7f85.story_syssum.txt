'Planet Solar' would be the world's fastest fully solar-powered boat and is projected to cross the Atlantic in two weeks.
Planet Solar will be covered in 470 square meters of solar panels -- the equivalent of two tennis courts.
Batteries on Planet Solar will be able to store enough energy gathered from the sun to allow the boat to sail in poor conditions for three days, said Faigaux.
Famous French sailor Gerard D'Abouville will skipper the boat alongside Domjan.
Up to 500 people at any one time will be will be able to visit the village's three inflatable "spheres" to learn more about Planet Solar, ecology and economy.
