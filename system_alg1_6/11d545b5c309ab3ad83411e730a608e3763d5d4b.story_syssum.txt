It wasn't until the Industrial Revolution that men began to work outside the home, tethering women to household responsibilities and child rearing.
Nevertheless, I had internalized the values of my culture, and my own scholarship could not help me override this.
Why?
Maternal employment continues to pose a threat to our strongly held belief about motherhood -- it is natural for mothers, not fathers, to have primary responsibility for raising children.
When women are pregnant, people ask them, but not the fathers of their children, whether they plan to return to work.
The cost to women is great in lost opportunity.
By encouraging women to "lean in," some, such as Slaughter, say Sandberg is placing undue burden on individual women.
Our implicit biases limit the aspirations of men and women alike.
