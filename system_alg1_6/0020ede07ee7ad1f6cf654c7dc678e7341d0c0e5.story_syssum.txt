As a 20-year-old, Ana Ivanovic claimed the French Open on Roland Garros' clay courts.
"I've been working really hard," Ivanovic told retired grand slam champion Kim Clijsters in an interview for CNN's Open Court show.
A number of others have also helped her temporarily as part of the Adidas Player Development program.
"I'm really enjoying someone who speaks the same language and can understand you," Ivanovic said.
"A lot of players on tour jump around with coaches, I can never understand that.
Now ranked 14th, she has been outside of the top 10 since June 2009, partly explained by her inability to reach the final four of a grand slam since that 2008 win over Dinara Safina in Paris.
Ivanovic has had a number of high-profile boyfriends -- including Masters-winning golfer Adam Scott and fellow tennis player Fernando Verdasco -- but as Caroline Wozniacki has discovered, it is tough combining consistency on court with such a relationship.
"She can beat the top players, but to win a grand slam you have to win seven matches.
"I still feel like there is so much I can achieve and so many tournaments I can win," she told the Belgian.
