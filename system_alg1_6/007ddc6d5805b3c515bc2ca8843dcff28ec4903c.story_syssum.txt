Kurdish fighters defending the key Syrian border city of Kobani are dangerously outmatched as ISIS advances, a top United Nations official said Tuesday, calling for the international community to step in.
And hours after U.S. airstrikes targeting ISIS struck near Kobani overnight, the city's future was far from certain.
The U.S. goal, she said, is "a deliberate, well thought-out campaign in Syria" to disrupt ISIS command and control, destroy the group's infrastructure and attack sources of fuel and financing for ISIS.
Five airstrikes targeting groups of ISIS fighters struck near Kobani overnight, U.S. Central Command said.
Three people were killed and at least 36 injured in demonstrations throughout Turkey, police said, according to Anadolu.
CNN affiliate RTL Belgium said about 50 protesters stormed into the building.
Belgium participated in overnight airstrikes in Iraq, U.S. Central Command said.
Elsewhere in Syria, two strikes west of al-Hasakah hit multiple ISIS buildings, one near Deir Ezzor struck an ISIS staging area and IED production facility, and one southwest of Rabiyah struck a small group of ISIS fighters.
U.S. military airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria have cost more than $62 million so far, according to data provided by the U.S. Defense Department.
The data, apparently sent out inadvertently to the Pentagon's press contacts on Monday, listed the total number of airstrikes by U.S. Central Command in Iraq and Syria.
