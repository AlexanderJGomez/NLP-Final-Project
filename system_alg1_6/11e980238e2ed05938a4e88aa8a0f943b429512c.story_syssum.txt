According to the lawsuit, Aruba Petroleum had 22 natural gas wells within a 2-mile radius of the Parrs' property, with three wells in close proximity to their Texas home.

I don't trust this company," Lisa Parr said.
"We are not anti-fracking or anti-drilling.
If you are going to put this stuff in close proximity to homes, be respectful and careful."
