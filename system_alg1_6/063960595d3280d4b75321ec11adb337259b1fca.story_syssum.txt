So she went into exile in 1961, and she's never been back.
And Cuban and U.S. flags will be everywhere.

Around midday on Christmas Eve some of us will head to El Palacio de Los Jugos for lunch and Cuban sandwiches.
But we will be fine.
To Miami, not to Cuba.
I don't want to hear any more stereotypes about who my people are or tourists talking about going to visit Cuba "before it changes."
I want to put those hints together, fill in the gaps and see for the first time, where I am from.
