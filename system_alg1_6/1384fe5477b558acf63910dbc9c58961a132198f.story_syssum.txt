In almost all the countries surveyed, the use of social networks such as Facebook and Twitter didn't change much from 2010 to 2011.
Two notable exceptions were Egypt, where 28% of respondents now use social networks -- up from 18% last year -- and Russia, where social-networking use rose from 33% to 43%.
-- Social networking is generally more common in wealthier nations, largely driven by the fact that they have higher rates of Internet access.
For example, 53% of respondents in Israel and 50% of respondents in the U.S. said they use social networks, compared with 5% in India and 2% in Pakistan.
