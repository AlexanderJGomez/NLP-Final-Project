(CNN) -- A heavy police presence in Bahrain on Sunday limited marches by protesters organized to coincide with the controversial Formula One race in the kingdom, won by world champion Sebastian Vettel.
Maj. Gen. Tariq Hassan Al-Hassan, Bahrain's public security chief, said meticulous planning had gone into the event, the official Bahrain News Agency reported Saturday.
"Police are out in force to beef up security measures at the Bahrain International Circuit," he is quoted as saying.
"The Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and Formula One Management (FOM) wish to jointly confirm their belief that the Bahrain GP should go ahead this weekend," the two bodies said in a statement.
The protests in Bahrain started in February 2011, spurred by uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt.
Canceling the race in 2011 cost Bahrain from $480 million to $800 million in potential investments, according to estimates.
