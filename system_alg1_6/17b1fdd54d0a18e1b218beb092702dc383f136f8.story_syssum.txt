Washington (CNN) -- Over the next few days, the drama of a potential government shutdown will collide with the promise of a new health insurance system known as Obamacare.
Does a government shutdown shut down Obamacare?
Plus, the law would still be in effect, so its many new requirements -- everything from forcing insurance companies to cover anyone who wants insurance to forcing everyday Americans to carry health insurance or pay a fine -- would still be in effect, too.
A.
A lot of people think that because of Obamacare, fewer companies will offer health insurance, particularly to low-paid workers and retirees.
Do you get health insurance from the government?
Obamacare doesn't really affect you.
If you get your insurance from one of the 50 state-run Medicaid programs, Obamacare should not affect you.
Do you have an individual health insurance plan?
Check out your new state health insurance exchange or the one the federal government set up in your state if your state government refused to do so.
Why?
You're either going to have to enroll in Medicaid or buy health insurance from a private company on an "exchange" organized by either your state government or the federal government.
How are you supposed to afford a new health insurance plan?
Is Obamacare health insurance government insurance?
No.
You don't really want health insurance.
So if you're single and you make $50,000, you'd have to pay a $400 fine for not having health insurance.
Some people do.
