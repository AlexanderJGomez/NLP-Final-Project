It seemed United would have to settle for a point after Cristiano Ronaldo's double had only proved enough to keep United level against a Villa side that thoroughly deserved a lead provided by John Carew and Gabriel Agbonlahor.
However, a stunning piece of skill from Cristiano Ronaldo gave them a 14th- minute lead.
The goal stung United into life and they levelled with 13 minutes remaining when Michael Carrick exchanged first-time passes with Giggs on the edge of the Villa box, before presenting Ronaldo with a lay-off.
