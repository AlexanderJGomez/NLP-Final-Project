Nathaniel Nicholson, son of an infamous CIA double agent, faces his own spying charges.
While serving a 23-year prison sentence, prosecutors allege, Jim Nicholson, 58, restarted his career as a double agent and enlisted his son Nathaniel in his efforts to collect money owed to him by the Russian spy services and to sell more secrets.
Nathaniel Nicholson had complained to his father that he and his sister were short of money to pay for college, prosecutors said.
