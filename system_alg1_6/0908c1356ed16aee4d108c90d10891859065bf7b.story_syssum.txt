(CNN) -- A frog that eats birds and a gecko with leopard stripes are among the 163 new species discovered last year in the Greater Mekong region of southeast Asia, according to a report by the World Wildlife Fund.
It shows how little we know about species in the region," he said.
Since 1997, nearly 1,200 new species have been discovered, many that cannot be found anywhere else, said Dekila Chungyalpa, director of WWF's Greater Mekong Program.
"As we become familiar with more species in the region, our understanding of climate change and how it impacts these new species is changing," she said.
"Climate change is making it obvious that we can't treat development like it's a separate issue," she said.
It's such an immediate issue for us and it's going to change everything in this region if we don't address it."
