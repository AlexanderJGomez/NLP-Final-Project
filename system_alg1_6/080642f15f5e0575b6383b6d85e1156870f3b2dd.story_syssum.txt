Now, eight months later, her family is mourning again because they can't keep two SpongeBob Squarepants memorials at her gravesite.

"The family chose a design with the guidance of a Spring Grove employee who unfortunately made an error in judgment," the cemetery's president told CNN.
"It was just heartbreaking," Deborah Walker said.
