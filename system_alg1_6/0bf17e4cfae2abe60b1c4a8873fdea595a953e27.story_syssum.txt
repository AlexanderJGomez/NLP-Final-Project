Joe Dinardo, left, and Clark Dever will be spending only 12 hours in each city before going to their next stop.
Dever, who was recently saving up money to be a professional photographer, quit his job, and Dinardo decided to use all of his accumulated vacation time from his job to take the trip.
JetBlue suspended the deal two days early, saying they were sold out, though the company declined to specify how many people bought them.
She created a site where people are sharing their itineraries in an attempt to either travel together, meet up with Twitter followers in their cities or try to couch surf at other people's homes.
Though Dever and Dinardo may have the most exhausting schedule, they, like many others, think that if nothing else, the trip will be a true adventure.
"No matter what happens, there will certainly be a story that comes out of this trip," Dever said.
