A royal spokesperson said: "Kensington Palace has a working kitchen provided by the Sovereign (public) Grant to support receptions and other public events which might be hosted there.
There is also a much smaller family kitchen paid for privately by The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge."
The Household source confirmed that the apartment would be used for official engagements, which means invited guests and, presumably, media will get a chance to see inside.
There's a major backlog of repairs throughout the estate -- 40% of it isn't up to standard, according to the Household source.
The Royal Household source notes: "The cost of security is a cost of terrorism rather than a cost of the monarchy."
