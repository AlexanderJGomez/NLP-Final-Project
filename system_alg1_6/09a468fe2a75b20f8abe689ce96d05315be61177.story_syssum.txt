Dave pays taxidermist to turn bear into furniture.
So, although I'm sort of weirded out by this practice (and, hey, to each their own) I can absolutely appreciate bad taxidermy.
And, now, there's a new, popular Twitter feed about just that.
And it does.
Bad taxidermy on the Web is actually nothing new.
Just like Nish's twitter feed.
In the meantime, Su maintains her day job as an active-wear designer, but says she's actually going to have to try her hand at taxidermy.
Tainton will be giving Su a private lesson at her apartment, and Su's only real concern is that she'll barf.
