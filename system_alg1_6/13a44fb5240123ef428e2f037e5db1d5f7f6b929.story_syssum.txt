Since passage, the cries have shifted from rationing to repeal.
The confusion and apathy surrounding the health care reform law leaves ample opportunity for others to mischaracterize and foster doubt, energizing and exciting the repeal platform.
But health care reform will not be repealed, and despite messy politics and angry voices, policymakers, providers, insurance companies and other stakeholders are moving quickly to implement the bill.
But more importantly, a repeal of health care reform, followed by a replacement with a more modest set of changes, is tantamount to leaving millions of patients in a state of free fall, with no net to catch them.
Health reform starts at birth -- health plans will no longer be able to refuse to cover children younger than 19 simply because they were born with a medical condition.
Keep in mind that some of these provisions will not technically kick in until your health plan starts the new plan year, which usually happens in January.
As patients, we should ask questions and not be afraid to challenge our health care system, insurance companies and government officials when we are left feeling confused or misguided.
