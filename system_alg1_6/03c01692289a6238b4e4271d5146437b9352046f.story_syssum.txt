Atlanta (CNN) -- On September 1, 2012, an adult inmate was attacked at Baldwin State Prison in Hardwick, Georgia.
Calls to the Georgia department were not immediately returned Wednesday.
In February, a prisoner had three fingers severed by a man with a 19-inch knife at Wilcox State Prison in Abbeville, Georgia.
And on, and on and on.
Last year, some 21,000 men and women were released from Georgia prisons, according to the report.
The center says three times as many prisoners were killed in Georgia in 2012, as compared to 10 years ago, and that in that one year, Georgia had more homicides in its state prisons than some other states' prisons had in the last 10 years.
"The U.S. Department of Justice should launch a thorough investigation," reads the center's report.
