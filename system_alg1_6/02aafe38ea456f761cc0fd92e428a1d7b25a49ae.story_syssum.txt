(CNN) -- New Sunderland owner Ellis Short insists that he will not interfere on the football side following his takeover of the English Premier League club.
"Niall is a very smart footballer, very smart about the Premier League and is a wonderful chairman of the club who knows more about football than I ever will, so I will be in the background and Niall will be running the show.
I fully expect that Niall will be able to make good personnel decisions going forward."
Meanwhile, prospective Portsmouth owner Al Fahim has told fans he intends to build a "great football club" once his takeover is completed.
