(CNN) -- The grizzly bear that attacked and killed a man in Yellowstone National Park acted in defense, park officials said on Thursday, adding that they have no plans to kill the bear.
"Upon seeing the bear, they began to back down the trail and when they turned to check, the bear was in full charge towards them," Wenk said.
She played dead and the bear left, Wenk said.
Wenk said bears have been very visible to park visitors this year but that park officials rely on reports from hikers to determine how many bears are in the back country of the park.
Wenk advised visitors to familiarize themselves with bear safety and protocol before they begin hiking.
