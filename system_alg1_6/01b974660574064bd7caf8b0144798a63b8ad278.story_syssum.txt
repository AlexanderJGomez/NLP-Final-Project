Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- A whale trainer at SeaWorld died from "multiple traumatic injuries and drowning" after a 12,000-pound killer whale grabbed her ponytail and pulled her underwater in front of shocked onlookers at Shamu Stadium, the Orange County Sheriff's office said Thursday.
Orange County Sheriff's Office spokesman Jim Solomons said Brancheau slipped into the tank.
The Orange County Sheriff's Office said the man apparently hid in the park until after it closed, then climbed into the tank.
Tilikum could have been trying to play with Brancheau or get her attention or companionship, said Nancy Black, a marine biologist who has studied whales for 20 years.
"I don't believe the killer whale purposely intended to kill the woman," she said.
But Tompkins said, "We have a tremendous track record with these animals at SeaWorld" and a very small percentage of problems.
"This is the first time in 46 years that we've ever had an incident like this with a trainer," he said.
