WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The servers hosting the Web sites of the House of Representatives and its members have been overwhelmed with millions of e-mails in the past few days, forcing administrators to implement the "digital version of a traffic cop" to handle the overload.
"This was a massive digital busy signal," he said.
"We know it's in the millions," he said of the number of e-mails that lawmakers in the House have been receiving.
Now, when House.gov or individual members' sites begin to get overloaded, a message will come up on the computer screen saying, in effect, "try back later," Ventura said.
"We monitored the situation all night long, and technicians and engineers saw that we were facing the same demand as yesterday," Ventura said.
