(CNN) -- Hillary Clinton is front-page news again.
Whatever happened to having to generate a little news, or even pseudo-news, to warrant some coverage?
Now there's no denying the obvious: Clinton would be a prohibitive front-runner.
-- Clinton hasn't made up her mind.
(See?!)
Hillary Clinton is incredibly popular right now in part because she's had diplomatic immunity for the past four years.
She blew a 30-point lead to a freshman senator, allowed massive staff infighting and failed to fully compete in the caucus states.
I wouldn't bet a ton of money against Clinton being the next Democratic nominee, but the 33 months between now and the Iowa caucuses is a political lifetime.
