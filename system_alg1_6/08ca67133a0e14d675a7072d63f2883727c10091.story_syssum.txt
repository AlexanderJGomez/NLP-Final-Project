The suspects planned to target a train crossing from the United States into Canada, according to a U.S. intelligence official and another government official.
It was aimed at the New York-to-Toronto line that runs through Buffalo, another U.S. official said.
The suspects watched "trains and railways in the greater Toronto area" and intended to derail a passenger train, said Royal Canadian Mounted Police Chief Superintendent Jennifer Strachan.
Authorities believe the suspects received "direction and guidance" from elements of al Qaeda in Iran, said James Malizia, assistant commissioner for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
There's no evidence that the Iranian government was involved, he said.
