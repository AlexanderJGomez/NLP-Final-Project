(CNN) -- Kenyan troops are battling the Islamic extremist group Al-Shabaab in neighboring Somalia, westerners are being targeted at Kenyan tourist resorts and fears are high of terror attacks in Nairobi.
Kenyan forces say they are ultimately seeking to take the Somali port city of Kismayo, described by the U.N. as a key stronghold and source of cash for Al-Shabaab.
"We don't want to go off and get stuck in Somalia," Kenyan government spokesman Alfred Mutua said.
According to many reports, in the absence of any Somali navy patrols, those fleets plundered fish stocks, decimating the livelihoods of many Somali fishermen.
With famine causing misery for millions in the Horn of Africa, the conflict between Al-Shabaab and Kenyan forces is likely to hinder humanitarian efforts.
Bombings only increase the risk," Middleton said, adding that discussions about access between aid workers and Al-Shabaab were unlikely to be eased by the conflict.
"Their reasoning is that Kenya forces could be stuck in Somalia for ages, or there could be an insurgent campaign in Kenya itself.
