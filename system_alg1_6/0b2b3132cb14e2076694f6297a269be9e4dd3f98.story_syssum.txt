Iowa City, Iowa (CNN) -- Katherine Valde is ready when a fellow student says "no thanks" to early voting because of the thrill of casting a ballot on Election Day.
In Iowa four years ago, early voting accounted for 36% of the ballots cast for president.
And Democrats have a big early edge.
Grubbs said one effort in which Democrats were smart to focus so much early voting attention was younger voters.
More broadly, Grubbs conceded a modest Obama edge in Iowa at the moment and said there is nervous talk among some Republicans that Romney could hurt GOP candidates in competitive congressional and other races.
Iowa Republicans also say, despite the Democratic edge in early voting so far, that the GOP is breaking records in terms of its grassroots organizing.
Zmoos says Iowa's unpredictable winters make her a fan of early and absentee voting, and she shrugs off the early Democratic edge in absentee ballot requests as temporary.
