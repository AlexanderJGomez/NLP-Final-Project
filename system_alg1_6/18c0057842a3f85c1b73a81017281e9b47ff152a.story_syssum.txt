Quite simply, cities and states need to consider switching from the prevailing "defined benefit" pension plans to the "defined contribution" plans common in the private sector.
Worse yet, city pension debt is dwarfed by that of state pension debt.
California is the worst, with $370 billion in unfunded pension liabilities.
Pat Quinn at one point suggested a federal bailout of the state's pension debt, a call that has been echoed by many for Detroit.
In the case of defined benefit plans, Detroit shows that taxpayers may not always be able to pay what the government promises.
But other cities and states can still prevent the crisis from boxing their own public workers into a similar financial bind.
