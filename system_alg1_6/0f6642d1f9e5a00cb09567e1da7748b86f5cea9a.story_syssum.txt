NEW YORK (CNN) -- After a nearly year-long investigation, police say they now believe 10 sets of human remains uncovered along a desolate stretch of Long Island, New York, beach are linked to a single killer.
At least 10 sets of human remains have been found in Nassau and Suffolk counties since December.
Their remains were found among bushes along a quarter-mile strip of beachfront property, according to police.
Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas Spota said in May that the newly found remains were not believed to be connected to the first four victims.
