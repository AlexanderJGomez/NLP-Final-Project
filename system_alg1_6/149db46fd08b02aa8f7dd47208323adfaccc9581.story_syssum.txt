Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN) -- A few miles south of the town of Starobeshevo in eastern Ukraine, a group of men in uniform is slumped under a tree.
The drive north from the port city of Mariupol -- only a couple of miles from the Russian border -- offered no evidence of a Ukrainian presence.
By contrast, a small detachment of Ukrainian troops we encountered on the way north seemed demoralized.
The husband, Victor, said he was pure Ukrainian but accused the government of lying to the people.
But accreditation could be obtained only in Donetsk, a city not so easy to enter now with the Ukrainian army shelling it.
Instead he put two of his men in our minivan and dispatched us with an escort to Donetsk, some 30 miles away.
The outdoor cafes and parks that were crowded in the early summer are deserted and more stores are boarded up.
