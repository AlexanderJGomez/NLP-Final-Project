"We've found an issue with two specific capacitors in the power system that affects the ability to hold a charge in some of our bands.
We're also fixing an issue with syncing related to the band hardware.
In his statement, Rahman says that Jawbone has "temporarily paused production" of the bands, and will once again begin taking orders after the hardware's technical issues have been resolved.
Consumers experiencing hardware problems can also continue to receive replacement bands through Jawbone's existing warranty program.
