This should be the day Nigeria steps into the spotlight and basks in the glow of hosting the World Economic Forum in Africa.
But Nigeria does have a couple of obvious economic black-eyes, most notably an inability to close the wealth gap between the North and South, which in turn has given fuel to the Boko Haram movement and, by extension, radical Islam.
But if one heads North to Borno -- the birthplace of Boko Haram -- per capita income is just $1,631.
After re-basing its economy in early April to take in services growth, Nigeria zoomed ahead of South Africa as the continent's biggest economy.
South Africa also struggles with less than a third of Nigeria's growth.
That is where Nigeria remains vulnerable.
