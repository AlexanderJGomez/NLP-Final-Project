ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Dressed head to toe in black, designer Isaac Mizrahi is wearing an outfit that seems to contradict his personality -- and his usual fashion flair.
CNN talked to Mizrahi about his love for theater, the most common fashion mistakes and why bad flowers are never OK.
Isaac Mizrahi: Well, you know what, I think it's all theater.
And in the end, I am like this personality that represents that.
CNN: What's your daily schedule like?
Mizrahi: It changes every day, and I really like that.
I feel like it really disrupts what I love doing most, which is this creation, you know what I mean?
You know people have excuses for bad shoes -- because you know some people have back problems, it is the street and they're walking and walking and walking -- but I do think that people have no excuse for bad hair.
It's like you should spend your most money ... on your hair.
Mizrahi: You know what it is with people?
No.
Mizrahi: I don't know.
I can't say about my personality, but I like to think that I'm very exposed to what's going on out there in the world culturally, and that's what influences my design.
Here's a good description of my personality: claustrophobic.
