The 26-year-old will face European Ryder Cup teammate Luke Donald in Sunday's final at Dove Mountain's Ritz-Carlton course after the Englishman made light work of his matches against Americans Ryan Moore and Matt Kuchar.
1 Kaymer won both of his matches at the 18th, surviving a late rally from Jimenez after leading by four holes at 14.
Kaymer was pegged back three times by Watson -- who earlier beat compatriot J.B. Holmes at the first extra hole of their quarterfinal -- but won 15 and 16 before the left-hander birdied 17.
Yang, who beat U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell on Friday, was never ahead in the match and trailed by four holes after the eighth, then Kuchar matched his four consecutive pars to 17.
Organizers hope the final will not be disrupted by the forecast drop in temperatures which could bring snow to the desert course.
