A controversial new Texas law requiring voters to present personal identification before going to the polls has been blocked by the Obama administration.
The Justice Department, relying on statistics provided by the state, said Hispanics in particular would be negatively affected by the Texas law.
Texas and South Carolina now have the option of asking a federal court in Washington to review the laws, and allow them to be enforced this election year.
Opponents of the voter ID law in Texas have said minority voter turnout could be suppressed 3% to 5% at a time when the Hispanic population there is growing rapidly.
The Justice Department said Hispanic registered voters in Texas are 46.5% to 120% more likely than a non-Hispanic registered voter to lack the required identification.
The Supreme Court in January ordered a special federal court in Texas to reconsider its rejection of the maps approved by the state's Republican majority.
