Chelsea, who overcame Barcelona in the semifinals, were 1-0 down against Bayern Munich with seven minutes remaining at the Allianz Arena, but Drogba conjured an 88th-minute equalizer.
The win also guaranteed Chelsea a place in the Champions League next season after missing out via the Premier League by only finishing sixth.
Chelsea had one corner in the entire match and scored from it through Drogba.
"It's like a nightmare," Bayern director of sport Christian Nerlinger said.
