But Serbian Troicki has rejected the charge, alleging the doctor conducting the blood test allowed him to miss the procedure and says he will now appeal the decision.
The 27-year-old Troicki confirmed that he underwent a test the following day by the same doping control officer with the result coming back negative.
I am clean and will always be clean throughout my career.
It feels like the world that I help building day-by-day has let me down.
Each player will have an individual electronic biological profile and be tested more regularly to monitor their levels and alert the authorities to possible drug use.
But this was a clear mistake from the on-site doping control officer who was also a doctor and the person in charge to decide," added the Serbian.
I hope this nightmare will come to a good end.
