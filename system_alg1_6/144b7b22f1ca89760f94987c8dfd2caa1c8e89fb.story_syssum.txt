Cairo (CNN) -- Nine people died over two days in clashes between Egyptian police and protesters amid reports of inadequate security at a soccer match that devolved into a riot in which 79 fans were killed, officials said Friday.
Police fired tear gas into the crowds and warning shots into the air, he said.
Another fire broke out 20 kilometers from Cairo, at the Al Marg police station, said Usama Emam, a national security investigator.
Among the people arrested in Cairo were 12 Syrians, said Maj. Karim El-Fouli with the Egyptian police.
On Thursday, two people died in Suez and a military officer was accidentally killed by a vehicle driven by security forces in Cairo, officials said.
Rival fans battled with rocks and chairs, and witnesses said many of the Al-Masry fans carried knives and sticks.
Mamdouh Eid, executive manager of the Al-Ahly fans committee, said authorities contributed to the escalation of violence.
"There were organized groups in the crowds that purposely provoked the police all through the match and escalated the violence and stormed onto the field after the final whistle," he said.
The governor and the chief of security, along with the head of the Port Said football federation, the stadium manager and the riot police chief, have all been banned from travel until the investigation is completed.
