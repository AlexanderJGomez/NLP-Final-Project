Chrisette Michele's album "Epiphany" debuted at No.
This time around, Michele, whose voice has earned her comparisons to Billie Holiday and Jill Scott, relinquished some songwriting duties to R&B singer Ne-Yo.
Michele: I have epiphanies all the time, because I'm always thinking.

Michele: "Epiphany" is about a girl who's sitting on her couch and saying "You know what?
Michele: One way is that I didn't write some of the songs.
I get excited when we talk about jazz.
Michele: I'm an advocate of music in schools.
Michele: When I was in school I used to prank my teachers all the time.
I also love Adele's new album.
Those are two that are on my radar.
