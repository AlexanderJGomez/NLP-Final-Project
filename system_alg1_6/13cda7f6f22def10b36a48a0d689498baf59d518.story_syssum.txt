According to Qadri, the composition of the caretaker government should be decided with the input of the judiciary and the military.
Qadri threatened that unless his election reform demands were met by Thursday, he would stage a "Million Man March" to the capital, paralyzing the city with thousands of supporters.
"We are expecting one to two million people who will join the march", Shahid Mursaleen, spokesman for Tahir ul Qadri, told CNN.
The "Million Man March," which is expected to reach Islamabad on Monday, could be a game changer, analysts say, because it could have a major impact on the democratic process -- but whether the outcome of that would be positive or negative at this crucial time for Pakistani politics is still unclear.
