The Russian government overspent its vast oil revenues in recent years, fueling inflation, and did not do enough to reduce the economy's reliance on oil, Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said in an exclusive CNN interview.
Kudrin, who is also a deputy prime minister, said the financial crisis had set back Russian shares -- but added that the United States had fared even worse.
Kudrin confirmed Russia would have a budget deficit of 8 percent in 2009 -- its first for a decade -- and will spend more than it takes in for the next two years as well.
Russia's stock markets plummeted by nearly 70 percent in 2008, and the country spent one-third of its gold and foreign currency reserves -- or $216 billion -- defending its currency, the ruble.
Kudrin -- who is attending a global investment forum in Moscow -- said there were signs the Russian economy was stabilizing.
