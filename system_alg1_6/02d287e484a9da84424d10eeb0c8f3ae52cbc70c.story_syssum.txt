The tiny, landlocked nation in central Africa is home to about 5 million people.
A coalition of rebels named Seleka ousted President Francois Bozize in March, the latest in a series of coups since the nation gained independence.
What happened after the president left?
That's nearly 10% of the population.
No.
OK, the President left and the rebels got their wish.
Rebels capitalized on the army's weakness and went on a rampage, human rights groups say.

Rights groups say Seleka is a predominantly Muslim coalition.
The Central African Republic is surrounded by countries struggling to emerge from years of conflict.
The United States sent special forces to the region last year to help hunt down Kony, the brutal leader of the Lord Resistance Army.
The current president has tried to distance himself by disbanding Seleka, Human Rights Watch says.
An African Union force is already in the nation.
The United Nations has suggested its peacekeeping force should eventually replace the African-led mission known, as MISCA.
