(CNN) -- In her new book "10-10-10," Suzy Welch advocates a fast and reasoned approach to decision making by asking readers to think about the impact their decisions will have in 10 minutes, 10 months and 10 years.
I think gut is no way to live your life.
So I say, listen to your gut.
Welch: It is a shortcut to wisdom.
Because people will make a great 10-10-10 decision and then not have the courage to live it.
If your values hurt other people for your own financial advancement, a good 10-10-10 decision isn't going to undo that.

Welch: The great thing about the human condition, OK, is that life goes on.

Do you think she would agree with you [on 10-10-10]?
Sometimes gut is great, and sometimes gut is just easy.
