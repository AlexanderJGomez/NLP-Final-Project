"If you're trying to do commerce between Portland (Oregon) and Seattle, there is no way right now," said Bob Calkins, a spokesman for the Washington State Emergency Operations Center in Camp Murray, near Tacoma.
The rain also caused Amtrak to suspend service between Seattle and Portland until Saturday, "with no alternative transportation," the rail line said Thursday on its Web site.
The rainfall swept across virtually all of the state, but its biggest effects occurred along the western half of Puget Sound, Calkins said.
Only 260 of them sought shelter Wednesday night at the 39 shelters for people, Calkins said.
"It just drizzles every day, or so it seems, whereas in Miami, when it rains, it's a bellywasher," Calkins said.
