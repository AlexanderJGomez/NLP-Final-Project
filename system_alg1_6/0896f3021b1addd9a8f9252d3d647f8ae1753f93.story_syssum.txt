The head of world football told CNN's Pedro Pinto there is no on-field racism in football and that any player who has been abused should simply shake hands with his opponent at the end of the match and move on.
Beckham, who plays in the United States for LA Galaxy, said something should be done, but he stopped short of saying Blatter should step down.
Soon after Blatter gave his interview to CNN on Wednesday, his position appeared to be undermined when the English Football Association charged Liverpool's Luis Suarez with racism toward a fellow player.
"Racism is a criminal offense in this country and anybody who is caught will face criminal sanctions," he told CNN.
The "Kick It Out" group, who campaign against racism in football, said Blatter's comments were worryingly out of touch.
In an exclusive interview with CNN, Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said racism was still prevalent in football, but the top tier in the English game was fighting hard to eradicate it.
There is no place for it in football, let alone in England, and we will strive to eradicate it."
Bose said that although great strides have been made in the fight against racism in football, there is still much work to do.
