(CNN) -- A reporter last week asked me if many people cared about the release of individual records from the 1940 Census.
Each image from the 1940 Census is a lined page called a population schedule, containing the records of up to 40 individuals.
Now the 1940 census records are available for free, and millions of people are accessing them.
The release of the 1940 Census records will allow them to shed a light on a United States very different from how we live now.
Because residents in 1940 answered census takers' questions, the records released last week will provide a glimpse of Navajo tribal lands on the eve of the uranium boom, which transformed the landscape.
Citing unprecedented movements of the population to areas with heavy concentrations of armaments manufacturing and responding to the administration's orders, the Census Bureau unveiled a 1941 plan to conduct an annual sample census.
Because Americans opened their doors to census takers in 1940 and the survey interviewers who followed them, the United States had the information President Franklin Roosevelt assured them was necessary "to guide us intelligently into the future."
