Beijing (CNN) -- Han Junqian doesn't go outside very often.
Han is blind, and his life is similar to the roughly 120,000 blind massage therapists in China today, according to a 2012 report by Changchun University.
When they are educated at all, blind people are shoved into segregated schools that are isolated from the rest of society.
"It's a kind of apartheid," said Hallett.
China's semi-official organ for dealing with blindness is the China Association of the Blind, and they are forthright about the scale of the problem that blind Chinese face.
"It's not fair that blind people have so few opportunities," said an official from the association who requested anonymity.
"I have forgotten everything."
