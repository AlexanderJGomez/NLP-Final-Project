Today, the services built on top of that network have done a great job in enabling communications, perhaps none more dramatically than Twitter.
Not at all.
And wasn't that the promise of the Web in the first place?
But the Web is bigger than any one site or any one social network.
We'll naturally make great use of Twitter and Facebook and all the other services, but it'd be unforgivable to pick only one of them as a platform for civic engagement.
Now the challenge is reminding all of the social institutions, media organizations and government agencies that they need to use their own communications infrastructure just as much as they participate in services such as Twitter and Facebook.
This is, after all, how the Web was designed to work.
Because we'll have a web of independent but connected communications systems, just as the Internet was always designed to be.
