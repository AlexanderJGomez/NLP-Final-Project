But it happened in America.
It's no coincidence that Facebook, like Google, Apple, Twitter and Intel, started in the United States.
And the structure of support for those who have great ideas is still in place.
But America's "soft power" lives on.
Zuckerberg's ancestors, as well as those of Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, were Jewish immigrants.
Americans may be rolling out one great idea after another, but other countries are getting many of the jobs that come from its inventions.
In the United States, people can make monumental fortunes when they have good ideas.
Zuckerberg could have sold out years ago and lived a life of luxury.
And congratulations to America for creating a place where people's ideas can become reality.
And remember, others countries are also learning from America's success.
