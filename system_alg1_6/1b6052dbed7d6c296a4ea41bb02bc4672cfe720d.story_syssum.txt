Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court ruled for drug manufacturers Tuesday, deciding that a case brought by a Pennsylvania family who says their child was injured by a vaccine cannot be heard outside of a court created to hear such claims.
At issue was whether such liability claims can proceed in separate state courts, if the vaccine-related injuries could have been "avoided" by better product design and if federal officials had approved another, allegedly safer drug.
The "vaccine court" rejected the initial claim, so the family tried to revive the lawsuit in separate state and federal courts.
A federal appeals court eventually ruled for Wyeth, now owned by Pfizer Inc., concluding all design-defect claims were barred under the statute.
Kagan, now a Supreme Court justice, sat out of the case to avoid a conflict of interest in the eventual ruling.
The Georgia Supreme Court in 2009 became the first appeals court in the United States to allow families to sue outside the special vaccine court.
That case involved Atlanta-area parents who claimed their son, Stefan Ferrari, suffered severe neurological damage 12 years ago from booster shots by Wyeth and GlaxoSmithKline that contained the mercury-based preservative thimerosal.
The current high court case is Bruesewitz v. Wyeth (09-152).
