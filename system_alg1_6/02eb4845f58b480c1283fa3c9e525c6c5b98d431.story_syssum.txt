Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- A South Korean court has issued an arrest warrant for the brother of President Lee Myung-bak on bribery charges, a court official said Wednesday, dealing a blow to the governing party ahead of elections later this year.
The president's brother said he was sorry as he was taken to the detention center but did not comment further, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported.
Lee Sang-deuk's arrest came after the announcement by Park Geun-hye, the daughter of former President Park Chung-hee, that she would be running for president this year.
Her mother was shot and killed in 1974 by a Japanese-born Korean who had close ties to North Korea.
