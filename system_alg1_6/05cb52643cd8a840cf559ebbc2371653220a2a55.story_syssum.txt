"I wanted to prove that I was whole, and one of the ways to do that was to learn to surf," Cummings said.
Do you know a hero?
Cummings co-founded AmpSurf with his prosthetist and two other amputees, including Rodney Roller, the man who taught Cummings how to surf.
But the clinics aren't just about surfing, Cummings said.
Doctors told Davis he had a 99 percent chance of never walking again and a 60 percent chance he'd never get out of his wheelchair.
"Surfing makes me feel like I'm flying," Davis said.
More than 300 people have taken part in AmpSurf clinics, including Brian Ruhe, 35, who lost both legs above the knee when he was 18.
For Cummings, AmpSurf will always be about more than just surfing; it's about happiness, not just for the participants, but for him and his volunteers.
