Washington (CNN) -- Rep. Charlie Rangel temporarily stepped down as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday, a decision forced by a growing storm of ethics controversies threatening the longtime congressman.
Rangel was formally admonished Friday by the House ethics committee for violating rules on receiving gifts.
House Republicans plan to introduce a resolution Wednesday calling on Rangel to permanently step down and again force House Democrats to go on record defending him.
Rangel is a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, which has 42 members in the House.
