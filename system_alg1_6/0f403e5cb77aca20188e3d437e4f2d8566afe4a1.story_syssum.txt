They are both necessary for the construction of The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), intended as the successor to the Hubble instrument that has been operating in space for 25 years.
Hubble is about the size of a school bus but JWST is as big as a tennis court.
NASA says that to see these objects the telescope will have to detect objects which are 10 to 100 times fainter than Hubble can currently see.
Scientists hope the telescope will be able to tell us more about objects that formed 13 billion years ago -- about 700-800 million years after the Big Bang.
