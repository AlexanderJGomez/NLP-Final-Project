The ousted President was convicted on charges of violence and inciting violence and sentenced to 20 years in prison for the torture of protesters outside the presidential palace in December 2012.
"Coup leaders have sentenced Mohamed Morsi to decades in prison for nothing more than championing the democratic will of the people."
It's not about Morsy only, but it also applies to (former Egyptian President Hosni) Mubarak and others.
We wish we could see the trial of a regime when it is in power, not after that."
At various points in the trial, Morsy said that he was still the President of Egypt and refused to recognize the court as legal.
Early in the trial, Morsy and his co-defendants were held in a metal cage in court.
In May, Morsy is scheduled to start a fifth trial -- this one on charges of insulting the judiciary.
