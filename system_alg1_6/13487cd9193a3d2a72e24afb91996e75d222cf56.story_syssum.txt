London (CNN) -- Britain has closed its embassy in Iran and evacuated all its staff from that country following the attack on the embassy compound in Tehran Tuesday, British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Wednesday.
British citizens still in Iran will be supported by other EU missions there, he said.
Protesters who raided the British Embassy and the other British compound were demanding that the British ambassador be sent home immediately.
Ireland's Foreign Office urged Iran to reconsider its decision to expel the British ambassador to Tehran and said it should bring those responsible for the embassy incursion to justice.
"The gathering of the Iranian people in front of the British embassy was a reflection of the nation's public opinion caused by British actions," he said, according to the website.
The ministry said it would "take action through legal channels" against those who stormed the embassy building.
Iranian security forces are responsible for guarding the embassy under international law, he said.
