When buying beef, we tend to stick to what we know, which may be why almost 60 percent of our beef dollars go for ground beef.
More than 90 percent of the beef we buy originates in America, while most of the rest is Canadian bred.
• Grain-finished: Nearly 75 percent of U.S. beef comes from cattle fattened on grain (usually corn) for three to six months in feedlots.
• Grass-finished: Grass- or pasture-finished beef comes from cattle that forage on grasses and legumes.
About 90 percent of American beef is sold as large vacuum-packed cuts.
• Processing and packaging: Until the 1960s butcher shops bought beef as half- or quarter-carcasses.
• Fat content: The USDA defines "lean beef" as having less than 10 grams (g) of total fat, 4.5g or less of saturated fat, and less than 95 milligrams of cholesterol per 3½-ounce serving (100g) of cooked beef.
In general, the redder the meat, the more iron it contains (beef liver has the most).
• Inspection and grading: USDA inspectors examine all live animals and beef shipped out of state, which encompasses most of today's supermarket beef.
• Natural and Organic: Beef labeled "natural" must not contain any artificial ingredients and cannot be more than minimally processed, such as ground beef.
• Buy lean cuts.
Beef that has been presliced into steaks or made into patties costs more than less processed meat.
