Her brother, Jim Wolf, suffers from depression, alcoholism, unresolved grief and chronic homelessness, she says.
Thomas says Wolf has started on that path before.
Thomas says Wolf trained to deploy with an infantry unit but never deployed.
Neither Thomas nor Bliss seemed surprised or anxious when Wolf was arrested shortly after the video was released.
She knows he is not the same big brother who was there for her growing up.
Wolf was recently interviewed for a spot at a long-term residential treatment facility and received a complete physical, Thomas said.
She also admits that perhaps the video did not give Wolf the "glimpse into the future" that others had hoped.
I think he's hopeless.
"I may have almost lost hope, but I will never give up."
