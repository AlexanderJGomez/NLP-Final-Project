(CNN) -- Now that they've gotten a peek at it, publishers of books, newspapers and magazines are hoping Apple's forthcoming iPad tablet device will breathe new life into their struggling industry.
Chubb and others are hoping that the Apple's iBookstore and other pay-based models for the iPad will do for the print-media industry what iTunes did for the music industry.
"Nobody would have believed we would pay to download music the way we do now," Chubb said.
"I think [Steve Jobs] will be remembered as the digital Gutenberg," said Bruno Ruffilli, a writer at La Stampa newspaper in Italy.
One tech writer at Apple's iPad unveiling Wednesday worried that because the iPad also functions like a computer, reading on the device may be difficult.
And The New Yorker is the most popular magazine download on the Kindle, she said.
"We are pleased to be part of the launch of this exciting new product and we look forward to further discussions with Apple," said Janet Robinson, president of The New York Times Company and Martin Nisenholtz, senior vice president of digital operations, in a joint statement.
Conde Nast also must figure out how to market the iPad's digital versions of its magazines, she said.
