If a new president comes to the White House -- if Romney and Ryan win -- will America find itself once again at war?
A look at how Romney and Ryan would respond to the challenges facing America is as revealing as it is stunning.
Obama has since learned his lesson about being shy in praising America.
Ryan, who has no foreign policy experience and has spoken little of it, outlined the dilemma facing the U.S. when he spoke about the Arab uprisings.
On Iran, arguably the most important foreign policy question and conceivably a new war front for America, both Romney and Obama have stated that Iran must not be allowed to develop nuclear weapons.
And despite criticism of Obama's approach to Israel, Romney agrees with Obama that Israel is a key ally whose security is one of the non-negotiable aspects of U.S. foreign policy.
To be sure, rhetoric and images matter a lot.
But overall, America's foreign policy choices, based on national interest, national values, strategic considerations and popular opinion, will not significantly change regardless of whether Obama or Romney wins the presidential election.
