More than just a daily habit, Facebook has become the place where I get important, often surprising glimpses into the lives of the 1,365 people with whom I've chosen to connect.
But, in large part, the people who say they're leaving Facebook don't.
Facebook just is.
Facebook has won the social-media wars because it's where all the people are.
That's what Facebook wants, of course.
When Facebook recently bought photo-sharing app Instagram for $1 billion, Instagram users vowed to quit, complaining that their precious little network had sold out to a monolithic company.
Once Facebook has shareholders to answer to, things may change.
Perhaps a mobile app that accesses the social network's huge population, something Facebook-adjacent that takes what people like about Facebook and turns it into something more nimble and attractive than Facebook itself.
