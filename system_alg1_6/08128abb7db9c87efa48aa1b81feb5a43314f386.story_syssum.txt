Andrew, still fifth in line to the British throne and Queen Elizabeth II's second son, carefully and wisely avoided mentioning the name Virginia Roberts (Jane Doe 3 in filed U.S. court papers) -- the woman at the center of the sordid claims.
Since his association with convicted sex offender financier Epstein forced the Duke to accept a downgrading of his role as a UK trade envoy in 2011, he has been busy trying to carve out a new role for himself.
His work focuses on supporting entrepreneurs.
In 2014 the Duke launched Pitch@Palace, and held two competitive pitch events at St James's Palace, worked with 76 entrepreneurs from across the UK.
Essentially, his new role is all about assisting the economic success of, and the creation of skilled jobs in, the UK.
He has also been key in showcasing the work of the UK Technology Industry and Innovators.
Why?
The only way, perhaps, Andrew can hope to move on is by giving a detailed rebuttal of all the allegations that have been made against him in a sworn affidavit.
