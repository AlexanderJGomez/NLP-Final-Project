(CNN) -- Chelsea have completed the signing of England international defender Gary Cahill from Premier League rivals Bolton Wanderers for a fee of $10.7m.
Ironically big-spending PSG now seem the only realistic challengers for Tevez, who has fallen out of favor at City after refusing to come off the substitutes' bench during the 3-1 Champions League defeat at Bayern Munich earlier in the season.
In other transfer news, Barcelona have announced that French defender Eric Abidal has signed a new deal with the club.
Abidal has made 177 appearances in four years with Barca, winning the Champions League twice and the Spanish La Liga three times.
