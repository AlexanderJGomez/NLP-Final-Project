The same jury that convicted Carla Hughes of two counts of murder Tuesday for the death of Avis Banks spared her life, declining to impose the death penalty.
"She took Avis Banks' life and the life of her unborn child because she wanted that life," the prosecutor said.
"I'm not asking you, I'm pleading with you, to spare my daughter's life," said Hughes, who is also a teacher.
Prosecutors alleged the murder weapons connected Hughes to the crime.
... She was met by a stone-cold killer," he said.
