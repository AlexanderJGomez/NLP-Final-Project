Africa is now the fastest growing continent in the world, according a recent report from the African Development Bank.
"It's easy to talk about giving back but when the opportunity presents itself -- such as IBM Research Africa that allows you to create innovations in science and technology to begin to make a proper impact in the lives of more than a billion people -- I don't know what more can stop anybody," says Stewart.
Stewart went on to work in IBM's Services Innovation Lab -- an international program where he was responsible for the technical strategy at eight global facilities.
"All innovators in the continent of Africa should be problem centric," he says.
Stewart says tech entrepreneurs need to be cautious about starting businesses without any commercial foresight.
After more than two decades abroad, Stewart is committed to reverse the continent's so-called "brain drain," the exodus of brilliant minds relocating to countries outside Africa.
