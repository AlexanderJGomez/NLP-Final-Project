Earlier in the day Laura Trott added to the gold she won in the women's team pursuit with triumph in the omnium event, but home crowd favorite Victoria Pendleton was beaten to gold by Australian Anna Meares in the individual sprint.
I saw everyone stepping up to the plate and thankfully it worked out for me too.
In the women's individual sprint final Meares gained revenge for defeat in the same event four years ago, as Pendleton had to settle for silver in her last race before retiring.
It denied Pendleton a fairytale ending to a career in which she won two gold medals, including the women's keirin at the London Games.
I would have loved to have won on my final race but I'm so glad it's all done and I can move on," she said.
She set a new Olympic record in the the 500m time trial event to beat American Sarah Hammer and add to the gold she won in the women's team pursuit.
