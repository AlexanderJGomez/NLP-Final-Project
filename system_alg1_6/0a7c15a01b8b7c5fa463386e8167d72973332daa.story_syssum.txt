Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Doctors completed an autopsy of Moammar Gadhafi on Sunday, with the chief pathologist confirming the former Libyan leader died of a gunshot wound to the head.
Leaders of Libya's interim government have said Gadhafi was killed in crossfire after fighters captured him Thursday.
He said crowds beat Gadhafi in what was a "humiliating end" for the former dictator.
Mahmoud Jibril, chairman of the NTC's executive board, has said Gadhafi's right arm was wounded when a gunbattle erupted between the fighters and Gadhafi loyalists as his captors attempted to load him into a vehicle.
More shooting erupted as the vehicle drove away, and Gadhafi was shot in the head, dying moments before arriving at a hospital in Misrata, Jibril said, citing the city's coroner.
"We believe there is a need for an investigation and more details are needed to ascertain whether he was killed in the fighting or after his capture.
