Bowe Bergdahl.
Bowe Bergdahl has been gone far too long, and we continue to call for and work toward his safe and immediate release," a Pentagon spokesman said.
The U.S. government acknowledged in May 2012 that it was engaged in talks with the Taliban to free Bergdahl.
The discussions moved in fits and starts because of U.S. concerns that any Taliban prisoners swapped for Bergdahl might be repatriated and allowed to rejoin the fight.
