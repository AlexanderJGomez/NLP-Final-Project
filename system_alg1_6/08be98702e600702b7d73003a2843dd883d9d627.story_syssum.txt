As a modern royal couple in a modern royal family, William and Kate will start their married life in the most ancient of royal buildings, stepping into the future with one foot firmly in the past and an obliging nod to those kings and queens buried there.
Since then, Westminster Abbey has ruled supreme as the ultimate royal venue.
Neither Kate nor William is making any radical concession to the modern world or demanding any changes in their royal duties.
William and Kate are now the golden couple of a very modern monarchy, and it is predominantly because of the influence of his parents (and some help from the queen) that Britain's future king has embraced this position with such maturity.
The marriage of William and Kate at Westminster Abbey will be just the tonic a jaded Great Britain needs.
