A day earlier, suspected drone strikes targeted al Qaeda fighters in Yemen for the second time in two days, killing "at least a dozen," the government official said.
"These strikes destroyed the training facility completely and killed both Yemeni and foreign members," it said.
Al Qaeda operatives had fled to the area after a 2012 push by government troops, backed by the United States, he said.
"Yemenis are smart enough to doubt initial reports of this type," he added.
Strikes on suspected al Qaeda figures resumed in 2009, with more than 100 reported since then, according to the New America Foundation, a U.S.-based think tank that tracks the raids.
