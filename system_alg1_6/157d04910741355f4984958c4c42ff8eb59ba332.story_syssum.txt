"Under the Clean Air Act these standards will require American power plants to put in place proven and widely available pollution technologies to control and cut harmful emissions like mercury, arsenic, chromium, nickel and acid gases," Jackson said.
The Power Plant Mercury and Air Toxics Standards are expected to have broad health benefits, according to the EPA.
Jackson emphasized these new measures would come at a financial cost for utility companies but said it would level the playing field for utility companies once they are all operating from the same clean air standard.
Consumers will see a bump in their bills while utility companies put the new technology in place, she said.
