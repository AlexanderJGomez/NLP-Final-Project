A new Facebook system will use your activity on other websites to send you what Facebook thinks are ads about your current interests.
The site announced the new system, called Facebook Exchange, to marketers last week.

According to reports, Facebook paid $10 million to charity after five users claimed the site broke California law when it used their posts in the feature without paying them.
