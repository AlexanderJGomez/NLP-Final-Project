(CNN) -- The University of North Dakota is one step closer to retiring its nickname and mascot, but changing the school's 90-year-old Native American moniker -- the Fighting Sioux -- has not been without complications.
"It's our understanding coming out of this meeting that the Fighting Sioux nickname and logo will be dropped," the NCAA quoted its Vice President for Communications Bob Williams as saying Friday.
Citing the conference's "close, close ties to Native American tribes" and the promise of boycotts from other Division I schools if the name goes unchanged, he says the school's membership in the conference "could be in jeopardy."
Such schools as Stanford University and New York's St. John's University, elected to drop their nicknames (the Stanford Indians became the Cardinals in 1972, then the Cardinal in 1981; the St. John's Red Men became the Red Storm in the mid-'90s), while others, like the University of North Dakota, balked.
Others, like the Bradley University Braves, whose name does not affiliate with a specific tribe, were allowed to keep their name so long as Native American logos and imagery were eschewed.
But the Fighting Sioux of the University of North Dakota -- winners of seven national championships in men's ice hockey -- was denied such an endorsement from the Tribal Council of the Standing Rock Sioux.
