While I felt more aggressive than other girls, I didn't think that anything other than male and female could exist.
Thus, no one ever told me there was anything wrong with my body (that didn't happen until a gynecological visit when I was twenty), and I grew up loving it just the way it is.
I still do.
I didn't think being intersex was a bad thing to be.
Intersex folks are not some new invention that people need to be "ready for:" we exist and always have.
I look forward to one day telling my god-daughter about how it used to be for us, and to hearing her say, "Wow, I can't believe some people had problems accepting intersex.
Humans can be so weird."
