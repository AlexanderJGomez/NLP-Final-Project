(CNN)  -- The search continued Tuesday for as many as 67 people missing after a boat carrying about 200 Haitians capsized, the U.S. Coast Guard said.
The Coast Guard is contributing one boat, the 210-foot cutter Valiant, and three aircraft to the search, Johnson said.
Turks and Caicos authorities are using small boats in the search, she said.
Overloaded vessels can quickly lose stability and capsize, sending migrants into the water, a Coast Guard release said.
