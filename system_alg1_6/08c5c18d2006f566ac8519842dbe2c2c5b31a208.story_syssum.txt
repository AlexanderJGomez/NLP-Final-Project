Berlin (CNN) -- The outbreak of E. coli in Germany has killed several more people and sickened hundreds, authorities said Tuesday.
A woman died after visiting Germany, the Swedish Ministry for Health and Social Affairs said.
Sweden's health ministry said there have been 39 confirmed cases of people sickened by E. coli in Sweden, 16 of which are being investigated for complications caused by HUS.
But the source has not yet been pinpointed, authorities said.
The Fepex officials argue that German authorities have accused the Spanish cucumber of being the source of the outbreak, without proof.
A Spanish health ministry spokesman told CNN that Spanish authorities are investigating the outbreak.
The Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition said two Spanish companies producing cucumbers may be involved in the outbreak.
