Thanks to Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman, eagle-eyed visitors to London might just spot the three humps of an enormous hippo appearing from the Thames' murky depths.
"I was thinking about the history, but I also had to think about practicalities," Hofman says.
I have a love for these objects and the way they get circulated around the world."
"The bunny was removed after three months but afterward, more people started to visit the spot.
"I love the people.
"In Europe, people work hard but they have more spare time and there's a different pace.
Hofman says "HippopoThames" will be his final water-based project.
