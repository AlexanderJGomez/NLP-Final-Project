A report released Thursday alleges that Angelyn Donald, principal at PS 386, was told by a number of students about note passing and even kissing between their 10-year-old classmate and her 40-year-old special education teacher, Anthony Criscuolo.
Donald has been at PS 386 since November 2011 and the principal there since June 2012, according to David Pena, deputy press secretary for the New York City Department of Education.
Criscuolo, who taught 5th grade special education, was immediately reassigned away from the school and any students, Connie Pankratz, a spokeswoman for the Department of Education, told CNN.
Criscuolo began working in the New York City school system in 2002 as a substitute teacher in the Bronx.
