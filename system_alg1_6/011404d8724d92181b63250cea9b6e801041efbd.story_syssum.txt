While President Obama has reignited a national conversation over rising college costs with his new proposals, those suggestions are unlikely to dramatically lower costs soon.
A less cost-saving variant of the three-year plan would keep the degree at its traditional 120 semester hour length, but have students go to school year-round for three years.
Second, make it possible for students to use MOOCs (massively open online courses) and other low-cost, online options, allowing for lower cost "blended" degrees combining perhaps two years of traditional classroom experience with an equal amount of online training.
Students need to be examined on the online material, with safeguards assuring the registered student is actually being tested.
Third, offer a traditional residential degree for 40% less by dramatically reducing labor and capital costs.
Do we really need courses on "Lady Gaga and the Sociology of Fame" taught to students who are clueless about  Beethoven, Shakespeare and van Gogh?
Fourth, create a National College Equivalence Test similar to the high school GED.
Fifth, get the federal government out of the student financial aid business.
Ending these inefficient federal programs would save tens of billions annually.
