In the third serious airline legroom incident in two weeks, an angry passenger caused yet another flight to divert Monday night.
Local law enforcement removed the passenger and the flight continued to West Palm Beach, Delta said.
Paris resident Edmund Alexandre, 60, was charged in U.S. federal court August 28 with interfering with an airline flight crew.
It seems at least one of the passengers was not completely satisfied with the extra space in the Economy Plus section where they were seated, which provides United passengers up to 5 inches of extra legroom compared with standard coach seats.
"To react in such a way that the crew feels the need to divert a flight to have a passenger removed is a really big deal."
