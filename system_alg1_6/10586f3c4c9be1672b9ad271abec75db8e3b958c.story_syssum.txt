WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama has accepted the resignation of Louis Caldera, the director of the White House Military Office responsible for the controversial low-altitude flyover of New York by a 747 plane used as Air Force One, the White House said Friday.
"I have concluded that the controversy surrounding the Presidential Airlift Group's aerial photo shoot over New York City has made it impossible for me to effectively lead the White House Military Office," Caldera said in a letter to Obama.
The flyover, officials said, was a training mission -- it was also a government-sanctioned photo shoot.
As it nears, they begin to run.
Anna Carpenter, local law enforcement agencies and the FAA had been notified of the exercise.
