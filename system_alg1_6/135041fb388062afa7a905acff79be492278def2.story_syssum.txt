Hong Kong (CNN) -- Eight Chinese officials have been fired or suspended after five boys died in a rubbish bin after suffocating on fumes from charcoal they burned to stay warm, according to state-run media.
One user on Sina Weibo, China's version of Twitter, wrote: "China is supposedly an intermediate developed country but still can't protect its own children.
The other father, Tao Jinyou, a poor man who was said to work long hours tending fields, told Xinhua that he and his wife paid little attention to their own son, let alone their nephews.
Persistent truants, the boys were said to have been missing for three weeks before they were found dead.
It's estimated there are 55 million "left behind" children in China, the sons and daughters of 200 million migrant workers who have moved to the cities for a better life.
A local resident told CCTV that neighbors had noticed the boys wandering the streets.
This would enable them to have their children live with them," it said.
"Hope they won't feel cold anymore in heaven," @Qingyu_aneya said.
