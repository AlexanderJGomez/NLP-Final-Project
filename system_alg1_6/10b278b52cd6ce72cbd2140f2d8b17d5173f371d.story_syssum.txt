Ashley and Tyson Gardner tried unsuccessfully for years to get pregnant.
Ashley Gardner: We tried EVERYTHING under the sun.
It was getting hard getting asked ALL THE TIME why I didn't have children yet.
We just announced on our private pages to our friends and family and the picture was so priceless that everyone started sharing it and we started getting hundreds of friend requests from people we didn't know.
My husband is the oldest of 10 children so he is ready to take on anything!
They love him.
After eight long, heartbreaking years of infertility and every month passing by with a negative pregnancy test you do get discouraged!
Gardner: Only thing I can think of is what I stated above.
