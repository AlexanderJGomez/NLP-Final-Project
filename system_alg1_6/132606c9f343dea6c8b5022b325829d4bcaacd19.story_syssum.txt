The anglerfish female is spiny, ugly, and so much bigger than the male that most humans don't even see him: the tiny little glob attached to the lady anglerfish by his teeth.
It may be that people are finally getting the idea.
For the rest of us, we realize more every day that each branch and twig of love that can be put to use to support our families, whether sprawling and far-flung or tiny and barely afloat, is necessary.
And even if people didn't think that (I'm pretty sure they were admiring the handsome groom and beautiful bride and not the two nutty ladies chuckling in the corner), it was gratifying that in addition to this payoff for decency, there was even the glint of genuine affection.
My love for my children means that I have to love their father, too.
This seems like a good thing, for all of us.
Our capacity to love is not limited; time is a constraint and so is energy, but love that makes your life better gives you more of what you need.
