Attorney Michael Wright said his legal team filed a federal civil lawsuit against two police officers; Beavercreek's police chief; the city of Beavercreek and its Police Department; and Walmart.
"We believe that had Mr. Crawford been white, he may have gotten a little bit more time to respond to the police officers," he said.
Walmart spokesman Brian Nick expressed condolences to Crawford's family and to relatives of a mother who fled the scene of the police shooting with her daughter, had a heart attack and later died.
In September, an Ohio grand jury decided not to indict the police officers.
When the two officers located Crawford, "he was talking on a cell phone held in his right hand, with no other customers in his vicinity, and with his left side and back visible to the two police officers.
The family alleges, among other things, that the police officers did not use due diligence to determine that Wright wasn't a threat; that the officers didn't give him enough time to put down the weapon; and that Walmart was negligent because the air rifle had been resting on a shelf, unpackaged and unsecured, for at least two days, the family's lawyers said Tuesday.
