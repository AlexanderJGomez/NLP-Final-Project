Beijing (CNN) -- Demonstrators braved a heavy police presence and the threat of arrest by massing Thursday in the streets of Kunming, China, to protest the planned construction of a chemical plant, they said.
"Every Kunming person cares about this issue," said another Kunming native, a 50-year-old man who said rows of police thwarted his efforts to reach the heart of the protest.
The provincial general manager of China National Petroleum Corp. has said the refinery will not use the chemical.
As part of the interrogation, she said, police took her to the print shop where she had made copies of her fliers.
"Kunming is a beautiful city, where we have cleaner air than any other cities in this country," Young said.

Pollution and dust generated in China have been found as far away as California.
The government has made explicit its intention to weigh environmental regulation against the cost to the economy.
