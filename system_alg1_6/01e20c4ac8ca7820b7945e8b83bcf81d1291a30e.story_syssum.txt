"It's a website that's republished the feeds from many thousands of unsecured web cams and CCTV cameras.
"In theory, if you have a web camera and it is interface accessible over the internet, it could be at risk," Paterson says.
Polonetsky says it's valuable to teach the lesson that web cameras need to be secured but says there have to be better ways than publishing people's feeds online.
While the ICO doesn't know the Russian website owner's intentions, Paterson says that as far as it can tell the feeds have not been archived -- though they don't know for certain.
"Actually, it's worse," he says.
Polonetsky says it is possible that sellers of devices without basic data protection would be considered unfair to consumers under the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's standards.
"If the feed from your camera can identify individuals that would be personal data and if someone's processing that in an unfair or unlawful manner then it could breach the act," he says.
