The Lower Ninth Ward Health Clinic was clinic director Patricia Berryhill's home before Hurricane Katrina.
The patient files in the cabinets behind her now number more than 1,300, and 95 percent of those who walk through the door have no health insurance.
A sign in the window making clear there are no narcotic drugs inside is a sign of the clinic's rough surroundings.
Overall, Tulane University geographer Richard Campanella says, the population of New Orleans stands at about 330,000 -- roughly 75 percent of its pre-Katrina level.
Campanella says median household income is up to $40,000 from $27,000 before Katrina, "and it is not because the city is doing better economically."
Craft-Kerney says a commitment to add a second school in the Lower Ninth, or enticements to bring in a supermarket or a major pharmacy, would help bring more people back, or attract new residents.
But Craft-Kerney says the clinic would not be in operation had it not been for the help of Mike Leavitt, the Bush secretary of health and human services.
Craft-Kerney will soon face the new administration.
I don't expect it overnight -- but he did say he would make good on President Bush's promise to make New Orleans whole again."
