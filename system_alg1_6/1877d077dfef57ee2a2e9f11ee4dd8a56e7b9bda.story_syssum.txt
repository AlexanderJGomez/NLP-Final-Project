Fenton and Devrieze are a part of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society's Team in Training program.
The program started 23 years ago when Bruce Cleland formed a group to run the New York City Marathon in honor of his daughter, a leukemia survivor.
Oh my god.
His mom, Barbara, is the matriarch of the Fenton family.
He's running 10 marathons (to celebrate her 10th anniversary of going into remission) in six months -- the time it took from diagnosis to remission.
People loved Harry Devrieze.
The Devrieze family was almost surprised by the intensity of the disease the second time around.
It was during this time that she went to her first Team in Training meeting and signed up for the Rock 'n' Roll marathon.
For a couple of weeks, Devrieze refused to run, clutching to the friends and family Harry had held so close.
Then she picked up her shoes and moved with the pain.
It's mind over body, and having a greater purpose ... makes the mind part work better."
