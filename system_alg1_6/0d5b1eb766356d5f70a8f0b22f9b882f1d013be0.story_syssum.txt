The fire that engulfed the Porsche carrying actor Paul Walker apparently did not erupt until a minute after the car clipped a light pole Saturday.
The autopsies were completed Tuesday, Los Angeles County Coroner Lt. Fred Corral said.
As investigators searched for more information about the accident that killed the popular "Fast & Furious" actor on Saturday, one of his co-stars dramatically addressed grieving fans.
Both Rodas and Walker were drivers for Rodas' Always Evolving racing team, according to the team's website.
The actor had told his father that he wanted to take a hiatus from acting to spend more time with his 15-year-old daughter, Meadow, the elder Walker said.
"I'm just ... glad that every time I saw him, I told him I loved him," the father said.
Richard Cohen told CNN that authorities received a tip Sunday suggesting that another car was at the scene racing the Porsche when it slammed into a light pole and burst into flames.
But speed was a factor in the crash, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office said.
Someone called it in and said it was a vehicle fire.
There was nothing.
Jim Torp, a car enthusiast who was at the charity event, said Walker was smiling as he got into the Porsche minutes earlier.
The couple apparently did not know who Walker was, King said.
"Walker called the manager over and said, 'Put that girl's ring on my tab,'" she said.
The box-office success of the surprise summer hit yielded numerous sequels.
Walker was in the middle of the seventh film in the "Fast & Furious" franchise.
"We don't know what they'll do here, or even if they'll just say, "It may be tasteless to proceed at all because we can't be showing Paul Walker in a speeding car, defying death in a movie that ended up being the way he died,'" O'Neil said.
