The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based activist group, said the Syrian fighter jet was targeting the countryside around the Syrian town of Quneitra, where the only border crossing between Israel and Syria is located.
Militants in the area are trying to dislodge Syrian government forces from their last two strongholds in the area, the group said.
