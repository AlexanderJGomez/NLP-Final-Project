Singer Michael Jackson struggled with insomnia, a nutritionist who worked for him told CNN.
Over the last two decades, doctors treating sleep disorders have prescribed more antidepressants than insomnia drugs, according to several published analyses.
But the Food and Drug Administration has not officially approved antidepressants for insomnia.
Insomnia drugs can produce deeper sleep levels for a longer period of time -- about eight to 12 hours, he said.
Sleep drugs work by slowing activity in the brain to allow sleep.
The use of antidepressants to battle insomnia could be influenced by cost, since generic antidepressants cost less than brand-name insomnia drugs, doctors said.
But not all sleep drugs are benzodiazepines.
"There are still a lot of doctors prescribing antidepressants and other sedating medicine for insomnia even though those medicines haven't been studied very well for treatment of insomnia and have some different types of risks," Walsh said.
Using anesthetics to get relief from sleep disorders is highly unusual and inappropriate, several doctors have told CNN.
Doctors say that if Jackson was being anesthetized to battle insomnia, it was a dangerous practice.
