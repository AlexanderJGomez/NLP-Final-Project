The Federal Trade Commission is urging mobile phone app developers and phone companies to make it easier for parents to control the personal information being collected by smartphone apps.
"Parents should be given the information they need to make informed decisions about whether to allow their children to use apps with these capabilities," the FTC report said.
The agency urged developers and marketers to work together and develop accurate privacy disclosures regarding what data is collected through apps used by kids.
