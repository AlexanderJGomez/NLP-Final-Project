PYONGYANG, North Korea (CNN) -- North Korea on Friday destroyed a water cooling tower at a facility where officials acknowledge they extracted plutonium to build nuclear weapons, CNN's Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour reported from the scene.
"This is a very significant disablement step," the U.S. envoy to North Korea, Sung Kim, said.

In response, Bush said he would lift some U.S. sanctions against North Korea and remove the country from the State Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism.
Media outlets from the five other nations involved in the talks were invited to view the tower's implosion, a rare move in North Korea.
