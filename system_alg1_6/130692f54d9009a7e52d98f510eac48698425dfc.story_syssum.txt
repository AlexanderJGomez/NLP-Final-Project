With fewer lawmakers voting, conservatives will need more Boehner opponents to force the vote to a second ballot.
While Boehner's allies have said they are confident a second vote won't happen, about a dozen Republicans have indicated publicly they will vote against Boehner.
"We're at over a dozen right now and you're going to see more people get on and decide not to vote for the current leadership," Yoho said Tuesday on CNN's New Day.
"It's either a vote for the status quo or for a new direction for the Republican Party."
