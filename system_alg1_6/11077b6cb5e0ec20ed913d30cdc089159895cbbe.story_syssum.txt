Ernst, a conservative favorite, is the first woman to represent the Hawkeye State in the Senate while Love is the House's first black female Republican.
But she has been a visible presence on the national stage since her win in November and during her first week in Washington.
In a recent op-ed for the Boston Globe, former New Hampshire Sen. John E. Sununu, a Republican, said that when it came to working with Cruz "the collective membership of the world's greatest deliberative body would rather stick needles in their eyes."
"She wasn't elected to become a political celebrity, she was elected to serve the people of Iowa," said Dave Kochel, an Iowa-based Republican strategist who advised Ernst during her Senate campaign.
While she acknowledged her historic win on election night, Love has also signaled that she will resist the efforts of others to define her by her race and gender.
"I think it's important to join and do what you can to make sure we are uniting Americans," Love told Fox host Greta Van Susteren Thursday.
But "she declined 99.9% of those interview requests," said Patti Solis-Doyle, a long time adviser to Clinton who was her chief of staff on her first Senate campaign.
Others who came to the Senate as big names like New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker are still struggling to find the right balance.
"They're both going to get an enormous amount of requests, not only for interviews, but also to travel and raise money for their respective parties and caucuses," Solis-Doyle said.
