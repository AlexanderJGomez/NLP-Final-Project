LONDON, England (CNN) -- Distinguished scientist Stephen Hawking was said to be in a "comfortable" condition Tuesday after spending the night in hospital, Cambridge University said in a statement.
ALS is usually fatal within a few years, but Hawking has lived with the disease since he was diagnosed in 1963.
On his Web site, Hawking has written about living with ALS.
She said about 350,000 people worldwide have the disease.
Hawking has guest-starred, as himself, on "Star Trek: The Next Generation" and "The Simpsons."
Hawking also predicted "great dangers" for the human race and said the species would have to look beyond the earth for its long-term survival.
If we can avoid disaster for the next two centuries, our species should be safe as we spread into space."
