A few days ago, it appeared that former "Cosby Show" cast mate Phylicia Rashad was condemning the women making the allegations.
"Forget these women," Showbiz 411 had quoted Rashad as saying.
Over the past several months, allegations have painted Cosby as a sexual predator, a serial rapist, a man who, over many decades, allegedly drugged and assaulted women, many of whom had viewed him as a mentor and guide.
He has not stood trial.
It's fairly easy for most of us to condemn Bill Cosby, because he is not a person we actually know.
Every year, literally countless men who engage in sexual violence against women do not face charges, for reasons as varied and familiar as those given by the women in the Cosby scandal.
Holding them accountable.
