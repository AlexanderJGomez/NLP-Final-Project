Solloo, whose real name is Solomon Njoroge, says Kenya cannot afford a return to post-election violence.
"This country cannot afford to go back to that time," says Solloo from the glass house, a few moments before going on air.
So far, Solloo says, thousands of young people have gathered outside the glass house to show their support and also take part in a host of election-related activities, including issuing of ID cards, a voter-registration program and democracy workshops.
"I just want everyone to understand that we need peace," he says.
