Bekaa Valley, Lebanon (CNN) -- In my nine years as a UNICEF ambassador, I've been to camps for people displaced by conflict.
Many of these refugees lived a middle-class life in Syria, where they had homes, jobs, electricity and plumbing.
Since January, the number of Syrian refugees in Lebanon has increased nearly six-fold.
Syrian children can enroll in public schools in Lebanon as long as there is space, but many schools are already at capacity.
UNICEF still needs $172 million this year to assist Syrian refugees across the region, which means programs to support these children are threatened.
They need our help to stay alive, to go to school and to be kids again.
