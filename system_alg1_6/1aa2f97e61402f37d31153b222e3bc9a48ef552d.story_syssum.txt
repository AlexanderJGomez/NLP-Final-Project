But right now, I am struggling and I thought a little bit of crowd sourcing with the highly intelligent men -- and especially the women -- who visit CNN.com might help.
I would be lying -- something I am not prone to do whatever the haters may say -- if I said I was not seriously chuffed about this.
At every single one of the nine or so events I have so far done about the book, and in several of the many interviews, I have been asked -- usually but not always by a woman -- a version of this same question: "Do men and women win in different ways?"
As Grace said afterwards -- well to be honest she heckled me at the time with the words "shut up Dad, this is embarrassing," -- I was answering a question I had not been asked, namely "why aren't there more women in the book?'
She said it was still a man's world and women had essentially to do twice as many jobs as men.
At my next event, a Labour fundraiser, thankfully neither Fiona nor Grace could make it.
You can't win, said I.
And the next time I sit down with CNN's woman winners, Christiane or Becky, I need to have a better answer than the ones I have been deploying thus far.
