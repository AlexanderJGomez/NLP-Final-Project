The first cases of H1N1, also called swine flu, were confirmed in Mexico in April.
Within days, the government closed all schools and most public venues.
In the United States, federal officials released new guidelines this month for containing the spread of the virus across the nation's school system.
The revised federal guidelines advise parents to keep children infected with the H1N1 virus out of school for 24 hours after the fever has gone away.
