Florence, Italy (CNN) -- Amanda Knox vowed Friday to fight her conviction for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher "until the very end" and said she "will never go willingly" back to Italy.
"It was terrible news," he said.
And with a great deal of family support, they're going to go forward and appeal what we would characterize as a completely unjust conviction," Simon said.
Sollecito, who is not allowed to leave Italy while the legal process continues, was halted in the northern Italian town of Udine, police said.
Prosecutors said the couple killed Kercher, a British student, in November 2007.
Her sister, Stephanie Kercher, said the family might never know exactly what happened on the night of her death.
Stephanie Kercher said that she had been told of a letter written by Knox to the Kercher family but that she had not seen it.
Knox, who remained at home in Seattle, Washington, while the retrial was held, said in a written statement Thursday that her conviction would bring no consolation to the Kercher family.
