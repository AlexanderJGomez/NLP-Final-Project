In addition to Kentucky, more moderate candidates won in Republican Senate primaries in Georgia and Oregon and in a House showdown in Idaho.
If the GOP flips six Democratic held seats, they will win control of the Senate and McConnell will get a promotion from minority leader to majority leader.
Oregon: Sen. Jeff Merkley easily won the Democratic primary, and pediatric neurosurgeon Monica Wehby is the projected winner of the GOP Senate primary, topping a more conservative rival.
Soon after the race in Kentucky was called for McConnell, two of the groups backing Bevin -- the Senate Conservatives Fund and the Madison Project -- closed ranks behind the Senate minority leader.
Speaking to supporters who held up signs that read "Obama needs Alison Grimes" and "Kentucky needs Mitch McConnell," McConnell previewed his primary election theme: tying his opponent to President Obama, who lost Kentucky big in 2012 and is highly unpopular there now.
When all's said and done, the race could become the most expensive Senate campaign in history, breaking the $82 million record set in the 2012 Senate battle in Massachusetts.
