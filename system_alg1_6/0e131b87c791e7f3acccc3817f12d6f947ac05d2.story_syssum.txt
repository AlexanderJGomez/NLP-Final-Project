(CNN) -- Two-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks played a role in the surprise ending of a domestic assault case in Los Angeles, according to defense attorney Andrew Flier.
Flier said he was initially concerned that having a Hollywood star on the jury would unfairly influence the case's outcome.
He welcomed anybody," Flier said.
If the case hadn't ended in a plea, Flier said he doesn't know how Hanks would have voted.
