The suicide victim, Michael Edward Pickels, 32, had attended the concert with a friend, Sung said.
Pickels had bound his girlfriend, aimed a loaded gun at her, and said he was going to kill them both, according to Sung.
Pickels' death was ruled a suicide by Santa Clara County's coroner Friday, Sung said.
"We wish to continue to be sensitive to family and friends of this individual and hope that in performing it is not viewed as a selfish act," the message continues.
