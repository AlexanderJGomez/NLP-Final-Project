The Yankee clubhouse in 1962 was like a large subterranean living room.
"Your locker is right here by the door," said Pete.

My big chance came on May 7, 1962, in the second game of a double-header against the Washington Senators, in front of a real crowd that included my Mom and Dad, my brothers and a whole bunch of neighbors from New Jersey.
After the game Houk said to me, "any more shutouts like that and we're going to need a new bullpen."
This is my favorite memory of Yankee Stadium.
That's the year I kept a diary that became Ball Four -- a book that also mentioned Mantle hitting a home run with a hangover -- which got me banned from Old Timers Day at Yankee Stadium for 28 years.
Inside, the grayish green carpet was now bright blue and featured a giant Yankee logo.
Bulldoze the field where Mantle roamed and level the mound where Larsen pitched the only perfect World Series game.
