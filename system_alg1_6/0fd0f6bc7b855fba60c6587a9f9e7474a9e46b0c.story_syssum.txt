The confirmed death toll reached four when Boulder County officials recovered the body of a woman who had been swept away after getting out of her vehicle Thursday, Sheriff Joe Pelle said.
On Friday, National Guard troops using "high-profile" trucks to wade through water were evacuating the entire Boulder County town of Lyons, which had been cut off since the flooding began Wednesday night.
She said, "I just felt like I was trapped.
Four helicopters were being used for rescues in Boulder County Friday, Pelle said.
Some people remain stranded in homes there, he said, adding, "How we're going to get them out -- it's going to take a damn long time."
John Hickenlooper said.
KMGH reporter Theresa Marchetta said evacuees also described homes dangling off cliffs.
Some people in Lyons still were awaiting rescue, evacuees said, and some residents had chosen to stay.
Both were saved after traveling two blocks in the water, police said on Twitter.
"This is not going to get fixed in a week," he said.
