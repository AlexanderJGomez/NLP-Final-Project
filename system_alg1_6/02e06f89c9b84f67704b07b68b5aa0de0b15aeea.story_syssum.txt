Tsipras has vowed to end austerity measures and renegotiate the terms of Greece's European Union bailout.
Syriza's message is one that has also resonated in other southern European countries under the restrictions of international bailouts.
European Central Bank Executive Board member Benoît Cœuré told CNN on Monday that Greece  would still have to pay its debt.
Greece has made remarkable progress in recent years, and we stand ready to continue to assist Greece in addressing the remaining reform challenges," he said.
"Our victory is, at the same time, it's a victory for all the people of Europe that are fighting against austerity that's ruining the common European future," he said.
But it's unclear how Syriza's plans to renegotiate the bailout would play out.
