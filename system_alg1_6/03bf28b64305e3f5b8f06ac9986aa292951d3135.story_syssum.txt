"The joy comes from recognition from us doing our jobs as soldiers on distant battlefields," said Romesha, a former Army staff sergeant dressed in full uniform that included a cavalry hat.
In conferring the medal, President Barack Obama described the conditions faced by Romesha and 52 other soldiers when they came under attack from mortar, rocket-propelled grenade, machine-gun and sniper fire on October 3, 2009, at Combat Outpost Keating in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan.
Later in the battle, Romesha and his team charged more than 100 yards through enemy fire to reach wounded soldiers in the outpost, Obama added.
"Colin is not as shy as Clint," Obama said.
Romesha is the fourth living person to receive the nation's highest military decoration for actions in Afghanistan or Iraq.
A few months later, a U.S. military investigation found that measures taken to protect the outpost were lax, and critical intelligence and reconnaissance assistance had been diverted from the base.
