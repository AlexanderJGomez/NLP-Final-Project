In a tearful speech Raul said his decision to leave was a "painful one, but I think it is also the correct one," and said his next destination will be a club in Germany or England.
Raul won six Spanish league titles and three Champions League crowns during his stay at Madrid, and he told fans who gathered to mark his departure that he would support Real Madrid wherever he went.
I have been happy at Real Madrid and I will always be willing to help the club in whatever it needs."
New Real captain Iker Casillas added: "Raul is a symbol of Real Madrid.
There are many men who form part of the legend of Real Madrid but few that are chosen to embody the club - Raul is one of those."
