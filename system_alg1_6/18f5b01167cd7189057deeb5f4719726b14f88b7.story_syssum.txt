"Oh, my God," Hayes said as Asiana Airlines Flight 214 tore into the tarmac and skidded across the ground.
He said he had been focusing on a taxiing United Airlines jet when the Asiana flight caught his eye.
"My initial thought was that with the nose pitched up in the degree that it was that the pilot was maybe trying to divert the landing," said Hayes, who has no background in aviation.
Asiana 214 appeared to be too low and too slow as it neared the runway, and the cockpit voice recorder indicates the crew tried to abort the landing less than two seconds before the crash, NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman told reporters.
"The only thing we can say is we're just really happy that a lot of people survived, because it wasn't looking good for them folks on that plane for sure," Hayes said.
