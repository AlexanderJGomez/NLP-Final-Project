But many were disappointed by the countless features the smart watch did not include.
"I'm waiting for a smart watch that does something extra than just bring my phone to my wrist," says design engineer Esben Oxholm, who mocked up his own smart watch concept in February.
Christoph Behling, lead designer for Tag Heuer watches, shared Oxholm's criticisms, saying that in his view the Galaxy Gear will not serve as a replacement for regular watches, because it is lacking in two fundamental aspects: both in its form and its function.
Others say that the smart watch proper still hasn't been invented.
Through all the fevered commentary, technological enthusiasts continue to draw up their own visions of what a smart watch should be.
