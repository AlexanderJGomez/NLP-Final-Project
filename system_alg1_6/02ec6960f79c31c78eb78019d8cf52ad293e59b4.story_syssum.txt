A couple of weeks later, in July 2011, Pippen bought nicotine patches, started exercising and never looked back.
Doctors offered to get him into a bariatric center for gastric bypass surgery as well, but Pippen refused.
But Pippen isn't a man to do things halfway, his wife says.
Pippen took group fitness classes at their gym and swam laps on the weekends.
Susan worried that once Pippen reached his goal, he would revert to his old habits.
Pippen is now maintaining at 182 pounds.
Pippen does kickboxing on Wednesdays and swims laps on the weekends, while Susan runs on the treadmill.
"The hardest part for me is exercising when I don't want to," she says.
