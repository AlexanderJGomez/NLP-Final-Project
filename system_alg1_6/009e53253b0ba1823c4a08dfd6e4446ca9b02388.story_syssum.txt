And, I would suggest, she should have gone further: There's reason to think that bombing is exactly what ISIS wants us to do.
Why?
ISIS then beheaded a British journalist, so the British stepped up its military support in the campaign against ISIS.
Yes, the violent terrorism of ISIS is medieval and inhumane.
Why would ISIS goad the world to attack it?
But right now, we are the dog being wagged by the tail of ISIS.
Recruits are flocking to ISIS.
We have to stop responding with bombs every time they provoke us with videotaped slayings.
In fact, if you think the only way to defeat them is with bombing, they've already won.
