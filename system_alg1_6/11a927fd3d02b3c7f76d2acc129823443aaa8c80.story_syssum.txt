A 17-year-old male was charged Saturday as an adult with aggravated assault and other charges over a shooting the previous day at a Philadelphia high school, police said.
The shooter was in the school gym with about seven other students, city police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said.
The school went into lockdown as law enforcement officers searched students and let them out of the school, said Stanford.
On Saturday, police said school security officials provided inaccurate information about the teen who was cleared and released.
But police do not know how many shots were fired, Ramsey said.
