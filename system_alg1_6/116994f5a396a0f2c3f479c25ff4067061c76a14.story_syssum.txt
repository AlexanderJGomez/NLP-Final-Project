But had Barre-Sinoussi listened to one leader at the lab where she would eventually find fame, she may never have been a scientist at all.
Barre-Sinoussi has loved science since she was a girl.
"It just was not done at the time, but I wanted to try," she says.
She worked to find a connection between retroviruses, cancer and leukemia in animals.
I said, 'That is one of my dreams.'
"
She returned to Montagnier's unit; his lab was one of the few still examining the connection between retroviruses and cancer.
No one responded, said Barre-Sinoussi, who wasn't at the lecture.
Barre-Sinoussi says she and Montagnier had never heard of it then, but they agreed to do some research.
"That was a really worrying day," Barre-Sinoussi says.
"So we knew it had to be something else," Barre-Sinoussi says.
"
And it did.
"They just wanted to be close to the place that made the discovery," she says.
In 2008, when the Nobel Prize winners were about to be announced, the Nobel committee couldn't find Barre-Sinoussi to tell her.
and then she started to cry," Barre-Sinoussi says.
Barre-Sinoussi says she couldn't believe it.
"This is a good thing of the Nobel Prize -- it is easier for me to get an appointment with the first lady or the president of the country," Barre-Sinoussi says.
The attention her discovery has brought Barre-Sinoussi has changed everything, just like her friend warned, she says.
I told him what he said.
And I'm so glad I did not listen."
