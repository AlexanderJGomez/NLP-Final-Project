(CNN) -- Qatar's government says it's investigating complaints that sprinklers and alarms weren't working during a fire at an upscale Doha shopping mall that killed 19 people, most of them children in a nursery.
She said she left when the smoke became "too much."
Along with the children and teachers, two would-be rescuers died in the blaze, Interior Minister Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa Al Thani said in a statement posted on the ministry's Facebook page.
Four were Spanish nationals, a spokeswoman for Spain's Foreign Ministry said Monday.
Al Thani said everyone was believed to have been accounted for late Monday.
