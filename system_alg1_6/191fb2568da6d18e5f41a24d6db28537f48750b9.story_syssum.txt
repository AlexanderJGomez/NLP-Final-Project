We don't know how many are responsible, we don't know motive, if any, and we don't know whether it's domestic or foreign.
We know the Boston Marathon is seen around the world.
We do not need the president to say the word to feel it.
But then again, is our paranoia that irrational if something as celebratory as the Boston Marathon is no longer a safe place to be?
"Justice" won't take us back to September 10, 2001 ... back before the word "terrorism" was on the tip of every American's tongue.
If April 15, 2013, was the day the Boston Marathon became a target for terrorism, then September 11, 2001, was the day we all were warned that it would be.
Nothing will be the same.
