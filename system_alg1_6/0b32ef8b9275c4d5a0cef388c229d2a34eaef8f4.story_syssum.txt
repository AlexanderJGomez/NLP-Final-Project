He's had more than 90 radiation treatments and 200 chemo treatments since being diagnosed with head and neck cancer eight years ago.
Now, Cossman, 61, is sitting in a doctor's office, ready to undergo a CT scan that will determine if his cancer is being kept in check.
...
Cossman is one of 16 patients with progressive forms of cancer currently taking part in a study of a developmental drug by the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Cerulean Pharma.
He wants to make others "aware of head and neck cancer, and that clinical trials are available," he says.
It takes about nine years for an oncology drug to go through the necessary clinical studies to FDA approval, said Dr. Kenneth Kaitin, director of The Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, an independent nonprofit research group.
"What you're normally looking at in this patient population, if you can keep it at bay for two months, you are actually doing quite well, because the patients are so far along" with cancer, says Fetzer.
His doctor diagnosed it as head and neck cancer -- a surprise to Cossman because he's never been a heavy drinker or smoker.
"By June 2006," he says, "I went through every type of chemo that's been approved for head and neck cancer.
"You can't immediately go from one study to another.
In his second study, he developed a tumor on his right arm.
No," he says.
So Cossman entered his fourth study this summer, the trial by Cerulean Pharma.
He says far too few cancer patients who could be eligible for trials are aware of them.
His cancer has grown at a rate of 11 percent, enough to remain on the study.
Cossman hopes to enter a new one soon.
"Definitely," he says.
