A soft-spoken and shy man, Shin shared his harrowing story about escaping from a total control zone called Camp 14, giving Western audiences an accessible reading on North Korea.
It will be wrong for their witness accounts to lose credibility because of this incident," said Ahn Myeong Chul, a former North Korean camp guard who knows Shin.
While "Escape From Camp 14" was not the sole reason for the creation of the commission, Navi Pillay, then the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, urged the probe after meeting Shin and another North Korean prison camp survivor in December 2012.
In a reversal of his story told for years, Shin told Harden on Friday that he had been transferred to another prison, Camp 18, when he was 6, instead of spending his entire life inside North Korea at the total control zone Camp 14, the author says on his website.
North Korea had sought to discredit Shin.
Ahn, the former prison camp guard who has known Shin for seven years, said he believes the crux of Shin's story is true and that torture in either camp is still the same.
