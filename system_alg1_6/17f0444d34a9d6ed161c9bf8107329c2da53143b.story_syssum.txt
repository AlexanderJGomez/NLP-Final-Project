Boehner was one of the first top Republicans after Mitt Romney lost the 2012 presidential election to say that the party needed to deal with immigration.
Many Republican Party leaders and possible presidential candidates, however, say the GOP needs a more inclusive message to Hispanics if it hopes to win the White House in 2016.
The vote was largely along party lines and Republicans pressing for broader reform said that ending the Obama administration's program easing such deportations sent the wrong message.
Paul has made broadening the Republican Party's appeal a cornerstone of his message.
Echoing the same sentiment expressed by Obama, Denham said the measure was "a messaging bill" and "would never see the light of day" over in the Senate.
Florida Republican Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart also voted against that bill and told CNN that the GOP proposal helps Democrats continue to use immigration as a political wedge.
But if the message is perceived to be anti-immigrant, that is very, very negative," Diaz-Balart said.
"Republican support among Hispanic voters does not hinge on immigration reform but inaction.
Many Republicans interviewed by CNN said the challenge next year will be even greater because Democrats will want to use any divisions on the issue to further expand the wedge between the GOP and Latino voters going into the 2016 election.
"Just do your job -- I'm talking to Republicans and Democrats alike.
And many Republicans agree that the party's record on immigration will be important in states like Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, and Florida, which are home to expanding populations of Latino voters.
