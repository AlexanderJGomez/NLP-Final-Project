(CNN) -- Waking up Tuesday to the news that my good friend and former team mate Phil Hughes was in a critical state in hospital after a blow to the head in a state cricket match made me instantly realize how fragile life can be.
Phil was the new young gun in Aussie cricket who had burst onto the scene.
I had spent the weekend watching Lewis Hamilton at the Formula One Grand Prix charging towards his second world championship.
And then this happens to Phil -- left in a critical state.
Cricket is essentially a team sport but the life of a top order batsmen can be isolated and lonely.
Being a batsmen is lonely, it takes drive and a courage to face your emotions and your fears.
I put my hands on my knees, and just waited for things to go dark around me.
But for a ball to almost find its way through, under the helmet, behind the ear, and to cause that sort of damage is unheard of.
Our thoughts are with Phil and his family.
And if anyone can ride this wave, it is Phil Hughes.
