JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- A U.S. mining company has denied a report by Indonesia's state media that a convoy of its buses came under fire in the province of Papua Wednesday.
PT Freeport is the largest copper and gold mining company in the province.
No one died in the attacks, Antara said.
But authorities still do not know their identities.
