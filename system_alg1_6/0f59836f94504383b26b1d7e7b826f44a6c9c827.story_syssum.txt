Elvis Presley bought the property in February 1967, three months before marrying Priscilla Beaulieu.
McLemore said his parents bought the property in 1979 and turned it into a cattle ranch after previous owner-developers had failed to turn it into a resort.
McLemore said he met Priscilla Presley on a winter day in 1985.
"There's still a trailer pad behind the Honeymoon Cottage," McLemore said.
However, he said, he doesn't have a serious buyer on the hook and has yet to receive an offer.
