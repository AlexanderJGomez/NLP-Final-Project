In addition, about half of Pakistanis (51%) said they think the May 2 raid on bin Laden's home in Abbottabad will adversely affect their country's relations with the United States.
In a poll taken after bin Laden's death, more than two-thirds (69%) said they think of the United States as more of an enemy.
Asked whether they believe the Pakistani government authorized the raid, 29% said it did, 23% said it did not and nearly half said they did not know.
Yet extremist groups are still unpopular, with just 12% of Pakistanis expressing a positive view of al Qaeda, down from 18% last year.
The pollsters said there were few differences between the first and second surveys, implying that bin Laden's killing had little impact on public opinion in Pakistan about the United States or other issues covered by the survey.
Perhaps that's because only about a third (37%) of Pakistanis said they followed closely reports about the raid that killed bin Laden.
But just 27% said they had heard a lot about the attacks, up from 14% last year.
