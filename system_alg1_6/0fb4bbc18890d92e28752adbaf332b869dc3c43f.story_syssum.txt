Sydney has been at the forefront of this since establishing the "Sustainable Sydney 2030" vision.
The City of Sydney (CoS) has set some ambitious targets by aiming to cut 70 percent of our carbon emissions by 2030 (on 2006 levels of 5.4 million tonnes per annum).
Gas-fired trigeneration - a technology that uses heat from energy production making it more than twice as efficient as coal power stations --is one of the tools we're using to end our reliance on coal-fired power and generate 30 percent of our energy needs from clean, renewable sources.
As far as transport goes, cities like New York and London have experienced a cycling boom and despite the nay-sayers, Sydney has also seen a 113 percent increase in cycling since 2010.
