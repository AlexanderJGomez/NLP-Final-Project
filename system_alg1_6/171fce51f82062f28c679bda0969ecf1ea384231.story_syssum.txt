New York (CNN) -- Former pharmaceutical executive Gigi Jordan at first appeared calm as she described for a New York jury the last time she saw her son alive, those now-fuzzy final moments before she gave the 8-year-old autistic boy a lethal drug concoction.

Jordan testified that she held her son as Jude gestured at his crotch.

On the stand, Jordan said she planned on giving the money to charity before taking her life.
Brenner said Jordan told a therapist and local authorities about the alleged abuse but no action was taken.
