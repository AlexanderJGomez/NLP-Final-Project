SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN)  -- Thousands of protesters demonstrated against China's human rights record and its crackdown in Tibet after the Olympic flame arrived in San Francisco Tuesday.
Beijing organizers have said the monthlong international relay will not be stopped despite the protests, but some International Olympic Committee members have suggested an early end should be considered.
One of the San Francisco torchbearers has dropped out of Wednesday's relay because of fears of protests, a torch relay spokesman said.
David Perry, spokesman for the San Francisco Olympic Torch Relay, said he did not want to release the name of the person.
Some stops were skipped and the flame was transferred from the torch back to the lamp to be carried on a bus several times to avoid protesters.
An Olympic committee member suggested Monday that the public relations nightmare that has followed the Olympic flame on its way to the Summer Games in Beijing may make 2008 the last time such an ambitious global torch relay is attempted.
