In Detroit on Monday, Al Gore endorsed Sen. Barack Obama for president.
Saying he will do whatever he can to support Obama's bid for the White House, Gore said Obama has "inspired" him.
"Take it from me, elections matter," Gore said.
"After the last eight years, even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter," Gore said, adding, "After eight years of lost jobs and lower wages, we need change.
"This election isn't about changing the past, it's about changing the future," he told The Associated Press on Monday evening.
