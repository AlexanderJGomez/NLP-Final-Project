AL: It is an amazing legacy and I think she is always looking down at me very proud.
CNN: You worked your way through the ranks of Estee Lauder and managed to extend the reach of the brand to all corners of the world, partially through casting diverse models.

AL: I think you can get inspiration from anything.
I think the Internet is a great way to get inspiration.
