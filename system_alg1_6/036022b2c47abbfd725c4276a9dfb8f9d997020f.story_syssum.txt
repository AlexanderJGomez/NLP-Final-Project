Along with Ferrari's new car comes a new driver -- the quietly charismatic Kimi Raikkonen replaces Brazil's Felipe Massa -- and new hope that the Finn and Spain's Fernando Alonso can return the team to championship-winning ways.
Twenty-four hours earlier it was McLaren who were unveiling their new car which they hope can wipe away the memory of a dismal 2013 season.
"I'm very keen to learn all about the new formula and our new car, and I want us to be in a position where we head to the opening flyaways feeling comfortable with our package, yet still ready to absorb and learn more as we go," Button said in a statement.
Testing for the new season, which starts in Melbourne on March 16, begins at the end of January in Jerez, Spain.
