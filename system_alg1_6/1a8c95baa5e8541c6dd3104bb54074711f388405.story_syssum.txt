Sixteen years after her affair with President Bill Clinton became public knowledge, she's returned to the limelight with a campaign against cyberbullying -- of which she claims to have been "patient zero."
And, of course, this will be embarrassing for Hillary Clinton.
The right won't have to waste its own resources reminding people of the seedier side of the Clinton years -- Lewinsky can do that now.
Does Hillary Clinton not have a right to put this scandal behind her and have a political identity separate from her husband's?
