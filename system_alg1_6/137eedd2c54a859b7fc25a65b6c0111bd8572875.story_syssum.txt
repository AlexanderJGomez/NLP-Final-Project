The New Zealand-based Fonterra Group said Saturday that three batches of its whey protein tested positive for the Clostridium botulinum bacteria.
"China has not closed the market to all New Zealand dairy products," the ministry said.
The company involved, Sanlu Group, was partially owned by Fonterra.
At the time, Fonterra said it remained "100% confident about the quality of its products."
