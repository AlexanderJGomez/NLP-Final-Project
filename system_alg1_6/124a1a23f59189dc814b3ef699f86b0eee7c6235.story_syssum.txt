MUMBAI, India (CNN) -- The last gunmen in a standoff at the Taj Mahal hotel in Mumbai were killed early Saturday, the city's police chief told CNN sister station CNN-IBN, but another official said more attackers could be inside the hotel.
Dutt also differed from Gafoor on the number of gunmen involved, saying three, not two, had been killed.
It is still unclear who is behind the attacks, but the gunmen were men in their 20s who "obviously had to be trained somewhere," a member of the Indian navy's commando unit said Friday.
Karim said he spent eight hours barricaded in a room at the Taj with 40 to 50 people before commandos rescued him.
Earlier, police said they found 36 bodies during a sweep of the Oberoi hotel; they killed two militants and freed hundreds of trapped guests.
Gafoor said most of the attackers had been heavily armed.
Police said they came by boats to the waterfront near the Gateway of India monument and the two hotels.
"Until the investigation is complete, it will be difficult to say where they came from and how they came," he said.
"Not everybody can fire the AK series of weapons; not everybody can throw a grenade like that," a commando said outside the Taj hotel.
The Chabad-Lubavitch International group said Rabbi Gavriel Noach Holtzberg, 29, made a phone call to the Israeli Consulate to report gunmen in the house.
Two gunmen died in the battle at Chabad House, CNN-IBN reported.
