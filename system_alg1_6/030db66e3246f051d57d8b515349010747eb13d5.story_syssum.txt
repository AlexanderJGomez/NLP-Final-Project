Hong Kong (CNN) -- The international community is now waiting for confirmation from the United States and South Korea on whether a seismic disturbance in North Korea Tuesday is in fact the hermit regime's third underground nuclear test.
Begins development of No-dong missiles, a "scaled up" version of the Scud with a range of 1,000-1,300km and much larger payload, allowing it to reach Japan and Taiwan.
North Korea has long been suspected of developing its own nuclear weapons program.
A Bush administration official says North Korea has conducted an engine test of the Taepo-dong-1 missile.
North Korea withdraws from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, an agreement that was signed by most of the world's countries to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.
Responding to the test, the U.N. Security Council approves a resolution to impose sanctions against North Korea and require an end to nuclear and ballistic missile tests.
North Korea initiates what it calls a peaceful launch of a satellite, but the U.S. State Department declares it a "provocative act in violation" of a 2006 Security Council resolution prohibiting North Korea from conducting ballistic missile launches.
North Korea declares it will launch a long-range rocket in April to deploy a satellite into orbit.
North Korea appeared to have conducted its third underground nuclear bomb test February 12, as the U.S. Geological Survey reported a seismic disturbance centered near the site of the secretive regime's two previous nuclear tests.
The reclusive, Stalinist state announced last month that it planned a new nuclear test and more long-range rocket launches, all of which it said were part of a new phase of confrontation with the United States.
