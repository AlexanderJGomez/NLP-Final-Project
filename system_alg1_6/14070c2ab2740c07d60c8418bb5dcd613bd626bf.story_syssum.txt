A school district outside Columbus, Ohio, is on track to receive more than $1 million in federal grant money for its Chinese arts and language program.
The funds will be used, school officials say, to support their visiting teacher from China and to foster the newly formed relationship with their sister school in the southern Chinese province of Kunming.
"We feel very lucky that we have this," Aldis said.
"It's really been challenging," she said.
I think China has a beautiful culture."
Kramar said he was concerned about impressionable elementary students learning about communism through material provided by the Chinese government.
"We don't agree with everything, how the system works in China, but hopefully as it opens more and more, which it certainly has, they will become more democratic, they will become more open with less censorship, so you hope that's all there," Langhals said.
Parent Mandy Aldis said she isn't bothered one bit by the program being funded by China's government.
