(CNN) -- Chief Clerk Walter Dimmick was convicted of stealing six bags of gold coins -- worth $30,000 -- from the U.S. Mint in San Francisco in 1901.
The coins from the 1901 heist were never found.
Kagin dismissed the idea that the coins could be connected to the turn-of-the-century heist.
But instead what you have here are coins from 1894 and before," he said.
"These are not just coins, but they are artifacts.
"Unlike other hoards and treasures, this one includes a great variety of coins struck over many different years, and many of the coins are still in pristine condition," Kagin said.
