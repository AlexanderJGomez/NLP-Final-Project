Ruscio also said that the regimental flags are going to be removed from Lee Chapel.
The original flags will be placed on rotating display at Lee Chapel Museum in a more "appropriate location" where the stories behind them can be properly told, wrote Ruscio.
He said some students felt uncomfortable with the flags at Lee Chapel.
In April, Ruscio said questions raised by law students were legitimate.
In his letter Tuesday, the administrator said the purpose of the historic flags in a campus setting is to educate.
