The top rural speed limit is normally 70 mph, but in 2006 it set a maximum daytime speed of 80 miles per hour, the highest speed limit on the country, on more than 500 miles of rural interstate in its southwest corner.
The speed limit for rural roads in Montana is 75 mph.
As you continue west, interstate speed limits bump up to 70 in Iowa, and then you can maintain a steady 75 from Nebraska through to the California line, where interstate speeds drop off to 70 again.
Speeds are slower in more populous Eastern states and faster in the wide-open West, although the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety argues that some of the new, higher speed limits out West and elsewhere are costing lives.
Ironically, the new regime of U.S. speed limits has helped researchers make sense of whether higher rural speed limits are dangerous.
While Yowell admits most states are well-intentioned, he's "not willing to accept that speed limits are solely a function of safety," he said.
Baxter's rule of thumb for computing the right speed limit is the traffic engineering standard known as the 85th percentile speed.
But it tends to be well above the speed limits that most jurisdictions set.
