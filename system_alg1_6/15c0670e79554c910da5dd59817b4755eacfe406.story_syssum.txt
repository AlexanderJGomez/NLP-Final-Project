Lawson, a 42-year-old administrative assistant, checked out a library book about online dating before creating her profile.
One in six recently married couples met on an online dating site, according to a study commissioned by Match.com in 2009.
Lawson began online dating at the end of 2011 when she realized she wasn't meeting anyone her own age in Gainesville, Florida.
"I probably think about 'Star Wars' more than anyone should," Lawson wrote in her OKCupid profile.
Lawson said her favorite part of the date was when she texted him later to tell him she didn't think it would work out between them.
"Finally just one day on Skype, everybody else had kind of hung up and I said you know, I think I love you," she said.
White advised to be protective with personal information because it's easy to lie online.
Within 24 hours of registering on Match.com in 2010, Barbara Hassan had three matches "who by all accounts were intelligent, good looking and well off."
They corresponded online for a few months, until the man asked Hassan to pay for his ticket to the United States.
But just when Hassan thought she was done with online dating, she met her husband in 2011.
Whether people are looking to find their soul mate or just to have some fun, Lawson said it helps to go into online dating with a sense of humor.
