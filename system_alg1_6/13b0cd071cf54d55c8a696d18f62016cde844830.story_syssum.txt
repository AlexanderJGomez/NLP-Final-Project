In November 2011, a few months after Hosni Mubarak had been ousted by the Egyptian revolution, the scientists predicted that in the final evolution of Egypt's transitional democratic phase, the military would allow for semi-free elections but would still act as custodians of the country and the true center of power in the short to medium term.
"In November 2011, what we showed was even though the majority of the Egyptian society was in favor of ousting Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian military was at the time going to support the newly elected regime, but not fully accept it for a long-term solution."
"The military will continue to be pro-American, because of its reliance on U.S. foreign aid and military assistance, and the Egyptians who would be running in the future will be smart enough not to bring conflict with the U.S.," said Ashraf Singer, a member of the Egyptian Council for Foreign Affairs who has also worked closely with Egyptian government officials.
He added that based on his group's analytics, the current military leadership does not want to be the sole political entity ruling the country and sees itself as only the custodian of the society.
