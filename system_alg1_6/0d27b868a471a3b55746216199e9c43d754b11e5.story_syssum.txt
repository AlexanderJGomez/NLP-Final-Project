Are you involved in your kid's school?
Alex has been in school for a week now.
I don't have the time or desire to be that much of a super mom (for now), but I do want to be involved.
I try not to do anything half assed but I also have a tendency to not say no enough.
At all.
Are you involved in yours?
It's only week one of about 18 years of schooling so I have time.
