Los Angeles (CNN) -- Zsa Zsa Gabor's Bel Air mansion, which offers an expansive -- and expensive -- view of Los Angeles, officially hits the real estate market for sale Tuesday, according to the realtor who is listing the property.
Von Anhalt, 67, placed two porcelain toilets on his lawn facing the home of an adjacent property owner with whom he had a feud, the prince said in a CNN interview last year.
Hilton, who has not been allowed by von Anhalt to see her mother in several months, said Gabor would never want to leave her house for a condo.
The Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is famous for her many marriages and strong personality as well as her acting prowess.
