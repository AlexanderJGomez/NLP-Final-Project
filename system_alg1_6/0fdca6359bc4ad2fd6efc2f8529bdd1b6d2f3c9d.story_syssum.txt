Chuck Hagel was one of only two senators who voted against sanctions.
A few weeks after this vote, Hagel  sent a letter to President George W. Bush asking him to launch "direct, unconditional, and comprehensive talks" with the Iranian government, which the State Department has labeled a state sponsor of terrorism every year since 1984.
These comments and actions indicate that he does not fully appreciate the dangers of a nuclear Iran or the character of the Iranian regime.
More recently, in January 2009, Hagel signed a letter advising Obama to spearhead direct, unconditional talks with Hamas, a terrorist group that had just fired hundreds of rockets into Israel.
Oh Allah, count them one by one, and kill them all, without leaving a single one."
