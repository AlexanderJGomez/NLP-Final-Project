While the Defense Department announcement said only that Checque belonged to an "East Coast-based Special Warfare Unit," a U.S. official said the man was a member of the Navy's Special Warfare Development Group, more commonly known as SEAL Team Six.
Morning Star said negotiations began "almost immediately" with the captors and went on sporadically into Saturday night, when two of the three were released.
The Afghan doctor's family paid $12,000 to the smugglers, Haqbeen and Samad said.
Former classmate Stefanie Stewart told CNN she sat next to Checque on the school bus almost every day.
Morning Star did not release the identities of the other two men, citing safety concerns.
Despite the kidnappings of Joseph and its two other staffers, Morning Star reiterated its "commitment to continue its work" in Afghanistan.
