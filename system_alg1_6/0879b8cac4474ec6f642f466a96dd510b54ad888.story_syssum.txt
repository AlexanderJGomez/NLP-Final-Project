"It's something that they wanted for so many years, and they just had no idea how to start," said Matt Cusimano, a Peace Corps volunteer and a teacher at the primary school in Sandvoort, a village of nearly 200 people.
Cusimano, 25, said it made sense when the school's headmaster approached him with the idea for a communal library.
That's why I was comfortable taking on a library project," Cusimano said.
Better World Books and the nonprofit Margaret Clemons Foundation donated more than 3,600 books to the library.
If you don't know how to read, you can't start a computer," Leitch said.
"It helps me to read better," he said.
If you want to donate books for the people of Sandvoort, go to their Facebook page for information or to Better World Books.
