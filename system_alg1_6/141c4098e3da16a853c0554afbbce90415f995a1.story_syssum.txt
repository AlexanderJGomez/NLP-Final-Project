She said she thought she was going to die as her car crashed into the concrete and plunged into the water.
I thought I was going to sink with my car," she said from her hospital bed Friday, her left shoulder bearing the bruised imprint of a seatbelt.
Patterson said that as she watched the dust settle, she began to realize what had happened.
Investigators tracked her down Friday morning at her workplace, Sheriff Rich Stanek said.
The Minneapolis Fire Department recovered the fifth body from the bridge decking, he said.
Friday morning's recovery effort went more smoothly than anticipated, Stanek said.
"When you go over there, it's quite heart-wrenching," he said Friday morning.
"God bless you all," she said.
President Bush, who on Thursday pledged federal aid to rebuild the bridge, will visit the disaster site Saturday.
