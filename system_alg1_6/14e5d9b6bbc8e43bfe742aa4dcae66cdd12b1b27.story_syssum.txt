Olympic officials claim -- quite falsely -- that they would never mix politics with the games.
The real reason is simple: Olympic officials are afraid to upset countries with anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian sentiment.

Even if they do, that will not remove the stain of cowardice now on display at the International Olympic Committee, which remains visibly splashed across those Olympic ideals they hypocritically claim to promote.
