Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's former security chief testified that he worried at times that the singer might overdose on drugs, but he didn't think he was an addict.
Jackson called him between 20 and 30 times from his hotel room "in the middle of the night," LePerruque testified.
He also never witnessed Jackson take medications, he said.
LePerruque said he never confronted Jackson about his drug use because he "didn't want to put him on the defensive."
The incidents of slurred speech and incoherent late night phone calls did not happen over the entire time LePerruque worked with Jackson, he said.
he said Jackson asked him.
LaPerruque said he never believed the criminal charges against Jackson were true.
Jackson was acquitted on all charges after a trial.
The wrongful death trial begins its 15th week in a Los Angeles courtroom Monday.
