The jury came back with the award late Thursday against Andrew Shirvell, said Deborah Gordon, a lawyer representing the plaintiff, Chris Armstrong, 22, who graduated last year.
"I think the jury award is grossly excessive," he said.
Gordon said that Shirvell's claim is without merit.
Gordon said the multimillion-dollar judgment "is probably not collectable" at this time, since Shirvell has no job.
But she said that had never been the point of the lawsuit.
