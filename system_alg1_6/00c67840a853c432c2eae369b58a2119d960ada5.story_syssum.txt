"He's changed shape a lot since we got him," Collett told Horse and Hound magazine in the build-up to Kauto Star's demonstration dressage test at Olympia.
When you've taught him something once, he remembers it.
Having spent a career streaking past thousands of spectators lining a racecourse, Kauto Star appeared a little unprepared for an indoor arena crowd as he took his first, dainty dressage steps at Olympia.
Now, by contrast, Collett says there is "no pressure" on Kauto Star to perform to any standard in his new sport.
