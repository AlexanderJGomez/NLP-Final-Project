Jason Segel and Paul Rudd star in "I Love You, Man," which opens Friday.
Rudd has been in several comedies written, directed or produced by Judd Apatow, considered one of the leaders of the "bromance" trend with his softer, more openly emotional male characters.
In "I Love You, Man," Segel's character is rougher and looser than his characters in "Sarah Marshall" and "How I Met Your Mother."
In real life, claims Segel, he even has a man cave.

"Yeah, and my character had to learn that maybe it's time to grow up a little bit," Segel added.
"I think that we've all been kind of drawn to real stories, you know, characters that hopefully people can relate to and what's funny about just certain insecurites and just certain things in life.
