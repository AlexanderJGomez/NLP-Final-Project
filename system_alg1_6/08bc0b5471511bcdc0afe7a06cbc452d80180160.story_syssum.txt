New York (CNN) -- For Angel Rojas, the daily bus ride through the streets of Brooklyn provided a respite from a hardscrabble existence juggling two low-paying jobs.
A young man boarded the bus, police said.
Anderson allegedly belonged to Stack Money Goons and targeted a rival from another group known as TWAN Family, police said.
The couple has two children: a 12-year-old son, Saury, and 8-year-old daughter, April.
Guerrero said, "He was just sitting on a bus.
His laughter and his presence stayed with you."
