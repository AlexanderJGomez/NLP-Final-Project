"Why are they doing this?"
These World War II veterans have traveled here to visit the National World War II Memorial, which honors the 16 million U.S. armed forces who served and the more than 400,000 who died in battle.
A physician's assistant at the VA in Springfield, Ohio, Earl Morse was struck by the WWII vets he treated and how few made the journey to see the memorial that honors them.
Six planes flew 12 veterans.
So far, more than 30,000 veterans have experienced a visit to the memorial, courtesy of Honor Flight.
"Each of those stars represents 100 men and women who died in WWII, and I realized that my division has almost 39 stars on that wall," said Tom Rone, 85, who stormed the bullet-ridden beaches on Guadalcanal as a platoon sergeant with the Marines.
"I've had exchanges with veterans that are jaw dropping," Morse says.
For Morse, the founder of Honor Flight, the end of each flight is a bittersweet experience.
An estimated 1,200 WWII veterans die every day.
