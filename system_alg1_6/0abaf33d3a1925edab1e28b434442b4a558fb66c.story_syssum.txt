(CNN) -- A passenger aboard Continental Airlines Flight 1404 described a scene of panic as the plane skidded off the runway while trying to take off and caught fire Saturday at Denver International Airport in Colorado.
Trejos said when the plane hit the ground, he saw an engine on fire and seats buckling toward each other.
"They described a surreal scene when they pulled up, heavy fire on the right side of the aircraft, all chutes deployed from both sides of the aircraft, people evacuating and walking up the hillside towards them," Hynes said.
Hynes said fuel from the aircraft leaked for several hours after the mishap, but the fire was out.
She suggested passengers call ahead for Sunday departure times since many flights may be delayed.
