Section 6 of the flag code states, "The flag should be displayed on all days."
The flag code thought of that one, too.

Section 7 of the flag code provides one major exception: the flag of the United Nations can be flown in the position of honor or prominence at the U.N. headquarters in New York.
As part of the United States Code, the flag code is technically federal law.
In 2006 the Freedom to Display the American Flag Act of 2005 officially became law.
Should we ever pick up a 51st state, Section 2 of the flag code stipulates that the state will get a new star on the flag.
