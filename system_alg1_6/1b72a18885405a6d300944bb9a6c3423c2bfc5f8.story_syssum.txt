No Republicans supported the bill in either the House or Senate, and Democratic leaders needed a separate bill that calls for changes in the new law in order to get enough support in the House to pass the measure.
In the end, he said, the bill delivered the "core principle that everybody should have some basic security when it comes to their health care."
Obama had told their stories when campaigning for the health care bill in recent months.
Insurance companies also will no longer be allowed to drop people from coverage when they get sick, or to place lifetime or annual limits on the amount of health care people receive, Obama said.
Passage of the bill was a huge boost for Obama, who made health care reform a top domestic priority of his presidency.
Gibbs, however, said the administration expects to win any lawsuits filed against the bill, and he challenged McCain and other Republicans to campaign for the November election against the benefits of the health care bill.
House Democrats unhappy with the Senate bill have been continually reassured that the compromise package will be approved by the more conservative Senate.
