Kelly: I don't know if people would say it's so retro.
...
Patton: I don't think it hurts them at all because you can make up lost time at work.

Kelly: You talk about "Marrying Smart" and spending more time in college to find that right person, but you have to believe it's also very important for women, at the same time, to be fulfilled and find what they want because their marriage could end; 50% of marriages end in divorce.
Don't expect to only be happy because of your marriage.

Patton: It's absolutely true.
...
Patton: Well, they clearly haven't read what I've written.
Patton: I'm not the one that's evil.
