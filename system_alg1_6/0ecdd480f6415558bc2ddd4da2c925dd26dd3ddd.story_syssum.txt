John Couey had been sentenced to death for killing 9-year-old Jessica Lunsford in Florida in 2005.
"To me, death is sad," he said.
Couey was sentenced to die in August 2007 for abducting and raping Lunsford, then killing her by burying her alive.

Citrus County Sheriff Jeff Dawsy, who led the investigation into the girl's death, told reporters he wished Couey could have faced the death sentence handed down by the jury.
In sentencing Couey, Judge Ric Howard noted Couey became fearful of police dogs being used in the area in the search for the girl.
"He caused a slow, suffering, conscious death," Howard said of Couey.
Although Lunsford's death was one of several that contributed to the passage of a federal child-protection law dealing with sex offender registration and other matters related to child sex offenses, Mark Lunsford said at the time of Couey's sentencing the law does not go far enough.

He called on Couey to drop his appeals.
