The sweat-stained sheets of Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, still on her bed, a woman quarantined in a Dallas apartment said Thursday that she desperately wants her family's nightmare to end.
She said no one brought food Thursday to four people who can't leave to get it themselves, at least until later in the day.
"But (authorities) said we shouldn't throw anything away until they can get back with me," Louise said.
And Louise, her son and her nephews must wait 21 days from when Duncan first showed symptoms before they can leave the apartment.
"We have some hygiene issues that we are addressing in that apartment," Jenkins said earlier in the day.
When Duncan arrived in the United States on September 20, "he didn't tell me that he came in contact with anybody with Ebola," Louise said.
"I was so (scared)," Louise said.
Wilfred Smallwood, Duncan's half-brother, said his 21-year-old son is also among those quarantined in Louise's apartment, where he lived.
(Louise said she didn't think she had.)
One Ebola expert, Dr. Alexander van Tulleken, also said the federal response to the first Ebola case on U.S. soil seemed troubling.
