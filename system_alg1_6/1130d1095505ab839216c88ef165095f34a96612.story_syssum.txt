(CNN) -- Reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward relied on FBI insider W. Mark Felt as a reliable but anonymous source for their stories on the Watergate scandal that led to President Richard Nixon's resignation in 1974.
AM: The way that he was portrayed by Hal Holbrook in "All the President's Men" was he would give your partner Bob Woodward a little bit of a tease and say, "I'm not going to tell you anything more than that; you've got to follow the trail."
Bernstein: Yeah.
Bernstein: To both of us.
And we went to see Mark Felt, and we had a kind of wonderful couple of hours with him.
Bernstein: First time I had met him, yes.
Would you agree?
