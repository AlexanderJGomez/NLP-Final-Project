Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- Some of the families camped outside the San Jose mine, waiting for rescuers to reach 33 workers trapped underground, fear Chilean President Sebastian Pinera may be playing politics with the rescue operation in an effort to boost his popularity.
The Chilean research company said the increase was "directly related with the rescue operations of the trapped miners in the San Jose mine."
Outside the mine Sunday, some family members said they were angry that the rescue effort was being turned into a political spectacle.
The woman, who asked not to be named for fear of unspecified reprisals, said she did not bother to wait in the hot sun to meet the president Sunday.
"We have to be calm.
Away from reporters, Pinera first visited a powerful oil drill that has been transported to the mine to assist in the rescue.
Sunday was the first day that all three drills were working simultaneously, Pinera said.
