"It's great to see beam circulating in the LHC again," said CERN Director General Rolf Heuer.
Now that a beam is circulating, the next step is low-energy collisions, which should begin in about a week, CERN said.
But just nine days later, the operation was set back when one of the 25,000 joints that connect magnets in the LHC came loose and the resulting current melted or burned some important components of the machine, Myers said.
Mark Wise, professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology, said he's just as excited about the results that will come out of the LHC as he was last year and views the September 2008 accident as a delay rather than a devastating event.
The LHC will probably be in operation more than 20 years, Myers said.
At that time, there was a "hot soup" of particles called quarks and gluons at a temperature of around 2 trillion degrees above absolute zero, he said.
