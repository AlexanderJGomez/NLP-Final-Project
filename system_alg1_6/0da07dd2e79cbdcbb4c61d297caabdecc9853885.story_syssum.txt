Washington (CNN) -- Baseball all-time home run champion Barry Bonds won a big legal victory Friday when a federal appeals court ruled that evidence the government says would prove he lied about using steroids is inadmissible in court.
"There was a link missing here, that the only way to get down to the nitty-gritty that this was from Barry Bonds was using hearsay testimony," Talbot said.
The government said it would instead bring BALCO executive James Valente to the stand to testify Anderson told him the samples indeed came from Bonds.
The government had the burden of showing the samples came from Bonds, then went to Anderson and then to BALCO.
The government alleges BALCO helped supply Bonds with steroids and drug-masking substances.
Neither the government nor Bonds had an immediate reaction to the ruling.
