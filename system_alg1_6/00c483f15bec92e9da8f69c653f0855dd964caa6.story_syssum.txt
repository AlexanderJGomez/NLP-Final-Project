London (CNN) -- London's Heathrow Airport is "fully operational" and returning to normal after an emergency landing Friday forced the closing of both runways, the airport said -- but many travelers are likely to suffer delays anyway.
A British Airways plane bound for Oslo was forced to make the emergency landing "due to a technical fault," the airline said.
London Fire Brigade said one of its crews helped the airport fire service put out an aircraft fire.
"At first we were told ongoing incident and then emergency landing.
Emergency vehicles were quick to the aircraft I'm told."
