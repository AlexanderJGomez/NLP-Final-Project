That in turn has led to reports in Britain and abroad that London has trumped Paris as the most visited city in the world.
Top London attractions such as the Tower of London and St. Paul's Cathedral said visitor numbers were "through the roof" last summer, with an increase of 17% on 2012, the London Evening Standard reported.
Proclaiming "London dethrones Paris," the conservative daily Le Figaro had compared London's projected 16 million visitors with a 2012 figure of 15.9 million visitors to Paris.
"Like it or not, while London may have attracted more visitors around the Olympic Games, Paris remains the number one world tourist destination, even if we only include foreign visitors and not national ones," Hidalgo said.
In 2012, 29 million domestic and foreign tourists visited the wider city of Paris, Hidalgo's office said.
Parisian spluttering be damned, London and Partners has used its figures to promote a new video campaign, The London Story, in which well known Londoners reveal what they most love about the city.
"A great thing about London is shopping," adds Sixties It girl Twiggy.
