Much of the praise has gone to Heath Ledger's dark and disturbing portrayal of the Joker.
Itson saw the first "Batman" movie, but wasn't a big fan of the series, or Heath Ledger, but said her friend wanted to go.
"It was amazing, there were no words for it, it was so good, it was probably the best movie I've ever seen," she said.
And I'm also a big movie fan, and we tend to go to a lot of movie openings."

The Dark Knight lived up to the hype, especially Heath Ledger's role as The Joker.
It was definitely Bale's story, but the late Heath Ledger's movie.
Heath Ledger is AWESOME as the Joker.
The way Heath Ledger plays the Joker is different than how Jack Nicholson plays the character.
