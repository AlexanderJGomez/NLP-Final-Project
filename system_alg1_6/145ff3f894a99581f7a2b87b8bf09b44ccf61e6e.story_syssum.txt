In an interview scheduled to air on CNN Friday night, Larry King asked James whether the Cavaliers have an edge to retain the Ohio native.
James' potential freedom -- he can opt out of the last year of his contract and become a free agent on July 1 -- is one of the most talked about issues in the world of sports this year.
"I don't know to that extent, but it will be fun," James said.
He told King his goal is to be with a team that can win more than one NBA championship.
