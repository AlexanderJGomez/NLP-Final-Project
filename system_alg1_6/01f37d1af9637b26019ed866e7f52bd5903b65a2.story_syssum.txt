But why was Macy so excited?
What does she like about Hillary Clinton?
I was just like, 'Wow.'
(long pause) I turned back at my family and I, like, I, you know, made the face.
Macy: I like her because, like, she is running for president and a lot of people think that girls shouldn't be president because they are not as smart or they shouldn't have the same rights.
Macy: I didn't know, too, too, too much.
Did I already say Taylor Swift?
Macy: Maybe!
CNN: Thanks Macy...
