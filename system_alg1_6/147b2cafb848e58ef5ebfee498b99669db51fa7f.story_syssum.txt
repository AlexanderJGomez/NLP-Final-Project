Rep. Darrell Issa, a Republican from California who has been an advocate for Internet freedoms, has posted online a draft of his legislation, the Internet American Moratorium Act of 2012.
He said he will begin taking questions about it from Reddit users Wednesday morning.
You can't know what the internet or society will look like in six months, let alone two years, and making it harder to respond to emerging threats or opportunities is an abdication of your responsibilities as a member of Congress," wrote one Reddit user.
That's not a good thing -- the internet is a big place, and the language of this law is very broad," she wrote.
And while we're for an open internet, a blanket ban is a bad idea.
