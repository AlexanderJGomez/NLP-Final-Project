But is the Uber story really as good as it seems?
In contrast, Uber has embraced a take-it-or-leave-it approach that may be tough for consumers to swallow over the long haul.
According to its Terms & Conditions agreement, Uber is not a transportation service.
Surprisingly, Uber does not claim to "assess the suitability, legality or ability" of any third party providing services procured through Uber, and UberX drivers may not be professionally licensed or permitted.
I am sure there are fellow riders who, like me, take issue with the company not disclosing their passenger rating in the Terms & Conditions or privacy policy for the app.
In addition to the security of corporate data, there is the issue of whether individual drivers have access to personal passenger information and how Uber protects riders from unauthorized breaches.
Consumers both love and fear disruptive companies like Uber.
But the taxi driver action also creates the perfect context for Uber to explain why shaking up the regulatory environment -- and the ensuing mess -- is a good thing for both consumer and regulator.
I happen to love Uber.
This requires Uber to develop a true brand to manage its disruption and take control of the conversation with consumers.
