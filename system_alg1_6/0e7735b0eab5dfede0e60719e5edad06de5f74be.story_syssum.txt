With her story still ringing in my head, I set off to a small village near Chandrapur in India's Maharashtra state on International Youth Day at the behest of UNICEF to visit a new generation of strong young Indian women with some very inspiring stories.
The program is determined to challenge the difficulties many girls face across India, providing them with the knowledge and skills required to become strong financially independent women and also very importantly, to become the agents for change and development in their communities.
If we can educate more girls, provide them with employment opportunities and give them the right life skills, their world will open up!
Games like these, alongside Barclays volunteers sharing their financial knowledge, are what help the girls plan, set up and develop their own enterprises.
How can we make sure that "all girls and boys can make their own name and fate and be independent," as one girl told me.
Walking along a path in this quiet village in the middle of nowhere, it is easy to see how a girl can get lost -- lost for life.
Her father was paralyzed and was not able to take care of the family and that's where his young daughter stepped in.
With programs like Building Young Futures, these positive stories and messages will only grow in number.
