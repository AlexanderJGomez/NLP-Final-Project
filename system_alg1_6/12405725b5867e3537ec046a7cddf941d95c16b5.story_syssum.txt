The Doolittle Raiders flew their "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo" mission in April 1942, when, in the wake of Pearl Harbor, spirits in the United States were at a low point.
"All 80 of us knew each other, from all our training missions," Cole said.
Cole was Doolittle's co-pilot in the first of the 16 planes to take off from the deck of the USS Hornet in the Pacific.
There was a time when every schoolchild in the U.S. was taught about the courage of the Raiders.
And then came the Doolittle Raiders, 80 volunteers with guts enough to thrill their countrymen.
"I was scared, frightened -- just about any word you can think of that describes being apprehensive," Cole said.
One died of starvation; the others were grievously mistreated for more than three years.
When the bottle is opened, Cole said, "I know there will be tears, at least in my case."
Friends and admirers of the Raiders have been trying to persuade Congress, in recognition of the Raiders' contribution to this country, to award the entire 80-man squad not the Medal of Honor, but the Congressional Gold Medal, one of our nation's highest tributes.
You'd think the Doolittle Raiders would rate one.
As Brian Anderson -- a friend and longtime admirer of the Raiders who has worked to get the medal authorized and has tried to get the attention of members of Congress -- said: "Time is not on the Raiders' side."
The Doolittle Raiders have earned that medal.
