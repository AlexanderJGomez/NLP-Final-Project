Because two white men committed these acts of violence, however, our political and media chattering class never used the word "terrorism" in its discussions.
Let us imagine that these Pentagon and IRS attacks had been committed by an olive-skinned Arab Muslim man named Ali Muhammad.
If this same above-mentioned suicide letter had been instead written by an Arab Muslim man named Ali Muhammad right before crashing his airplane into an IRS building, most of the right-wing blogosphere would instantaneously erupt with screaming headlines of another act of Muslim terrorism.
Simply put, terrorism is terrorism, whether it is committed by a white, black or brown person anywhere in the world.
