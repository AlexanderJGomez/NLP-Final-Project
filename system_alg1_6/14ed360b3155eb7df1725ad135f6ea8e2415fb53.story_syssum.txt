Readers have his latest book to digest.
But after Sussman's most recent book was complete, his editor says he changed his tune.
"In some ironic way, it (his death) got a little bit more attention for the book in the UK," says Morgan Entrekin, president of Grove/Atlantic, Sussman's U.S. publisher, "as people wrote about the tragedy of his death and the fact that this was going to be his last book."
His widow didn't finish his latest book until after his death last year.
Sussman also wove his wife into all of his stories.
"All of those things that you would normally talk about," she says.
His agent says she has a manuscript Sussman wrote more than 10 years ago.
"It's an absolutely hilarious book," says Laura Susijn, his longtime agent and friend.
His literary team also worries that introducing a new work too soon after his latest crime thriller's release could distract readers from the marketing campaign around his existing books.
"For me, he's very much alive," Susijn says.
She says she would also be keen to publish her husband's early manuscript -- in time.
