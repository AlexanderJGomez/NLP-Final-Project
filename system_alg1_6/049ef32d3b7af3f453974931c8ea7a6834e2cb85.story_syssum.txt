Washington (CNN) -- On the 47th anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington on Saturday, the first sight on the National Mall for thousands of marchers was a four-story art installation that displayed four images and quotations of Martin Luther King Jr..
America's political atmosphere at the time of the Beck and Sharpton rallies sometimes seems more toxic than the politics of 1963.
But King and the civil rights movement provided a moral vision that made it possible for the U.S. to find a way out of those ugly times.
NAACP leader Medgar Evers was assassinated in Mississippi.
"You haven't got no time to cry no tears for no Jews," he called out at the Harlem Unity Rally.
Segregationists in Congress even expressed hope that violence would ruin the march and the civil rights movement.
But amid what Garry Wills called America's second Civil War, the civil rights movement embraced the idea that the best way to gain rights was to appeal to everyone's hearts and meet "physical force with soul force," as King put it.
By the time of the March, King understood that America could be changed only by winning over the other side.
King's cause was moral, universal.
Everyone remembers King's speech at the March for four words: "I have a dream."
King could issue that challenge.
Who's our King?
Who is appealing to his bitterest enemies?
