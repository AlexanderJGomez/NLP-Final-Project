(CNN) -- Five people were injured -- three seriously enough to require hospital treatment -- when an escalator at a commuter rail station in New Jersey suddenly went into high-speed reverse Monday morning, authorities said.
"As a precaution, PATH has suspended escalator service at Exchange Place through (Tuesday) morning," said Marsico.
Rodriguez, the witness, said that since Sandy, the Jersey City PATH station hit by Monday's incident has had major issues.
