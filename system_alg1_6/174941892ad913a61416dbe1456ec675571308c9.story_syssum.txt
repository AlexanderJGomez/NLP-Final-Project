Delbert Belton was in the parking lot outside the Eagles Lodge in Spokane on Wednesday night, waiting for a friend to pick him to go bowling, when the two teens robbed and assaulted him, leading to his death, police Chief Frank Straub Jr. said.
"We're hoping that he surrenders," the police chief said.
One who did was Ted Denison, who called himself "mechanic buddies" having worked on cars alongside Belton for over 20 years.
Police found Belton prone in the parking lot, with the Spokane County Medical Examiner's Office determining he'd died Thursday of blunt facial and head injuries.
"What did they think they were going to get from this man?"
