It's not a question of the amount of kings or tribal leaders, it's just a question of countries," says Weidinger, who plans to visit Africa twice this year and six times in 2015.
Weidinger had no definitive guide to help him locate all of Africa's royals and tribal leaders.
"Some countries put the monarch system back into the constitution, they give power to the traditional leaders," says Weidinger.
Weidinger says that in his opinion, the biggest threat to Africa's last remaining monarchs isn't local government, but modernity.
Dowden, however, thinks these monarchs will retain their power for a while yet.
