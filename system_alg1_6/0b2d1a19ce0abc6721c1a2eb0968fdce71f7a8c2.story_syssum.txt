The Interior Ministry statement Tuesday said the country's Citizenship Act "allows the kingdom the right to revoke the citizenship of anyone who is charged with being a threat to the state's security," Bahrain TV reported.
Two prominent Bahraini groups, the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights and Bahrain Center for Human Rights, decried the move.
But Amnesty International said the move breached people's right to free speech.
The country is strategically important for the United States in the region and it is home to the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet.
