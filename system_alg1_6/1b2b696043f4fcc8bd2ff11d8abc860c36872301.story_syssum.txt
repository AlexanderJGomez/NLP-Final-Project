(CNN) -- With Tuesday's recall vote, taxpayers in Wisconsin affirmed Gov.
Walker took office in 2011 facing a $3.6 billion budget hole.
Before Walker's reforms, Wisconsin state employees enjoyed salary and benefits that were about 28% higher than comparable private sector workers, according to a new study from the American Enterprise Institute.
Property taxes fell for the first time in 13 years, and Walker cited figures that showed Wisconsin has added 35,000 jobs since he took office.
The public sector union machine, once a colossus of Democratic power, looks weak in the wake of Walker's triumph.
Public sector unions were left out in the Wisconsin cold.
On, Wisconsin!
