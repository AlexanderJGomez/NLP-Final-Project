So does Gary Gates, CEO of the Fort Calhoun plant.
The floodwaters at Fort Calhoun are outside the plant.
That's where it should be.
The buildings housing the reactor core, the spent fuel rods and other crucial components are protected by small levees and aqua-berms.
The Fort Calhoun plant has been offline since early April for a re-fueling operation.
Gates and his colleagues say the water has not breached the buildings housing the reactor core and the spent fuel rods, and they're confident it won't.
Gates says the Nuclear Regulatory Commission cited the Fort Calhoun plant in 2009 for not being adequately prepared for a flooding event.
Still, NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko had solemn words for the staff of Fort Calhoun after touring the plant on Monday.
