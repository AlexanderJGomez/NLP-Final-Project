Married couples are connecting in any way they can.
"You just don't realize how much time you give up when you have kids," says Jenny Triplett, 45.
Charly Rok and her husband Jason take a cooking class together, because they share a love of food, as well as cooking.
"I married him, and he married me, because we actually like each other, and we like spending time with each other," Charly says.
"When you go into a kitchen on a Saturday, and you're spending the day cooking, you really tend to let go of a lot of other things," Jason Rok says.
"Once the kids go ... it's going to be you and her," Rufus Triplett says.
"If you don't learn how to communicate then (when the kids live at home), it's going to be challenging when they go."
She says that couples need to realize that they'll be in their relationship for the long haul.
In addition to honesty, communication and kindness, she says spending time with her husband, despite work demands, is their key to longevity.
She says their secret is learning to ebb and flow together, rather than apart.
"When we are together, we're really together," she says.
