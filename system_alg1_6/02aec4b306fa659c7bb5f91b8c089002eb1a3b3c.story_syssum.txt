Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN)At least 15 people, including two members of Parliament and a deputy mayor, were killed Friday when militants attacked a hotel frequented by government officials in the heart of Somalia's capital, police said.
They include Parliament members Hajji Gafe and Ali Omar, as well as Mohamed Aden Guled, Mogadishu's deputy mayor, Abdi said.
Shoppers were gunned down, held hostage and tortured.
But Al-Shabaab has continued its campaign of violence in attacks such as a suicide blast last month on a Somali army convoy in Mogadishu, the bombing of a bus carrying Kenyan teachers in Galkayo, Somalia, and an attack on an African Union military base.
