A Pentagon official insisted all active duty U.S. troops have been accounted for and no civilian was recently reported missing, and even the man's ex-wife said she didn't know he had been kidnapped.
Hultz said he was held in various locations across the Iraqi capital by Promised Day Brigade members.
The U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq simply said two lawmakers -- al Douri and Quasay al-Suhail -- handed over an American citizen, who was then transferred to the U.S. Embassy.
Another U.S. official with knowledge of Hultz, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he returned to Iraq in 2006 as a civilian contractor.
As to Hultz, by Sunday he'd been provided "all necessary consular services, including a medical check-up and debriefing," according to the U.S. Embassy.
"The Embassy reminds all private American citizens living and working in Iraq to register with the Embassy at travel.state.gov and to pay heed to the Iraq country-specific information, including the current travel warning for Iraq," the U.S. government said in its statement.
