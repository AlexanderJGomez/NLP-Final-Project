It was a typical African rural scene, but with a difference: traditionally the driver would have been a white Afrikaans male farmer, but Bohitile is a black woman.
"The percentage of black farmers is still very small in comparison to white farmers," said Bohitile.
Some assistance came last month when a white Namibian mentor, sponsored by German money and directed by the government-owned Agricultural Bank of Namibia arrived to advise one of the new owners, Naftali Katjiuongua.
There seemed to be no way out of the conflict between white and black over who should rule the land and own the wealth.
Bohitile and Zaamwani-Kamwi are two women who encapsulate the new Namibia, and the possibilities open to them today were virtually unimaginable in the past.
Namibia's success is that black advancement has not meant white diminishment.
