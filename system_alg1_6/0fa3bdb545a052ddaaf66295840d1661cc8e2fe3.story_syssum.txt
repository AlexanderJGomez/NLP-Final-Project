One of the accusers had once traveled with them to the Alamo Bowl, Dottie Sandusky said, where she and her husband shared a hotel room with the boy.
Dr. Elliot Atkins testified that he had diagnosed Sandusky with histrionic personality disorder after interviewing the former coach.
"I didn't go around seeking out every young person for sexual needs that I've helped," the former coach told the NBC sportscaster in an interview segment that wasn't part of the November 2011 broadcast, but has since been aired.
Sandusky routinely "got showers with kids" after working out, and he would say so later, Amendola said Monday.
The final prosecution witness testified Monday that her son seemed to suffer from stomach ailments during the times he was visiting Sandusky and sometimes did not want to visit the former Penn State assistant's home.
The defense then opened its case with a former Penn State coach who testified about Sandusky's stellar reputation in the community.
Another said Sandusky warned he might send him home from a trip to Texas, where they'd gone to watch a Penn State bowl game.
