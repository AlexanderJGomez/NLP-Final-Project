LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A plea deal has been reached in the assault case against singer Chris Brown, defense attorney Mark Geragos said in a hearing Monday.
Brown had previously pleaded not guilty to felony counts of assault and making criminal threats in connection with an attack on Rihanna.
Rihanna's attorney, Donald Etra, said Rihanna made the request because she felt that a protective order in place, requiring that Brown not annoy or harass her, was sufficient.
"I want Mr. Brown treated as any other defendant who comes to this court," Schnegg said.
Brown "embraces this as an opportunity to get his life back on track and get his career back on track," Geragos said, adding that Brown will speak further after his sentencing.
Rihanna had not attended any of the hearings in the case but had been following the case closely, Etra said earlier.
At the end of his statement, the detective said Brown sent a text message nine days later, apologizing.
