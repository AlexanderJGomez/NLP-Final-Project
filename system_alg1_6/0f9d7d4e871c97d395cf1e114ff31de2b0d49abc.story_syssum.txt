So sad Lydia Callis is not the sign language interpreter #Sandy" tweeted @kyledoyle.
Callis, 30, became an Internet sensation just three days earlier because of the dramatic facial expressions and body language she used to translate Bloomberg's dire warnings about the dangers coming with Superstorm Sandy.
When Bloomberg warned "It is dangerous," viewers could see the danger on Callis' face.
But Callis herself was staying out of the spotlight, apparently giving just one interview to DNAinfo.com reporter Jill Colvin, who tracked her down at the New York emergency management headquarters in Brooklyn on Wednesday.
Callis said she tries to translate Bloomberg's emotions.
"When a reporter asks a sarcastic question, you can see it in my face," she said.
"Bloomberg's new signer does her job fine, but she doesn't have panache of Lydia Callis, who signed with a New York accent.
Bloomberg didn't like all the shine Lydia Callis was getting?
Callis earned a degree in American Sign Language from that school, which is part of the Rochester Institute of Technology, before moving to New York City last year, a school spokesman said.
