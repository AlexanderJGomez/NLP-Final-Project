Since the 1960s, organized labor, once the pillar of the Democratic Party, has often been taken for granted or even treated with hostility.
Organized labor has been integral to the organizational strength of liberalism throughout the 20th century, as the most reliable and powerful force to get out the vote in elections and to help build congressional coalitions behind progressive legislation.
Democrats won the support of workers as a result of the surge of legislation that helped working- and middle-class Americans find economic security.
"Labor did it!"
The relationship between labor and Democrats frayed after the 1970s.
Organized labor also suffered as Democrats reached out more aggressively to different constituencies, middle class suburbanites, consumer activists, young Americans and African-Americans, who didn't have as much connection to unions and often saw them as an "entrenched interest" that didn't have the best interest of the party in mind.
But Democrats can't afford to lose the enthusiastic support of organized labor.
