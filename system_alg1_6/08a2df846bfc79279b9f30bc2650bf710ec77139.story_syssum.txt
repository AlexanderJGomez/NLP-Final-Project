In the mid-March chill Thursday, the victims and their stories continued to emerge as firefighters ferreted through the piles of bricks and wreckage on the East Harlem block where a powerful explosion and fire leveled two buildings.
Another victim, Griselde Camacho, 44, was a public safety officer at the Hunter College Silberman School of Social Work in East Harlem, the school's website said.
Rosaura Hernandez, 21, who also perished in the explosion, was a line cook at Triomphe Restaurant, general manager Robert Holmes said.
"It's a terrible loss.
Though authorities have said a gas leak may have triggered the explosion, Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters Thursday that the official cause was under investigation.
On Thursday, Con Edison officials said the utility received a call reporting a gas leak around 9:13 a.m. Wednesday from a resident at one of the newer buildings on Park Avenue.
Fire officials said they received no reports of gas leaks in the area in the last month, while police reported receiving no calls since 2010.
Some wreckage was still smoldering Thursday, with the fire whipped by the cold wind, de Blasio said.
"They flew off the ground," said the piano technician, who also lives in the building in East Harlem.
A building department official said one of the two Park Avenue buildings that collapsed received a city permit last year for the installation of 120 feet of gas piping.
"If we were here five minutes earlier we may have had some fatalities among firefighters," he said.
