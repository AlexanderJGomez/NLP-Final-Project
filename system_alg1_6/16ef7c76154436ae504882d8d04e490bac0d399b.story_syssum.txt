(CNN) -- In his September 4 op-ed, Jack Schlossberg presents his case that young Americans should cast their ballots for President Obama this fall.
Or, according to this analysis, that half of recent college graduates are jobless or underemployed Or that under Obama, the national debt has risen $5 trillion.
In a word, travesty.
In 2008, Obama regaled us with promises of hope and change, but his time in office has exposed the emptiness of these promises.
But of all of Schlossberg's claims, perhaps the most misguided is the notion that Obama has displayed political courage in the White House.
But in this case, it's about coming to terms with the fact that Obama has had his chance to lead and his policies have failed.
We can vote for a new direction.
