It's the first time that potential human organ trafficking, a worrisome international crime, has been detected in Spain, authorities said.
The mayor's alleged accomplices recruited and later paid for nine poor people -- eight immigrants and a Spaniard -- to have specialized liver compatibility tests at a clinic in Valencia last summer, police say.
But medical workers there, following strict protocols against human organ trafficking, prevented it.
Further investigation into the people who were recruiting and paying for those tests led police to the Lebanese mayor, and to the Lebanese suspects and the Palestinian, who live in Spain, authorities said.
It's exploitation of human beings."
