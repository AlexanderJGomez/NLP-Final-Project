The sources said at least 10 people were injured.
Eight Palestinian militants were killed in more than 25 Israeli airstrikes and 39 rocket attacks across Gaza on Sunday night into Monday, said Ashraf Al-Qidra, a spokesman for the Health Ministry in Gaza.
After that statement, 70 rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel, with Hamas claiming responsibility.
Israeli police have questioned six suspects about what they did "before and during the murder" of the Palestinian teen who was abducted and burned to death, Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
Netanyahu on Monday spoke with the father of the Palestinian teenager who was burned alive in Jerusalem last week, expressing shock at what he called an "abhorrent" murder.
We've done exactly that," said Mark Regev, spokesman for Netanyahu.
Meanwhile, the Abu Khedair family is irate over the treatment by Israeli police of one of the burning victim's cousins, an American high school student.
Senior officials in the Obama administration said they were shocked at two videos in which Khdeir was seen being held down and pummeled by men in the uniform of Israeli security forces, the officials said.
The officials said they expect Tariq will be able to return home to Florida with his family in the next few weeks.
"They are investigating whether he was throwing rocks," another senior State Department official said.
Abu Khedair's mother, Suha, said she wants equal justice for the people who abducted him in the early morning as he was heading from his home to a mosque for prayers.
The Israeli military destroyed the homes of the two main suspects in the killings of the three Israeli teenagers.
