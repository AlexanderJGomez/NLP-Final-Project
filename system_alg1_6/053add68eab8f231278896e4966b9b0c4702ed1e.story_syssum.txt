Yelena Isinbayeva shrugged off five years of disappointments in global competition to return to the top of the podium, roared on by partisan home support in the Luzhniki Stadium.
Bronze behind Suhr in the London Games last year was also a disappointment, but she has now gained redemption on home soil.
Olympic 800m champion David Rudisha was missing from the event he has made his own, breaking his own world record on the way to gold in London last year.
Isinbayeva's gold was the second of the day for the hosts after Olympic champion Elena Lashmanova crossed the line first in the women's 20km walk.
