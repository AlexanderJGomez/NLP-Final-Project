Mumbai, India (CNN) -- I normally don't dwell on what I am going to wear before I go on a shoot.
I was not.
Ganesh Shinde, 42, has been doing this job since 2007.
Shinde sweeps, his partner scoops.
"Now I am used to it," Shinde says, admitting he found it hard when he first started the job.
Shinde has no gloves.
"They have to numb their senses," Shinde explains.
According to the Mumbai based research organization Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), 80% of the manual scavengers die before they turn 60 because of health problems.
Most manual scavengers are Dalits -- people belonging to the lowest strata of India's caste system.
Shinde says it's hard to get a cup of tea.
I asked Shinde what hopes he has for his child.
India's current prime minister, Narendra Modi, hopes to change the future not just for Shinde's daughter but for millions of Indians who are forced to live with unsanitary and unhygienic conditions every day.
