Radamel Falcao Garcia Zarate, Falcao for short, is a Colombian soccer star.
Falcao is good enough to improve any team, but United hardly needed another attacking player.
In his absence, James (pronounced "Ham-ez") Rodriguez scored six goals as Colombia swaggered its way into the last eight before defeat to hosts Brazil.
A new star was born, and Rodriguez is now strutting his stuff at Real Madrid having also left Monaco.
@FALCAO is his official Twitter handle.
Monaco did qualify for the Champions League, even if Falcao missed most of last season through injury.
The Manchester club isn't in Europe after an awful season under Alex Ferguson's successor David Moyes, who was subsequently sacked.
