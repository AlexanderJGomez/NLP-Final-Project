Officer John Hege was one of four police officers fatally shot Saturday in Oakland, California.
Hege had been with the Oakland police force about 10 years.
The man accused of shooting the officers -- Lovelle Mixon, 26, of Oakland -- was fatally shot in a gun battle with SWAT officers in an apartment complex where he was hiding, police said.
The gunman fired on SWAT officers who entered the apartment, hitting two of them before police shot and killed the man, Jordan said.
Police said Romans had been with the department since 1996 and Sakai since 2000.
