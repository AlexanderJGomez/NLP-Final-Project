Coulson and Brooks are former editors of the defunct Murdoch tabloid the News of the World, which was shut down last year in the face of public outrage at the hacking scandal.
Coulson quit the post in Cameron's office last year when police opened a new investigation into phone hacking.
Cameron's office and News International declined to comment, as did McCartney and a number of other celebrities named as potential victims.
The journalists facing charges include former top News of the World staff, including Thurlbeck, former managing editor Stuart Kuttner and editor Ian Edmondson.
She quit News International, the British newspaper publishing arm of News Corp., amid the scandal last summer.
British police have been investigating phone hacking by people working for Murdoch since January 2011 and have arrested dozens on suspicion of phone hacking, computer hacking and corruption.
Dowler's parents told the inquiry in November how phone hacking on behalf of News of the World had given them false hope their missing daughter was still alive.
