"I was called in the morning by my elder brother notifying me of an attack on the school where my daughter was schooling," he said.
Their entire village was razed to the ground and so Samuel moved his family to Chibok and enrolled his eldest daughter Sarah into the Government Secondary School so that she could sit for her final high school exam.
Rebecca says there is not a day that goes by that she does think of her daughter.
"She used to tell me one day she will finish school and become somebody.
"Every Christmas we used to be complete and happy but now one of us is not there, how can it be the same?"
But there is nothing we can do," says Rebecca.
But although they are at low spirits, they say their hopes remain high that their daughter will come back.
