A: I don't like hockey.
B: I like hockey.
Why?
Because they win a lot?
Are the Blackhawks unbeaten?
So, even if you lose a game in extra time -- as the Blackhawks have -- you didn't "lose."
Hey, you obviously know your hockey!
The team is the talk of the town.
I do not know if you know who Chicago's hockey stars are.
He was born and raised in Buffalo, New York, where a boy is so lucky because he can play ice hockey outdoors 10 to 11 months a year.

You see, it wasn't so long ago my boyhood favorites the Blackhawks were skating on (insert "thin ice" cliche here).
A popular team to watch had disappeared off the radar.

I was a hockey guy.
I have a daughter who recently asked whether I could get her hockey tickets.
Hockey isn't for everybody.
