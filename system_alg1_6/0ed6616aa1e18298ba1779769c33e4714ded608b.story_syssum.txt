(CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama arrived in South Korea on Wednesday, where the leaders of top global economies will convene at the G-20 summit to try to stabilize the world's financial markets.
But the president focused on the two countries' shared principles of unity and tolerance when he delivered a highly anticipated speech at the University of Indonesia right before he left for South Korea.
Obama said he returned as president of the United States seeking "a deep and enduring partnership" with Indonesia.
"We see the G-20 as fundamental not just to our international economic agenda, but to our ability to have a lasting recovery at home, because fostering balance, global growth is essential to fostering growth here in the American economy," Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications said ahead of Obama's Asia trip.
After South Korea, Obama will head to Japan for the APEC summit, which will be held in Yokohama on Saturday and Sunday.
"Further economic integration [and] trade liberalization in Asia Pacific is vital to our own interests and our ability to export more and grow our economy here at home," National Security Advisor Mike Froman said ahead of Obama's Asia trip.
