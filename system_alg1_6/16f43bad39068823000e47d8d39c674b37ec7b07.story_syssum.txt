The PKK accuses Turkey of oppressing Kurdish culture and suppressing Kurdish nationhood.
During the 1990s the Turkish military launched a concerted campaign to eliminate the PKK threat, adopting commando tactics and targeting the group's mountain bases.
In 1998, under intensive Turkish pressure, Syria expelled Ocalan and shut down the PKK camps he had established there.
It accuses the PKK of launching attacks on Turkish targets from secret bases in the mountainous and semi-autonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq.
