In any case, the couple's allusions to their reunion --a Twitter picture showed her embracing a man who appears to be Brown; another showed a man presumed to be Brown face down and shirtless on a bed -- culminated with Brown posting a photo of himself and Rihanna, who appears to be in her underwear.
Normally I don't like to get too involved in grown folks' private business.
When the world first saw the images of Rihanna's face after her fight with Brown, many rushed to blanket the songstress with support.
She likely knew she would hear a lot of criticism and I guess she wanted us to know she doesn't need our sympathy.
After that recording, I thought Rihanna had gotten Brown out of her system.
Oh, I can hear Brown fans now -- leave him alone.
And if there's a repeat of 2009, a lot of us won't be interested enough to care.
Hopefully that incident was a one-time thing and she'll be alright.
