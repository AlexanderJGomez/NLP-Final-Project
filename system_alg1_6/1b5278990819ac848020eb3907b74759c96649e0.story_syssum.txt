That's how it looked in 2000, when the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as PRI, lost the presidency to Vicente Fox of the National Action Party, or PAN.
As expected, the top vote getter in Mexico's presidential election on Sunday was PRI candidate Enrique Peña Nieto.
When criticized for being out of touch, he insisted chauvinistically that he wasn't "the woman of the household."
Even former President Vicente Fox crossed party lines and endorsed Peña Nieto, against the PAN's own candidate, Vazquez Mota.
As many Mexicans see it, the PRI was always plotting its retaking of the presidency, even as it overhauled its brand and tried to overcome a legacy of corruption.
But the more common view seems to be that, despite the makeover, the party is as corrupt as ever -- a fact that voters seem willing to overlook if it can steer the country to safer and more tranquil waters.
My sense is that the PRI couldn't stop the war, even if it wanted to.
Meanwhile, we'll have to wait and see whether the election of Peña Nieto turns out to be good news for Mexico.
