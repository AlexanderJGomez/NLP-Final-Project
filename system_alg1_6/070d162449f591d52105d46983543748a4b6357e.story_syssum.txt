Malik, editor Kabeer Sharma said, posed nude.
Bilawala said the publication "cheated" his client and doctored the nude pictures.
FHM, Bilawala said, violated its agreement with the Pakistani model that stipulated that Malik would be shown the photos from the shoot before they were published.
Malik said she never agreed to pose nude, the prospect of which sparked outrage in her homeland.
"I am not bothered about what they think," she said.
"My fans and many Pakistanis support me and believe (in) me."
