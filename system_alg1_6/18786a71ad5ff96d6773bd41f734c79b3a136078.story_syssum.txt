During a wide-ranging interview at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Panetta and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton talked about Syria, the Secret Service and North Korea.
North Korea said the rocket was designed to carry an observation satellite, though the United States, South Korea and Japan said it was a cover for a long-range ballistic missile test.
Clinton said it was too early to determine if there was a prospect for a shift in relations on the Korean peninsula with the younger Kim, who lived outside of North Korea for a time.
As a result of the launch, the United States has suspended an agreement reached in February to provide food aid to North Korea.
North Korea had drawn world attention with the announcement of the launch, which came during a two-day nuclear summit in South Korea that brought together leaders from the United States, Russia, China and dozens.
On the unrest in Syria, Clinton said it was a "long shot" that Russia and China would change their position and allow for a U.N. Security Council resolution that calls for an end to the violence and a transition of power.
"The reason it was disturbing is that whether it takes place in Colombia or any other country or in the United States, expect that our people behave according to the highest standards of conduct," Panetta said.
