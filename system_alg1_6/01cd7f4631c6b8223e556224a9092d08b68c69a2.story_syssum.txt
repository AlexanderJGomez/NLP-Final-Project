Wilfredo De Jesus wants his message heard loud and clear: Evangelical Latino Protestants in the United States are more relevant than ever.
"We're very vocal now," he said.
The door is the most open to Republican candidates and the Republican Party, Jones said.
And (Latinos) haven't seen our people rejoice for quite some time," he said.
The 38-year-old attorney and lifelong Republican said that as the son of Mexican immigrants, "it's disappointing as a Latino when you hear people making ignorant statements (in the party).
Immigration ... it's a preeminent issue for us," said the Rev.
Much like his friend De Jesus, Salguero believes that Latino evangelicals are the key to victory for any politician.
"Barack flipped on us," De Jesus said.
It's only right for the Republicans to say, 'let's win back this Latino bloc, at least the evangelicals.'
"
The 31-year-old said the focus for the Republicans in winning more Latino votes should be on the economy, whether they are courting evangelical Protestants or others in the community.
Right now, that's jobs and unemployment," Ballori said.
"These politicians are so full of it to get elected," De Jesus said.
