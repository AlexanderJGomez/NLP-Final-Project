Phnom Penh, Cambodia (CNN) -- Late one night, after dark, we met up with Don Brewster -- head of Agape International Missions, an NGO fighting child prostitution -- to go behind the scenes at Cambodia's KTVs: karaoke clubs that are fronts for brothels.
We walk into a KTV; Scott and Don lead the way into the karaoke rooms.
Don says if we take the elevator up from the basement, we can skip the bar and go straight to the "massage" floor.
I have my iPhone in hand and itching to take a picture when suddenly things go horribly sideways: A white-clad girl in the bowl suddenly jumps up and starts screaming "She take a picture!!"
We head to another KTV, this one still upscale but less fortress-like than the last.
An older woman walked in five girls dressed in fairly classy though sexy business suits, for us to take our pick of whom we would like to stay with us.
Don picks one, and so does Scott and the two join us; the karaoke starts in earnest.
The young girl sitting next to me, the one Scott chose, is extremely pretty.
and it talks about how a girl is like a flower, and only has the one time where she has most value.
I see that Don has been very busy with the girl he invited to stay, showing her a video on his iPhone in which a girl from his center talks about how she was able to leave a KTV and now has a job that she is excited about and is much happier.
I had no idea that I was going to be involved in trying to recruit girls to leave the KTV life and receive the services of Don's NGO.
What a night.
