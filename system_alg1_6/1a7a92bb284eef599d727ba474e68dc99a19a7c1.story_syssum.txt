Washington (CNN) -- A federal appeals court ruled Friday the Transportation Security Administration can still use full-body scanners at airports, but said the agency erred in how it deployed the controversial machines.
Either side can appeal to the full appeals court or the Supreme Court.
"The balance clearly favors the government here," the court said.
The court also debunked the privacy group's allegation in its lawsuit that TSA had violated the Video Voyeurism Prevention Act.
"I think the court would have had a very different conclusion" had body scans been mandatory, Rotenberg said.
