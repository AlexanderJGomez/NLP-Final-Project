Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court's decision Monday on same-sex marriage brought the issue back into the political mix less than a month before the midterm elections.
All told, 30 states could soon start permitting same-sex marriage.
"As a general rule, it won't have an effect on these midterms because I think the issue is fading," said Quentin Kidd, director of the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University in Virginia.
Republican Ed Gillespie, who's challenging Democratic Sen. Mark Warner in Virginia, said the Supreme Court's decision has "considerable impact" but did not express overt concern about the issue.
With half of Virginia voters supporting same-sex marriage, according to a Quinnipiac poll earlier this year, a Republican candidate running for a statewide seat would almost need to take a measured approach on the issue.
And with Colorado voters supporting same-sex marriage, 61%-33%, according to a Quinnipiac poll in April, it's no surprise that Gardner may keep quiet on the issue.
Hagan was part of the surge of Senate Democrats who endorsed same-sex marriage last year, but North Carolina passed its same-sex marriage ban as recently as 2012 -- an effort that Tillis, speaker of the North Carolina House, helped push.
