One child died and several others were hurt in a grenade attack on a children's Sunday-school class in Kenya, the Kenya Red Cross said.
The Kenya Red Cross tweeted that one child died, and that "six critical children" were taken to a hospital.
In a series of posts Saturday on a Twitter account often used by Al-Shabaab, the group said the Kenyan military is "waging a losing battle" in Kismayo.
Thousands of residents of the city fled before the fighting, according to the U.N.
