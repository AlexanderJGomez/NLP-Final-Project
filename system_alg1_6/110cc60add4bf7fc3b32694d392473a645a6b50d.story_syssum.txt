Also feared dead in the crash were two children -- ages 1 and 13 -- in one house, East Haven Mayor Joseph Maturo Jr. said.
Maturo said the children were in one house with their mother when the plane struck shortly before 11:30 a.m.
The plane missed its initial approach, which isn't uncommon, said Tweed airport manager Lori Hoffman-Soares.
"It's always a concern, but it's something that happens in every airport," Maturo said.
