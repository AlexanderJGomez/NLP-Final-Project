Sometimes Twitter is more liberal.
On Twitter, a full 77% of tweets about his win were positive and only 23% negative.
And 57% of those who posted news on Twitter were either Democrats or leaned Democratic, compared with 46% of the general public.
But Twitter pundits don't always lean to the left.
There were more negative than positive comments about Obama and Romney on Twitter.
In the Pew's 2012 news consumption survey, just 13% of adults said they ever use Twitter or read Twitter messages.
Only 3% said they regularly or sometimes tweet or retweet news or news headlines on Twitter.
