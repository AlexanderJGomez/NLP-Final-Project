(CNN) -- During the past few months, I have gently suggested to my patients that they receive the flu vaccine.
Severe flu complications, like pneumonia, can hospitalize these patients, or worse, be fatal.
But another reason is the relatively low percentage of patients who received a flu shot.
The reason many cite, "I got the flu from the flu shot!"
In some, the flu can be debilitating, leaving patients bedridden for days.
It's still not too late for a flu shot.
Then be proactive and get a vaccine earlier in future flu seasons.
