"I don't feel like in England, the young players are dreaming of playing for the national team anymore," said Vieira, who is now Manchester City's Football Development Executive.
"In England, I really don't understand how come so many young players from the age of 16-21 pull out of the national team for injury.
On Tuesday the Football Association opened its elite football facility -- the $168-million St. George's Park complex -- which it hopes can help pave the way for the national team to win a major international tournament for the first time since 1966.
That is a good base to start with."
"We want to bring our young players from the academy through to the first team," said Vieira.
