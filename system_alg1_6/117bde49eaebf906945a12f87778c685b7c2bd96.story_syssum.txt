Sarah Palin's hometown required women to pay for their own rape examinations while she was mayor, a practice her police chief fought to keep as late as 2000.
Alaska's Legislature in 2000 banned the practice of charging women for rape exam kits -- which experts said could cost up to $1,000.
But Croft, the former state representative who sponsored the law changing the practice, says it seems unlikely Palin was not aware of the issue.
During the time Palin was mayor of Wasilla, her city was not the only one in Alaska charging rape victims.
"Several municipal law enforcement agencies in the state did have trouble budgeting and paying for the evidence collection for sexual assault victims,"  Henry said.
He does not recall discussing the issue with then-Mayor Palin.
The bill passed unanimously with the support of the Alaska Department of Public Safety, the Alaska Peace Officers Association and more than two dozen co-sponsors.
"The bigger picture of what was going on at the time was that the state was trying to cut their own budget, and one of the things that they were doing was passing on costs to cities, and that was one of the many things that they were passing on, the cost to the city," said Patrick, who recalls enormous pressure to keep the city's budget down.
Before Palin came to City Hall, the Wasilla Police Department paid for rape kits out of a fund for miscellaneous costs, according to the police chief who preceded Fannon and was fired by Palin.
Palin is committed to supporting victims and bringing violent criminals to justice," Hazelbaker said.
Victims' advocates say that services are lacking and that Palin cut funding for a number of programs that treat female victims of violence.
The McCain-Palin campaign insists that fighting domestic violence and sexual assault are priorities for Palin.
