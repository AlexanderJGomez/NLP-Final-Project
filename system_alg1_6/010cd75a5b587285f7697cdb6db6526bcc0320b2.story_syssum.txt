By producing the magazine, ISIS is taking a leaf out of the book of its former ally al Qaeda, which has praised and advocated terrorist attacks in its glossy publication, Inspire.
ISIS has successfully recruited large numbers of foreign fighters from across the globe, including from the United States and Western Europe.
The final section of its most recent issue is dedicated to the beheading of American journalist James Foley, the first of three Western captives whose killings the group has publicized.
The magazine shows that ISIS, which is also known as ISIL, is paying close attention to what's being said about it in the West, featuring an "In the Words of the Enemy" section.
