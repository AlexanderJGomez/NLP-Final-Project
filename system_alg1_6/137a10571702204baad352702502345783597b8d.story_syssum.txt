For much of the past decade, Iran's nuclear weapons development program has been one of the top national security concerns for the United States.
In pushing for ever more punitive sanctions, we held out the hope that by increasing the economic pressure enough, we might be able to force Iran to give up its nuclear weapons ambition and rejoin the community of nations.
Advocates of this approach say that sanctions brought us to this point and passage of a new round of sanctions during the negotiations will improve the likelihood of success at the bargaining table.
The Iranians must be made to understand that if they walk away or cheat, the sanctions will be tightened to the point of strangulation -- and the international community must be prepared to make good on that threat.
It is about seizing the opportunity to see whether we can end Iran's nuclear weapons program without resorting to military action.
The administration must not accept a bad deal -- and any interim agreement that provides sanctions relief must be easily and quickly reversible.
