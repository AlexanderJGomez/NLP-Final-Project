West Virginia law says that if a Senate vacancy is created within two and a half years of the end of a term, the appointed successor will automatically serve out the remainder of the term.
West Virginia law fails, however, to state exactly when a vacancy occurs.
"The people of West Virginia have lost a true champion, the United States Senate has lost a venerable institution, and America has lost a voice of principle and reason with the passing of Robert C. Byrd.
"Sen. Byrd was a fearless fighter for the constitution, his beloved state and its great people.
"It has been my greatest privilege to serve with Robert C. Byrd in the United States Senate.
"Sen. Byrd combined a devotion to the U.S. Constitution with a deep learning of history to defend the interests of his state and the traditions of the Senate.
...
He was a symbol of West Virginia, he was an outstanding senator, and he was extraordinary American."
