After a preliminary framework for a possible nuclear deal was reached between Iran and world powers, many here believe a final agreement is possible -- and most hope that widespread sanctions relief could be on the horizon.
"Today, our army is the source of our national stability," Rouhani said in his speech at the parade.
Major General Hassan Firouzabadi, the Chief of Staff of Iran's armed forces and a man who is close to Rouhani, told CNN he hopes the U.S. and Iran can work closer together to fight ISIS in Iraq.
"We trust the American people, but the tone of U.S. government and military officials is such that we still consider the U.S. a threat."
And even though many Iranians have high hopes for the interim nuclear deal, the leadership in Washington and Tehran is far more skeptical.
"Our main concern here is making sure that if Iran doesn't abide by its agreement, that we don't have to jump through a whole bunch of hoops in order to reinstate sanctions," U.S. President Barack Obama said last Friday.
