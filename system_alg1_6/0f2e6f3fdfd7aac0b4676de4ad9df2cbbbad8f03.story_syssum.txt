"Floods are always more difficult to raise money for than dramatic seismic events that happen suddenly, because the scale of it only creeps up on people," Wynter said.
"It's very hard to compare disasters," said Nicholas Reader, spokesman for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).
In Haiti, about 3 million lives were disrupted and more than 200,000 people died in the massive January earthquake.
"The public is not as shocked by a disaster if the death toll is lower, so we are trying to really push this emergency into the headlines so people understand the enormity of it," said Maurizio Giuliano, spokesman for OCHA in Pakistan.
Many people associate Pakistan with Islamic militancy.
"In the meantime, many more thousands of people in Pakistan will die as a result of these floods."
People are suffering in Pakistan.
Over and over again.
