(CNN) -- The big winners of this Formula One season could be road drivers rather than F1 racers, according to one former world champion.
I think the technology will flow to road cars very quickly.
Hamilton, a world champion in 2008, set the fastest time on the final day of the final test event in Bahrain, but the quickest lap time of preseason was set by Felipe Massa of Williams.
It's a move that Scheckter thinks will see the fight for the world championship go down to the wire.
No it's not, but it makes exciting racing.
