One of the most urgent is child farm labor.
Children 14 and older can work long hours at all but the most dangerous farm jobs without their parents' consent, if they do not miss school.
In 2011 Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis proposed more stringent agricultural labor rules for children under 16, but Obama scrapped them just eight months later.
According to the 2010 Human Rights Watch report, the Department of Labor employees were spread so thin that, despite widespread reports of infractions they found only 36 child labor violations and two child hazardous order violations in agriculture nationwide.
Farm parents, their children, and the American Farm Bureau objected strenuously to the proposed new rules.
And until the economy stabilizes, the savings farms realize by hiring children makes it likely that even more of them will be subject to the dangers of farm work.
Unenforced rules won't protect the nearly million other children who work on farms.
