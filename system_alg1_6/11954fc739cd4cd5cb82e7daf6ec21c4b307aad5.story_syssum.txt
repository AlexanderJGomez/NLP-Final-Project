LONDON, England (CNN) -- London police said Thursday they are planning one of the largest and most complex operations in their history as the city gears up to host the G-20 summit next week.
O'Brien would not say how many police officers would be on duty, but he said there were 10,500 police shifts being scheduled between March 24 and April 2.
The one-day summit is already attracting a "significant amount of interest" from protest groups, O'Brien said.
Police expect some 20,000 people to turn out, O'Brien said.
O'Brien said only that police were prepared for a "range of instances."
"The vast majority of firms will have robust security arrangements in place," said the Chamber's chief executive, Colin Stanbridge.
"We're up for it and we're up to it."
