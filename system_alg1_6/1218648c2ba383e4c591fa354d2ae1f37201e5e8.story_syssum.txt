Roland S. Martin says issue of Obama's birth certificate is being pushed by conspiracy theorists.
From the moment President Obama entered the race, he has had to endure the so-called flag-waving American patriots who think they are the arbiters of what's right for the country.
They will then accuse the president of doctoring the document and ordering up the state of Hawaii and federal officials to create the birth certificate.
President Obama is right to ignore these losers.
In such difficult times, we all need a good laugh every now and then, and you provide great comic fodder.
