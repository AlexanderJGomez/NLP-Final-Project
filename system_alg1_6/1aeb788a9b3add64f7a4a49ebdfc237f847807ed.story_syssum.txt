The pilot, identified as Marcus Schrenker, 38, later checked into a hotel in Alabama under a fake name and then put on a black cap and fled into woods, authorities in Alabama said, according to the Santa Rosa County Sheriff's Office in Milton, Florida.
Public documents list Schrenker as president of an Indianapolis agency called Heritage Wealth Management.
Schrenker "appears to have intentionally abandoned the plane after putting it on autopilot over the Birmingham, Alabama, area and parachuting to the ground" Sunday night, the sheriff's office said in a news release.
The plane appeared to have been put on autopilot around 2,000 feet altitude, said Sgt.
The plane had been scheduled to land in Destin, Florida, authorities said.
The Childersburg police didn't know about the plane crash, so they took Schrenker to a nearby hotel, authorities said.
Harpersville is 30 minutes east of Birmingham, and about 223 miles north of Milton, Florida, near where the wrecked plane was found.
Kathleen Bergen, spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration, said a "detailed review of radar data" and the fact that the plane had switched to autopilot suggested the pilot might have parachuted.
