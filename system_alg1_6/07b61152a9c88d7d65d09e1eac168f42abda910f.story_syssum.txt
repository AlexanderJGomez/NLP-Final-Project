Lopez took his own .45-caliber handgun onto the sprawling post Wednesday and killed three people and wounded 16 more before taking his own life, according to authorities.
A family spokesman confirmed the account belonged to Lopez.
Full of hate.
In another Facebook post, Lopez talked about Lanza, 20, who killed his mother, Nancy, before fatally shooting 20 children, six staff members and himself at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown in December 2012.
It has been exactly 1 year and 2 days since left Iraq seeing in Fallujah the most brutal explosion...
Lt. Gen. Mark Milley, the post's commanding general, said Lopez did not experience direct combat in Iraq.
The soldier was told he would have to come back later, Otis said.
Glidden Lopez Torres, a family spokesman, said Lopez' mother, Carmen, an emergency room nurse in their hometown, died of a heart attack in November.
The spokesman, not related to the soldier, said Lopez attended the funeral but was disappointed that it took about five days for his 24-hour leave to be approved by the military.
