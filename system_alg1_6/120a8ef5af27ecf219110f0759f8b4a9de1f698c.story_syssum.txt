Along with the best picture and best director nominations, the film also earned nods for best actor (Daniel Day-Lewis), best supporting actress (Sally Field), best supporting actor (Tommy Lee Jones) and best adapted screenplay (Tony Kushner).
"Les Miserables" and "Silver Linings Playbook" both received eight nominations, including for best picture.
Washington received his sixth nomination, a best actor pick for "Flight."
"Beasts," a magical-realist fable about a little girl and her father surviving the caprices of weather, emotion and civilization off the Louisiana coast, received four nominations: best picture, best director (Benh Zeitlin), best actress (Wallis) and best adapted screenplay.
...
Wallis was considered too young by some -- "Sorry, Quvenzhane Wallis, but Best Actress Oscar Nods Are for Big Kids," read a headline in The Atlantic -- and Zeitlin's directing competition included Quentin Tarantino ("Django Unchained"), Kathryn Bigelow ("Zero Dark Thirty"), Ben Affleck ("Argo") and Tom Hooper ("Les Miserables").
Other best actress nominees are Jessica Chastain ("Zero Dark Thirty"), Jennifer Lawrence ("Silver Linings Playbook") and Naomi Watts ("The Impossible").
After its nomination for best picture, the Center for Constitutional Rights, a legal advocacy organization, released a statement in protest.
The movie, however, picked up best picture and best original screenplay nominations.
Tarantino is still better off than Wes Anderson, whose "Moonrise Kingdom" picked up just one nomination, for original screenplay.
He got a nomination for co-writing one of the original song nominees, "Everybody Needs a Best Friend."
The show will air from the Dolby Theatre -- formerly known as the Kodak Theatre -- in Los Angeles.
