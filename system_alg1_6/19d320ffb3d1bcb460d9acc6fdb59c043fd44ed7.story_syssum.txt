"Everyone in the Chargers family is sad today after hearing the news about Paul," a statement from the NFL team said.
"We appreciate all the thoughts and prayers," Oliver's family said in a statement to The San Diego Union-Tribune.
The county medical examiner ruled the death a suicide by handgun and gave police authorization to release the cause.
Oliver's high school coach in Georgia, Bruce Cobleigh, said Oliver was a leader.
Suicides of some other former NFL players involved brain injuries.
In February 2011, former Chicago Bears defensive back Dave Duerson, 50, committed suicide with a gunshot to the chest, rather than his head, so his brain could be researched for CTE.
The NFL launched a crisis support line in July 2012 for players, former players and their families.
