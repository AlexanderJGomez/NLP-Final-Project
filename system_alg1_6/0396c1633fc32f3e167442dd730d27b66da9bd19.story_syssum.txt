Dr. Joseph Adelegan has pioneered new energy sources, including using cow waste to create cooking gas.
His project "Power to the Poor: Off-Grid Lighting from Cassava Waste in Nigeria," was awarded a $250,000 grant in May from the World Bank after being named one of the best projects in Africa.
Using this method, Adelegan says he hopes to generate 200kw daily, which will provide basic electricity for more than 2000 households initially.
The scheme will cost $310,000 and will become profitable in little over three years, Adelegan says.
Enter Chewang Norphel, a softly-spoken but sprightly 72-year-old has created artificial glaciers and managed to generate water and greenery in this barren landscape.
So that local farmers get a real headstart when they need it most," Norphel says.
For Norphel, there are several advantages of an artificial glacier over a natural one.
One artificial glacier costs just $7,000, compared to $34,000 for a dam.
In 1996, one year after he had retired, Norphel joined the Leh Nutrition Project, a non-governmental organization, as project manager for watershed development.
