It was two days after ADM fired Whitacre and accused him of embezzling millions from the company.
"He didn't want to talk to a 52-year-old Mark Whitacre while preparing for the role, the Mark Whitacre who went to prison, who has been treated for bipolar disorder, who is now COO of a company," said Whitacre, who is now an executive for a small food supplement maker.
"As a result of this case, the Department of Justice and the FBI started looking around to see if they could find any other cases like this," said Dean Paisley, a retired FBI agent who supervised the undercover ADM work.
"The movie should be taken very, very seriously," said Sam Antar, a CPA who turned government witness against his employer in the 1980's.

"There were no provisions for similar checks and balances with Whitacre," Paisley said.
