Washington (CNN) -- A divided federal appeals court has ruled that federal regulators went too far with new rules to control air pollution in parts of the eastern United States.
Kavanaugh described a "Catch-22" scenario that would make it hard for states to comply with federal rules.
Under the Clean Air Act, the good neighbor provision requires upwind states to bear responsibility for what the appeals court said was their fair share of "the mess" in downwind states.
"Yet another federal court has reined in an overreaching EPA for violating federal law and intruding on Texas sovereignty," Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said.
The federal government now has the option now of asking the Supreme Court to accept the case for review.
