But last week, with one tweet, Savage returned to our lives: "I'm going to be a father!"
Ben Savage: It's been pretty .
.
As important as it is to a lot of fans and a lot of people who watched our show, it's just as important to me after all this time.
I know a lot of people grew up with that show.
And so, to a lot of people, this show means a lot.
We were just having fun on that show.
It was just a fun experience.
But I think that everyone associated with the show wanted to make sure that if we were to come back, that we weren't going to do it in a way that was going to be a disservice to the show.
.
I think it was just a matter of making sure all of us were on the same page about what we were going to do in terms of making the show last another seven years, hopefully.
Savage: We're going to wait and see what happens.
Savage: [laughs] That's definitely an interesting way to go.
Why not?
Savage: Well, I dunno [laughs].
Savage: Perhaps.
Savage: Exactly.
I'll just say, again, going back to our favorite word, it's always very flattering when people recognize me.
