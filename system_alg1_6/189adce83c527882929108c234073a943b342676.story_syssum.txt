So many are now imagining an end to the energy crisis.
We need to innovate alternative energy sources now more than ever ... and our choices are limited.
The catch is fusion is very hard to do.
We must now extend that duration and power and innovate technologies to make fusion electricity at a price that the consumer will pay.
Called ITER -- it is designed to reach a self-sustaining fusion burn -- the last scientific hurdle to fusion power.
If we continue to starve the technological research agenda of funds, however, we risk delaying fusion power and ceding technological leadership to China and Korea.
Fusion research including ITER construction is less than â‚¬1.5 billion ($2 billion) a year -- not even 0.05% of the market.
Only if we sufficiently fund alternative energy research now.
