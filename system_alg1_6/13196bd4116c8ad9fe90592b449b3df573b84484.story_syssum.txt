(CNN) -- Prosecutors have offered Ariel Castro, a Cleveland man accused of holding three women captive for close to a decade, a plea deal that removes the possibility of the death penalty, a Cuyahoga County courts source said Thursday.
"It's safe to say (Castro) wouldn't take a deal with the death penalty," the source said.
