Manchester, New Hampshire (CNN) -- The trail of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev has led investigators to the New Hampshire home of a former Chechen rebel living in exile, a law enforcement official told CNN on Friday.
In an interview this week with Voice of America, Khadjimuradov said he believes federal investigators questioned him because they wanted to know whether Tsarnaev had used a shooting range in the area.
Authorities have said the surviving Tsarnaev brother told investigators that no one else was involved.
Authorities have said they believe the brothers acted alone, but are investigating whether they could have learned from or been aided by terror groups, including groups overseas.
In his statement, Khadjimuradov said he understood why authorities wanted to talk to him and that he fully cooperated.
