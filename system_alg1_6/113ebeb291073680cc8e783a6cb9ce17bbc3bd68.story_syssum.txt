To help you, Travel + Leisure has assembled the ultimate online guide.
Decide how much you want to spend and when you want to travel, and Getaway Maps will overlay the lowest fares pulled from more than 500 airlines (most of the major U.S. carriers, as well as many international ones) for a select range of cities.
Caveat: Farecast covers only 78 cities, all of them in the United States.
Caveat: Menus may be a bit stale; 3,000 to 5,000 are updated per month.
Like most airlines these days, the site is no-frills, but you'll never get stuck next to the bathroom again.
Caveat: Not a booking site, so prices usually aren't listed.
Caveat: It requires an extra step to convert from kilometers.
