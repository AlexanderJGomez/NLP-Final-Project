Etan Patz, who disappeared in 1979, was the first missing child featured in the milk carton campaigns of the 1980s.
When no one had seen Etan, she called police and filed a missing person's report.
Etan's case was the first of the milk carton campaigns of the mid-1980s.
They noticed that they looked a lot like Etan Patz, according to author Lisa R Cohen's book about the case, "After Etan: The Missing Child Case that Held America Captive."
Prosecutors in the Bronx and Manhattan pursued this lead, but concluded they did not have enough evidence to connect Ramos to Etan's disappearance, GraBois and a spokesperson for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said.
"Etan did not have an aunt in Washington Heights,"  GraBois said.
GraBois said he had Ramos transferred to a federal prison, and planted informants as his cell mates.
Anyone with information on the whereabouts of Etan Patz or that leads to the arrest and conviction of the individual responsible for his disappearance is asked to call the FBI/NYPD Etan Patz hotline: 212-384-2200.
