Scientists at the Smithsonian in Washington announced Thursday the discovery of a new species of mammal called the olinguito (pronounced oh-lin-GHEE-toe).
Previously, scientists had assumed that olinguitos were members of their sister species, the olingos, Helgen said.
Helgen began his detective work in pursuit of the new species when he set out about a decade ago to comprehensive study of olingos.
Cloud forests are "cloaked in fog," Helgen said.
The olinguito's misty high-elevation habitats in Colombia and Ecuador, and the tendency for the animal to stay in the trees, have helped keep the species relatively obscure to scientists until now, Helgen said.
The olinguito is not yet considered an endangered species, but there are threats to its home environment, Helgen said.
DNA from this olinguito shows that it is clearly not an olingo, Helgen said.
"It wasn't because she was fussy, it was because she was not at all even the same species," Helgen said.
