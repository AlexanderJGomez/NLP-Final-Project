(CNN) -- Canadian explorer Adam Shoalts knew he was heading into uncharted territory when he set out on a solo expedition to explore northeastern Canada's remote Again River.
Even Google Earth's low-resolution satellite imagery, all that's available for this remote part of Canada, is deficient for detecting waterfalls.
"In August 2012, I went back, this time alone, determined to canoe the river no matter what," he says.
He resurfaced, out of breath, and spotted his canoe upside down in an eddy near the riverbank.
This week, Shoalts is heading back to the Again River to continue his work for the Royal Canadian Geographical Society (RCGS).
Though Shoalts says gadgets are useful in the field, it's important not to rely on them completely.
For those with their own Magellan dreams, it's not too late to get into the game, says Shoalts.
