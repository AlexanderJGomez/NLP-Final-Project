The case examined whether the federal government can deny tax, health and pension benefits to same-sex couples in states where they can legally marry.
At issue was whether DOMA violates equal protection guarantees in the Fifth Amendment's due process clause as applied to same-sex couples legally married under the laws of their states.
"For same-sex couples who wished to be married, the state (of New York) acted to give their lawful conduct a lawful status.
Under DOMA, Social Security, pension and bankruptcy benefits, along with family medical leave protections and other federal provisions, did not apply to gay and lesbian couples legally married in states that recognize such unions.
Windsor was in New York when the ruling came down.
Children born today will grow up in a world without DOMA, and those same children who happen to be gay will be free to love and get married as Thea and I did, but with the same federal benefits, protections and dignity as everyone else," Windsor said.
That raised the question of whether any party could rightfully step in and defend the law.
The case is U.S. v. Windsor (12-307).
