The teen idol is just the latest young star to run afoul of both the police and public relations folks.
In recent years, Lindsay Lohan, Chris Brown and Amanda Bynes have dominated headlines with legal issues and rehab stints.
Lately, Bieber's reality is not looking so great.
Former child star Danny Bonaduce said on his Seattle radio show on KZOK-FM Thursday that Bieber's recent arrest could be just what the embattled teen star needs right now.
Other celebs have not bounced back as well as Spears.
Lindsay Lohan recently announced she will be starring in and producing a new film, and there's a six-episode documentary series on the way.
"Not 'I don't give a f***' to just be reckless and do whatever, but 'I don't give a f*** what they say," Bieber reportedly said.
