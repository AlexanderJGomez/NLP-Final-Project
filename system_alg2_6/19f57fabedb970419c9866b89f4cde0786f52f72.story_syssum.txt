The open displays of anti-Japanese fury, say some China watchers, is a convenient distraction for the Communist Party as it grapples with a fraught leadership transition marked by political scandal, murder, "disappearances" and infighting.

Of course we will fight for Diaoyu," the protester asks.
China normally clamps down on protests like this.
