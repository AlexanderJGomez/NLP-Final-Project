(CNN) -- Alex Ferguson is the legendary Manchester United coach who once sent a boot flying into the face of David Beckham, but a British sculptor has revealed a softer side to the formidable Scot.
The Old Trafford team has won 12 league titles under his stewardship, helping it to a record 19 English championships overall, in addition to two European Champions League triumphs.
"I'd already done the Matt Busby sculpture for Manchester United some 12-15 years ago," said Jackson, who in his role as royal sculptor has produced works ranging from the archangel Gabriel and Constantine the Great to the young Mozart.
"I went up to see him, took a lot of photographs of him and spent some time watching him at a match," explained Jackson, who also produced a sculpture of England's World Cup-winning squad of 1966 which is outside Wembley Stadium.
"It's an amalgam of everything I've seen of him and the meetings I've had with him.
"Sports sculptures, the tradition goes back to Greco-Roman times," said Jackson.
The sculpture of Ferguson will be the latest in a long line of monuments proudly displayed by English football clubs.
Newcastle United unveiled a statue of much-loved former manager Bobby Robson earlier this year.
