French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner has a reputation for challenging convention and authority.
Kouchner is a humanitarian as well as a patriot, with a strong commitment to human rights.
On Iran he is, in a way, merely echoing the words of his President who declared in a speech last month that a nuclear-armed Iran would be 'unacceptable' and describing the stand-off over its nuclear program as 'undoubtedly the most serious crisis before us today'.
Certainly Mr Kouchner is making clear that France no longer takes the view once expressed by President Chirac that a nuclear-armed Iran might be inevitable
