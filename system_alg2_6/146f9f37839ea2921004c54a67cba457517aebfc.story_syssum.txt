Daryn Webb had a plan, and for someone intent on "riding" a fridge down the side of an active volcano, a great deal of optimism might be assumed too.
Perhaps because his home was getting a little breezy and running low on appliances, he eventually gathered some tools and wood and knocked up the world's very first volcano board, later to belt down the same volcano with more success.
Cerro Negro is a baby in geological terms, the youngest volcano, in fact, in all of Central America -- some boast in an area with such a fund of them.
This is probably the only place in the world you can book a tour to go volcano boarding.
"To our knowledge, volcano boarding is only possible on Cerro Negro," says Timothy Brauning of the Bigfoot tour company, which leads volcano boarding trips.
"Who's up?"
Then I'm up.
I see the spill coming in plenty of time though, and I pull the volcano boarding equivalent of the ejector seat, hurling myself sideways.
An Australian guy, who claims second place, looks crushed.
Volcano boarding can be booked through various local companies including Bigfoot based in Leon.
Tours run most days, year round, weather permitting.
