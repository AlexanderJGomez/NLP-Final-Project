(CNN) -- The deportations of thousands of Mexicans who have served time in U.S. jails into Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, are adding a deadly ingredient to an already volatile state of security, Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz said.
"We know they were deported from the U.S.
Of those deported through El Paso, about 6,800 were criminal aliens, Zamarripa said.
The deportation flights from Arizona to Mexico are happening because it is a high-traffic area for illegal immigrants, and because that's where the government of Mexico agreed to the program.
In a recent conversation, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the United States would work to give Juarez more details about who is being dropped off on its doorstep, Reyes Ferriz said.
