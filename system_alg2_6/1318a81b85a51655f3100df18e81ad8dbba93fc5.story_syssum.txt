First lady Michelle Obama dazzled in a Jason Wu original gown.
In choosing Wu, who is originally from Taiwan, Obama continues a tradition of wearing American designers who hail from other countries.
Aside from being a socially conscious purveyor of style, Obama also sends a clear message of hope and promise by choosing colorful, reasonably priced pieces.
"Michelle Obama has a specific style that works for her.
It's all about looking polished, like you know what you're doing."
