In rainy weather it curves to increase downforce for a safer drive, and straightens out when the downpour clears.
"Any place that uses robotics today, you could use materials and have the same capabilities," says Skylar Tibbits, a computational architect who leads the Lab and the movement.
The materials are 3D-printed into specific shapes and then autonomously transform into another, with wide-ranging implications for industry from automotive to medical to military.
In addition to BAC, the team are collaborating with Airbus to develop the wing design.
Demand for 4D is reaching a fever pitch, says Dr. Junus Kahn, founder of Carbitex, which produces the materials used by the Self-Assembly Lab, as well as supplying them to major business clients.
"Everyone is always scared that technology will take our jobs," says Tibbits, rolling his eyes.
If the full scale of his vision is realized, we might need to do little else.
