Wisely supporting the green trend, Ford chose to combine two important concepts in the debut of a single vehicle, the Ford Explorer America.
Here are the highlights of the technology that Ford will roll out in the 2009 Lincoln MKS luxury sedan; the so-called Eco-Boost engine features turbocharging and direct-injection.
Compared with the current cost of diesel and hybrid technologies, customers can expect to recoup their initial investment in a 4-cylinder EcoBoost engine through fuel economy savings in approximately 30 months.
Perhaps this is what Captain America would drive ... after all, there's plenty of room in this 6-passenger mid-size SUV for his shield and other members of the Justice League.
