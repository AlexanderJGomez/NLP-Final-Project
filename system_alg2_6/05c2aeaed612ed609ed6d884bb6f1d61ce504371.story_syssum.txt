London, England (CNN) -- China will execute within a few hours a British man convicted of smuggling heroin, his family said Monday.
"Both Chinese and international law clearly indicate that a person who committed a crime while suffering from significant mental illness should not be subjected to the death penalty," Alston said in a statement released by Reprieve, a British legal group.
"The British Government has been doing and will continue to do everything within its power to secure a fair trial and clemency on the death penalty for Akmal Shaikh," a Downing Street spokesman said Monday.
During the trial, the defendant has been guaranteed his legal rights," Jiang Yu, spokeswoman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said last week.
A spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told CNN in October there was no evidence of mental illness.
Shaikh said he was given a suitcase to carry by another man who had duped him into believing he was traveling to China to become a nightclub performer, and was unaware that the bag contained drugs.
Forensic psychologist Peter Schaapveld said he suspects Shaikh is suffering from a severe mental disorder.
