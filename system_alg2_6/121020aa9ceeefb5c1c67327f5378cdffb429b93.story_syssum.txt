(CNN) -- Washington and Lee University cited slavery's "regrettable" role in the Virginia school's history and announced that it will remove Confederate battle flags from a chapel that serves as a major meeting place.
The original flags will be placed on rotating display at Lee Chapel Museum in a more "appropriate location" where the stories behind them can be properly told, wrote Ruscio.
He said some students felt uncomfortable with the flags at Lee Chapel.
But I do think what was incredibly encouraging was the care the administration used with these issues," Stroud said.
In his letter Tuesday, the administrator said the purpose of the historic flags in a campus setting is to educate.
