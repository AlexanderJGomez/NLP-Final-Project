State Sen. Chris McDaniel said Friday on CNN's "New Day" that "the integrity of the process matters.
McDaniel alleges that some Democrats who voted in the runoff had previously cast a ballot in their party's Senate primary.
McDaniel said on "New Day" that the process "won't drag out too much longer.
It needs to happen for the integrity of the election process."
Chris McDaniel doesn't care anything about the integrity of the process.
On Wednesday's Cochran campaign conference call, a person who appeared to be a McDaniel supporter asked "since black people harvested cotton, why is it OK to harvest their votes?
As to endorsing or going forward with Thad Cochran or whoever else, I'm going to have to make that call after all this is said and done."
