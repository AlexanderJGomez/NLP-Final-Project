(CNN) -- Sitting inside the quaint tasting room of Chateau O'Brien, an award-winning French-style winery in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Northern Virginia, co-owner Debbie O'Brien pours some of the best red wine in the region.
Take Delaplane Cellars, a family winery owned by Jim and Betsy Dolphin that boasts panoramic views of the Northern Virginia mountains in a spacious, contemporary setting.
Wines at Delaplane Cellars include crisp whites like Chardonnay and Viognier and complex red wines that include Melange Rouge, William's Gap Reserve, and Cabernet Franc.
For red wines only, visit Boxwood Wineries in Middleburg, Virginia, a picturesque property owned by John Kent Cooke, the former owner of the NFL's Washington Redskins.
Since the Tannat flourishes in humid climates, Virginia is the perfect region to harvest the grape.
"It's all about the fruit -- and patience."
The Ashby Inn & Restaurant is only a 10-minute drive from Delaplane Cellars.
There are 18 rooms in six separate cottages.
The restaurant serves great food for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
