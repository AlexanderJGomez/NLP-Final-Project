(CNN) -- Anna Hazare, the 74-year-old Indian activist set to begin a 15-day hunger strike at a public venue, delivered a message Thursday to the thousands who have taken to the streets in support of his anti-corruption crusade.
The public will continue to be on the streets as long as this Lokpal isn't created."
He accepted a police proposal that will allow him to fast in New Delhi for two weeks.
Hazare only recently rose to national prominence, as his protest seems to have struck a chord with Indian society across the spectrum because corruption is pervasive at all levels of government, observers say.
As a result, Hazare was detained, as were 1,300 supporters who planned to join Hazare at a protest site.
The group had refused to leave the prison office until they are allowed to hold their hunger strike without the conditions, the jail spokesman said.
"Our government acknowledges the right of citizens to hold peaceful protests," he said, adding that Hazare and his supporters would have been allowed to hold their protest fast if they had accepted the conditions.
In fact, we will have to act simultaneously on many fronts," Singh said.
"We have no demands of the government," he said.
