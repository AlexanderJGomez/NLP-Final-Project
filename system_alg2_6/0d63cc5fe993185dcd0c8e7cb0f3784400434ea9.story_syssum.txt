Police also announced the arrest of the man they say killed Anjelica and dumped her body along the Henry Hudson Parkway.
It led detectives to Anjelica's sister, now an adult; from there, they identified the woman believed to be the girl's mother, he said.
Police arrested Juarez after questioning him near the Manhattan restaurant where he worked as a dishwasher, Kelly said.
Juarez, who was 30 at the time of the crime, said he went to an apartment in Queens shared by seven of his relatives and saw Anjelica in the hallway, Kelly said.
It was the sister who told Juarez to get rid of the body and who provided the cooler, Kelly said.
Jerry Giorgio, who worked on the case from the start, said he was "elated" at news of the arrest.
From there, investigators constructed a family tree, and the trail led them to Juarez, Kelly said.
