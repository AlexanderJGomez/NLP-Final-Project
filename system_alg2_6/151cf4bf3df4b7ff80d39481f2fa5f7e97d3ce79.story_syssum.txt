Agadir, Morocco (CNN) -- In Agadir, the arid heartland of Morocco's indigenous Berber population, a quiet oil boom is gaining momentum, one drop at a time.
But times have changed, and according to the Argan Oil Society, all the co-operatives are now staffed and run by local women.
Charrouf says that the new-found international popularity of argan oil -- which she describes as "liquid gold" -- has not only provided about 5,000 jobs for Berber women across 170 co-ops, but also an important social lifeline.
"The purpose of this work is to preserve the argan tree, because it was in decline," she said.
For now at least, the work is steady.
"Economically, (because) the price is increasing; socially, because the women can get outside the house and learn; and environmentally, because we can plant these trees."
