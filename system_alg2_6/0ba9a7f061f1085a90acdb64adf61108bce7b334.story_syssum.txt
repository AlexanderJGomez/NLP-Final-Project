(CNN) -- After nearly 15 months being held captive by suspected Islamic militants in the southern Philippines, Warren Rodwell is emaciated, exhausted but delighted to be free at last.
"I'm sure you will understand that this has been a very difficult and exhausting ordeal for Warren," his brother Wayne Rodwell said at the same briefing.
Reports in the Australian and Philippine news media suggested that Rodwell's family had paid a ransom worth nearly $100,000 in return for his release.
"We wish the Philippine police every success in tracking down the group that took Warren from his home," Cappello said.
"Mr. Rodwell's family have shown a great deal of courage and stoicism in what has been a tremendously difficult situation," she said.
