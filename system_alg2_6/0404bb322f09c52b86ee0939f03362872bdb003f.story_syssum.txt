The Fastnet race still remains one of the biggest events in the yachting calendar.
"It was a catastrophic event that had far-reaching consequences for the sport, the biggest of which was in the design and safety of the boats," Rodger Witt, editor of the UK-based magazine Sailing Today told CNN.
Improvements were also made to the safety harnesses that tied crewmen to their boats, many of which proved ineffective in the tragedy.
Ware said that even today the tragedy "still spooks me."
Ware said the worst part for him was fielding calls from concerned relatives.
"I found myself talking to a woman whose husband I knew was in one of the boats where there'd been fatalities.
