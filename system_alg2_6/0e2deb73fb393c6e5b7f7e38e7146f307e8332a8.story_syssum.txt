Scientists at the Smithsonian in Washington announced Thursday the discovery of a new species of mammal called the olinguito (pronounced oh-lin-GHEE-toe).
Previously, scientists had assumed that olinguitos were members of their sister species, the olingos, Helgen said.
Helgen began his detective work in pursuit of the new species when he set out about a decade ago to comprehensive study of olingos.
Even people who live in the Andes had the same confusion about olinguitos being olingos, because humans don't hunt them and the creatures stay in the trees, Helgen said.
The olinguito's misty high-elevation habitats in Colombia and Ecuador, and the tendency for the animal to stay in the trees, have helped keep the species relatively obscure to scientists until now, Helgen said.
"It shows us that there's a long way to go to exploring the whole world, but especially maybe these cloud forests," Helgen said.
DNA from this olinguito shows that it is clearly not an olingo, Helgen said.
"It wasn't because she was fussy, it was because she was not at all even the same species," Helgen said.
