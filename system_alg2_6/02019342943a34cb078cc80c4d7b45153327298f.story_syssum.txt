As of Wednesday, the government had registered over 450,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) who have been fleeing the area in view of the aerial bombardments and warnings by military authorities.
The military has taken extraordinary steps, especially in terms of its public relations efforts, to minimize the fallout in public perception.
The government has established one camp in Bannu, but many more facilities are needed, especially during the hot summer season.
The minister in charge of the government response â€” the Federal Minister for States and Frontier Regions retired Lt Gen Abdul Qadri Baloch -- has said "every reasonable need of the IDPs will be taken care of in the best possible manner and money is not an issue."
The people of North Waziristan -- and the tribal region FATA -- have been stranded between the military and the militants for more than a decade.
According to government officials, Pakistan has reported 65 polio cases from FATA this year of which 50 alone pertained to North Waziristan.
There is also an opportunity to rebuild FATA, which has been governed since the British times as a remote outpost of the Empire with little or no rights for the local population.
This requires a civil-military consensus.
