Libertarian candidate Amanda Swafford is pulling 5% of the vote in Georgia, keeping Nunn and Perdue from reaching the 50% threshold.
The CNN/ORC poll, conducted by telephone October 19-22 with 565 likely voters, indicates Carter has a 48%-46% advantage over Deal, while Libertarian candidate Andrew Hunt gets 6% support.
Nunn has a particular advantage over Perdue among likely women voters, 56%-38%, and among likely voters who live in the all-important suburbs that dominate much of the state's political scene, Holland added.
