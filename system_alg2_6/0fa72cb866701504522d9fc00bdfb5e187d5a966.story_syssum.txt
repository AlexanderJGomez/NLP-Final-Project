Voters are unhappy with everyone, which includes President Barack Obama, Democrats and Republicans.
Expect to hear Democrats complain loudly that Republicans are going to try to impeach Obama, that an attempt to sue the President is a useless partisan exercise designed to fundraise from conservatives across the country and that women should be very afraid of the Supreme Court decision on contraceptives.
Voters are desperate to know about what can be accomplished to help them.
The Democrats will likely point to some positive economic indicators and rising consumer confidence to show that it is turning around.
Republicans can show they have a plan to turn around the economy faster, but rightfully point out the inaction by the Senate Democrats to address Republican plans.
And people are mad at Washington.
This means that Americans could lean toward the GOP when they vote this November, if the focus is kept on what people are demanding to know, which is, "How we get out of this mess?"
