Australian luxury yacht captain Drew Gollan was killed in January in English Harbor, Antigua.
In a press release, the Antigua Charter Yacht Meeting acknowledged that "a number of boats have decided to leave Antigua in the wake of this incident."
An international charter company manager and luxury yacht industry expert, Els Bucknell, said yacht crews and clients were "shocked and saddened" by the deaths, and there would likely be a short-term impact on the Caribbean region.
"Most people assumed that this part of Antigua was safe and I think it has come as a shock," she said.
