"I still use [microblogging website] Weibo for a lot of things but new things like Pengpeng come up all the time -- this one is pretty good actually.
"We have four million users which makes it one of the fastest growing mobile apps in China," Tian told CNN.
Pengpeng uses location-based technology that allows users to meet strangers through playing games.
"We see mobile social apps as something like an amusement park -- you come and you're always playing with other people; you meet them in a 'no pressure' way," he says.
Twitter, Facebook and YouTube have been locked out of the Chinese market since 2009, leaving the field open to homegrown social media sites such as Sina Weibo and Tencent Weibo.
"Sites such as UMi and Mimi are gaining more and more users -- it won't become mainstream however," Wang says.
As for Pengpeng, users are as anonymous or as open as they want to be.
