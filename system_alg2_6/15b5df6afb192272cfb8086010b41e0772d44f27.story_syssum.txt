Washington (CNN) -- A federal appeals court in Washington Thursday struck down the Texas voter ID law requiring photos for voters at the polls, calling it racially discriminatory.
The panel of judges for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia also said it was ruling only on the Texas law, and not issuing a statement about other state voting laws.
Democrats claim there is no voter fraud issue, and that the laws are designed to reduce voting by poor minorities.
"Chalk up another victory for fraud," said Gov.
Earlier this month, a state court in Pennsylvania approved a voter ID law requiring photo identification at the polls.
