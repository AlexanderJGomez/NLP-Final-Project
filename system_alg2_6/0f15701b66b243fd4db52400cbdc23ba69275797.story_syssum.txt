(CNN) -- Another week, another North Korean provocation.
Not necessarily, argue some of those closely familiar with North Korea.
"The timing and the intensity of North Korea's provocations (since Kim Jong Un took office) clearly demonstrates a high tolerance for risk," said Ellen Kim, assistant director of the Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
Person said the latest incidents might reflect North Korean frustration on a number of issues, not least the recent joint military drills between South Korea and the United States, which Person described as the largest such exercises in two decades.
A troubling glimpse of what is going on inside North Korea came with a U.N. report released in February.
Even China, the closest thing North Korea has to a reliable ally, doesn't fully understand the power struggle going on at the top of the North Korean regime, suggested Minxin Pei, a leading China watcher and director of the Keck Center for International and Strategic Studies at Claremont McKenna College.
But Person suggested the supposed impenetrability of North Korea might sometimes be overplayed.
"But this is a very slippery slope -- and could easily turn nasty."
