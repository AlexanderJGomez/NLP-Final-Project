(CNN) -- If you took a moment during the heat of the presidential race to drop by the Mitt Romney campaign office, you would have been shocked by the number of white people working to get him elected.
Likewise with Hispanic voters, free health care was a big plus."

But Mitt, you need to check your facts and realize that there were a lot of white people who really didn't like you.
See, if you accept Romney's theory that minorities were a prime reason he lost, then he should have cleaned up in the Electoral College in those really, really, really white states.
This is why Mitt Romney shouldn't have been president.
You think that minorities and young people are a bunch of victims who just want free stuff, or as you call them, gifts.
We need a president who offers a vision for a more inclusive America, not one who sees health care, college loans and an initiative to deal with immigration reform as "gifts."
