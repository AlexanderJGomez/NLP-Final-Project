(CNN)In his writings, author Avijit Roy yearned for reason and humanism guided by science.
No one came to their aid as they were hacked down, a witness said.
Roy founded the religion critical blog Mukto Mona, which served multiple writers.
Very.
Roy and the blog's other critics took off the gloves when it came to religion, particularly Islam.
"The virus of faith was the weapon that made these atrocities possible," Roy wrote.
Mukto Mona contains sections titled "Science" and "Rationalism," but most of the articles hold science up to religion as a litmus test, which it invariably fails.
"A well-known extremist ... openly issued death threats to me through his numerous Facebook statuses," Roy wrote.
"Avijit was very idealistic," he said.
He never had a chance to.
