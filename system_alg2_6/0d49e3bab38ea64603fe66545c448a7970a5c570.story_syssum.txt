(CNN)  -- Arsenal will face Celtic in a mouthwatering all-British tie later this month to decide who reaches the Champions League group stages.
The losers will drop down to play in the Europa League, formerly the UEFA Cup.
Shakhtar won the UEFA Cup last season and will now be able to defend their title under the guise of the revamped Europa League.
