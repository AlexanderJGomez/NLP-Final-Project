On April 26, 1986, the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant's reactor No.
The reactor sits at the center of a 1,000-square-mile "Exclusion Zone," a quarantined no-man's land complete with border guards, passport control and radiation monitoring.
That story is partly embodied in an unlikely community of some 130 people, called "self-settlers" who, today, live inside the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.
About 116,000 people were evacuated from the Zone at the time of the accident.
One self-settler, Hanna Zavorotnya, told me how she snuck through the bushes back to her village in the summer of 1986.
When I asked Hanna about radiation, she replied: "Radiation doesn't scare me.
There is a simple defiance common among them: "They told us our legs would hurt, and they do," one 80-year-old woman told me.
"So what."
Of the old people who relocated, one Chernobyl medical technician, whose job is to give annual radiation exposure tests to zone workers  said: "Quite simply, they die of anguish."
How could this be?
Is the power of motherland, so fundamental to that part of the world, palliative?
Radiation or not, these women are at the end of their lives.
