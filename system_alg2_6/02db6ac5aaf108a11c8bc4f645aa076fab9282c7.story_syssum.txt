This week, Suu Kyi made a triumphant and stirring return to the world stage, traveling to the West, her home for 24 years before she became an accidental leader of the revolution and the regime's prisoner in her home in Yangon, the generals' new name for Rangoon.
She gave the speech more than 20 years after her chair had stood empty on the stage during awards ceremony in 1991, the year she won the prize, as she languished in isolation, enduring years of house arrest.
But then her mother became ill. She traveled to Burma from her home in Oxford to care for her.
Suu Kyi found herself as a top target of the regime.
She stayed a prisoner in Burma and never saw her husband again.
She won a seat in parliament in April elections, part of a slow process of promised democratization.
Without Suu Kyi, the world would not have known about the misery and repression that the junta had foisted on the Burmese people.
For years she was the one who insisted the West should not lift economic sanctions, even when that meant more hardships for her and her people.
She has proven she is one of the few people who truly deserve to become a hero, an icon of their time.
