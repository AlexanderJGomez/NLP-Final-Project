(CNN) -- Kim Jong Un, successor to his father's dictatorship over North Korea, will have to find ways to balance political factions and generate revenue -- or he may not remain in power for long, analysts said Tuesday.
"The way to view Kim Jong Un is almost as a CEO of North Korea Inc.," Park said.
North Koreans "know much more about the world than they did" when Kim Jong Il came to power, said Caryl, who last visited a few years ago.
If something were to end Kim Jong Un's time in power, it would be battling forces within the North Korean power structure.
Jayshree Bajoria of the Council on Foreign Relations writes that "even with a successor, North Korean observers have for some time feared a behind-the-scenes power struggle or nuclear instability after Kim Jong-Il's death."
Depending on the balance between the new people that support Kim Jong Un and the older generation that upheld Kim Jong Il, things may not necessarily go smoothly within the leadership," he said.
