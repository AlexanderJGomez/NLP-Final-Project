New York (CNN) -- The father of a 4-year-old boy tortured and beaten to death in New York will be freed from jail to attend his son's funeral, authorities said Thursday.
Wade must turn himself in February 6 and will be sentenced on February 21.
Kryzie King, 27, was indicted in connection with the boy's death in Manhattan criminal court Wednesday.
In a statement last week, King's attorney, Bryan Konoski, said: "My client is not charged with homicide at this time and she is presumed to be innocent of allegations against her.
King told police that Myls' father dropped the child off for her to watch December 17 and that she was the "child's primary and sole caretaker" until the time of his death, the complaint said.
"And god forbid when they happen, it is our job to learn from them and try to every time do better so we can reach more children."
