"The whole bridge from one side of the Mississippi to the other just completely gave way, fell all the way down," survivor Gary Babineau told CNN.
"I realized there was a school bus right next to me, and me and a couple of other guys went over and started lifting the kids off the bridge.
Occasionally, a pickup truck with a medic inside would drive to get an injured person and bring him back up even ground, Hink told CNN.
"I could see the whole bridge as it was going down, as it was falling," Babineau said.
I saw a couple cars fall," he said.
Melissa Hughes, 32, of Minneapolis, told The Associated Press that she was driving home when the western edge of the bridge collapsed under her.
Babineau told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune: "On the way down, I thought I was dead.
After the bridge settled and his car remained upright, "I just put in park, turned the key off and said, 'Oh, I'm alive,' " he said.
