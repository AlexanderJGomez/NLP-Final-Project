Christopher Coleman sits in the back of a police car after his arrest Tuesday in the slayings of his wife and two sons.
Coleman told police he left the house at 5:43 a.m. the day of the deaths and drove to a gym to work out.
In an article posted on the Major Case Squad's Web site, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper reported the message said something to the effect of, "I told you this would happen."
Joyce Meyer Ministries said in a statement Wednesday that it had learned of the charges against Coleman.
