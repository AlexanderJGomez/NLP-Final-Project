Actor Russell Johnson, best known as Professor in the 1960s TV sitcom "Gilligan's Island," died Thursday, his agent said.
Johnson worked up until his death, signing autographs over the holidays, said Eisenstadt.
Before becoming an actor, Johnson served in the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II.
"Most of us have to really learn how to do what we do, and that takes some studying and being part of an acting group," he said.
