Al-Maliki also said he hoped that members of Iraq's parliament would be able to choose a president and prime minister in their next session.
The political uncertainty comes as Iraqi forces battle Sunni extremist militants from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS.
Five more Russian-made Sukhoi Su-25 fighter jets have been delivered to Iraq, the Ministry of Defense said in a statement on Tuesday.
Iraq has now turned to Russia and Belarus to buy fighter jets, he said.
The Prime Minister did not say how he planned to address the move.
Iraqi military units around Baghdad are likely to stand and fight if ISIS militants attack the city, preliminary reports from U.S. military advisers in Iraq and U.S. intelligence personnel concluded, according to a senior U.S. official.
Atta said Iraqi forces have gained more ground from ISIS militants, many of whom have been killed or arrested.
In unrelated violence, at least three people were killed Tuesday night when Iraqi security forces clashed with supporters of a radical Shiite cleric, police and health officials said.
Nine people were wounded, and one military Humvee was set on fire, police said.
In 2006, the cleric's supporters attacked the Iranian Consulate in Basra, about 300 miles (500 kilometers) south of Baghdad.
