The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the railroad, said late Sunday that "alerter" systems -- which require engineers to respond to alerts, sound an alarm if they are unresponsive and eventually brake the train in an emergency-- will be installed in every operator cab within the next year.
A 2007 study of "alerter" technology by Massachusetts Institute of Technology said, "Engineers can become inattentive and keep hitting the alerter even when nodding off.
His cabin was equipped with a "dead man pedal" that required constant downward pressure with the foot to keep the train moving, the MTA has said.
By Tuesday morning, the MTA said, Metro-North also enhanced communication between engineers and conductors to ensure trains are operated at safe speeds at four other critical curves and five movable bridges.
It also said it believes that positive train control, a costly, high-tech system that targets human error, could have prevented the crash.
