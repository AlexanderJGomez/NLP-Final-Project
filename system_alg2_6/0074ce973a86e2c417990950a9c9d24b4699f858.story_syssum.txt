(CNN) -- Chelsea have completed the signing of England international defender Gary Cahill from Premier League rivals Bolton Wanderers for a fee of $10.7m.
However, he had already indicated he was not prepared to sign a new contract, meaning Wanderers were forced to sell him or lose him for free at the end of the season.
In other transfer news, Barcelona have announced that French defender Eric Abidal has signed a new deal with the club.
Abidal has made 177 appearances in four years with Barca, winning the Champions League twice and the Spanish La Liga three times.
