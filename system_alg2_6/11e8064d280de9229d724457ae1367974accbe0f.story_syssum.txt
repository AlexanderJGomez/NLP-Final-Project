(CNN) -- In her new book "10-10-10," Suzy Welch advocates a fast and reasoned approach to decision making by asking readers to think about the impact their decisions will have in 10 minutes, 10 months and 10 years.
I think gut is no way to live your life.
So I say, listen to your gut.
Watch Suzy Welch talk about decision-making paralysis Â»
Because people will make a great 10-10-10 decision and then not have the courage to live it.
If your values hurt other people for your own financial advancement, a good 10-10-10 decision isn't going to undo that.
...
Because like with that one, you're saying there are good things that come of it.
...
The book says very clearly that gut has its place.
Sometimes gut is great, and sometimes gut is just easy.
