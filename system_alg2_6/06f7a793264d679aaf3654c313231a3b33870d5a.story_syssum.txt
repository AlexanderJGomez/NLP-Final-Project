(CNN) -- Coinciding with this season's flu outbreak is an upsurge of another illness that can be dangerous, even deadly, especially for infants: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
"Just in general, when we look at cough and respiratory symptoms, there's a lot of overlap," said Dr. Susan Gerber, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
"I brought him in because he was wheezing and coughing," she says.
RSV spreads much like the flu -- exposure from others who are coughing or sneezing and by direct skin-to-skin contact.
Cooper Dearborn tested positive for RSV but responded quickly following a procedure to clear his lungs of congestion.
There currently is no vaccine for RSV.
