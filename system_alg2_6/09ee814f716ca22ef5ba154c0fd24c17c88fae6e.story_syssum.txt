Phil Spector's first murder trial in 2007 ended in a mistrial as jurors said they couldn't reach a verdict.
"The evidence did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty for the simple reason [that] he did not kill Lana Clarkson," Weinberg said.
Spector's first murder trial in 2007 ended in a mistrial as jurors said they couldn't reach a verdict after 15 days of deliberations.
Weinberg argued that the prosecution's case hinged on circumstantial evidence.
A female juror who declined to be identified told reporters the jurors considered all the evidence and testimony to reach their verdict.
Five women took the stand and testified that he had threatened them with firearms.
That was one of two Grammy Awards won by Spector, who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989.
