(CNN) -- The flight data and cockpit voice recorders from JetBlue Flight 191, which made an emergency landing this week, have been retrieved and will be analyzed, officials said Thursday.
Osbon turned off the radios in the aircraft, dimmed his monitors and sternly admonished the FO (first officer) for trying to talk on the radio," the U.S. attorney's office in the Northern District of Texas said in a written statement.
By that time, the first officer had summoned another JetBlue pilot who had been traveling as a passenger to enter the cockpit and the two locked themselves inside, the affidavit states.
Osbon, who was been charged with interfering with a flight crew, has not made a public statement.
He just did what he was paid to do," Jean Beatrice Dowd said of Jason Dowd.
The incident "has been earthshaking for us, too," she said.
He was in New York, speaking with officials about the incident, his mother said.
