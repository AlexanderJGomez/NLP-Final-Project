The mother of Brooke Stegall, 5, says opera gave her visually impaired child new confidence.
"These parents work so hard to make this happen," said Anne McComiskey, director of the program.
"First of all, we are teaching the parents how to teach their child," she said.
All of the children go to the center one day a week.
McComiskey says the performance reinforces lessons learned during the course of the program.
It's just many of the concepts that we have been teaching them for five years, coming to play in the opera."
McComiskey says that that is one of the goals of the program: to instill a sense of "I can" in the kids.
