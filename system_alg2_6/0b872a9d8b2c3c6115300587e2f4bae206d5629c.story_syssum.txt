Washington (CNN) -- Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin is two for two.
The Ryan Express chugged into the White House on Thursday with other House Republican leaders where he again waited for his opportunity to make an impact.
The White House admitted progress.
After Thursday's meeting, Republican Rep. Steve Southerland of Florida said they obviously respect each other.
"Paul and the President certainly have a pass through the last election and I think there's a great respect between them.
CNN's Gloria Borger put it this way: Ryan and President Obama have a "preexisting condition."
It was the first time Obama and Ryan had sat down together since the presidential race.
Obama later complimented Ryan, saying, "I think Paul Ryan is a pretty sincere guy and has a beautiful family."
