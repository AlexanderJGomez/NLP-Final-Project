More likely, Hernandez was one of hundreds of undocumented immigrants released from detention because of looming budget cuts set to take effect Friday absent congressional action.
The decision was made by career ICE employees, an administration official told CNN.
"Detainees with serious criminal histories are a detention priority and have not been released," she said.
Hernandez, the young man who was released in Georgia, can't know for sure that he was released because of budget cuts.
Most were given a paper with a court date, but not Hernandez.
