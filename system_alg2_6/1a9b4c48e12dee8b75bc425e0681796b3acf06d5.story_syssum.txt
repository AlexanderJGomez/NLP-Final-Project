Boyd, a fourth-generation black farmer himself, tells CNN that he wants Congress and the Obama administration to "step up" and deliver the money needed to fund the settlement.
The 1997 Pigford v. Glickman case against the U.S. Department of Agriculture claimed that black farmers were systematically denied government farm loans and support from federal programs because of the color of their skin.
Black farmers are dying when they were supposed to have received this settlement years ago."
That's what this is about.
He chose this tactic because he says the black farmers "are just marched out.
You know they're older now, they're dying.
Now, Boyd says he hopes to remain in Washington until a bill is passed funding the settlement.
"It's time for Congress and leaders in the Senate to start working for the American people and that includes the black farmers, too."
