An adjunct professor of French at Duquesne University.
The minimum pay for adjunct faculty at Duquesne used to be $2500 per course.
We are living a lie that cheats these professors and the students they teach, particularly in access universities and community colleges where adjunct faculty numbers, like percentages of lower-income students, are highest and instructional spending per student is lowest.
The larger issues are not about individual responsibility or culpability for actions toward Vojtko, but rather, about collective responsibility for the structural conditions of work that contributed to her circumstances, and that leave significant segments of the academic workforce with no benefits and low pay.
Or can we muster the collective will to appropriately remunerate and honor the work of all working Americans?
Adjuncts are organizing for benefits, a living wage, and conditions that will benefit their students and their schools.
American higher education can and should do better for those who teach our students.
