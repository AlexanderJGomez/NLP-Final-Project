They choose to stop paying, one way or another.
How do they choose to default?
So, the USA cannot really default, thanks in part to a strong Federal Reserve and international creditors still wanting to buy its bonds, no matter how low the interest rate falls.
From Argentina to Russia to North Korea, countries have stopped paying the interest or principle on domestic or international obligations.
They want their money back.
After all, it means a country can get a handle on its obligations.
New creditors stepped in, instead of walking away.
If not, that would be a default.
All this makes you wonder why the USA would even want to be mentioned in the same breath or paragraph with these countries.
