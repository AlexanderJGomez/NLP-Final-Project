MARDAN, Pakistan (CNN)  -- A family of 18 Pakistani men, women and children trudges down a dirt road toward a refugee camp.
Now, they are living in Mardan's rapidly growing tent city of more than 1,400 other displaced Pakistanis.
Khan's family has joined tens of thousands of other Pakistanis fleeing south to escape the escalating conflict between the military and Taliban militants in northwestern Pakistan.
Bessler spoke on a rooftop, overlooking the sprawling Jalozai refugee camp in western Pakistan.
Some accused camp administrators of corruption, allegations that aid workers have denied.
A fresh wave of displaced Pakistanis will only aggravate tensions, said Bessler, the U.N. official.
"There is a serious humanitarian crisis under way," Brack said.
"Whenever it is God's will, we will go back to our homes," says Mohammed Munir, an elderly man who fled with his family from the Buner district to the new camp in Mardan three days ago.
The man kneeled and prayed in the grass outside the entrance of a tent that his family now calls home.
