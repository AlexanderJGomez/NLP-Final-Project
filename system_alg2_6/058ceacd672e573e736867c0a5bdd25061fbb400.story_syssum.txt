Washington (CNN) -- As the Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial was officially dedicated Sunday, speakers called for carrying on King's ideals and values and confronting issues including bullying and social and economic justice for all Americans.
"Let us not be trapped by what is," Obama said.

"As we dedicate this monument, I can hear my father saying that oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever," she said.
"The very first time that I came to the site, I was almost overwhelmed," Martin Luther King III said.
"Let us not forget that he paid the ultimate price for our civil rights," he said.
If King were here today, said the Rev.
Of those that spoke near the Lincoln Memorial that day, "I'm the only one still around," he said.
He said he's heard talk that nothing has changed.

Singer Aretha Franklin sang "Take My Hand, Precious Lord," a tune she said King often requested.
"Martin Luther King is not only a hero of America, he's also a hero of the world," he said.
King's original words were: "If you want to say that I was a drum major, say that I was a drum major for justice.
Because he was not.
Ambassador, former Atlanta mayor and civil rights leader Andrew Young said King was sensitive about his small stature, as he stood only 5 feet 7 inches.
"Now he's 30 feet tall, looking down on everybody," Young said.
