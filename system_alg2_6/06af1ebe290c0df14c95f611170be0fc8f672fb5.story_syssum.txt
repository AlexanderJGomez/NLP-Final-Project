To Sony, releasing the Move is an obvious move for the PlayStation, given it believes it started the motion controller era with its Eye Toy.
Now, by unveiling the device's name it can begin what Dille said will be the company's biggest video game marketing effort of the year.
And later this year, the forthcoming game SOCOM 4 will incorporate both Move and the sub-controller.
