Philippines Coast Guard Rear Adm. Rodolfo Isorena said Wednesday that he hopes the salvaging will begin soon so that further damage to the reef will be limited, the Philippines News Agency said.
Various U.S. officials, including Navy Vice Adm. Scott Swift last month, have apologized to the Philippines for the incident, which the U.S. Navy and the Philippines Coast Guard are investigating.
One of the environmental concerns is that algae will grow on dead or scarred corals, park Superintendent Angelique Songco said.
The salvage operation also may hurt tourism, because it will happen at the start of the park's main tourism window of March to early June, Songco said.
