(CNN) -- South Carolina social workers were familiar with Timothy Jones Jr. long before police accused him of killing his five children and dumping them off a dirt road in Alabama, according to documents from the state Department of Social Services.
The first DSS visit came in September 2011, a report says, when a caseworker visited the home because of allegations that the kids -- at the time, only three -- were dirty and not attending school.
The caseworker called police, but when Jones arrived, he'd calmed down, the report states.
Four months ago, a South Carolina DSS case manager spoke to one of the children, who said Jones made them do exercises for punishment.
Jones admitted to the case manager that he had spanked his son, and the case manager told Jones to refrain from physical discipline.
The case was closed in July, but a case manager was called on August 13 after allegations that Jones beat his son, leaving bruising, and that he was not feeding them properly, at times making all five kids split a 20-piece chicken nugget dinner, the DSS report states.
It's unclear how or why Jones allegedly killed his children, but acting Sheriff Lewis McCarty of Lexington County told reporters that Jones drove for several days with their decomposing bodies in the back of his SUV.
They saw children's clothing but no children."
"We do not have all the answers and we may never have all of them, but anyone who knows little Tim will agree that he is not the animal that he will be portrayed through the media."
