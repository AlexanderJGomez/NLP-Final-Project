(CNN) -- A Dutch court intervened Friday to stop a 13-year-old girl from attempting to sail around the world by herself, stripping her parents of sole custody.
The court will then make a final ruling on whether her parents may have the final say about their daughter's plans, the court official said.
Laura believes she will be able to convince the court that she is fit to make the trip alone, de Lange said.
Just this week, a British teenager became the youngest person to sail around the world solo when he returned to Britain after a nine-month trip.
Is she an electrician?
he said.
