Can you tell me what Joe Cotton did?
Each of them won the Kentucky Derby horse race.
Bet you don't know Burgoo King.
Burgoo King was a no-go no-show.
Would you like to know why?
In 1958, when folks were giving thought to buying one of Ford's really cool new cars, the Edsel, a lot of them were impressed by Tim Tam when he took the Kentucky Derby with a tremendous stretch run, then ran first in the Preakness, as well.
Bet you don't know Canonero II.
That was him.
To see Smarty Jones.
He could run Secretariat-style and leave everyone else gagging on his dust, as he showed at the Preakness while winning by more than 11 lengths.
"Nobody else," I said.
He was 36-to-1.
Smarty Jones ran second that day.
Horse racing.
But you know what?
