"She's pretty cut up," said a performer who saw the violence at the "Gathering of the Juggalos" in rural Hardin County, Illinois.
They rocked the trailer and smashed its windows, the witness said.
The witness, who was standing in the rear of the stage, said the crowd of about 2,000 was immediately angry toward Tequila and she was unable to turn them around.
Tequila continued to perform even after her face started bleeding, he said.
This was not  the only violent incident at the festival early Saturday, Seiner said.
