Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- Christine O'Donnell shocked the political establishment last week with her victory in the Republican Senate primary in Delaware against Rep. Mike Castle.
During the Democratic primaries, Obama had differentiated himself from Sen. Hillary Clinton by blasting her for an "Inside the Beltway" mentality, depicting her as someone who, like her husband, was too willing to cut deals and too cozy with the interest groups that lurk on K Street.
The political process looks very much the same in 2010 as it did in 2008.
Unless Congress passes government reforms such as publicly financed elections to change that process, Tea Party politicians will either have to deal with it or languish.
Although Tea Party candidates castigate earmarks, government spending and pork barrel politics, all of those who are victorious will represent constituencies profoundly affected by the money that Congress allocates every year.
Voters should be extremely skeptical about the kinds of promises that candidates such as O'Donnell are making.
