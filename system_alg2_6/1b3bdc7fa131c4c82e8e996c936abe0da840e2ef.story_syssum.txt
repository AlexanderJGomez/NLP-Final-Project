(CNN)Noelle Velentzas, 28, couldn't understand why U.S. citizens like herself were traveling overseas to wage jihad when they could simply "make history" at home by unleashing terrorist attacks, according to a federal criminal complaint unsealed Thursday.
Velentzas and Siddiqui did not enter pleas when they appeared in federal court in Brooklyn on Thursday.
In the past 18 months, the Justice Department's National Security Division has prosecuted or is prosecuting more than 30 cases of people attempting to travel abroad to join or provide support to terrorist groups.
Velentzas and Siddiqui repeatedly expressed support for violent jihad, the complaint said.
"As alleged, the defendants in this case carefully studied how to construct an explosive device to launch an attack on the homeland," Loretta Lynch, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a statement.
In February, Velentzas and the undercover agent drove past a Home Depot in Queens.
Velentzas appeared to have experienced hardship in her life but was "working towards self-development and long-term stability," the statement said.
