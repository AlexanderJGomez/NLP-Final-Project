The case of Chandra Levy, a 24-year-old Washington intern whose body was found in a Washington park in 2002, is back in court, but the actions of a D.C. Superior Court judge have given it a mysterious air.
Carome predicted the secrecy surrounding hearings in the Levy case could last months.
Despite Fisher's restrictions on information, CNN has learned some key details of these unexpected hearings from Carome and court papers.
Two women testified that Guandique attacked them in the same park.
Condit testified at Guandique's trial and denied involvement in her disappearance and murder and was never charged.
Levy's father, Robert, told CNN that the family has not been told anything regarding the recent hearings.
