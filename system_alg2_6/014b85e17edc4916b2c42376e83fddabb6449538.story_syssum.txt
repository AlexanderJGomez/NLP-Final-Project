Randazzo kept surfing year-round and it paid off in 1990 when he started making a living off the ocean.
"He has absolutely paved the way for any surfer that wants to become a professional from New Jersey," says DePhillipo.
Randazzo became a professional surfer in 1990, yet he still couldn't find a sponsor to support him.
"Dean has paved the way," DePhillipo says, "There's never been a surfer from New Jersey or the Northeast that's made the World Tour."
"It's just one of those events that everybody wants to support even if they're not surfing, they want to support Dean," says Stacey Marchel, a Jersey surfer and the owner of Stacey's Surf Camp.
