Beijing (CNN) -- A day before the Nobel committee honors an imprisoned Chinese dissident with its peace prize, China ratched up the rhetoric calling the award "an interference" in its internal affairs.
"Liu Xiaobo broke Article 105, a crime of instigating the subversion of state power," Jiang said Thursday.
An official from the United Nations said the U.N. is not going to attend the ceremony, but said that is not unusual.
Labeed Abawi, Iraq's deputy foreign affairs minister, said officials had not yet decided if they would attend the ceremony.
