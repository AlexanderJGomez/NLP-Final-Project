NEW YORK (CNN) -- The New York City Council on Thursday voted in favor of a bill that would extend term limits, allowing Mayor Michael Bloomberg to run for a third term.
Earlier, the council voted 22 in favor and 28, with one abstention, against an amendment to the bill that would have called for a voter referendum on the issue of term limits.
"Mayor Bloomberg, be like Hugo and let the people decide," he said.
They should have the right to vote for the current mayor or a new one."
"If the City Council should vote to amend term limits, I plan to ask New Yorkers to look at my record of independent leadership and then decide if I've earned another term," Bloomberg said at City Hall.
Forty-five percent of voters were in favor of extending the term limits for their mayor.
