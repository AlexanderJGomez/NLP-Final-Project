Sony also offers subscription programs called PlayStation Plus, which provides access to exclusive games, and Qriocity, which offers on-demand music and movies over the internet.
Sony released a statement on Thursday saying, "It may be a full day or two before we're able to get the service completely back up and running."
The new "Mortal Kombat" game is also supposed to let gamers play online.
