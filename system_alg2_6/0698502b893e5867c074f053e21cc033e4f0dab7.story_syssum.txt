Mizoram, India (CNN) -- The world's population hits 7 billion this week, but Ziona, the patriarch of what may be the biggest family in the world, is not bothered.
"I never wanted to get married but that's the path God has chosen for me," he says.
Ziona first got married when he was 17 to Zathiangi, who is now 70.
Without much fuss, while some women of the house cook, others set the table, still others serve and clean.
But while he likes living in a big family, he himself doesn't want more than one wife.
But for me, having one wife and one son is quite enough.
"My father is the greatest god that we can have in this world, he has done so much for us," says his eldest son Nunparliana, who has two wives and 14 children.
The family is not listed in the Guinness Book of World Records because Ziona says he doesn't want the publicity.
