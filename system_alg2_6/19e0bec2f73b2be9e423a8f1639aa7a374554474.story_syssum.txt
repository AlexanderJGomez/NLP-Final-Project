Editor's note: Rich Roll, one of Men's Fitness magazine's "25 Fittest Guys in the World" in 2009, was the first athlete to compete in the Ultraman World Championships on an entirely plant-based diet.
But the denial had finally caught up to me.
I'm here to say that it doesn't have to be that way.
Not a vague, wishy-washy notion that I should "get in shape," maybe "eat better" or possibly "go on a diet," but rather a specific long-term plan to enhance my wellness in a way that would not only stick, but fit within the parameters of my busy life as a full-time lawyer, husband and father of four small children.
And not only did I keep the weight off, I was the most fit I had ever been in my life.
But my point is that change starts with a decision followed by baby steps along a new, consistent trajectory that, over time, can lead to dramatic results.
And despite what you may see advertised, I'm sorry to say there is no secret diet, mystery pill or overnight miracle that will do it for you.
Set a goal: Vague, nonspecific notions of "getting fit," "going to the gym," or "eating better" are all fine, but they are not true "goals" and all too typically devolve, paving the way for relapse to old habits.
A good support network is a key to success.
Don't diet: Instead, get honest about your habits and embark on implementing healthy, lasting changes in your nutrition.
Personally, I cannot overemphasize the difference this has made in my own life, a secret weapon for enhanced athletic performance and overall long-term wellness.
One day at a time: Large goals can seem insurmountable.
No matter how busy you are, if you are truly honest about this inquiry, I guarantee you can make some cuts and carve out some time.
No matter how old, overweight or out of shape you are, you have the power to make a decision, set a goal and create a plan.
