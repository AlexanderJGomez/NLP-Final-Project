Head coach of Great Britain's powerlifting squad, Vaughan-Ellis  participated in a course that's designed to boost the leadership and management skills of coaches.
In the run up to the 2012 Olympic Games in London, the desire to develop high caliber coaches is ramping up in the UK, said John Neal of Ashridge Business School, where Vaughan-Ellis took the coaching course.
"We prepare our athletes to be the best in the world.
Its core World Class Sport Coach Development program is endorsed by the British Olympic Association.
Neal estimates that about 160 coaches have completed the coaching program since it was launched.
But in return, the business school gets a unique perspective on decision making that is fed back into its executive education programs, Neal said.
That's an invaluable skill in athletics.
