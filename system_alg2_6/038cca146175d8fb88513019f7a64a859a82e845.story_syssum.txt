Van Marjwik's side next play Germany, who beat Portugal 1-0 in Lviv thanks to Mario Gomez's second-half goal, in a game that never matched the drama of Denmark's victory.
Van Persie should have scored early on in the game but put his shot wide and later on in the first half the Arsenal striker was thwarted by Danish goalkeeper Stephan Andersen's alertness.
Completely against the run of play, Krohn-Dehli gave Denmark a shock lead after he gathered Simon Poulsen's deflected cross and drilled a shot through the legs of Dutch goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg.
It was not until late in the second half that he forced Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer into a save and for the most part Germany were able to minimize the Portuguese forward's threat.
But it was Gomez who finally broke the deadlock, connecting with Sami Khedira's cross from the right, cleverly guiding a header past Patricio.
