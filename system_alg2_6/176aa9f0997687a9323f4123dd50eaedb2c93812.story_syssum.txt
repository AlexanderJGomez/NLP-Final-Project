The corrections department's Board of Parole Hearings granted parole for the 71-year-old Davis following his 28th parole suitability hearing on Wednesday.
In January 2010 and October 2012, the parole board granted him parole.
Manson is serving a life sentence for his role in nine murders.
He was denied parole for the 12th time in 2012; his next such hearing is set for 2027, at which time he'd be 92 years old.
