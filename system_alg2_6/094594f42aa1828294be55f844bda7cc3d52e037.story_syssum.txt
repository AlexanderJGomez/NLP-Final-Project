Former flight engineer George Hopkins says he remembers vividly being hijacked to Cuba in 1968.
And he sticks a .38 right in my nose, right between my eyes, and I could tell it was loaded because I see the bullets around the cylinder.
With the plane now heading to Cuba, the hijacker lowered his gun.
"He said don't worry about it, we've done this before," Hopkins said.
According to a December 1968 indictment, Soltren and three others -- Jose Rafael Rios Cruz, Miguel Castro and Alejandro Figueroa -- conspired to hijack the flight.
Hopkins wonders now whether he would even recognize Pena Soltren.
