The Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act, sponsored by House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller, R-Florida, and passed overwhelmingly, would let the agency secretary immediately fire any of the department's senior executives.
There are roughly 360 senior executives at Veterans Affairs, according to the Office of Personnel Management.
But, the trend over the past five years shows a substantial difference at the VA. From 2008-2013, the VA fired executives at a rate one-fourth the firing rate for government overall, according to the OPM data.

Nor has he said if he is in the process of firing any VA employees as a result of the scandal.
"I will do everything I can," Shinseki demurred.
