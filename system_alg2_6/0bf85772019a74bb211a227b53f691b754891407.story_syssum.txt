"The regular Prius is a gasoline dependent car; it doesn't get energy from anywhere but the gas tank," said Coquillette.
Coquillette expects to begin conversions to even more efficient lithium batteries soon.
"Gas becomes optional," with this conversion, Coquillette said.
"We've seen such a diverse group of people," said Coquillette.
Hartline said the Prius was not designed with any conversion possibilities in mind, but she said the company welcomes any technology that pushes the envelope on plug-in batteries.
Also, as more drivers become interested in alternative energy, they will need to learn more about infrastructure.
People come to me and say, 'I want to do this right away,' " said Coquillette.
However, most U.S. electricity is created from burning fossil fuels -- about 70 percent, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency of the Department of Energy.
