(CNN) -- For Thomas Tugend, there was no doubt which side he was fighting for as a young infantryman in Europe in World War II.
That the Tugend family was successful, educated and loyal Germans no longer meant anything.
The elder Tugend had worked with them on health issues related to childhood poverty in Germany after World War I.
"The reason so many German Jews didn't leave when they had the chance was because they couldn't believe what was happening," Tugend said.
Despite their escape, Tugend said his father was never the same.
"Even then I knew the historical significance of the war and I wanted to be a part of it," he said.
"Every town and village I went to," Tugend said, "I would be told, 'No, I'm not a Nazi.
I'm not a Nazi.'
Tugend left the Army soon after the war's end, but he wasn't finished fighting.
After all these years, Tugend is philosophical about his family's escape from certain death at the hands of the Nazis, and his time as an infantryman at war.
