In north-central Sri Lanka's Minneriya National Park, hundreds of elephants travel each year to the shores of an ancient reservoir built by a king more than 1,700 years ago.
If you haven't heard of The Gathering or ever seriously considered visiting Sri Lanka, you're not alone.
In addition, they are habituating elephants to charge vehicles, which they will continue to do once they leave the national park with the beginning of the rains."
Conservationists are pushing government and park officials to ensure animals, humans and the local environment are better protected.
As word about Minneriya's main attraction spreads, the hope is that massive herds of elephants will continue migrating to the park each dry season, as they have for hundreds of years.
The best time to see The Gathering is during the dry season, from June to September.
For those who would rather have the whole trip arranged for them, tour companies like Asialuxe offer multi-day packages including airfare.
