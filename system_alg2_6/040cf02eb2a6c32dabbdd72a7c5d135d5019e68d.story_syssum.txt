In defiance of the country's moderate climate, the architects say they have devised a system to control the park's outdoor environment, using old and new farming technologies to simulate Mediterranean and tropical climates in an ecologically sustainable way.
Because this will also be a recreational space, our goal is to make it as open as possible, without using greenhouses," he said.
However, for tropical foods like mangoes and basmati rice, van Bergen says the park will need another layer of warmth.
Van Bergen says the park will reduce carbon emissions by cutting down on food processing and transport costs, while stimulating local industry and social bonds.
"However, I have reservations about any system that creates open artificial climates.
For van Bergen, this type of criticism misses the point, because he sees the Park Supermarket as just one of many possible alternatives to the existing system of food production.
"Just like our energy, I think our future food supplies will have to come from a variety of sources, using a variety of methods -- of which we are sure this will be one.
