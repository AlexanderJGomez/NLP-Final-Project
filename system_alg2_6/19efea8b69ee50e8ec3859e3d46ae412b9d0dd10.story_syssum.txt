(CNN)Here in London, you can tell that the U.S. presidential election is only about 600 days away because every restaurant here seems to contain a senator or a governor.
Why?
Scott dodged, and because the audience laughed gently at him in English accents, it made him look all the more like a country bumpkin.
Of course, from our point of view he wasn't very nice to us either.
For all of this, London Mayor Boris Johnson taunted Mitt in front of a large British crowd -- and Boris is the closest you get to a politician we actually like.
But while there certainly are no-go areas here, it's because they're just horrible and no one (Muslim, Jewish, Christian or anyone else) would want to go there.
Why, otherwise, would someone ask Scott Walker whether or not he believes in evolution when he's in the UK on a trade mission?
You see, we're not nearly as superior as we like to make ourselves out to be.
So my advice for any other presidential candidates considering a visit to London is to take a second look at the map.
And, of course, there's a lot happening in Russia right now, too...
