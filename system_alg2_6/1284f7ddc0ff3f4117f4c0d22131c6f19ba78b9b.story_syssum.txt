You know those two friends -- the pair that is SO obviously in love with each other but just can't quite get it together enough to date?
Well, thanks to Facebook (and Walgreens) you can finally push your pals into the loving relationship that they so obviously long for.
Finish off the virtual Valentine with a gift suggestion for the pair -- like plush toys or K-Y Jelly -- and post the whole thing to your Facebook wall for all to see.

Crowded Room is an Android/iPhone app that allows you to meet up with like-minded people as you go about your business each day.
