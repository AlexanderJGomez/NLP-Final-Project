Dawkins argues that there is no doubt that Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection is true and, unlike some other scholars of the subject, says belief in evolution is not compatible with faith in religion.
"I believe a true understanding of Darwinism is deeply corrosive to religious faith," Dawkins says in his TED Talk.
Darwin himself was very slow to make his theory of evolution by natural selection public, taking 15 years from his early insights on the subject to the publication of the book -- and publishing it then only after naturalist Alfred Wallace had independently come up with the idea of evolution.
T.H.
Dawkins: I think it stems from the far greater popularity of religion in America, but that only pushes the question back a stage.
CNN: You maintain that science is corrosive to religion and that religion undermines science.
Dawkins: I think it is mostly because of biblical literalism.
Dawkins: Yes, I am happy to say I do think so.
