NEW YORK (CNN) -- For someone who claims to be incredibly laid back, Jason Mraz is certainly piling up the accomplishments.
The tour's quirky title was inspired by a wholesome San Francisco, California, restaurant Mraz loves.
What's that like?
Yes, the trees give me avocado and fruit that we sell and we eat tons of, but I feel like I have a role to play back to that, too.
Mraz: I do, thank you.
Mraz: I do.
Mraz: I loved it.
I was like, "What does he think?"
Mraz: It is really tough.
I just don't know that I could commit myself to something like that.
Where were you?
And just as any afternoon where I play music, I was playing on an electric guitar, just chugging around, feeling a little reggae in me you know, and the melody and the words just started to pop out rather quickly and so I recorded it rather quickly.
I love getting to bounce around and explore so much.
I have begun my level one training.
