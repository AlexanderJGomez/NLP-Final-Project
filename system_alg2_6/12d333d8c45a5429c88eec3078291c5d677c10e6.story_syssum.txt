It's the World Cup.
After one game Thursday and three on Friday, Saturday will be the first day with four World Cup.
But the story for the England-Italy tilt isn't just that they're playing, but where they are playing: in Manaus.
His was the fifth death, nationwide, involved in the construction of World Cup venues.
Still, the game will go on Saturday at the Arena da Amazonia -- that being the official name for the Manaus stadium.
The funny thing is that having people spray the grass in the middle of a World Cup arena was supposed to be one of the biggest and best changes tied to the 2014 tournament.
Saturday's three other games, and six other teams besides England and Italy, have plenty of their own story lines as well.
