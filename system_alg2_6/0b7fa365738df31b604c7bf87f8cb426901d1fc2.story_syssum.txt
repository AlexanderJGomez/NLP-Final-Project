(Parenting.com) -- I am a 38-year-old father of two little boys living in Portland, Oregon, and I like my circumcised penis.
That's it.
Besides, my boys are lucky enough to be able to bathe in clean water just about every day.
Either the men were adamant that their son look like them or they just didn't care if they didn't.
I can't help but wonder if the practice of male circumcision, as with female genital mutilation, has something to do with a fear of human sexuality and a desire to control.
They went as far as to claim that there are as many good reasons for prohibition of male circumcision as there are for female genital mutilation.
I did not have any desire to subject my beautiful baby boys to excruciating pain, even with analgesia.
The day will come when one of my boys will want to know why his penis is different than mine.
