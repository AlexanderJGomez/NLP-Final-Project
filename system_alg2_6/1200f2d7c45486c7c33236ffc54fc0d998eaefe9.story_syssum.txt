(CNN) -- Hundreds of students walked out of their Oklahoma high school Monday to protest the school's response to the alleged bullying of three classmates who say they were raped by the same person.
He also said the school was enlarging a task force to study the implementation of a "targeted, research-based sexual assault curriculum for students," and that the school will continue to respond quickly to reports of sexual assault and bullying.
Friends of the teens started a Facebook page, YES ALL Daughters, two weeks ago to show support for them, Babb said.
"It shows that students won't put up with this harassment and bullying," Babb said.
