The IUCN assessed a total of 63,837 plant and animal species around the globe which revealed 19,817 of that number are currently threatened with extinction, with 3,947 described as "critically endangered" -- the final classification prior to extinction.
More than 275 million people are dependent on coral reefs for food, coastal protection and their livelihoods, according to the IUCN.
"Recent work on plant assessments suggests that around one in five plants are threatened with extinction," says professor Stephen Hopper, director (CEO and chief scientist), Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, England.
Paul Smith, Head of the Millennium Seed Bank at the Royal Botanic Gardens says that every plant extinction makes it more challenging for humans to adapt to change.
"There is no technological reason why a plant species should become extinct.
"The problem with any consensual approach is that it takes a very long time.
