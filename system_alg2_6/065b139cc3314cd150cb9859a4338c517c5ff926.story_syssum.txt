There was little publicity for Seattle's first medical marijuana farmers market held on Sunday.
"Medical marijuana is not legal in the state of Washington," said state Department of Health spokesman Donn Moyer.
But unlike in California or Colorado where medical marijuana initiatives led to an explosion of dispensaries that provide the drug, in Washington the medical marijuana community has remained, for the most part, underground.
Still fears persist among medical marijuana users.
Market organizers said they are hopeful that a bill working its way through Washington's legislature will provide medical marijuana users and growers in the state surer legal footing to operate on.
