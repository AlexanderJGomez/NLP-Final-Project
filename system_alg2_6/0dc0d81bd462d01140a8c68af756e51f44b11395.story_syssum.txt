I have no money.
Both Mohammad Sohail and Suffolk County Police have no idea who the man is.
You are a great American," another reads.
The typed letter begins, "You change My Life (sic)," and goes on to say that the man is sorry for his actions six months ago.
The letter says Sohail's acts inspired him to become a "True Muslim" and that his life has changed dramatically.
So now he is a good person in this community and I'm very glad for that.
