Fans of the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy can tour a New Zealand farm that was used as the setting for Hobbiton.
It was like, 'I can't believe I'm actually here,' " Maro said.
It seemed to be very popular," said Kelly Van Baren, a sales manager who lives in suburban Chicago, Illinois.
A convoy of three huge buses with scenes from the film painted on their sides shuttled mostly American tourists to various sites, including the church where the main characters were married and a gazebo featured during some of the musical numbers, Van Baren recalled.
Movie and TV fans who want to stay closer to home to explore famous locations have plenty of movie tours to choose from in the United States.
But the most popular tour focuses on sites used in the television and big screen hit "Sex and the City," Gacanja said.
For Maro, the experience in New Zealand was so unforgettable, she went again a year later for another look at "The Lord of the Rings" sites.
It was just a great trip," she said.
