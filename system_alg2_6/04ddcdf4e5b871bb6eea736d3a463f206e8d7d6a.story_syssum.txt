Chrisette Michele's album "Epiphany" debuted at No.
But this isn't Michele's first big career moment: She won a Grammy this year in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance category for her single, "Be OK," featuring will.i.am.
The latest epiphany is that I really don't have to be afraid of anybody.
And the reason why it was an epiphany was when I first started, I was so afraid that maybe they won't like me.
And that's her epiphany.
Michele: One way is that I didn't write some of the songs.
I get excited when we talk about jazz.
Michele: I'm an advocate of music in schools.
Michele: When I was in school I used to prank my teachers all the time.
I also love Adele's new album.
Those are two that are on my radar.
