Carlo Ancelotti will take over as manager of Chelsea from July 1 this year.
Ancelotti, who turns 50 next week, has been in management since 1995, when he took charge of Italian Serie B club Reggiana.
During his time at both clubs he amassed three Serie A titles, two European Cups, and he also won the Coppa Italia four times with Roma.
Despite his management success at AC Milan, it has been widely reported that his relationship with the club's owner, Silvio Berlusconi, has not been strong in 2009.
