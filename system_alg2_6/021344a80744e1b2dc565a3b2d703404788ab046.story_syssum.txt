Reality isn't quite so simple as to perfectly apply recent developments on Detroit and Russia to the American debate in 2012, but neither were Romney's arguments on the car industry and on Russia.
The president probably still wouldn't call Russia this country's top foe.
"Russia has stabbed us in the back," said Sen. Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat.
The headline of Romney's op-ed in November 2008 was "Let Detroit Go Bankrupt."
More damaging for Romney than either the Detroit op-ed or the Russia as a foe storyline was his statement to fundraisers about giving up on the 47% of Americans who would not vote for him no matter what.
Romney is retired from national politics and the pundits and press have moved on to the 2016 parlor game.
