Like any kid on his first day of school, I was engulfed by longing and loneliness, staring forlornly at my dad through the screen door as he walked away.
I didn't speak English yet, having been home with my mom up until that first day of kindergarten.
And that was that.
I didn't mind "Rudy" but I didn't like "Ruiz" pronounced in English.
"Rudy" in English.
To the north loomed my future, which I was learning and absorbing at school and in the media.
And the alliteration of "Rudy Ruiz" provided a challenge in that the "r" in Rudy flows smoothly in English, while the "r" in Ruiz rolls like a locomotive thundering over the old railway bridge that spans the Rio Grande in Brownsville, often backing up traffic for miles.
Four letters in English.
Balance.
The key to attaining the right balance is empathy.
Just like my name.
