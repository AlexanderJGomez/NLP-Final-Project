Washington (CNN) -- Lenient enforcement of a law requiring U.S. citizens to have passports when re-entering the country at land border crossings has heightened the risk that an imposter might get in, according to a government report released Monday.
In an effort to implement the law without clogging international borders, Customs and Border Protection instituted a phase that it called "informed compliance" to transition the law into effect over time.
Compliance has been greatest along the northern border, where 98 percent of travelers had the appropriate documents, the inspector general's report says.
The agency said the program is working, adding that it believes it is better to encourage compliance then to enforce it at this time.
