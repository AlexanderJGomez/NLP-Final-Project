(CNN) -- What is the value and impact of international aid?
Research demonstrates that food aid can be poor value for money, especially when food grown in donor countries is shipped to the developing world.
As much as $22 billion -- or 20% of bilateral aid spending -- is spent on activities in donor countries or put towards the cancellation of debt.
But it is undeniable that these schemes are at odds with the common perception of aid as financial support transferred from donor to recipient countries to fight poverty.
Now, for the first time ever, we can see just how much aid flows between specific countries and, crucially, what that aid consists of.
But almost 70% of Italy's aid stayed in the country, spent on refugee costs and debt relief, whereas around 70% of Denmark's aid resulted in a transfer of resources to developing countries.
Without the support of international aid, most poor people will be left behind.
Then policymakers in both donor and recipient countries can make better and more informed decisions, and civil society can better monitor progress and hold them to account.
