In the post-Mao era, Chinese leadership change and power transition have become institutionalized and more predictable.
The challenge has become more pressing, as Chinese society gets wealthier and more restless after three decades of rapid economic and social change.
Dominating the debates and ideological clashes are the neoliberals and the neo-Maoists who occupy the leadership, while neo-Confucians, popular as they may be among some common folk and patriotic youths, have yet to find their strong advocates among top leaders.
Unlike leaders like Bo Xilai who used iron-fisted measures when dealing with social discontent, Wang has a reputation for listening to netizens, including their criticisms of the government.
In a subtle rejection of the "fairness and justice" advocated by neoliberals, the neo-Maoists see the state as a beneficial force and the market as an evil one.
But ideological orientation will surely be one of the considerations in the jockeying for power.
How he and other key leaders take up stands in this struggle for ideological dominance will be immensely important for China and its direction in the next decade.
