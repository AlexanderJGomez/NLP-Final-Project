Michael Kepler Meo is just 12 years old.
Los Angeles Opera Music Director James Conlon briefly peeks into the dressing room to wish young Meo good luck.
Michael won the role of Miles, a troubled boy threatened by menacing ghosts in a rambling English country home.
Meo says she isn't sure where Michael came by his musical talent.
"I don't have too much contact with kids my age," Michael says.

"In opera you can sing even if you are old."
