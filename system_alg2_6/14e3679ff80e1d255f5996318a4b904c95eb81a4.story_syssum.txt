When police found the unconscious man in a Southern California Motel 6, the IDs on him said he was Michael Thomas Boatwright from Florida.
The man said his name was Johan Ek.
The case was first reported by the Desert Sun.
She found a website for the TRP English school in China.
Photos found with Boatwright in the motel room showed a young man living in what looked like a European city, not Asia.
The school in China told her he was divorced.
Everything Boatwright knows about his life before February 28 he knows because his social worker told him or because he read it on websites.
That would certainly explain the five rackets in his hotel room.
Fugue states, such as dissociative fugue, are often triggered by trauma, such as the death of a loved one or a serious accident, according to Dr. Aaron Anderson, a neurologist at Emory University School of Medicine.
He still feels isolated in the hospital, so Hunt-Vasquez encouraged him to reach out to members of the local Swedish-American community.
The hospital would like to discharge Boatwright, but they have no place to send him, said Richard Ramhoff, a spokesman for Desert Regional Medical Center.
