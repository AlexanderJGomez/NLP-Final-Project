Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has blamed Grupo Clarin for her low approval ratings.
"[Cristina] Kirchner saw [Clarin] as a limit to her power, and this was the origin of the conflict," Argentine political analyst Rosendo Fraga said.
"It hits other media groups, but Clarin is the one it hurts," said Daniel Kerner, an analyst at Eurasia Group.
If anyone is applying unfair pressure, it is monopolistic media companies, Fernandez de Kirchner said.
In response, Fernandez de Kirchner has come out swinging at the Clarin newspaper and its parent company, observers said.
The Kirchners "have a hostile stance, not just against Clarin but against all the press," he said.
It's paradoxical."
