Saturday brought another reminder of the powers that be in Egypt as America's top military officer was in Cairo to meet with his Egyptian counterparts.
But the demonstrations were scattered and light.
Meanwhile Saturday, an American student was arrested with an Australian journalist and their female translator in the city of Mahalla, north of Cairo, for inciting people to join the general strike and handing them money for doing so, a spokesman for the Egyptian Ministry of Interior told CNN.
Spokesman Alaa Mahmoud said they were transferred to a general prosecutor for an investigation.
Dempsey's spokesman, Col. Dave Lapan, said they discussed a wide range of issues, including the investigation of nongovernmental organizations in the country and an announcement that 43 foreigners working for such groups, including 16 Americans, would face prosecution.
The Egyptians said the pro-democracy organizations had received illegal foreign financing and were operating without a proper license.
They look now to a Syria in flames and flickers of discontent elsewhere and can take heart that they played a role in inspiring people to stand up for freedom.
They are optimistic that momentum will build as long as a military regime rules Egypt.
