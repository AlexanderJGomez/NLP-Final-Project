While Bush campaigned for 2014 candidates last year, he didn't hit the early primary states like Iowa and New Hampshire, which hold the first two nominating contests and where other potential presidential contenders have already made frequent visits.
GOP strategist Ford O'Connell said now is the time for Bush to focus on doing the behind-the-scenes action like securing financial commitments and organizing his team so he can be better positioned to ward off other potential GOP contenders.
Republican strategist and Bush supporter Ana Navarro, who's also a CNN contributor, said Bush is focused on fundraising and organizing but added voters can expect Bush do some public events in the coming weeks.
Campbell told the Wall Street Journal that Bush "will travel to states around the country in the coming months to support conservative candidates and causes."
