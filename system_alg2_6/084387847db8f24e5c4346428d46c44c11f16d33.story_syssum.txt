(CNN) -- Republican Joni Ernst has won the race for Iowa's U.S. Senate seat held by retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, defeating Democratic challenger Bruce Braley, according to a CNN projection.
The popular Harkin campaigned for Braley but couldn't make up for several gaffes and missteps the four-term lawmaker made during the campaign that surprised and disappointed his supporters in Iowa and Washington.
Braley was also criticized when it was revealed his family had filed a complaint against a neighbor whose chickens were crossing onto his property.
