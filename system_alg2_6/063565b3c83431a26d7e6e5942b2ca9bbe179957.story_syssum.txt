Tate said he was issued a weapon by his security firm on the morning of the President's visit, but no one told him it was a violation of Secret Service protocol for him to carry a gun, he said.
Tate said he was supposed to take the President to two different floors of one of the CDC buildings.
The fired worker told Baldwin he only took photos when the detail was over and did not take any images while on the elevator, as had been reported.
The New York Times, which also interviewed Tate, reported that when he took pictures of the President's limousine, the Secret Service became upset.
