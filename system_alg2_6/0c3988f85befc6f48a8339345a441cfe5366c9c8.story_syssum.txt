But in order to soak up Dubai's eclectic diversity, you have to prepare for another truth: "Dubai is worth a trip, but not all that glitters is gold," iReporter Holger Bauer said.
"You can get a very good view and 'lay of the land' by going up to the top floors of buildings, such as hotels or the Burj Khalifa," Anderson said.
And while visiting the Burj Khalifa, located in the heart of downtown Dubai, don't forget to explore the "large variety of trendy restaurants, aesthetic pools and fountains, and upscale shopping," she said.
The Dubai Mall, the largest mall in the world, features a choreographed fountain show, according to Anderson.
"They have Burj Al Arab as well as the very affordable Madinat Jumeirah.
"Another must see is the gold and spice souks near Dubai Creek," Koebbe said.
Getting around the city for a dime each trip is easy on your wallet, and it helps you connect with the locals and tourists around you, Bauer said.
If you take one thing with you from your Dubai experience, let it be the culture.
You'll find older traditional souks on one corner, then on the next, the very American-like Mall of the Emirates with an indoor ski resort, Ski Dubai.
I found the local people to be very warm and welcoming."
