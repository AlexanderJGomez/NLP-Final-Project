BURBANK, California (CNN) -- Laura Ling on Wednesday expressed the shock she and Euna Lee felt when former President Clinton showed up in Pyongyang, North Korea, to help secure the two journalists' release.
"We were taken to a location, and when we walked through the doors, we saw standing before us President Bill Clinton," Ling said, with Lee standing beside her.
She said that she and Lee are looking forward to spending "some quiet, private time" with their families.

"We always maintained our hope and knew in our hearts that we would see Laura again; we just didn't know when," Lisa Ling said outside her home in Los Angeles, California.
Their release is a "source of happiness not only for the families but for the entire country," he said.
Clinton made the trip to North Korea after the women's families asked him to travel there, a senior administration official said.
In July, Ling and Lee spoke to their families and told them that the North Koreans were willing to grant them amnesty if a high-level envoy, such as former President Clinton, were willing to travel to Pyongyang, the administration official said on condition of anonymity.
Gibbs added the former president last spoke with Obama during a White House visit in March.
Clinton had considered visiting North Korea in 2000, near the end of his second term as president.
