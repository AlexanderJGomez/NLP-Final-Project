Washington (CNN) -- Baseball all-time home run champion Barry Bonds won a big legal victory Friday when a federal appeals court ruled that evidence the government says would prove he lied about using steroids is inadmissible in court.
Anderson allegedly took urine samples and delivered them to a Bay-area lab known as BALCO.
The government said it would instead bring BALCO executive James Valente to the stand to testify Anderson told him the samples indeed came from Bonds.
The government had the burden of showing the samples came from Bonds, then went to Anderson and then to BALCO.
The lab performed repeated tests on athletes, said the government, to check whether the drugs were detectable.
The case is U.S. v. Bonds (09-10079).
