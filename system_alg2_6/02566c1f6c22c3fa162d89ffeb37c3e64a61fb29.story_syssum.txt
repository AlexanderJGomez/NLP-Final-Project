Kaufman, Texas (CNN) -- A Texas community is on edge after a district attorney who said he would put away the "scum" who killed a colleague two months ago was shot to death alongside his wife in his home Saturday night.
Just two months ago, McLelland vowed to find the people who killed Hasse, one of his top deputies.
"He never stated to me that he was worried," Wood said.
A law enforcement source told CNN that investigators at the McLellands' home recovered several shell casings at the scene of the crime.
The McLellands were killed almost exactly two months after Hasse was shot to death in broad daylight outside the county courthouse on January 31.
She said the prosecutor told her he had begun carrying a gun in and out of the county courthouse daily.
"I hope that the people that did this are watching, because we're very confident that we're going to find you," McLelland told reporters.
