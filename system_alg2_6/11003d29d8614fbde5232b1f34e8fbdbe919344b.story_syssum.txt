Washington (CNN) -- U.S. troops based in South Korea have not been put on a heightened state of alert in the wake of that country's announcement that North Korea was behind the sinking of one of its warships in March, the Pentagon said Thursday.
"We have said for a long time that if there were a problem in Korea our main arms would be the Navy and the Air Force, and those are not stretched in the same way that the ground forces are," he said.
Meanwhile, the State Department said the United States will send a clear signal to North Korea that the sinking of the warship was in violation of international norms and it must pay a price.
Asked whether the United States would consider putting North Korea back on the State Department's list of state sponsors of terrorism, Crowley said it was unclear whether the ship incident would be considered an act of terrorism to meet the legal threshold for such a designation.
Senior State Department officials said that although the department's lawyers would make the final determination, the attack is not likely to be considered a terrorist attack because North and South Korea are technically at war.
