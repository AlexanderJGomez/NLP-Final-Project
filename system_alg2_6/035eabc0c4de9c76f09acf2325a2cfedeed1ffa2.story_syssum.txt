(CNN) -- The Ohio state Senate passed a bill Wednesday that would curb the collective bargaining rights of public workers and strip away their power to strike.
Democratic lawmakers described the proposal as union-busting.
Earlier Wednesday the measure sailed through a Senate Labor Committee following a last-minute GOP shuffle that resulted in the replacement of Republican Senator Bill Seitz.
Ohio, often considered a battleground for presidential politics, faces an $8 billion shortfall in the next two-year budget.
