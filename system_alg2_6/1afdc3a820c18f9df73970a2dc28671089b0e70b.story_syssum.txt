The memo went out earlier this week as part of an effort to reform the student visa system, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
According to the university, Tazhayakov is enrolled but was suspended pending the outcome of the current case.
The court also heard that Tazhayakov went to Kazakhstan in December 2012 and was allowed to return to the United States on January 20, despite the apparent lapse in his visa status, the same government official said.
"It's surprising that the administration isn't already verifying that any student coming into the country has a valid student visa," Grassley said.
