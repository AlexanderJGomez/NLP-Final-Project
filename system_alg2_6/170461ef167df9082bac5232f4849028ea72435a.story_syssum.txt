(CNN)Rafael Nadal says he's unsure if he will play at this month's Australian Open after slumping to defeat in the opening round of the Qatar Open in Doha.
I wanted to start well, but it was not the case today," Nadal said, Agence France-Presse reported.
After suffering a back injury in last year's Australian Open final defeat to Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka, and missing the U.S. Open in September with a wrist injury, Nadal could be forgiven for being cautious about his return.
Djokovic will play Ukraine's Sergiy Stakhovsky in round two.
