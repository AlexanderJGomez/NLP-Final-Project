(CNN) -- The Seattle artist Moxie makes sculptures out of felted wool that are, like her, desperately playful and mad.
Their work is featured in magazines like "Make" and "Craft" and the documentary "Handmade Nation."
"Each poke, you are deciding what the piece will be and mean," she said.
In the last five years I lost both my parents, which is not exactly a tsunami tragedy, but it's powerful stuff when you've had a complicated relationship.
You never stop missing your parents.
What was that about?
...
Moxie: Wool, like every animal hair, has scales up and down each fiber.
Moxie: I believe in the high five.
Everyone has a context, a history that no one can know like you know your own.
Moxie: More than anything else, I've mastered the ability to ignore the voice in my head that tells me I don't know how to do anything.
A relatively new one, "Back to Work," is about productivity and creative process.
Moxie published an instructional book, "I Felt Awesome" (North Light Books) in 2010.
