Now that they are home, or soon to be home, our country has a solemn obligation to help them transition back to civilian life.
Today, nearly one in five women who are veterans have delayed or gone without necessary health care in the past year.
Today, one-third of the Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers lack a staff gynecologist and 18% of VA clinics have yet to hire at least one doctor specializing in women's health.
Yet the unemployment rate for female veterans has steadily climbed for most of the past decade, and is now higher than for male veterans.
To help combat unemployment among female veterans, the Department of Defense must take a hard look at the primary program designed to help veterans go into the civilian labor force: the Transition Assistance Program.
Finally, as the VA and Defense work to strengthen services to servicewomen, these agencies need to invest in improved child care options.
They served this country faithfully.
