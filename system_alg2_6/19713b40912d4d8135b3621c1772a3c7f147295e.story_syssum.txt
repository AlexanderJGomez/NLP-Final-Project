Led by politician, Akhilesh Yadav, 38, the Samajwadi Party unseated powerful low-caste chief minister Mayawati, who goes by one name.
The outcome is a personal setback for star campaigner Rahul Gandhi, who struggled hard to revive the Congress party.
The ousted leader, Mayawati, became chief minister of Uttar Pradesh in 2007 after leading her Bahujan Samaj Party to an overwhelming victory in this state of more than 200 million people.
An influential local leader, Okram Ibobi Singh, was credited for retaining power for the Congress party in the far-flung, insurgency-wracked Manipur province.
