Sawyer's father, Matthew Jones, said he was sure the tigers couldn't escape from their zoo exhibit.
"I assured him they couldn't," Matthew Jones said.
Matthew Jones said that after many trips to zoos around the country, he thought this zoo was "perfectly adequate" and saw nothing odd about it.
But Jen Williams of Hollister, California, said she felt safe during her June 2007 visit and didn't think the animals could jump over anything.
"They're pretty spectacular animals when you see them up close," Arnold said.
Arnold describes the feedings as "a big spectacle" where visitors can get fairly close to the animals.
