(CNN) -- Inside Moore Medical Center's emergency room, Dr. Stephanie Barnhart had been monitoring the weather all afternoon.
"We were hearing it, and we knew that it was coming for us," Barnhart remembers.
One of the biggest concerns in a tornado is shrapnel, Gupta says.
Huddled inside the hospital, Barnhart says she didn't realize how much damage the tornado had caused until she walked outside and saw the bowling alley across the street -- or saw where the bowling alley used to be.
Barnhart went back to work Monday night at one of the area's other hospitals, where patients at Moore Medical Center were evacuated after the tornado passed.
