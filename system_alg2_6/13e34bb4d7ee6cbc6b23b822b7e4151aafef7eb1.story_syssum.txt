(CNN) -- One person was killed and 16 others hospitalized Saturday afternoon when a sports bar tent collapsed during a storm that swept through the St. Louis area, fire officials said.
While the tent had received a city permit, manufacturer guidelines called for it to withstand winds of up to 90 miles per hour, said building commissioner Frank Oswald.
We have severe injuries to quite a few people," said St. Louis Fire Chief Dennis Jenkerson.
"Like the chief said, it is important that people are aware of the weather situation," he said.
Video shot by KSDK showed remains of the crumpled tent and dazed patrons standing outside.
