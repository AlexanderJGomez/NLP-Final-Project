The escapees, who include a man considered to be one of the country's most dangerous criminals, robbed a bank, a gas station and two storage facilities, said the Bruges police spokesman Sunday.
While in flight, the man suddenly pressed a weapon against his temple, Louwagie told Belga.
The man took away his headset so the pilot couldn't talk to ground control and forced Louwagie to land in the prison courtyard, he said.
