Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- In the week since a 7.0-magnitude earthquake shattered this capital and jolted observers around the world, authorities have buried 70,000 bodies, about a third of the estimated final toll, officials said Tuesday.
At least 28 of them are Americans, the U.S. State Department announced Tuesday.
"We were praying a lot for that to happen," he told CNN on Tuesday afternoon, about 15 minutes after he learned she'd been rescued.
PAHO's Andrus said the need for blood donors was urgent, with the lack of refrigeration complicating medical workers' ability to store it safely.
In Washington, U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Dr. Rajiv Shah told reporters Tuesday night that the U.S. response has been "swift, aggressive and coordinated."
The military is going to help with organization and with supplies, Hyman said.
"They're going to help us get electricity, they're going to help us get food, they're going to help us get tents, they're going to help us get all the operating supplies in," he said.
He said the U.S. military anticipated eventually having 10,000 troops in Haiti.
But one man said Haitians needed more relief supplies, not troops or guns.
But such incidents have so far been isolated, said Alain Le Roy, the United Nations peacekeeping director.
There has been a lot less violence in Port-au-Prince than there was before the earthquake," he said.
