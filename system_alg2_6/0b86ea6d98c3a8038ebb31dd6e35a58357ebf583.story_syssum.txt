Popular shows such as "The Walking Dead" and "American Horror Story" helped revive interest in horror literature, said Catherine Scully, young adult editor for the Horror Writers Association.
Unlike horror depicted on television and the big screen, in horror literature for young adults, subtlety is key, rather than shock value, author and horror expert Jonathan Maberry said.
In the early 2000s, authors began began weaving elements of horror into fantasy, such as the "Harry Potter" series.
"Horror combines what readers love by merging the scary creatures from 'Twilight' and gritty, horrifying elements of dystopian (literature)," gothic horror author Winters said.
Kenneth Oppel, author of a young Victor Frankenstein series, believes that part of the appeal of modern young adult horror is the shift away from crazed serial killers to demons within ourselves.
The "Fear Street" series married supernatural horror with real-life horror of teenagers' deepest fears and insecurities.
While the Stine "recipe" remains the same -- following one character's perspective closely -- Stine says the new "Fear Street" books will be longer, more adult and more violent, reflecting how young adult fiction has changed since the 1990s.
