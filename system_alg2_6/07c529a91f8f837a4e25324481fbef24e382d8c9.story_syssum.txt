(CNN) -- Syrian opposition voices spoke out Monday against a proposed law that would allow for new political parties, calling it little more than a publicity stunt.
This stipulation, Al Bounni said, makes it impossible for opposition parties to establish a presence, despite the new law.
State media also reported the sacking of two regional governors as a move to appease Syrian citizens.
Online videos posted Monday morning showed protesters reaffirming demands of regime change, chanting: "The people want the fall of the regime."
Human Rights Watch says Syrian security forces have intensified their campaign of mass arrests in cities that have had anti-government protests.
