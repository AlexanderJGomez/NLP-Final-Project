Doctors were set to operate on President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner at Austral Hospital, located about 60 kilometers (35 miles) outside Buenos Aires, the state-run Telam news agency reported.
Recent medical tests uncovered papillary carcinoma in Fernandez's thyroid gland, presidential spokesman Alfredo Scoccimarro said last week.
Papillary carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer and has a high survival rate, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine.
Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2010.
