That was a question facing pilots in airspace over the United Kingdom on Friday, when Shanwick Oceanic, a part of the UK's NAT system of air traffic control, developed a computer glitch.
So when Shanwick develops a computer glitch, air traffic arriving and departing into the United Kingdom is most affected.
Radar signals don't have the capability of traveling out to the middle of the ocean, so before airplanes enter the North Atlantic track system, from either east or west, a specific speed is assigned along with a specific altitude.
All this means that airplanes can still maintain this separation even if the ground-based oceanic computers take a temporary vacation.
This of course raises the question of whether the global air traffic control system has become computer dependent.
With all that in mind, we are just going to have to suffer through the compromise of inconvenience when the technology breaks down.
