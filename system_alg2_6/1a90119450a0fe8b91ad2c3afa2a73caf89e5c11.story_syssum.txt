However, with Madiba (as Mandela is often called), I feel like every moment spent with him is a gift, a blessing that I will tell my grandchildren about one day.
However, my stories about my encounters with Nelson Mandela are the stuff of comedy clubs.
He said to me, "You are so gracious, I am so humbled to meet you."
The one I remember most was around a birthday or Christmas during which there was a photo opportunity at one of his grandson's kindergartens.
And then I turned to my awe-struck friends and said, "Did you know his favorite song is 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star?'"
( I didn't.
Or the time, I asked Zelda la Grange, his devoted personal assistant, to take a photo of me and Madiba together before I went up to Cambridge.
I never thought I'd meet him again, up close and personal, until, last year when Zelda, ever the diplomat, like her boss, invited to me to introduce my newly born daughter, Freya, to him.
The ones we sent to friends (and everybody we knew), show us laughing with the world's greatest statesman.
