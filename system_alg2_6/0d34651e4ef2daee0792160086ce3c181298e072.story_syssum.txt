Regardless of the other candidates' performances in New Hampshire or even what happens in the South Carolina primary next week, Mitt Romney is extremely likely to be the Republican nominee.
From 1980 to the present, no candidate who significantly trailed in party endorsements has won the nomination.
We got an excellent example of this in December when Newt Gingrich opened up a fairly large lead in Iowa and national polls.
On his morning show on MSNBC, former Republican congressman Joe Scarborough, who served with Gingrich in the 1990s, called him a "bad person" who "will destroy our party."
Tim Pawlenty and Perry.
If Pawlenty had laid off campaign staff but stayed in the race, he might have benefited from a late surge in endorsements and in the polls.
Still, Perry remains the only candidate besides Romney with nontrivial support from Republican elites.
