(CNN) -- When makers of one of the most anticipated video games of the year invited users to help design part of the game, the gamers jumped at the chance to create animated characters.
For EA, the developer of "Spore," it's the downside to tapping into the booming user-generated content arena, which has made sites like YouTube, Flickr, MySpace, Facebook and Second Life so popular.
Despite its "Sporn" issues, "Spore" is poised to become one of the most popular games because of its ability to let people tell their own story, rather than one mapped out for them, Bradshaw said.
"It came up simply as something silly and juvenile to do," he said.
Users also are able to flag and report content that they find offensive.
He said many other creators of Sporn have told him that they too were only joking around.
"User-created content gives players total control over their game experience and empowers them to express their creativity in ways that they never thought possible," Bradshaw said.
Miles Moffit, a gamer attending the University of Georgia who has created tons of "clean" characters on his own, is glad to know EA will be regulating what makes it into the game.
