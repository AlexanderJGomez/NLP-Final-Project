McDonald's and Target dropped an egg supplier this week after an activist group released disturbing video showing what it says shows animal cruelty at three of the company's barns.
Sparboe Farms launched an internal investigation upon learning about the undercover video, which was shot by an animal activist hired under false pretenses, according to Beth Sparboe Schnell, president and owner of Sparboe Farms.
In fact, they are in direct violation of our animal care code of conduct, which all of our employees read, sign and follow each day," Sparboe Schnell said in a statement.
The company said it responded to the FDA, which in turn told Sparboe Farms that some of the corrective actions it took were insufficient.
Regulators recalled about 550 million eggs from the U.S. market in the wake of a salmonella outbreak traced to two Iowa farms in August.
Wright County Egg recalled 380 million eggs, while Hillandale Farms recalled 170 million eggs.
