Stephen Schwarz has received a grant and low-interest loan from the state to help keep his business going.
He had Mat and Naddie's back up and running and turning out what he calls "Modern Louisiana" food just three weeks after the storm.
Before Katrina, there were about 800 restaurants in New Orleans.
Schwarz also operates Michael's Catering.
"In the last year, it really got to the point where catering is 40 percent of our business," Schwarz says.
"Word of mouth is very important, because if you get one bad review, there are tons of restaurants that people are just waiting to try," she says.
Schwarz says.
But just because Mat and Naddie's has been a presence near the riverbend for a generation is no guarantee it'll be there after the recession.
