(CNN) -- The National Hockey League and a sports-oriented anti-homophobia advocacy group announced Thursday they are joining forces to provide players with tolerance training and other programs.
The NBA's contract with players says the league can't discriminate against gay players, and new players receive tolerance training.
In its 2011 contract with players, the NFL also banned discrimination based on sexual orientation.
