She was known for her fashion sense.
Hours later, Kennedy continued to wear the suit during the emergency swearing in of Johnson as President.
The public hasn't seen the suit since the assassination and won't for another 90 years.
Also hidden from view in the new archives building in Maryland: the blue blouse Jackie Kennedy wore beneath the pink suit, her stockings, blue shoes and blue purse.
It is kept at a temperature of 65 to 68 degrees, which is best for the fabric.
