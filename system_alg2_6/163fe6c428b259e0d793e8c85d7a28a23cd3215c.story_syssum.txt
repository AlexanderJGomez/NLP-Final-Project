National said the aircraft had landed uneventfully in Bagram and no additional cargo or people were taken on there, it said.
"The cargo contained within the aircraft was properly loaded and secured, and had passed all necessary inspections prior to departing Camp Bastian," the company said in a statement posted on its website.
That would mean the MRAPs had a total weight of at least 60 tons, which is within the jet's specifications, according to Boeing.
"The light person is never going to get the heavy person off the ground," he said.
"Upon takeoff, we'll be looking back at the cargo until we get off the ground, making sure none of the chains break or pop out," Airman 1st Class Michael Brown says in the airfield's story.
"It's a fantastic plane," he said.
In its statement, National Air Cargo said it "will not speculate as to the cause of the accident," and that it was fully cooperating with authorities as the investigation continues.
