Both of us are in the military and were deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.
I am also a transgender woman; I have known this all my conscious life, but my military didn't know until I told them after 18 years of service to the Air Force.
To fly into perilous locations requires that you know precise procedures like the back of your hand, and on several occasions I was at the right place at the right time to identify issues and trouble shoot problems with the aircraft's equipment, earning the respect and admiration of my peers and superiors.
Had I not been able to continue my military service because I was transgender, I wouldn't have been in the right place at the right time to make that vital difference for my colleagues and my nation.
I was proud to serve my country in a mission-critical role.
We do want to be sure, however, that people understand the main message emerging from our personal stories, and from the experiences of service members from other forces who participated in the conference: Transgender personnel serve just as effectively as everyone else, even in austere environments like Afghanistan.
Just like nontransgender personnel, we care about doing our jobs well, so that our militaries can fulfill their missions.
