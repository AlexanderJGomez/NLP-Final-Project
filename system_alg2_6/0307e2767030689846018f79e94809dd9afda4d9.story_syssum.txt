When Time magazine listed him among its 100 most influential people of the 20th century, it said "that everyone who taps at a keyboard, opening a spreadsheet or a word-processing program, is working on an incarnation of a Turing machine."
Being gay.

So maybe instead of wondering why there isn't a straight pride month or movement, straight people should be thankful they don't need one.
