Naftali Frankel, Eyal Yifrach and Gilad Shaar, Israeli Jewish teens, were buried Tuesday after a memorial ceremony watched nationwide.
The teens' bodies were found Monday, more than two weeks after the three were abducted on their way home from school in the West Bank.
He was a gifted student and "a responsible and poised young boy," the Israeli Embassy in Britain said in a profile of him after he was abducted.
Does that mean I feel bad things about the good people I work with, among the Palestinians?
No.
Gilad Shaar, also 16, was "gifted" and "always smiling," his grandfather Ezra Sha'ar told Israel's Channel 2, according to israelnationalnews.com.
"He was a boy who loved to learn, to do everything for the community and for society."

To the killers, he said, "You are wrongdoers, the nation of Israel promises that your day will come.
We will not break.
It's hard not to see him around, his smile," Zivan said.
