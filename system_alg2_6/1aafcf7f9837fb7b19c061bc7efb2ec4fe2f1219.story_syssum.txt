On Monday, the company that once blazed the trail in the smartphone market announced it's being taken private by its largest shareholder, Fairfax Financial, a Canadian insurance company.
For all the attention paid to BlackBerry's fall and the rise of iPhone and Android, there's still a sizable BlackBerry market out there.
"I think that Fairfax should double down on BlackBerry 10 and the combination of corporate and consumer market that appreciated the rock solid communication platform it offered," he wrote on BerryReview.com.
"Going private doesn't necessarily change the outcome for the company.
"Even if you're in an e-mail and you want to hit the 'delete' button to delete an e-mail -- you think that's logical -- it doesn't work," he says.
But for those, like Umiastowski, who want to stick with BlackBerry, it will hard to get them to change.
Now I'm on a Z10 and I find the multitasking + software keyboard + email experience is second to none," he wrote.
