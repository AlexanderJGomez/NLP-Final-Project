The friend who was on the phone with Trayvon Martin when his fatal confrontation with George Zimmerman began said Monday she is "disappointed, upset, angry, questioning and mad" at Zimmerman's acquittal on murder charges.
Zimmerman had called police to report Martin as a suspicious person in his neighborhood.
Zimmerman's lawyers successfully argued for the right to present evidence that Martin had marijuana traces in his system, but never brought that before a jury or presented any testimony about whether the drug could have affected Martin's behavior.
"She didn't ask to be in this place ... She wanted to go.
I just felt sadness for her."
