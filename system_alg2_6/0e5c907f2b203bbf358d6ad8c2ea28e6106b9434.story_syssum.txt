The heat wave has left scores dead and hundreds of thousands without power.
Temperatures topped 100 degrees Saturday in a swath stretching from south-central Iowa to the Chicago area to Louisville, Kentucky, to Virginia, the weather service said.
While it wasn't clear how hot it had been inside the car, temperatures in that community of 20,000 people reached 103 degrees.
Also, the heat has brought nearly 240 all-time record highs between June 23 and July 5, CNN meteorologist Alexandra Steele said Saturday.
"Heat begets heat," Steele said.
Many of these people have gone without power for a full week, thanks to strong storms fueled by the heat that barreled east from Indiana to New Jersey.
Roger Harrah said he traveled from county to county, some 60 miles, searching for ice Friday and finally found a store with some.
