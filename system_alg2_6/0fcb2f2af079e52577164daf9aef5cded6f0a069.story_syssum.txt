Now that the government has shut down, the institute can still use existing resources to continue Hubble operations for as long as possible.
The approximate cost of one hour of Hubble observing is somewhere between $8,000 and $25,000, depending on whether one adds the costs of operating and refurbishing the facility to its initial construction costs.
That means each week the government is shut down could cost dozens to hundreds of critical astronomical observations.
To check on the number of satellites that might be affected by the shutdown, this author tried to access a NASA website, only to see the following message: "Due to the lapse in federal government funding, this website is not available.
Their flagship mission, the Mars Science Laboratory and its Curiosity Rover, is apparently still active, operated by team members who work for JPL or Caltech or other participating institutions other than the federal government.
The government shutdown means they are forbidden to do any work.
For the past few weeks, we've had intensive discussions with colleagues around the world about the science this telescope will be able to do.
We are all waiting.
