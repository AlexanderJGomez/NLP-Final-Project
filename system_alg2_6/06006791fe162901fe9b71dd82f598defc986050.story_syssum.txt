As the world awaits the impending birth of William and Kate's second baby, potential names have become the topic of rampant speculation and heated debate.
If the assumptions are correct, she will be the first Princess of Cambridge born into the royal family in 182 years.
Contrary to popular belief the Queen was very fond of Diana, but should her name be bestowed as a first name upon the baby, it would be perceived as a slap in the face to the monarchy.
Since Diana's death almost 18 years ago, William has honored his mother's memory in a private and personal fashion.
I still miss Diana.
She would want her to go out into the world, to make her own mark and help those less fortunate, to enrich the lives of others and to carve out her own unique identity -- as Alice, Elizabeth, Victoria, Charlotte, or -- my own personal pick -- Alexandra.
