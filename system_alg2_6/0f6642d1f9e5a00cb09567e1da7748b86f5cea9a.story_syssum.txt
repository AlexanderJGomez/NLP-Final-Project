NEW YORK (CNN) -- After a nearly year-long investigation, police say they now believe 10 sets of human remains uncovered along a desolate stretch of Long Island, New York, beach are linked to a single killer.
At least 10 sets of human remains have been found in Nassau and Suffolk counties since December.
But the woman whose disappearance triggered the searches, 23-year-old Shannan Gilbert, remains missing.
Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas Spota said in May that the newly found remains were not believed to be connected to the first four victims.
