That seems to be the lesson young athletes learn from the latest steroids scandal.
The problem is, for every Braun and A-Rod, a thousand young men will never make the majors -- but are willing to risk their health, even their lives, by taking PEDs.
That's what we have here.
They can go online and find dozens of websites that offer to sell anabolic steroids and other PEDs online.
Many teenagers have credit cards, which can be easily used to purchase PEDs online.
Make sure young athletes hear the whole story.
But the real risk for young athletes is their health.
And that is never worth the risk.
