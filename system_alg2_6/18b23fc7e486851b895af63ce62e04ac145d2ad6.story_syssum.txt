(CNN) -- Indian pair Achanta Sharath Kamal and Subhajit Saha added another Commonwealth Games gold to the host nation's collection on Wednesday, beating Singapore in the men's doubles table tennis final.
Elsewhere at the games, Australia won a thrilling women's hockey final, clinching the gold medal after a penalty shoot-out victory against New Zealand.
It was also a landmark day for Northern Ireland, who claimed their first boxing medals for 16 years as three of their men won title fights.
