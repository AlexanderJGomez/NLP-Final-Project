Washington (CNN) -- Groups representing federal air marshals and flight attendants -- outraged over the Transportation Security Administration's decision to allow small pocketknives back into aircraft cabins -- say they will ask the TSA to reconsider the policy.
But Taylor said he is "appalled" by the decision, and said air marshals are voicing their opposition to him.
"It's not just the (Federal Air Marshal Service), it's all of my guys," he said, noting that law enforcement officers are allowed to carry weapons during commercial flights.
Pistole said the TSA sought to distinguish small pocketknives, such as those equipped with corkscrews, from sturdier knives used primarily as weapons.
And so those will still remain on the prohibited items list," Pistole said.
Immediately after the attacks, the TSA prohibited a wide range of items from aircraft cabins.
