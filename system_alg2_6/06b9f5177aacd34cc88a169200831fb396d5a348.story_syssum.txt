(CNN) -- Ten years ago, President Putin of Russia faced an embarrassing foreign policy defeat.
Within a few years, self-destructive squabbling among Ukraine's new democratic leaders, as the economy stagnated, had discredited the "Orange Revolution."
As before, Putin makes clear his disdain for the demonstrators and his support for Yanukovych.
By contrast, Russian troops in Crimea was the one thing certain to unite Kiev's factions, mobilize Ukraine's population and prompt rapid Western action on economic aid.
Even more perverse, invasion would throw away in one day two years' worth of reputational capital, accumulated from a string of unexpected foreign policy successes.
What to make, then, of Putin-2000 who, when asked whether Russia might one day join NATO replied: "Why not?
Over the years, Putin acquiesced to U.S. bases in Central Asia after 9/11, shared intelligence with Washington, agreed to cut nuclear arsenals by two thirds, and defied his own Communist protesters to establish a route through Russia for U.S. military supplies to Afghanistan.
The costs of the Crimean intervention, in reduced investment and international isolation, will last longer than the immediate rally behind the flag.
Surrounding themselves with friends and colleagues with similar world views, they --deliberately or unwittingly -- cut themselves off from unwelcome information.
Other authoritarian leaders, such as Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, have lost power after calling elections that they were sure they would win.
Yet, the information filter around Putin will make it hard for him to evaluate what is going on.
