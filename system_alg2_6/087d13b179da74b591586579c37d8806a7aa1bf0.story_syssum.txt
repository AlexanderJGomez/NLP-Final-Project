But Lotus team principal Tony Fernandes raised hopes of the former HRT driver taking part in the inaugural Delhi race when he said he would like to see Chandhok take to the track on October 30.
If I do get the opportunity to do it, it'll be fantastic, but as this moment it's a question only Tony can answer.
While Chandhok admitted dropping a driver can create a difficult situation for the team, he insisted his relationship with Trulli has been unaffected.
But I have to say Jarno was fantastic.
I'd like to stay with Tony, with Lotus, and in the future race for them full-time.
