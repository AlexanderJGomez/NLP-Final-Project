London (CNN) -- Britain has closed its embassy in Iran and evacuated all its staff from that country following the attack on the embassy compound in Tehran Tuesday, British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Wednesday.
Hague thanked those European and Arab nations that offered assistance to British Embassy staff following the incident.
Protesters who raided the British Embassy and the other British compound were demanding that the British ambassador be sent home immediately.
Ireland's Foreign Office urged Iran to reconsider its decision to expel the British ambassador to Tehran and said it should bring those responsible for the embassy incursion to justice.
Tuesday's demonstration in Tehran followed an Iranian Parliament vote Sunday to expel the British ambassador and reduce diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom in retaliation for its new sanctions against Iran, according to IRNA, the country's official news agency.
The ministry said it would "take action through legal channels" against those who stormed the embassy building.
Iranian security forces are responsible for guarding the embassy under international law, he said.
