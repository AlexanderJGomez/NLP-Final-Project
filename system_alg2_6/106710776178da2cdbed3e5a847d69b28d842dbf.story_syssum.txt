King Abdullah, as the protector of Islam's most sacred religious sites and leader of Saudi Arabia, is widely considered an important role model for Muslims around the world.
Saudi Arabia gave a good indication of its position on appropriate punishments last  Friday, when it carried out Round 1 of a public flogging -- 50 lashes -- against Raif Badawi, a young blogger, in front of the al-Jafali mosque in Jeddah.

Saudi Arabia's abusive prosecutions and cruel punishments flout these obligations, and undermine its own legitimacy.
