The leader of these Chinese hackers says there "is always a weakness" on networks that allows cyber break-ins.
There are Web sites with high-level security, but there is always a weakness," says Xiao Chen, the leader of this group.
CNN decided to withhold the address of these hackers' Web site, but Xiao Chen says it has been operating for more than three years, with 10,000 registered users.
On camera, Xiao Chen denies knowing anyone who has targetted U.S. government Web sites.
CNN has no way to confirm if his claim is true.
U.S. officials have been cautious not to directly accuse the Chinese military or its government of hacking into its network.
But again off-camera, Xiao Chen says after the alleged Pentagon attack, his colleagues were paid by the Chinese government.
One of the biggest problems experts say is trying to prove where a cyber attack originates from, and that they say allows hackers like Xiao Chen to operate in a virtual world of deniability.
