(CNN)French police say two suspects in Wednesday's terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine are still on the loose after escaping onto the streets of Paris.
"Everything will be done to arrest (the attackers)," French President Francois Hollande said in a speech Wednesday night.
These developments come after at least two heavily armed men entered the Charlie Hebdo office in Paris' 11th district, close to Place de la Bastille, and opened fire, Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said.
One unsettling video, posted to YouTube, shows two men shooting on a Paris street, then walking up to and firing point-blank at a seemingly wounded man as he lay on the ground.
Two police officers were among those killed, the French President said.
"Parisians will not be afraid," Klugman said.
Investigators will do a complete DNA work-up on the Citroen, including soil signatures that might suggest where the gunmen came from, a Western intelligence source briefed on the probe told CNN.
Thursday will be a national day of mourning for those killed in the attack, Hollande said.
The attack on the magazine spurred a wave of support for the publication and its practices around France and the world.
