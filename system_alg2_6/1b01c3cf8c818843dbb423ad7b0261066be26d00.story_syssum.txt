Alain Tremblay of the New Brunswick Royal Canadian Mounted Police said Wednesday.
The snake was found in the same room as the boys, Tremblay said.
He would provide no further details.
The Humane Society documents 17 people who have died in incidents in the United States related to the snakes since 1978, 12 of them since 1990.
