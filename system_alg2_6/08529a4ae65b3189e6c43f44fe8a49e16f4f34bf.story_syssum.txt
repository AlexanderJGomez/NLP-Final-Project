Special Agent Daniel McMullen on Friday said the bureau, along with university police, will expand the investigation to determine whether  any federal laws were broken in the incident Sunday, when a noose and a flag bearing a Confederate symbol were found placed on the statue of James Meredith.
And an attorney for one of the three students sought for questioning in the statue incident said Friday there is video evidence that absolves his client.
Coghlan said his client has been "ruled out" by the university and has no plans to talk to university police at this time.
"It's unclear at this time if the incident is related to the incident last Sunday on campus," Oxford Deputy Police Chief James Owens said.
James Meredith became the first black student admitted to Ole Miss in 1962.
"I'm shocked but not surprised by what happened," Judy Meredith said.
"For this to occur in 2014 is an insult to the legacy of James Meredith, The University of Mississippi community, and the SigEp alumni who fought for racial equality in the late 1950s," the fraternity said in a statement.
Shay Hodge, a former Rebels wide receiver and teammate of Oher, said "every school" has its racists.
Racism "happens in every campus, in every high school, in every community," Hodge said.
