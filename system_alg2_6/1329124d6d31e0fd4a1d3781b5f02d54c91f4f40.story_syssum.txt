In a 26-minute audio message posted on a jihadist website Friday, al-Zawahiri called on the Syria's al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra, also known as al-Nusra Front, to stop fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).
Al Qaeda splinter group ISIS this week staged bodies to look like they were crucified in the northern Syrian city of Raqqa.
In a recent long-ranging interview, al-Zawahiri urged Muslims to capture Westerners as pawns that might be used to free prisoners aligned with his movement.
