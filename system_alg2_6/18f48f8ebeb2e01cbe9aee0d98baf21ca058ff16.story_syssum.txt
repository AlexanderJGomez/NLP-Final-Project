(CNN) -- It was like a scene from a big-budget Hollywood disaster movie -- a Godzilla of a fire roaring down the mountain, straight toward Brandon Hanson's Colorado Springs neighborhood.
"It's a lot worse than we thought," he ran in and told Maria.
The Hansons scoured through photos posted on online news sites trying see their house.
The fire has forced about 36,000 people to evacuate their homes.
"This flag is my son's.
I want to make sure I take that down," he told CNN affiliate KCNC.
Sobecki was born and raised in Colorado Springs, and he'd seen fires before.
"That is Colorado Springs, the city I was born and raised in, the city that is at war with nature," Sobecki said.
Mark Galley wondered whether he would see his house again in the Mount Shadows neighborhood.
For Russ Wolfe, it's going to take a long time for it to be OK.
"With much sadness we have to report that the Flying W Ranch as well as several homes in the Mountain Shadows area has in fact been burned to the ground," the website said.
Everything looked like it was on fire, smoke everywhere."
People were still trying to go on with life, as though that were possible.
The flames were among the people, in their city.
