Delbert Belton was in the parking lot outside the Eagles Lodge in Spokane on Wednesday night, waiting for a friend to pick him to go bowling, when the two teens robbed and assaulted him, leading to his death, police Chief Frank Straub Jr. said.
"We're hoping that he surrenders," the police chief said.
According to the 42-year-old Denison, Belton never had problems outside the lodge before -- no threats, no altercations, nothing -- until Wednesday night.
"If he had, I would made sure I was there," Denison said.
"What did they think they were going to get from this man?"
