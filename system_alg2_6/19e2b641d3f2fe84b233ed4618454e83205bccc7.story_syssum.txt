Santa Barbara, California (CNN) -- As Elliot Rodger was carrying out a deadly rampage Friday night around Santa Barbara, his parents were frantically trying to find him, having just received a chilling manifesto from their son.
His mother called Rodger's father, Peter, and said he had to watch the YouTube video.
She called one of his therapists, who then called a Santa Barbara mental health hotline.
In fact, Elliot Rodger himself wrote in the manifesto that he worried that someone had discovered his plan when the police visited.
"If that was the case, the police would have searched my room, found all of my guns and weapons, along with my writings about what I plan to do with them.
Rodger had been seeing therapists on and off since he was 8, according to Astaire.
Before his death, Rodger was seeing two therapists, Astaire added.
Astaire told CNN that Rodger never expressed any fascination with guns.
"(His parents) were conscious and concerned about their son's health," Astaire said.
