Supporting Small Trades also means supporting factory owner Gary Pleam, whose great-great grandfather built a water wheel in 1873 to power the hat factory that became Mohnton Mills in 1906.
Today, Deysher is the sewing floor supervisor who "makes everything work," Pleam said.
Small Trades is just one brand that will be featured on Zady, a shopping site launching this week dedicated to fashion transparency.
"People care about where their clothes come from, and they want to know the story behind the label."
Co-founders Darabi and Maxine Bédat say they are targeting people like themselves, style-conscious and socially aware shoppers who have outgrown their trendy wardrobe of cheaply made goods.
"We've seen through the whole farm-to-table movement that people care about where their food comes from," she said.
Zady is just one brand that's trying to tell the stories of where clothes come from.
Some call it slow fashion, ethical fashion or conscious consumerism.
"More and more people want to know the story behind their clothes, and they're turning to the internet to find it."
This month, Bédat and Darabi piled into a car with Small Trades founder Robin Weiss to visit Mohnton Knitting Mills.
The last good year was 1998, Pleam said.
If Pleam could do it again, he'd do it all the same, he said, because business was good most of the time, and they've had a lot of laughs at work, staff picnics and Friday hot dog lunches.
"It just gives us our drive and motivation to make Zady work."
