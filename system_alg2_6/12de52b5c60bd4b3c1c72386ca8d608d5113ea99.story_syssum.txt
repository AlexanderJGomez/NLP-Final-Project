Officials and many residents have long known they live in landslide country, Pennington said.
Some experts and residents of Oso, Washington, now take sharp exception with Pennington.
"This is a valley lined with landslides, going back 14,000 years when the glaciers left," Haugerud said.
"We will get to the answer," Inslee told CNN this week.
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers spokeswoman Patricia Graesser said the study spoke to how people were living in the landslide area but the report wasn't a risk assessment of landslide hazards.
"I currently have no basis for estimating the probable rate or timing of future landslide activity," Miller's study states.
Local officials apprised residents of the perils as public improvements were made after the 2006 landslide, Pennington said.
While authorities might have done more -- like making sure that all landowners knew about the risk -- that doesn't absolve residents who built houses there, Miller said.
"Fishing is a big deal here in Washington," Haugerud said.
"This is a corner of the world where the majority of the people are very happy not to have much government regulations," Haugerud said.
Speaking as a Washington state resident -- and not as government geologist -- Haugerud said reforms may be needed to ensure local officials impose stricter regulations in landslide zones.
