To transform this positive choice into a global movement, Stein and I created the first World Vasectomy Day in 2013 -- and set out to inspire 100 doctors in 25 countries to do 1,000 vasectomies.
It has a less than 1% failure rate, compared with 18% for condoms, making it an important option for men whose families are complete.
Sadly, while men waffle on the sidelines, more than 300 million women have had tubal ligations -- six times the number of men having vasectomies, even though tubal ligations are more invasive, costly and risky.
There were men who traveled hundreds of miles to have the procedure for their wives, and those who did it to help their children emerge from poverty.
On World Vasectomy Day, we don't decide who should or should not get a vasectomy, but we do insist that it be voluntary.
The bottom line is that all methods of birth control come with some element of risk.
What we learned in creating World Vasectomy Day bodes well for our future.
