Montevideo, Uruguay (CNN) -- The passage of a landmark marijuana legalization measure Tuesday means Uruguay is set to become the first country in the world to have a system regulating legal production, sale and consumption of the drug.
Critics said legalizing marijuana could have dangerous consequences.
He told CNN en EspaÃ±ol last year that he supported legalizing marijuana.
Once the bill becomes law, there will be a 120-day period to give the government time to adopt regulations and implement it.
The same debates about marijuana that exist in the United States -- about medicinal properties, recreational use, the impact on the justice system -- have been happening in Uruguay for a long time, Calzada said.
"It's a very bad piece of legislation, mainly because it increases the availability of marijuana in the market," he said.
The legislation also calls for mandatory classes in public schools aimed at drug prevention and bans the advertising of cannabis in any form.
