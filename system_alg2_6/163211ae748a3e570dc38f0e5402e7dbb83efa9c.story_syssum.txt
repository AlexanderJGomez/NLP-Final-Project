Syria feels far away; a tragedy, no doubt, but to many who strongly oppose any kind of intervention, it is simply too removed, too complicated, too foreign to view as an American problem.
2) Chemical weapons will be used in future battlegrounds: More than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria.
If it passes without a response, this will not be the last time we see these weapons in use -- and not just in a distant battlefield.
3) The war is spreading, the choices are worsening: The United States has largely kept its distance in the Syrian civil war.
In the meantime, the war is bursting beyond Syrian borders.
4) Inaction will hand a victory to al-Assad, Iran and Hezbollah: The Obama administration is telegraphing an attack against Syria aimed at punishing al-Assad and sending a message to the world, rather than seeking to change the course of this civil war.
5) A new generation of hatred will perpetuate this tragedy: The war in Syria has raged for 2Â½ years.
The United States and its friends should strike al-Assad in a way that shows the world will not tolerate the use of chemical weapons, and prove that America's threats and international commitments have meaning and muscle.
Without sending any U.S. troops into Syria, the United States and its allies should find and strengthen the more moderate members of the opposition so they will gain the upper hand against extremists within opposition ranks.
