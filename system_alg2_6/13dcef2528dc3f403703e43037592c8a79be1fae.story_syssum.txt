Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Bangkok turned into a war zone Wednesday as Thai military forces cracked down on anti-government protesters, ending a tense standoff that has troubled the capital for weeks.
"I would like to give moral support to officers who are doing their duties now and would like to reassure you," Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva told citizens.
He said the government had regained full control and Red Shirt leaders had fled or were taken into police custody.
Hours after the large military operation got under way, soldiers took control of the park area.
At least five people, including an Italian journalist, were listed as killed by the Police Hospital in Bangkok.
"Negotiations failed because core [opposition] leaders are not to be able to make decisions by themselves," the statement said, alluding to an outside force influencing the protesters.
From his self-imposed exile abroad to avoid a trial on corruption charges, Thaksin released a statement Wednesday saying he was not the leader of the United Front for Democracy, the formal name of the Red Shirt opposition, and that their movement calling for new elections is not on his behalf.
"I never approve nor agree to any use of violence," he said.
