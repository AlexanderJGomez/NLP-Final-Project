"It's great to see beam circulating in the LHC again," said CERN Director General Rolf Heuer.
Now that a beam is circulating, the next step is low-energy collisions, which should begin in about a week, CERN said.
Had the machine been going, there would have been no damage, but beams would have been stopped until the machine could be cooled back down to operating temperatures, she said.
Mark Wise, professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology, said he's just as excited about the results that will come out of the LHC as he was last year and views the September 2008 accident as a delay rather than a devastating event.
The LHC will probably be in operation more than 20 years, Myers said.
ATLAS and CMS are the general-purpose experiments designed to find the Higgs boson and other rare particles that have never been detected before.
