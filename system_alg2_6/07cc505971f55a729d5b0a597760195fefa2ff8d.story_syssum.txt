Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani Taliban vowed Thursday to carry out attacks against India to avenge the death of a man executed by Indian authorities for his role in the 2008 terrorist assault on Mumbai.
The Taliban spokesman said they are demanding that Kasab's body be returned to Pakistan for an Islamic burial.
The Mumbai attacks destabilized peace talks between the Indian and Pakistani governments, which remain bitterly opposed over issues such as the disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir.
The sport has often been used as a platform to ease relations.
"It's a strong message that India does not and will not tolerate terrorism," said Prakash Javadekar, a party spokesman.
"The hanging of Ajmal Kasab marks a distressing end to India's moratorium on executions and is a step backwards for India's justice system," said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch, an advocacy group.
