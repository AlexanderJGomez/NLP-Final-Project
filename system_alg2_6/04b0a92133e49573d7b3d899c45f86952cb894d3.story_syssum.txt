Wilson, 38, died Saturday night at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan after suffering from breathing problems and other health issues, less than a year after DNA evidence led to his freedom, according to a statement from his attorney's office.
Yarbough, who was sentenced to 75 years to life in prison, also was released last year.
Yarbough and Wilson were already incarcerated when the 1999 rape and murder occurred, according to Adam Perlmutter, Wilson's attorney.
He had been out of prison less than two years, said Jeffrey Deskovic, whose foundation had worked with Lopez to help secure his release.
