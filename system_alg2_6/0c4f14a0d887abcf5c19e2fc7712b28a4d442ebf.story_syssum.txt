Checklists.
As the world learns more about Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot on Germanwings Flight 9525, it is readily apparent that this young man had psychiatric issues far beyond clinical depression.
Considering the hoops Lubitz had to jump through to have established himself as a Germanwings co-pilot, it's curious to me how the red flags of his illness were missed.
Glider flying is one of the purest forms of aviation.
Second, Lubitz had to compete successfully in a selection process just to have the opportunity to train through Lufthansa's flight program, a requirement of Germanwings employment.
The purpose of an MPL is to funnel airline pilot candidates having little or no flight time into the right seat as first officers.
As a 21-year-old flight instructor, I had that much flight time; it hardly qualified as a lot of experience.
Aside from observing and checking performance criteria, wouldn't at least one instructor have noticed behavioral issues in such an intense environment?
After all, the selection process was most likely highly competitive, with other qualified candidates readily available.
Depending upon a pilot's monthly flight time, salary for pilots can be as much as 20% lower than the mainline carrier.
Could it have been prevented?
