(CNN) -- Another State of the Union address, another road trip for President Barack Obama to push now-familiar policies that he said he would pursue on his own if Congress won't cooperate.
He said what?
"A speech by Barack Obama is a lot like sex," said GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos.
"Let's make this a year of action," Obama said.
The President also promised an executive order to raise the minimum wage for some government contract workers.
"We hope the President will join us in a year of real action -- by empowering people -- not by making their lives harder with unprecedented spending, higher taxes, and fewer jobs," she said.
"The American people aren't interested in refighting old battles," Obama said.
Obama said he will order the U.S. Treasury to create a new federal retirement savings account called MyRA, a savings bond that would guarantee "a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in."
Along with his order raising the minimum wage for workers on federal contracts, Obama asked Congress to get on board with a Democratic proposal to raise the federal minimum to $10.10 per hour.
