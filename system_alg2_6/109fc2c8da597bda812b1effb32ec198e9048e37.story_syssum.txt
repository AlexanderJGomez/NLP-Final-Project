Spanish National Police said Friday they have seized hundreds of kilograms of cocaine in an operation that they said thwarted an attempt by Mexican drug dealers allied with the Sinaloa drug cartel to establish a foothold in Europe.
"They adopted great measures of security to ensure the success of the operations, and sent various containers without any type of drug.
The container, which was intercepted in late July in the Port of Algeciras, concealed 373 kilos of cocaine."
If indeed "Chapo" Guzman's cousin was among the men arrested, "that is a big deal," said Beith, whose books "The Last Narco" and "Hasta El Ultimo Dia," focus on the Mexican drug war.
