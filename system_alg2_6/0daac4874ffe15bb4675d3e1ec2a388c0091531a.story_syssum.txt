In the conversation, recorded Sunday by a reporter for radio station WNEW, the woman says Darion Aguilar never had a gun before and was a gentle teenager.
Family friend Ellis Cropper, who is serving as a spokesman for Aguilar's mother, told CNN on Monday that police reviewed the journal after the mother called police to file a missing person report.
Several hours later, she went to check on him, and the store manager said Aguilar had never showed up, according to Cropper.
According to Cropper, police -- who were aware of the mall shooting -- then asked if Aguilar kept a journal.
She loved being a mother," McDonald said.
The mall reopened Monday afternoon, but the Zumiez store will be closed indefinitely, according to a sign on the boarded up storefront.
Cory Brown, the co-owner, said Aguilar walked in with a friend and after spending about 30 minutes in the store, he was approved to purchase the Mossberg 500.
Brown said Aguilar came back just before Christmas with the same friend and purchased another box of shotgun shells.
Police said Cody Cousins, 23, an engineering student, killed Andrew Boldt, 21, of West Bend, Wisconsin.
Last Monday, a student was shot and critically injured near a gym at Widener University near Philadelphia.
