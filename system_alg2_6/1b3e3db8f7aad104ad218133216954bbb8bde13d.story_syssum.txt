Mention "self-marriage" in any given group, and many people will likely chuckle over the notion of a sad, slump-shouldered bachelor who's given up on the idea of ever finding love, or a gift-grubbing girl just in it for the gravy boat and stand mixer.

We had 120 people there and after each vow when we had people say that they promised to do it, and they together said, "I promise!"
Some people might feel self-conscious in a group.
It doesn't have to be about that.
Some of us have done a lot of work on ourselves.
Maybe you just love the beach and want to do this there.
We also ask people to think about the things that trip you up.

Part of what Jeffrey and I want is for more people to focus on that in the most selfless way, so happiness and joy can spread.
