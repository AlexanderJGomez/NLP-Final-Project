"This is the first time we had to close off air filtered by the facility to the outside," Energy Department spokesman Gregory Sahd told CNN.
"And everyone that was in the facility (at the time), we know where they are and we've tested them."
Sahd said there have been no injuries reported, and the area officials believe was affected has been closed off.
