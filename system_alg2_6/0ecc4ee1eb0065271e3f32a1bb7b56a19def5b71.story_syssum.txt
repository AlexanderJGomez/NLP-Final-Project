Now, the U.S. team will have to find steelier resolve for its next contest, against soccer powerhouse Germany on Thursday.
Some made it all the way to the jungle heat of Manaus where the game took place; others joined a crowd of about 20,000 people gathered in front of a big screen in Rio de Janeiro, chanting their belief in an American victory.
Portugal netted the ball first.
They did -- until the end of the game and for four of the five minutes of stoppage time.
"You're disappointed not to get three points but at the same time you have to take the positives from the game," Dempsey said.
That confrontation is an intriguing one for U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann, who played for the German team that won the World Cup in 1990.
A tie would also be good enough to qualify, leaving Team USA second on five points, level with Germany, which would finish top because of a better goal difference.
If Portugal and Ghana tie, the United States would stay in second place on four points.
So if Ghana wins by more than one goal, and the United States loses by one or more goals, Ghana would snatch second place.
"We have to make it against Germany."
