(CNN) -- Normally Germany and France are close partners at the heart of Europe -- but U.S. diplomatic cables suggest a battle royal between the two allies over satellite technology, with the German space and intelligence agencies accusing the French of bad faith and looking to the United States as a future partner to develop next-generation satellites.
In February 2009, U.S. diplomats were told that "to minimize possible political backlash from developing HiRos as an intelligence satellite, the program will be managed by a civil agency."
A senior German official suggested that three German and three U.S. satellites could be deployed, with the imagery being shared.
CNN has reached out to the German space agency for further comment on the status and funding of HiRos.
