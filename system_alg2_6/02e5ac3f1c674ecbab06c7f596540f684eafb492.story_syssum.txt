Yet for Maroney, it wasn't simply a fun opportunity -- it's part of a larger goal to one day become a working actress.
But "after it's all said and done with the Olympics and Worlds and whatever I get the chance to do, I think that would be my time to really get into acting, something that I want to have as my job when I'm older," she said.
I'm not one kind of person, and that's the whole thing about being an actress, being able to play all different kind of roles."
"It was my first time ever doing anything like that," Maroney said.
I really like the character Rose on the show ... and I thought if I was ever going to be on the show, I'd really want to play her, and then I ended up being her best friend.
I really just take things one step at a time.
I really want to try to go to this next Olympics, [and] after I heal up I'll be back in the gym working as hard as I possibly could just like I did for this Olympics.
So I'll really be getting into trying to work for the next Olympics, and in between that I'll be doing, hopefully, little things like what I just did."
