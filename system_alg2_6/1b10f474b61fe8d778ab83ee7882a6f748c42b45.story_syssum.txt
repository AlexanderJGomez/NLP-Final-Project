(CNN) -- Chief Clerk Walter Dimmick was convicted of stealing six bags of gold coins -- worth $30,000 -- from the U.S. Mint in San Francisco in 1901.
The so-called Saddle Ridge Hoard was discovered by a husband and wife in February 2013 on their property in Northern California.
Kagin dismissed the idea that the coins could be connected to the turn-of-the-century heist.
"If you had robbed the U.S. Mint in 1901, you'd have 1901, 1900, 1899 coins.
"Nothing resonates like buried treasure," Kagin said, as a smile broke across his face.
"Unlike other hoards and treasures, this one includes a great variety of coins struck over many different years, and many of the coins are still in pristine condition," Kagin said.
