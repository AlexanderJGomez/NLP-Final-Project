(CNN) -- Next Monday, Google is officially shutting down its popular RSS feed reader, Google Reader.
(Many of the tools we mention will import data automatically from Google if you sign up before Reader closes.)
Is sharing stories important, or is reading the news a solitary activity?
You can follow your favorite news organizations or drill down by finding their Twitter accounts for specific sections or topics.
The RSS fire hose of news can be overwhelming for many people.
RSS readers are great because you can scan headlines and the first few sentences of articles and get the gist without having to read them, only going further if it's a topic about which you want to know more.
There is also Google News, which looks at all the news sources and arranges the breaking stories by popularity, highlighting the in-depth, opinion and featured stories on the topic.
A neat visual take on Google News is Newsmap.jp, which Marcos Weskamp created before moving to Flipboard to work as a designer.
Google Reader was a great tool that will be missed, but its death is an opportunity to try new things and play with different apps, sites and tools for reading news online.
