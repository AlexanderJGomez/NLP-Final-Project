NEW YORK (CNN) -- It's been a year since the parents of a severely disabled child made public their decision to submit their daughter to a hysterectomy, breast surgery and drugs to keep the girl forever small.
In the year since Ashley's parents went public, not only did the hospital that sterilized Ashley admit it broke Washington state law, but also the doctor who treated Ashley committed suicide.
One of her doctors described her mental capacity as that of a 6-month-old, dependent upon her parents to meet every need.
"If parents of children like Ashley believe this treatment will improve their children's quality of life, then they should be diligent and tenacious in providing it for them," her parents write.
He strongly believed this treatment should be available to them."
Another complicating factor -- some doctors remain adamant the treatment shouldn't be available.
"People with disabilities have to look at the potential of our lives: of available new technology, new equipment, medical advances.
Ashley's parents remain convinced what they did for Ashley is the most loving choice they could have made for their daughter and want that for other disabled children.
