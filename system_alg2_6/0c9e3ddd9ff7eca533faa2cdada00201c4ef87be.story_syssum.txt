The 2014 World Cup qualifying tie will be the first time the two teams have played each other since the break up of the former Yugoslavia and then the Croatian War of Independence, which raged between 1991 and 1995.
Like Stimac, Serbia coach Sinisa Mihajlovic wants his players to inspire passionate support from their fans.
"The stadium in Zagreb was like a volcano," recalls Mihajlovic, who played in the match, while Stimac missed out.
"There were police everywhere.
"Every time I went up to take a free-kick or a corner, tension was high," continued Mihajlovic, as he recalled more memories from that Zagreb game in 1990.
"It is a little different now.
For them this is a game.
They both got sent off bad mouthing each other.
