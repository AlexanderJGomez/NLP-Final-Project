(CNN) -- Nanci Griffith wanted to look on the bright side.
Music has always done that for me," she said.
I [want] my audience to hear these stories," she said.
Things came along like the Mildred and Richard Loving case ("The Loving Kind"), where Mildred died, and I read her obituary.
Griffith: No, never in my life.
CNN: Now, in addition to "The Loving Kind," there are other songs based on actual events on this record.
I feel like, in some ways, I'm just a journalist.
Griffith: I do.
Griffith: I was always more interested in story songs, things with a point of view ... and things that informed me.
When you're writing a personal song like "Rain," it's straight from your heart and seems to just flow.
