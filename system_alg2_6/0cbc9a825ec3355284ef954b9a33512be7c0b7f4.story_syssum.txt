Now, however, comes the time to be explicit: to speak out loud his affiliation, his fraternal pride and concern.
In a Father's Day talk at a black church in Chicago, he criticized "too many fathers" for "acting like boys not men."
In urban areas, fewer than half graduate from high school.
Politically it was not the smartest thing to say (the LGBT community didn't turn Obama into the most gay friendly president in U.S. history by going easy on him) but any black man could understand the sentiment.
The president isn't the only black man who needs to step up support of his brothers.
President Obama cannot, on his own, reverse this course, but he can do much more than he has to disrupt the flow of the one in three young black men who are headed to prison.
What a difference it might make for the millions of black boys who now are headed to destinies very different from graduating from Morehouse College or becoming president of the United States.
