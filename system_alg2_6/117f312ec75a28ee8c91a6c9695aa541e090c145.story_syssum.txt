(CNN) -- Charlie Sheen has filed a lawsuit against adult film actress Capri Anderson, claiming she tried to extort money from him following an October incident at New York's Plaza Hotel, a representative for the actor told CNN Monday.
She answered that she was in  shock, "I never expected the night to unfold the way it did," said  Anderson.
"He was searched, she was searched, the room was searched by the New York Police Department, it's a total fabrication," Galanter said.
