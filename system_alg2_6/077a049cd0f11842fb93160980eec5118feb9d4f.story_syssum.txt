(CNN)Not one, but two French citizens have been connected to beheadings in a recent ISIS video, both of them 22-year-old men who went to Syria to join the group, authorities said Wednesday.
The ranks of ISIS -- the extremist group calling itself the Islamic State that's taken over vast swaths of Syria and Iraq -- have swelled with volunteers coming from outside the region, including from the West.
Those worries have been heightened by the group's brutal tactics against foe and civilians alike, such as raping, enslaving and selling Iraqi women belonging to the Yazidi religious minority.
The West is fighting back, with many countries -- including France -- allying with Iraq to conduct airstrikes targeting ISIS in that country.
Meanwhile, fighting continues in Syria as well, some of it near the Turkish border.
