The 43-year-old former Russian agent turned Kremlin critic pointed his finger directly at Vladimir Putin, then as now, Russia's strongman president.
The poison used to kill Litvinenko is a rare radioactive isotope, polonium-210.
He was a former agent of the Russian Federal Security Service, the FSB, the post-Soviet successor of the feared KGB.
All or any of the above may have been sufficient reason to kill a man seen by his former FSB colleagues as a traitor.
Perhaps only President Putin, himself a former KGB agent, has the answer to that.
