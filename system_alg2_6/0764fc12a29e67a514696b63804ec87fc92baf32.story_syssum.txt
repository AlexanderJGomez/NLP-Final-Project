Richard Myers, the former police chief in Colorado Springs, will take office in Sanford at the end of the week, the city government announced Tuesday.
About $5,000 of that went toward the $15,000 cash Zimmerman put up to post bond, defense lawyer Mark O'Mara said last week.
For the next three to five months, Myers "will be responsible for reviewing Sanford Police Department's performance as it relates to the Trayvon Martin case as well as provide overall leadership," according to Colorado Springs police department spokeswoman Barbara Miller.
Myers resigned that post in 2011 after Stephen Bach was elected as the city's new mayor.
Earlier this year, Myers served a three-month term as interim chief of police in Manitou Springs, a small community outside Colorado Springs.
Myers' time in Colorado Springs ended with a controversy surrounding an undercover sting operation at a Hooters restaurant.
The detectives left and the restaurant and the waitress later were cited for serving intoxicated patrons.
The Colorado Springs Gazette and other media reported that Myers dismissed any notion that the Hooter's controversy played a part in his retirement in a Facebook post.
