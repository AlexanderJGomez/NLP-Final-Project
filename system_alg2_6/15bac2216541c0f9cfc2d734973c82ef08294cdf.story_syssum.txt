(CNN) -- The European Court of Human Rights condemned Ireland's laws on abortion Thursday, ruling the country violated the human rights of a woman forced to go abroad to end her pregnancy.
The Irish Supreme Court ruled in 1992 that abortion is lawful in Ireland if there is a risk to the mother's life, but the Irish Parliament has never passed a law guaranteeing that right.
Proving that her pregnancy posed a risk to her life required the Lithuanian woman to establish it either with her doctor or through the courts.
"Ireland's failure to legislate to protect the rights of women has been clearly exposed by the European Court of Human Rights today," said Mark Kelly, director of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, in a statement.
The Irish government argued the woman should have tried to go through the Irish court system to prove her pregnancy was a risk to her life, but the court said that would have been ineffective because it would be "inappropriate" to ask a woman to go through complex constitutional proceedings if her life was at risk.
"It is time for the government to end their ostrich mentality regarding abortion and start delivering on women's human rights," Mollmann said.
