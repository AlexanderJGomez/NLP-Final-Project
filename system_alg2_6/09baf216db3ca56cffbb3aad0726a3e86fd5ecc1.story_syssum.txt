Boston (CNN)After weeks of dramatic testimony, jurors are set to begin deliberations Tuesday in the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who faces life in prison or  the death penalty for working with his brother to explode bombs at the 2013 Boston Marathon.
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev "chose a day when the eyes of the world would be on Boston," Chakravarty said.
The prosecutor showed a picture of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan in the marathon crowd.
If Tsarnaev is found guilty of at least one of the 17 capital counts, the trial will proceed to a second phase, the so-called penalty phase.
"These children weren't innocent to him," the prosecutor said.
But luck had nothing to do with the Boston bombings, the prosecutor said.

Lu "received blast injuries all over her body.
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev struck Tamerlan, who was wounded, when he charged police in the car.
"Tamerlan wanted suicide by cop," the prosecutor said Monday.
We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all."
