Rolling Stone labeled the Everly Brothers "the most important vocal duo in rock," having influenced the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Simon & Garfunkel and many other acts.
"The amount of music that can be directly traced to the Everly Brothers is incredible," wrote one admirer on Twitter.
In 1957, they found a Felice and Boudleaux Bryant song, "Bye Bye Love."
"Bye Bye Love" was "the first thing that really killed me," Paul Simon once recalled.
The Everlys also served to bond the nascent Beatles.
