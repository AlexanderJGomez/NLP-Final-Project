(CNN) -- In the blink of an eye, Uber has emerged as one of the most esteemed companies in the United States, soaring in recent days to a market value of $18.2 billion.
Lack of transparency may be one.

It must bring context to the chaos it creates and be known as a positive force for change that always acts on behalf of its consumers, not its business model.
