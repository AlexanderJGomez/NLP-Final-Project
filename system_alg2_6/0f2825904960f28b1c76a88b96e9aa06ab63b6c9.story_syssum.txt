It also has formed several children's homes in Haiti and India.
We had dewormed 1.7 million children at the time.
Seeing these kids run around after being dewormed, it's an amazing thing.
Jackson: We now have seven children's homes: four in Haiti and three in India.
One in Haiti is for HIV-positive children.
Jackson: Some of these kids we've had for about eight years.
We're not going to help Haiti -- or whatever country we're working in -- if we send the kids away.
We were in the middle of our national deworming program and treating every child -- all 3.2 million kids -- and we had distributed half of that.
Jackson: We were extremely fortunate.
Jackson: Rainn has been extremely beneficial on all fronts, helping bring awareness and raise money for the cause.
We own some rainforest land in Peru -- 1,000 acres -- for preservation, and we're looking to do the same model in Ecuador.
It's said that two out of every 10 breaths we take come from the Amazon rainforest.
It's important to preserve that for our future.
