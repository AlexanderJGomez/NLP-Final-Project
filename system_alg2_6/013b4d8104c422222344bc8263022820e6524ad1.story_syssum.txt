It's hard to believe that in just a few weeks the very same East End docks will be transformed into a St Tropez-style luxury marina worthy of the world's A-list celebrities.
"It will be a mini Monaco," Benjamin Sutton from concierge service MGMT told CNN.
Berths are roughly £60 ($90) a meter per day, with a 70-meter superyacht setting you back a whopping £58,000 ($90,000) for two weeks of the Games.
And when the superyacht owners come out to play, nearby restaurant and club Waterside House will be offering them the exclusive, high-end entertainment they've come to expect.
We've got Olympic contestants, oligarchs, ambassadors, celebrities and CEOs of some of the largest companies in the world.
And it wasn't until the London Docklands Development Corporation redeveloped the site in the late 1980s -- including the financial hub of Canary Wharf -- that the docklands was reborn.
The Olympic makeover is the latest development for this historic East End heartland -- one which Benjamin predicts could give it a lasting reputation.
