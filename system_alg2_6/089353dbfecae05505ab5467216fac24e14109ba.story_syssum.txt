If we could see off camera, we might see Bieber's attorney subtly shaking his head in frustration.
What is a deposition?
But a deposition is not a trial.
Watch, for example, when he answers: "Guess what?
You can't answer if you don't know the question:  Bieber can be seen interrupting questions to answer.
Wait until the question is complete; pause and ask yourself if you understand the question; if you do, ask yourself if you know the answer to the question; if you do, only answer the question asked.
Bieber."
At a deposition, the lawyer asks the questions, not the witness.
Bieber may not like the questions, but he takes his chances with the judge if he refuses to answer.
In text form, sarcasm doesn't read like sarcasm:  Sarcasm is using words to indicate (sarcastically) the opposite of what you really want to say.
He can object "for the record," which means the judge can later decide if the answer is ultimately admissible at trial.
Bieber appears on the video to really think about the meaning of the questions and his answers.
If he could carve out his other behavior, in some respects, he's not half-bad as a deponent.
