(CNN) -- A week after students seized Taiwan's legislative building over a controversial trade deal with China, Taiwan's president Ma Ying-jeou agreed to meet with protest leaders to help end the standoff and allow the legislature to get back on track, a spokesperson for the president's office said.
Taiwan signed the service trade pact with China, its biggest trade partner in June last year, but it is yet to be ratified.
Protesters, who claimed negotiations over the deal were opaque and undemocratic, broke into the legislative building in Taipei the next day, demanding that the pact be scrapped.
Student leader Lin Fei-fan,speaking to CNN by phone from inside the legislature building Monday, criticized the pact.
The protests have garnered widespread support among Taiwanese living abroad.
