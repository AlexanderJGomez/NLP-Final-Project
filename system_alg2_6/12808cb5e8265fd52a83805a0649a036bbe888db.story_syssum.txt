Moscow (CNN) -- Moscow is a city defined by its scale.
It's actually quite beautiful in many parts, especially at night when it is lit up.
It's got the feel of a village and is crammed with interesting little shops and cafes, including a favorite bar (Klava) and excellent bakery (Volkonsky).
Sanduny Banya, the ultimate traditional Russian sauna.
Is there one that's actually worth seeing?
It has Indian staff, who all speak English, and fabulous views over city.
