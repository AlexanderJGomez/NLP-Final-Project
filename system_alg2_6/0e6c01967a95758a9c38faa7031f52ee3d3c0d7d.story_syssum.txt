German, 31, was fatally shot on duty Saturday by two teens who had run away from home, police said.
"Debbie and I have been complimented routinely this week by many on what a great job we as parents did in raising Robbie: Someone so loyal, fun, helpful, prankish, caring of others -- a hero," Tim German said, his voice quavering during the memorial Thursday in Longwood, Florida.
He had responded to a scene involving an autistic person, Windermere police Chief Dave Ogden said, standing before German's flag-draped casket.
Two days before the shooting, Brandon Goode, 18, and Alexandria "Alex" Hollinghurst, 17, both of Davenport, Florida, reportedly ran away from home, leaving only letters behind for their families to find.
Don't take that as me putting the blame on you because that is the furthest thing from the truth.
Once the letters were found, the couple's parents called police to alert them to the teens' disappearances.
When deputies responded to the scene, they found German "lying on the roadway, mortally wounded," the Orange County Sheriff's Office said.
Our deepest sympathy and our heartfelt prayers go out to the friends and family of Officer German.
We have no answers, only questions."
