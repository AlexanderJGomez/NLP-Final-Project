Throughout New York City, about 52,000 of ConEd's 3.2 million customers lost power during the heat wave.
"It's hard to imagine how anyone could believe that -- in the United States -- we should learn to cope with blackouts," said University of Minnesota Professor Massoud Amin, a leading expert on the U.S. electricity grid.
In a nutshell, a smart grid is an automated electricity system that improves the reliability, security and efficiency of electric power.
Failing to modernize the grid, he said, will threaten the U.S. position as an economic super power.
For example, a project to help Queens' Flushing neighborhood will "give us the capability to remotely control up to 26 underground switches," said Con Ed smart grid manager Thomas Magee.
"As you can see, we have a long way to go," said Andres Carvallo, who played a key role in planning the smart grid in Austin, Texas.
Without mentioning specific regions, Lauby said utilities are "making sure the generation and the transmission are available to help support those consumers."
The 'Easy Button'  Carvallo jokes about the so-called "Easy Button" at Austin Energy.
Soon, when power goes out in a neighborhood with smart meters, utilities won't have to wait for customers to report outages -- the smart meters will alert utilities automatically.
One advantage of smart grid technology may be jobs.
