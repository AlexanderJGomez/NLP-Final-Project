Facing skeptical legislators from both parties, Kerry tried to assure them that he shares their mistrust of Iran while asking that they halt the drive for new sanctions for now to give negotiations, which also involve the other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany, a chance to succeed.
"They know that if they fail, sanctions will be increased," Kerry said of Iran.
The interim agreement eases some $7 billion in economic sanctions in return for limiting aspects of Iran's nuclear program, Kerry told the committee.
Others used more graphic language, with GOP Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama comparing Iran's threats against Israel to Nazi Germany.
Obama said over the weekend that he would accept a peaceful nuclear program in Iran, including modest uranium enrichment.
To legislators calling for more sanctions, Kerry said economic strictures alone had failed to prevent Iran from expanding its centrifuges in recent years as it made progress toward developing a nuclear weapon.
Under the agreement, they can't have highly enriched uranium."
