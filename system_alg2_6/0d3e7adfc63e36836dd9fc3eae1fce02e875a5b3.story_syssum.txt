At its December open meeting, the Federal Communications Commission may vote on a proposed rule that would mandate automatic data-roaming agreements between carriers and address consumer worries by requiring reasonable prices for this service.
To impose the rule, the FCC would need to change the legal framework that governs broadband services -- an idea pushed by net neutrality advocates but vehemently opposed by many Republicans and internet providers.
The carriers also have a more fundamental objection to the proposed data-roaming rule: They claim the FCC does not have the authority to regulate the data side of their business.
The agenda for the December FCC open meeting has not yet been published.
If a vote on the data-roaming proposal appears on that agenda, the FCC might be able to get this rule approved under the wire, increasing its ability to pursue its net neutrality plans, before a more hostile Congress moves in.
