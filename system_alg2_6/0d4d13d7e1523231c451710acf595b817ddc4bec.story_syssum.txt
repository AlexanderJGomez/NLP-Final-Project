Barely 200 yards up the road, the crowd encountered a squad of armored Turkish riot police and a big police vehicle blocking the road.
Tuesday marked the second time in two days Turkish riot police used force against unsanctioned gatherings of political groups challenging the government.
The riots in Istanbul and other Turkish cities mark yet another day in a bloody 30-year cycle of violence between the Turkish state and the Kurds.
For decades, the Kurdish language was banned in Turkey despite the fact the Kurds make up the country's largest ethnic minority.
The parents of some of those prisoners were in a tent in a park in Istanbul's Okmeydani neighborhood Tuesday morning, staging a sit-in to support their children on hunger strike.
"No one has the right to make our kids rot in jail like this for two and a half years," Polat said.
As squads of riot police and armored cars chased stone-throwing Kurds through the streets of Okmeydani, a police vehicle rounded a corner and started firing its water cannon at the tent where at least 20 mostly middle aged Kurdish women sat on carpets.
But less than five minutes later, armored police officers began ripping down the tent.
"Get the mothers!
another Kurdish man screamed.
Turkey's Kurdish conflict is still very far from over.
