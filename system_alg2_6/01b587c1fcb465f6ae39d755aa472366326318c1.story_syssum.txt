(CNN) -- U.S soccer star Robbie Rogers has "come out" as gay on the day he retired from the game Friday.
"I will always be thankful for my career.
It's time to discover myself away from football.
Truth is not always easy to display, but truly strong people always find a way #RESPECT"
But not since the tragic loss of Justin Fashanu has a top-flight league witnessed an openly gay professional football player.
It's the nature of the business.
And while football has yet to move with the times, progress is being made.
"When a player gives a pass away or falls over, fans use homophobia abuse to put them down and it's that which we want to stop.
Rogers' story has been met with admiration from fellow gay football players, but his retirement from the game means that the community is still waiting for a player to come out and continue playing.
"And the fact that no professional player has come out in recent years means there are still issues to deal with.
