Fox searched for his daughter for 40 minutes inside and outside their Wilmington, Illinois, home and then called police, according to authorities.
Her body was found later that day in a river in Forked Creek, Illinois, just 4 miles from the family's home.
Riley often fell asleep on the sofa and her 6-year-old brother on the chair near her while watching TV, Zellner said.
Fox has said the front door was wide open when he awoke, Zellner said, as was the back door.
Indeed, five months later, Will County sheriff's officers arrested and charged Kevin Fox with the sexual assault and murder of his daughter.
"For weeks before her disappearance, I couldn't shake a feeling of uneasiness, strange noises at night outside our house, as if someone were lurking and watching us," Melissa Fox said.
The family is offering a $100,000 reward, and the FBI is offering $10,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for Riley Fox's death.
