Apple received 3,542 of these "device information" requests in the U.S. for 8,605 devices, and Apple turned over some or all of the desired information 88 of the time.
This is the first time Apple has released a transparency report.
The last line under the notes section in the report says, "Apple has never received an order under Section 215 of the USA Patriot Act.
"We have reported all the information we are legally allowed to share, and Apple will continue to advocate for greater transparency about the requests we receive," Apple said in the report.
We have no interest in amassing personal information about our customers," Apple said in the beginning of the report.
