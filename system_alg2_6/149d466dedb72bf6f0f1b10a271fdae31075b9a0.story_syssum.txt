(CNN) -- Costume designer Mark Bridges can create eras with fabric.
He spoke with CNN about how his job combines the best of all worlds, and what (or "who," for those who prefer the favored Oscar pre-show word) he'll be wearing on the red carpet.
It became a story of textures telling the story.
Bridges: I was always involved in theater and drama.
As a child, I loved movies, I always drew, I always loved fabric, I loved clothes, I loved color, I loved telling a story.
