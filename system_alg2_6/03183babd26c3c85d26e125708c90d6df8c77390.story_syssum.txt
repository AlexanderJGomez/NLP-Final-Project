(CNN) -- Civilians are in hiding in the Yemeni capital as protesters and government forces struggle for control on the streets of Sanaa.
At the medical camp, hundreds of young people were covered in blood and screaming from pain.
Dozens were killed and more than 700 were wounded -- many of them by gunshots -- over the last three days in clashes with the military, according to medical staff in Change Square.
Yemeni officials have said forces cracked down on those committing acts of violence during protests.
