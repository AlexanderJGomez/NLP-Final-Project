ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- A Georgia man convicted of kidnapping and killing his girlfriend was executed Tuesday.
Georgia became the first state to resume executions since the court validated the lethal injection process last month with a ruling in a Kentucky case.
In Mississippi, authorities had planned to execute Earl Wesley Berry on Monday, but the state Supreme Court set the date for May 21.
Moore regained consciousness and staggered outside, where she was shot a second time and put into the trunk of her car.
"We're here to express our opposition to the state of Georgia taking human life on behalf of U.S. citizens of Georgia," she said.
There have been 40 executions in the state since the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, ruling in a Georgia case.
If she is executed, she would be the first woman put to death in three years.
