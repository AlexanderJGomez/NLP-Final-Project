(CNN) -- Political groups and campaigns hoping to sway voters on the health care issue have spent about $70 million on health-themed TV ads since January 2011, according to a CNN analysis of ad spending data.
Most groups' health care ads were soundly opposed to the law.
Among the candidates, Obama's campaign spent $3.46 million on 8,211 spots, and presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney spent $3.8 million on 7,181 spots.
Restore our Future, the independent super PAC supporting Romney, spent $1.36 million on 3,589 spots.
"If I were a Republican candidate I would fill the airwaves with attack ads against Obamacare, just like they are doing, because this is one of the weakest links for this administration," Westen said.
The delay in implementing that provision, Westen says, let conservative groups run ads against the law before Americans experienced its benefits.
