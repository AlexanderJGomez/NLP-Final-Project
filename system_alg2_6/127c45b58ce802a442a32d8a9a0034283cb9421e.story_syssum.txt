"If you have bats roosting in your building, you can't disturb them in any way without getting a special license," says Kelly Gunnell, Built Environment Officer with the Bat Conservation Trust, a charitable organization in London, England.
"Only about half the bats here regularly use buildings as roosts, although nearly all of them will use them at some stage," says Gunnell.
"They can squeeze into the smallest places," says Gunnell.
Some species prefer tight spaces like cavities under roof piles, others need more space, like that found in attics.
"It's very preliminary, but there seems to be evidence that when you put solar panels on your roof, it can increase the internal roof void temperature, which can be disturbing to bats," says Gunnell.
"The problem we have is that, even if you take everything into account for the bats, they often just won't use the space you've created," says Gunnell.
That's quite a nicely designed bat house, but two years on, it's never been used by bats.
