(CNN) -- The parents of a 15-year-old girl who was gang-raped on a California high school campus urged the community Saturday to channel its anger over the event "through positive action," according to a pastor.
Another 10 people watched the attack without calling 911, police say.
The parents' statement urged the community to work to ensure that such an attack never happens again.
