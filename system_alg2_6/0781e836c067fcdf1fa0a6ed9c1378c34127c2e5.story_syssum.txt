(CNN) -- After a judge temporarily lifted a gag order so that he could respond to allegations made on YouTube by his ex-wife, comedian Steve Harvey Tuesday released court documents saying those allegations are false.
In the series of videos, Mary Harvey included excerpts of letters and e-mails she said she intercepted between Harvey and his current wife, Marjorie, near the end of her 16-year relationship with him.
Harvey "is authorized to publish this order for the limited purpose of refuting the allegations of respondent Mary Lee Harvey," the documents said.
Edmonds said that hearing is on contempt of court allegations against Mary Harvey.
