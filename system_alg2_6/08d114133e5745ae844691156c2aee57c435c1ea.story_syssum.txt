Boston (CNN)Hillary Clinton stood with those protesting the deaths of two unarmed black males at the hands of law enforcement on Thursday, telling an audience in Boston that "our country deserves a full and fair accounting" of what happened.
"We all know there are decent, honorable, brave police officers out in our communities every single day," Clinton said, before telling the audience the fact that African-American males are more likely to end up in prison than their white counterparts was a byproduct of an "out of balance" criminal justice system.
And I personally hope that these tragedies give us the opportunity to come together as a nation to find our balance again."
"These tragedies did not happen in some far away place.
Around the hall, there was excitement for Clinton.
Clinton was not the only high-profile speaker on the stage Thursday.
