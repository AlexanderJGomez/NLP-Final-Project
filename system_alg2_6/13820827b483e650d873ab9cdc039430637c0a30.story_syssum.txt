LONDON, England (CNN) -- Distinguished scientist Stephen Hawking was said to be in a "comfortable" condition Tuesday after spending the night in hospital, Cambridge University said in a statement.
ALS is "a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord," according to the ALS Association.
On his Web site, Hawking has written about living with ALS.
She said about 350,000 people worldwide have the disease.
"Over the last twenty years, observations have to a large extent confirmed the picture I painted in 'A Brief History of Time.'"
Hawking also predicted "great dangers" for the human race and said the species would have to look beyond the earth for its long-term survival.
If we can avoid disaster for the next two centuries, our species should be safe as we spread into space."
