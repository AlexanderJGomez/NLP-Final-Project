(CNN) -- The Justice Department charged Toyota with wire fraud on Wednesday as part of a settlement with prosecutors that will require the auto giant to pay $1.2 billion for admittedly misleading consumers and the government over unintended acceleration.
Under the agreement, the Justice Department will defer the criminal charge for three years, during which Toyota will submit to government monitoring.
Not only did Toyota fail to recall cars with problem parts, they continued to manufacture new cars with the same parts they knew were deadly," he said.
"In the more than four years since these recalls, we have gone back to basics at Toyota to put our customers first," he said.
