An FDA panel has called for more studies on how cold medicines affect children.
The committee said medicines with the same ingredients could be used by children ages 6 to 12.
Dr. Daniel Rausch, director of the pediatric hospital program for New York University, said that cold medicine is effective only at doses that are too strong for young children.
In August, federal health officials recommended the "consult your physician" advice to parents on the labels of cold and cough medicines aimed at young children be replaced by a warning not to use the medications in children under 2 unless directed to do so by a health care provider.
"Parents can continue to trust over-the-counter cough and cold remedies for their children," said Linda A. Suydam, president of the Consumer Healthcare Products Association.
Until those deaths, he did not realize that a dose of cold medicine could turn into a life-and-death issue among young children, he said.
