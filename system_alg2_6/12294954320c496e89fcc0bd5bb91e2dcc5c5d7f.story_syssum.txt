Now that he has been found guilty on every count, the jury must decide whether Boston Marathon bomber Tsarnaev, 21, should live or die for what he has done.
She was the one who could round up the family and put on big celebrations, he said.
"Dzhokhar Tsarnaev murdered each one of them in a way that they had time to feel pain, they had time to be scared and frightened, but they had no time to say good-bye," Pellegrini told the jury.
"She traded that in for a bat," Campbell said.
By contrast, jurors also were left with an indelible image of Tsarnaev, taken when he was in a holding cell in the very courthouse where the trial is being held.
Tsarnaev saw the people he killed as "the enemy," she said.
When she looked around, she saw blood and muscle everywhere.
"I remember looking around and it just seemed like there were bodies everywhere, blood everywhere."
Looking down at the blood I was just shocked that much blood could come out of someone," she said.
Celeste Corcoran lost both legs, one below the knee and the other above the knee.
She remembers being knocked to the ground, hearing nothing and then screams, and seeing blood everywhere.
"I remember thinking I was going to die, that no one could go through that much pain.
I remember thinking I wanted to die.
This can't be the end.'"
But she can never forget she's a double amputee.
"You don't realize until you're a double amputee how many dips and hills and inclines there are," she said.
