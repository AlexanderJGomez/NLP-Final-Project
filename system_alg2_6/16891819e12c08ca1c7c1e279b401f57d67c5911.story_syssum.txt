Savage and her neighbors say they had no clue that Thurmond, 36, had a wife, let alone four kids; they were also oblivious that Thurmond may have held the five hostage in the three-bedroom mobile home for three years.
Thurmond kindly told Savage he hadn't seen anything suspicious.
"I never saw them outside, never," she said.
Lt. Missy Collins, the investigator who had Thurmond arrested Tuesday after a two-week investigation, said her husband used to work with Thurmond at a pump-manufacturing facility in nearby Toccoa.
"You never saw anybody with him," the chief said.
Collins said Thurmond had once allegedly raped his wife with the children in the next room.
