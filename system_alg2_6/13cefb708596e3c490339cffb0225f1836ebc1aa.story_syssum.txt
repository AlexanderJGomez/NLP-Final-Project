Wynn, who will also decide Brown's case, said she believed the testimony of a limousine driver who said Brown hit Adams before Hollosy attacked.
Prosecutors and the defense lawyer began a discussion about granting immunity to Hollosy that would protect the bodyguard from having testimony in the Brown trial from being used against him in his case.
A limousine driver testified he witnessed Brown and Hollosy hit Adams.
Adams did not hit back, he said.
Brown voluntarily entered a rehab program a day after being released from a Washington jail in October, but he was kicked out a few days later for "throwing a rock through his mother's car window" after a family session at the center, a probation report said.
If he is convicted in that case, the judge would decide at a hearing Wednesday whether Brown should complete his probation in jail.
The rehab program told Brown to leave because of that statement and two other rules violations, the document said.
With his community labor work now on hold, his probation is expected to extend into 2015.
