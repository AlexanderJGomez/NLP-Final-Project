Bayard Winthrop: One of the big, dirty secrets in the apparel industry is that so much of the cost of what we pay for in our shirts and our pants is chewed up in distribution costs and big traditional marketing budgets.
Why is this?
If you actually monetize all of those things, I think that the difference between manufacturing overseas and manufacturing domestic is actually a lot less than most people think.
We rely on selling a sweat shirt to somebody that thinks it's of such high quality and we're standing for something that matters to them that they in turn will talk about it and become a fan and be loyal.
