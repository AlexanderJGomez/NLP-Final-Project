"She wasn't elected to become a political celebrity, she was elected to serve the people of Iowa," said Dave Kochel, an Iowa-based Republican strategist who advised Ernst during her Senate campaign.
While she acknowledged her historic win on election night, Love has also signaled that she will resist the efforts of others to define her by her race and gender.
"I think it's important to join and do what you can to make sure we are uniting Americans," Love told Fox host Greta Van Susteren Thursday.
