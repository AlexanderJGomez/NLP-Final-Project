It's official: U.S. President Barack Obama wants lawmakers to weigh in on whether to use military force in Syria.
In a televised address from the White House Rose Garden earlier Saturday, the president said he would take his case to Congress, not because he has to -- but because he wants to.
Top U.S. officials have said there's no doubt that the Syrian government was behind it, while Syrian officials have denied responsibility and blamed jihadists fighting with the rebels.
On Saturday, Obama proposed what he said would be a limited military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Any military attack would not be open-ended or include U.S. ground forces, he said.
Meanwhile, as uncertainty loomed over how Congress would weigh in, U.S. military officials said they remained at the ready.
"So we are quite concerned."
"The main reason Obama is turning to the Congress:  the military operation did not get enough support either in the world, among allies of the US or in the United States itself," Alexei Pushkov, chairman of the international-affairs committee of the Russian State Duma, said in a Twitter post.
A top Syrian diplomat told the state television network that Obama was facing pressure to take military action from Israel, Turkey, some Arabs and right-wing extremists in the United States.
On Saturday, Obama said "all told, well over 1,000 people were murdered."
