(CNN) -- With each day, the hunt for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 becomes one of the most baffling mysteries of the modern era, but history offers many great quests in which mankind searched for something or someone lost.
About 1,500 of the more than 2,200 people aboard the Titanic died.
A long search for a commercial airliner like Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 isn't unprecedented.
He vanished on July 30, 1975, after he stood outside the Machus Red Fox restaurant in Michigan and made a phone call.
But where?
It's one thing to imagine of a paradise like Atlantis.
They never found the seven lost cities of gold.
"Many have searched for the tomb of Alexander the Great, but no one had searched for that missing piece of ancient Egypt's story -- the tomb of Cleopatra, who took her own life rather than surrender her homeland to the Romans," Hawass wrote.
The disappearance of Flight 370 has nothing on the Bermuda Triangle.
Some even blame the triangle disasters on supernatural forces, including influences from lost Atlantis or another time-space dimension.
Call them aliens.
"The significance of a finding that there are other beings who share this universe with us would be absolutely phenomenal, it would be an epochal event in human history," Sagan once declared.
