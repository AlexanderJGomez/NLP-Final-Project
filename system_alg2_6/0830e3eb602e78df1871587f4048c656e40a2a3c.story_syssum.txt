When buying beef, we tend to stick to what we know, which may be why almost 60 percent of our beef dollars go for ground beef.
A 3½-ounce serving provides 27g to 30g of protein and is an excellent source of iron, zinc, and phosphorus.
• Grain-finished: Nearly 75 percent of U.S. beef comes from cattle fattened on grain (usually corn) for three to six months in feedlots.
• Grass-finished: Grass- or pasture-finished beef comes from cattle that forage on grasses and legumes.
About 90 percent of American beef is sold as large vacuum-packed cuts.
Packers then began selling vacuum-packed beef, the same large cuts sold at warehouse club stores.
• Fat content: The USDA defines "lean beef" as having less than 10 grams (g) of total fat, 4.5g or less of saturated fat, and less than 95 milligrams of cholesterol per 3½-ounce serving (100g) of cooked beef.
In general, the redder the meat, the more iron it contains (beef liver has the most).

• Natural and Organic: Beef labeled "natural" must not contain any artificial ingredients and cannot be more than minimally processed, such as ground beef.
• Buy lean cuts.
Large or family-sized packages cost less per pound than smaller packages.
Advice to buy a side or quarter of beef may seem sensible, but you'll likely have more meat than you can store.
