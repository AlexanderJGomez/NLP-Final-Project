European Union delegates leave during Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's speech Monday.
Ban said he had spoken to the Iranian president and asked him not to focus on "divisiveness" in his address.
Ahmadinejad said Zionism, the Jewish national movement, "personifies racism" and accused Zionists of wielding economic and political resources to silence opponents.
Israel withdrew its ambassador from Switzerland in protest before the conference, which the United States and a number of other countries are boycotting.
A number of European countries had vowed to walk out if Iran's president made offensive remarks.
Ahmadinejad was the first speaker at the conference because he was the only head of state to respond to the invitation, conference spokesman Ramu Damodaran told CNN.
She also criticized the delegates who walked out during his speech, saying his "unsavory remarks" did not "provide justification for anyone to walk out of the conference."
Pillay said Sunday that she regrets -- and is "shocked" by -- the United States' decision to boycott.
