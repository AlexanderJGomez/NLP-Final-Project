Does anyone believe that the real problem with immigration is a lack of attention to the issue?
The real question is: What is Congress doing to fix it?
Although I have sponsored and co-sponsored more than a dozen bills and resolutions on immigration none has ever been given time before the subcommittee.
The entire fiasco only highlights the fact that during a time when Democrats control the House, the Senate and the presidency, the Subcommittee on Immigration has done virtually nothing.
If the Colbert hearing was an attempt to distract voters from recognizing how little has actually been done, the strategy backfired.
They deserve leadership in Congress that will take the issue of immigration seriously instead of turning it into a comedy bit.
