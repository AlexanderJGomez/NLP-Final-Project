Syed Haris Ahmed, charged with providing material support to terrorism in the United States and abroad, used the time to talk about his Muslim faith instead of addressing the evidence against him.
"We worship the same God," Ahmed said.
The judge told Ahmed he would act according to the laws of the United States in deciding the case by considering the evidence.
"The evidence is very, very thin," Martin said.
"He's giving a closing argument," Ahmed said.
Martin said Ahmed moved to a suburban Atlanta neighborhood with his family when he was 12.
