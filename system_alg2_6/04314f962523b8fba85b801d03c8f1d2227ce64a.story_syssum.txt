(CNN) -- Roger Ebert got a final "thumbs up" as family, friends and filmmakers eulogized the movie critic at his funeral in Chicago on Monday.
"It was in Chicago where Roger kept his home, where he kept his heart and where he found his inspiration."
"Roger did not chose cancer.
"His time with us was too short, but what he shared with us endures," Emanuel said.
"We love you Roger, we always will.
Jackson also read a message from Spike Lee: "Roger Ebert was a champion of my work and other black filmmakers at a critical time in American cinema history, Roger was one of the lone defenders of 'Do the Right Thing' when everybody else and their mothers were saying that black folks would run amok and riot during the summer of 1989.
"Roger was pretty much the first with a computer," Barron said.
He taught us a lot and we at the Sun Times were always proud to say we worked where Roger Ebert worked.
