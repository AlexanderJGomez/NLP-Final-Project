"This was the doctor's testimony," said Mana Ostad-Mohammad.
Surgery was not an option, but Ostad-Mohammad's oncologist prescribed the cancer drug Nexavar.
But beginning last year -- soon after Washington and Western powers imposed additional sanctions against Iran to rein in its nuclear program -- Iranian doctors, pharmacists and patients say finding Nexavar and several other drugs that treated deadly diseases became increasingly difficult.
"It was very unexpected," said Mana.
But last March finding Nexavar became virtually impossible, she says.
On July 25, Ostad-Mohammad lost his fight with cancer.
