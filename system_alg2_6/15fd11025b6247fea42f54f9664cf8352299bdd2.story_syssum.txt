Married couples are connecting in any way they can.
Finding time together is key to making a marriage work.
Charly Rok and her husband Jason take a cooking class together, because they share a love of food, as well as cooking.
"I married him, and he married me, because we actually like each other, and we like spending time with each other," Charly says.
"When you go into a kitchen on a Saturday, and you're spending the day cooking, you really tend to let go of a lot of other things," Jason Rok says.
"Once the kids go ... it's going to be you and her," Rufus Triplett says.
"If you don't learn how to communicate then (when the kids live at home), it's going to be challenging when they go."
She says that couples need to realize that they'll be in their relationship for the long haul.
She is now 34 years old, and still married to Michael, 38.
"You can't say that the person you are right now is going to be the same person that you're going to be in five years."
"When we are together, we're really together," she says.
