Boardwine's friend, Joyce Bruce, had used his sperm and a turkey baster to get pregnant.
They tried the turkey baster method a few times.
She and Boardwine tried a few more times, and in July, she learned she was going to have a baby.
She thought he could have "some involvement," the appeals court decision says, but she would be the sole parent.
Bruce argued that she used "noncoital reproductive technology" to get pregnant, and Boardwine was technically a sperm donor.
The appeals court affirmed the lower court's ruling, saying the turkey baster doesn't constitute reproductive technology.
