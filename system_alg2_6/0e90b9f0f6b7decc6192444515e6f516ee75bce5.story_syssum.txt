(CNN) -- Following last week's Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 disaster, the carrier says it will offer full refunds to travelers who wish to cancel their tickets, while those wanting to postpone their flights can do so without penalty.
Shortly after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 went missing in March, the carrier renamed the flight MH318.
"Customers may wish to note that Singapore Airlines flights are not using Ukraine airspace," said the post, which appeared on the airline's Facebook page and Twitter account on July 18.
