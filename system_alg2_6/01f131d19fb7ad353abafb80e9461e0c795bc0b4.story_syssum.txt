"Selma" is a good film that told a great story, at least according to Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences voters.
But it's hard to see that being the reason for its snub: "Gravity" was nominated for 10 Oscars, won seven, and yet you won't find an astronaut who would describe the film as accurate.
But all?
And I will never understand how "Shakespeare in Love" beat "Saving Private Ryan" for best picture.
But I do not need her to win an Oscar to tell me how I should feel about "Selma."
Only that the true story of Selma is much more than calling out racism.
