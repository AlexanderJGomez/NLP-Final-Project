Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Demonstrations that began with quiet determination on the internet more than three weeks ago erupted into riotous jubilation Friday evening, moments after it was announced that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was stepping aside.
"God is great!"
"Hold your head high," Abdallah said they chanted, "you're an Egyptian."
Erian said of the pro-democracy revolution that he said he believes will shape the future of Egypt.
"Life is great now.
I think I will have a much better future now.
"We were all looking for Egypt and thank God we found her today."
Ghonim, who helped set up the initial Facebook page calling for protests, said it was time to celebrate, and said he has confidence that Egypt will not fall into dictatorship again.
"We have achieved what the people wanted," he said.
"It will be the ballot box and the voice of the Egyptian people that will determine the direction of any future governments."
