Gene Seymour says we want to relive Michael Jackson's youth, not the sad and bizarre aspects of his later life.
But acceptance came easier -- and sooner -- than any of us expected last night.
Let us see that transfiguring moment 15 years later at the Motown Anniversary TV special when Jackson seized dominion over the pop firmament with his shattering, moon-walking recital of "Billie Jean."
As surely as he was the King of Pop, Jackson was also a high priest of wish fulfillment.
But it's when that promise expands to shatter boundaries and expand possibilities beyond Top-40 parameters that pop music becomes pop phenomena.
Or why he wanted to both save the world and hide from it with the same ferocious intensity.
We seek those dreams even more urgently now that we know, for certain, that we'll never again see him on stage -- the one place where he was happiest and most assured.
Whatever the days ahead, that will be more than enough for now, forever.
