The corridor between Mogadishu and the town of Afgooye is already home to 400,000 displaced Somalis, some of them living in huts made of twigs and branches.
"We are starting today the distribution of aid for some 50,000 people in Afgooye corridor through our local partners in Somalia," the refugee office said Tuesday.
"I'm glad we were able to be of assistance and rescue these men, women and children.
