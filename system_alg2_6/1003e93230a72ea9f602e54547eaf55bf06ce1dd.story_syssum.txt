It was close to this spot in 1960 that the Jane Goodall, the British primatologist widely regarded as the world's foremost expert on chimpanzees, began her near 55-year study of one specially selected chimp family.
Researchers like Emily come from all over the world to study the chimps at Gombe.
Before the program began, chimpanzees were thought to be herbivores but Goodall saw them hunting monkeys and eating meat.
Despite the behavioral and genetic similarities, however, the chimps proximity to rural human settlements can often be problematic and detrimental to their own well-being.
In the dense forest and woodlands of Gombe, chimpanzees and other species are protected from the most destructive aspects of human behavior.
Through the Gombe-Masito Program, they aim to show villagers that sustainable agricultural techniques can bring both more income and a more vibrant habitat for all species.
That's a sentiment that Jane Goodall herself would be sure to endorse.
