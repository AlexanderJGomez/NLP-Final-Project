The video, uploaded to video sharing site Vimeo, shows two masked men wearing hoodies talking urgently in Russian as they scope out the boarded-up construction site, before slipping in.
Undaunted, the pair then swing out onto a crane and continue clambering skywards.
Makhorov's blog says that the pair waited until the Lunar New Year holidays, when construction teams had left the site.
