But there was one thing more shocking than the double hit-and-run: the seeming apathy by pedestrians, cyclists and drivers—18 of them—who did not stop to help.
The incident has also prompted widespread soul-searching in China about the state of the nation's morality and civic-consciousness.
Still others blame it on what some call "jingshen kongxu", or spiritual vacuum.
Psychologists, Hing tells me, have dubbed this phenomenon the 'bystander problem'—the one factor that would predict Good Samaritan behavior was how many witnesses there were to a tragic event: The more bystanders, the less likely someone will step up to help.
One factor is the district where it occurred, which has a concentration of hardware stores like the one Yueyue's father owns.
Other observers blame the incident on a breakdown in public trust.
Only about 8% surveyed said they still strongly trust other people.
Peking University's Xia Xueluan calls this the "interpersonal trust crisis".
As a netizen puts it, it's not that the good people can no longer be found in our society.
