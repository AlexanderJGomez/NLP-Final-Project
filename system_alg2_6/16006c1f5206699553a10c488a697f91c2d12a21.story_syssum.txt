Yvonne, who didn't give her last name, started by telling me that she had been able to get off Medicaid in the past year.
Let me try to explain: In a state that has chosen not to expand Medicaid, Yvonne is in the staggering position of now making too much money to qualify for Medicaid, and too little to obtain subsidies through the Affordable Care Act.
The tax subsidies available through the health exchanges were intended to make private insurance coverage affordable for those between the poverty line and four times as much -- people who now shoulder the responsibility, by law, of purchasing their own coverage.

In the states that accepted Medicaid expansion, the federal government will pick up 100% of the tab for four years.
The man who oversees the health insurance expansion in Maryland, Dr Joshua Sharfstein, was stunned that so many states turned the money down.
She can't get subsidies, Medicaid or health insurance.
