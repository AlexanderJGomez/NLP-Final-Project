The pop star has been under investigation for alleged involvement in a January 9 egg attack on a neighbor's home -- one that caused an estimated $20,000 in damages -- but you wouldn't know it from his tweets.
For the past week, we've heard little from Bieber that didn't include him hanging out with friends.
We know that Bieber flew down to Miami on a Monday, and the reports of what he's being doing there -- aside from his recent arrest -- include spending $75,000 in a strip club.
Obviously, given the circumstances, we can imagine that the star won't be sharing any Twitter updates for a while.
