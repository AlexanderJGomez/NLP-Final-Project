(CNN) -- Meat is murder?
Meat and livestock farming is also the source of many human diseases, which he claims would be far less common when the product is raised in laboratory conditions.
Conventional meat production is also hard on the environment.
In-vitro meat is made from samples of animals conventionally slaughtered.
"We think that a technology to produce cultured ground meats -- burgers, sausages, nuggets, and so forth -- could be commercialized within ten years," said Matheny.
Both conventional and cultured meat is made of muscle tissue.
"If cultured meat looks, tastes, and costs the same as regular meat, then I think acceptance will be high.
If cultured meat looks, tastes, and costs the same as regular meat, then do we care that it's produced in a steel tank, rather than in an animal farm?
The more we learn about how meat is produced now, the more in-vitro meat looks like a better alternative."
Gillian Madill, Genetics Technologies spokesperson for Friends of the Earth, thinks that clear parameters for in-vitro development need to put in place: "If we can successfully develop these products, what is the defining line between lab-grown meat and natural animals?"
"With India and China doubling their meat consumption every decade, there's no sustainable way to satisfy the growing global appetite for meat without a significant improvement in technology," said Matheny.
