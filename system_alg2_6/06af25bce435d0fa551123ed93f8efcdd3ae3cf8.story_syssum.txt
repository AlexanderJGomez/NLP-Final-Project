Prosecutors said Jordan, who testified that she killed the boy to prevent him from being sexually abused, forced many of the drugs down his throat with a syringe.
Defense lawyer Allan Brenner said the verdict was a victory.
To the extent that the jury has said this was not a mother viciously, violently, coldly doing away with her child, that's a triumph."
The defense said one ex-husband had allegedly threatened to kill her, a crime that would have left Jude with her other former husband -- his biological father -- who she believed had sexually abused the boy.
"I made the decision I was going to end my life and Jude's life," she told the jury, placing her hand over her mouth.
Jordan said the boy was physically and sexually abused not only by his biological father but also by others, including the woman who took Jude to school.
"I gave him the pills."
"I gave him more Xanax, but the Ambien is the one I gave him the most of.
Jordan told the jury she planned on giving the money to charity before taking her life.
