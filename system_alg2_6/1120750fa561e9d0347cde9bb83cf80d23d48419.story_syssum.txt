Atlanta (CNN) -- Locked in a battle with her brothers over their family treasures, the daughter of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. said Thursday she'd once considered lending them but never selling them.
In court papers, the King brothers submitted an e-mail inventory Bernice King wrote in 2007 that divided items from the estate of the civil rights leader into four categories: those she would be willing to sell, including the Spingarn Medal; items she would not be willing to sell, but might consider lending, such as the Nobel Peace Prize and Bible; items that had questions associated with them; and items she would have to examine before deciding.
But he warned Bernice King it was likely that her brothers would be able to show "the Bible and peace prize are possessions of the estate."
Bernice King and Martin Luther King III sued Dexter King in 2008, accusing him of converting "substantial funds from the estate's financial account at Bank of America" for his own use.
They agreed to a settlement, thereby avoiding a trial.
