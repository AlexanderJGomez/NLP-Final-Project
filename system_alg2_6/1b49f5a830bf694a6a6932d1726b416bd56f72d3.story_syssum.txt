London, England (CNN) -- Whether in the form of personal history or political biography, Jung Chang has spent her writerly life telling the story of China's tumultuous recent past.
CNN caught up with Chang, who currently lives in London, and asked her about China and why it's so important to remember the past.
I feel the Chinese don't know about the real man and the world still knows relatively little about him.
CNN: Your books are banned in China.
But my books are published in Hong Kong.
Mao held the country back.
Of course, having said all that, there are still many things that frustrate me.
JC: If there isn't anything dramatic happening, I think the country will probably go on as it is for a very long time.
I guess I miss the whole place, the people who have been through so much and the country, which is so old and yet so young and energetic.
