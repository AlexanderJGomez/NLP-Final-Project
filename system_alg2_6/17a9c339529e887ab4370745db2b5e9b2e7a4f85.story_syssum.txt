Antwan "Big Boi" Patton will be performing live with the Atlanta Ballet beginning Thursday.
On paper, Big Boi and Stallings couldn't be more different.
Big Boi's contemporary style may seem inherently different from the traditional and classical sounds that normally echo through an Atlanta Ballet performance.
Big Boi and a live band will perform some of his greatest hip-hop collaborations.
"Its very moving, sophisticated, elegant but at the same time it will tear your back off," Big Boi said.
For some of the dancers of the Atlanta Ballet, the show is a chance to perform alongside one of their idols and deviate from their rigidly classical performances.
"You [hope] to open up people's minds to different avenues that they might not think they can or cannot take," Big Boi said.
If "big" is successful, the show could tour, Big Boi said.
