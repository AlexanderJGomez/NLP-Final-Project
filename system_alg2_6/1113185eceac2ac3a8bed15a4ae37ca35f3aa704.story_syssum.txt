Despite the Somali terrorist group's calls over the weekend for attacks on malls in the West, including the vast Mall of America in Minnesota, the group isn't much of a threat at all to Americans.
Seven Somali-American men traveled from Minnesota to Somalia to fight for Al-Shabaab in late 2007, including Shirwa Ahmed, who graduated from high school in Minneapolis and then worked at the Minneapolis airport pushing passengers in wheelchairs.
Two years after the terrorist attack in Israel, four British citizens committed suicide in bombings on London's transportation system on July 7, 2005.
Alarmed by Al-Shabaab's campaign of suicide attacks across Somalia and its recruitment of Americans, the State Department designated the group as a foreign terrorist organization in March 2008, making it illegal for a person in the United States to knowingly provide Al-Shabaab with money, communications equipment, weapons or explosives or to join the group.
Ruben Shumpert, an African-American convert to Islam from Seattle, was killed in Somalia in 2008.
More than a dozen Americans have died while fighting for Al- Shabaab, according to a U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security report, while none of the Americans recruited by Al-Shabaab is known to have subsequently planned or conducted a terrorist attack inside the United States, according to a survey of more than 250 jihadist terrorism cases since the 9/11 attacks conducted by New America.
