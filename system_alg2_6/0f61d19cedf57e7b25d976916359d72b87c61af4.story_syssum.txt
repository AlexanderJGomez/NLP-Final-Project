In a two-year mission likely to start in May, New Zealand personnel will  train Iraq security forces at the Taji Military Complex north of Baghdad, Key said.
"ISIL's brutality has only worsened and its outrageous actions have united an international coalition of around 62 countries to fight and degrade the group," he said.
They will not just be behind the wire; they will be exposed to the much wider conflict; it will not be just the soldiers we send to the Iraq, it will be Kiwis traveling around the world," Little said.
Key said the government had carefully considered New Zealand's contribution to the coalition.
"The secondary risk is that New Zealand involvement in the international effort will radicalize people in New Zealand and or Australia.
Jackson warned that the conflict would likely escalate and said that New Zealand had no clear exit strategy.
"It's been clear for some time that the government was intending to make a military contribution," he said.
"For the opposition this is like 'let's not repeat 2003 [the Iraq invasion].'
The United States said it welcomed New Zealand's contribution.
