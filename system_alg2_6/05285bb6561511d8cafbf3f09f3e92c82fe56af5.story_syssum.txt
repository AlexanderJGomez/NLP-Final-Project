(CNN) -- Four Nigerian farmers and the environmental group Friends of the Earth took oil giant Shell to court Thursday in the Netherlands to demand a proper cleanup and compensation for pollution in the Niger Delta.
French said that Shell had cleaned up three leaks at three locations, from 2004 to 2007, which were caused by sabotage.
Under Nigerian law, oil companies are not liable to pay compensation for damage caused by sabotage spills, he said.
A report by the U.N. Environmental Program last year found that pollution from more than 50 years of oil operations in the Ogoniland region, by Shell and other companies, was more far-reaching than thought.
