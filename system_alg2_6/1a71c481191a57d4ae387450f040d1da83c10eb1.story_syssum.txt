Recall papers will be filed in the United States sometime Tuesday.
The worldwide recall involves 437,000 vehicles, including the Toyota Prius and Sai, along with the Lexus HS250h.
Jim Lentz, president of Toyota Motor Sales in the United States, during an online video interview Monday evening, declined to say when -- or if -- Toyota would recall the car.
A spokeswoman for the highway safety agency said Monday that Toyota had not confirmed any recall plans.
Of those, 2.3 million are under recall in the U.S.
In the wake of the recalls, Toyota's share value has dropped about 20 percent.
