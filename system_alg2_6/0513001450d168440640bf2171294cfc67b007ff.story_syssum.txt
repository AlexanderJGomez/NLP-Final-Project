Beijing (CNN) -- Demonstrators braved a heavy police presence and the threat of arrest by massing Thursday in the streets of Kunming, China, to protest the planned construction of a chemical plant, they said.
"Every Kunming person cares about this issue," said another Kunming native, a 50-year-old man who said rows of police thwarted his efforts to reach the heart of the protest.
The provincial general manager of China National Petroleum Corp. has said the refinery will not use the chemical.
A 25-year-old Kunming native who asked to be identified as Claire told CNN that police detained and interrogated her for more than nine hours after she was caught distributing anti-refinery fliers on a city street Tuesday.
"We fear the refinery will destroy the city's natural environment, and we demanded to see the environmental impact assessment report of this project.
"
Pollution and dust generated in China have been found as far away as California.
The government has made explicit its intention to weigh environmental regulation against the cost to the economy.
