Microsoft and Sony, which makes the PlayStation, are working to bolster their Internet-video offerings before new challengers can usurp the home-entertainment market that they've been cultivating for many years with their systems.
"We want you to be able to search and browse in a nonlinear way," Michael Aragon, a vice president for Sony Network Entertainment, said in an interview.
Music Unlimited and Video Unlimited will live under the Sony Entertainment Network umbrella, and they may eventually be joined by the PlayStation Network, Aragon said.
The Sony tablet, which is set to debut early next month, will have a version of Video Unlimited, and the iPhone app will eventually include the ability to watch videos offline, he said.
Microsoft, like Sony, feels the heat and continues to push the Xbox beyond gaming.
Microsoft plans to launch new video-on-demand and live TV services for Xbox in partnership with dozens of media companies, he said.
It's unclear how the new Xbox services will be packaged.
Sony favors a la carte over "the Netflix model," Aragon said, because it can offer new films close to when they are released on Blu-ray.
Microsoft and Sony would like to sell the media, not just the hardware that plays them.
