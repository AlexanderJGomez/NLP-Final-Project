At the time, he had been the rising star of Swiss skiing with four World Cup wins to his name and a solitary world title -- the 2007 Super Combined.
The feeling was great because the slope was in good shape and I was fast in first training and I was skiing easily.
Albrecht is able to laugh as he retells the incident, in part helped by the fact he has no recall of the savage beating he took on the final meters of the Kitzbühel course even after watching it back on a few occasions.
In the early weeks of his recovery from his brain trauma he did not have the strength to even feed himself.
"The first time I was on skis, I thought 'okay, shit, this is a nice feeling, I wanna go back in the World Cup'," he recalls.
He still recalls the feeling of being in the start gate for that first race back: "It was a great feeling.
But if you are a skier, if you are a pro, if you're the downhill, it's not so dangerous because you know what you can do, you know how it works and, for us, Kitzbühel, when you ski it's easy."
You came back, you were in the World Cup again, you did it, you have you're whole life in front of you'."
