From within what he called the "Academy of Sciences and Space Technology," Nkoloso said, he'd been studying Mars through telescopes.
"The first one on the list was the Zambia space program," says De Middel who, after a decade of working as a news photojournalist, had decided to embark on a new career as a visual storyteller.
In the self-published book, De Middel self-consciously conjures up the story of the unofficial space program piece by piece.
"You don't have to be American and work for NASA to dream of going to the moon; you can be an African -- he [Nkoloso] was a school teacher and thought that could be done."
Creating The Afronauts, which was sold out in just a few months, De Middel worked more as a movie director, trying to make the best of the resources around her.
De Middel, who's never been to Zambia, acknowledges she's not "an expert in Africa" -- nor in space.
If anything, De Middel says, the extraordinary tale of the forgotten Zambian space program presented a chance to talk about Africa from a different perspective.
That is a universal feeling and it doesn't belong to the people who can actually have the technology to go to the moon; it's everywhere."
