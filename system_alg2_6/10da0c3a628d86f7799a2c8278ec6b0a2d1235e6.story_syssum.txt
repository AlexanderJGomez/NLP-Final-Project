None of the young conservative activists had a nice word to say about Nixon and many were quite hostile.
To them, he was the archetypal Republican in Name Only -- a liberal in conservative clothing.
In domestic policy, Nixon bowed to the liberal consensus of his era.
The Philadelphia Plan was opposed by many Democrats, not just by Southern conservatives but also by labor leaders who saw it as a challenge to seniority programs.
But Nixon won re-election in 1972 partly on a reputation as a peacemaker with whom the Democrats could not compete.
Had Watergate not reduced his political capital so early in 1973, there's a chance Nixon would have pushed ahead with his agenda of a New Federalism and undone much of the liberalism of his first term.
Aside from Watergate, that's why he's so unpopular with the contemporary conservative movement.
Today, it's difficult to talk about Nixon as a model for contemporary Republicans because his political reputation is so tarnished.
Considering that record, moderate Republicans in pursuit of the White House have every cause to get misty-eyed when they hear the name Richard Nixon.
