says Huntsman.
His family "has put about $400 million into the cancer center, and we've raised about a billion dollars for cancer research (overall)," he says.
Huntsman's riches grew out of a small plastics company he founded in the early 1970s.
"It was just something that in my heart I've always believed, that if you are generous and help others, you'll be blessed in your own life.
Huntsman himself has also battled cancer, and has survived prostate cancer, mouth cancer and two types of skin cancer.
