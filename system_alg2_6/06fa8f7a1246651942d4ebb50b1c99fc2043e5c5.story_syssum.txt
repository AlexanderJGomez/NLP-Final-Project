The Clintons left the White House more than a dozen years ago "dead broke" and in debt, according to Hillary Clinton, who defended the hefty speaking fees she commands since stepping down as secretary of state last year.
Bill Clinton made more than $9.2 million in speaking fees in 2001 and more than $9.5 million in 2002.
A CNN analysis of the family's financial records in early 2013 showed that Bill Clinton had earned $106 million from paid speeches since leaving the presidency behind.
On its website, America Rising said the two homes the Clintons purchased after leaving the White House in Chappaqua, New York, and Washington cost around $4.5 million combined.
"Well, I certainly would give anything on earth if this had not happened," Clinton said.
