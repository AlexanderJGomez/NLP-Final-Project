Kathmandu, Nepal (CNN) -- A ferocious leopard may have killed 15 people in Nepal in a 15-month span, its latest victim a 4-year-old boy that the creature dragged away into the jungle to eat.
"It could be the same leopard," he said.
After killing its victim, the leopard takes the body away into the forest to eat.
The chief district administrator has granted permission for this particular leopard to be killed.
While cases of leopards killing domestic animals are common, and there are sometimes instances of leopards killing people in Nepal, this case is "extreme," Dhakal said.
