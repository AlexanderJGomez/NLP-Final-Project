In any case, the couple's allusions to their reunion --a Twitter picture showed her embracing a man who appears to be Brown; another showed a man presumed to be Brown face down and shirtless on a bed -- culminated with Brown posting a photo of himself and Rihanna, who appears to be in her underwear.
Normally I don't like to get too involved in grown folks' private business.
The way she is flaunting their relationship now, I don't anticipate the same amount of sympathy for her if another incident occurs.
She likely knew she would hear a lot of criticism and I guess she wanted us to know she doesn't need our sympathy.
Since completing a 52-week domestic violence program, Brown has shown about as much control over his temper as Bruce Banner.
Oh, I can hear Brown fans now -- leave him alone.
And if there's a repeat of 2009, a lot of us won't be interested enough to care.
Hopefully that incident was a one-time thing and she'll be alright.
