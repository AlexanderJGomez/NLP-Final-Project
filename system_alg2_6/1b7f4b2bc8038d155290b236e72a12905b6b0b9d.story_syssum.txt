Some members of Congress complained that Colbert's testimony before the House Immigration Subcommittee was undignified; others took issue with his invocation of Christian values.
But migrant workers suffer, and have no rights."
Why?
Undocumented farmworkers are poorly paid, enjoy few rights and live in fear of deportation.
(Undocumented immigrants, of course, pay sales taxes, and many pay Social Security and income taxes, though they are ineligible for most public benefits.)
They include securing our borders, fixing our broken legal immigration system and providing an equitable pathway to earned legal status for the currently undocumented.
Politicians may resent Colbert's jokes, but they can scarcely blame the comedian if their constituents are exasperated by congressional inaction on this and other critical issues, despite the many promises on the campaign trail.
