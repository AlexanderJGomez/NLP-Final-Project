But Gen. Rookmangud Katawal has refused to accept his dismissal, and Nepalese President Ram Baran Yadav -- the constitutional commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces -- has told Katawal to remain in office, a presidential spokesman said.
Despite sporadic clashes between the two factions, there were no serious injuries reported.
Pokharel said his party urged the Maoists not to fire Katawal without a consensus in the country's parliament.
The Cabinet named an interim army chief, but presidential spokesman Rajendra Dahal told CNN that 18 parties in Nepal's parliament asked Yadav to keep Katawal on the job.
