(CNN) -- Many people fail to have great careers because they make excuses to avoid taking action.
Nevertheless, many people struggle to find their passions.
In the absence of the lucky circumstance of their family, the search would have been longer and more challenging.
Many people fail to find their passion because they either fail to search methodically or search persistently.
Some do both.
They find their passion by immersing themselves in human experience.
What if?
You will have to stand against the popular culture to find your passion.
One moment you are reading in hopes of finding a topic of great interest; then you find that you are reading and do not want to stop.
Some people find their passion, and then relying on no more than popular opinion, they dismiss the passion as one that "cannot be turned into a livelihood."
Remember that passion is necessary for a great career, but it is not sufficient.
