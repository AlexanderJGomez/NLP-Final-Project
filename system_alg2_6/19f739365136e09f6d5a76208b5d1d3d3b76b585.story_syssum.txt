But with one phone call and a glimpse at a man who made him think twice, the opportunity to work with Novak Djokovic was a challenge he could not resist.
Becker began his partnership with Djokovic in December 2013 and was courtside when the Serb star claimed his seventh grand slam title at Wimbledon in July -- one more than his coach managed during a 15-year career.
Whenever he makes a mistake I feel that I make it too," Becker says.
While Becker received a couple of phone calls from players curious as to whether he would be willing to take up a coaching role, it was only once Djokovic got in touch that he began to consider moving back onto the circuit.
"But Novak called me and I told him I felt honored.
Instead, Becker believes the defeat to Wawrinka allowed them time to assess which way they needed to go, and allowed him to begin to influence the Serbian's game -- especially the mental side.
"Maybe that was something he was looking for.
Djokovic will start his 2014 U.S. Open campaign next week hoping to secure a second victory at Flushing Meadows to his growing list of triumphs, having lost in the last two finals there.
"Novak is a great student given he's someone who has won so much already," says Becker.
"It changed me for the better," says Becker, who has children by both his first and second wives.
He loves his wife and family more than anything in the world, and having that addition to his family will make him a better man."
