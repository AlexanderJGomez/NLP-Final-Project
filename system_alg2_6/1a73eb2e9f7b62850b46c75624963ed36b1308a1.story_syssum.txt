(CNN) -- The December death of a 27-year-old woman at the Missouri home of beer tycoon August Busch IV was ruled an accident, a medical examiner said Wednesday.
The call ended after the operator told Jung an ambulance had been sent to the property.
Martin had no apparent signs of trauma or other indications of cause of death, police said.
Busch, 46, became chief executive officer of Anheuser-Busch in December 2006, after years of working in the company's brewing, operations and marking divisions.
August Busch IV is the only representative of the family -- and its former namesake company -- on the Anheuser-Busch InBev board of directors.
