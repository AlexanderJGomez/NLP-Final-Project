MIT researcher Pablo Valdivia Alvarado works in his lab on a robotic fish he co-created.
MIT researchers built their first robotic fish, "Robotuna," in 1994.
"Most of the brains, the electronics, are embedded inside," said Alvarado, who designed the robofish with fellow MIT engineer Kamal Youcef-Toumi.
