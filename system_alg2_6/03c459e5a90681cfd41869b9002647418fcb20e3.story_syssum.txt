Then she failed to show for work this month, and her car was found abandoned in a ditch off a highway in neighboring Indiana.
Patrick, 33, moved to Kalamazoo just six months ago from California, where she earned a medical degree and another doctorate, her family told CNN affiliate WXMI.
"(The dogs) indicated that whoever was in that vehicle ... tracked back to that roadway" roughly 30 feet from the car, Strong said.
Patrick's disappearance shocked not only her friends and family, but also CNN's audience.
Patrick's parents told WXMI that she had just bought a plane ticket so that she could visit them in Florida at the end of the month.
