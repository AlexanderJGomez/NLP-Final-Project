"In this case, my office examined newly discovered scientific evidence that was not available at the time of the trial," Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth P. Thompson said in statement to CNN.
"Based on this new evidence, I believe a jury would have been more likely to return a different verdict," Thompson said.
Wilson was offered a deal by the district attorney's office for a nine-years-to-life sentence, but his case was disputed after he wrote Yarbough's family in 2005 saying that he had lied at the trial.
Thompson came into office in January with promises to restore justice to the wrongfully convicted.
At this time, after years behind bars, Yarbough is happy to move on.
"It was hard to keep my hopes up, but God is good now, I'm out now, I'm free, thank God," Yarbough said.
