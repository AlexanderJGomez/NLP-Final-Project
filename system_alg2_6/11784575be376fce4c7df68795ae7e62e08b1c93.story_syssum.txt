"I've been to many, many sporting events across the world," says Sean Foley, vice president of sport and media at the Raptor Group -- which is headed up by Roma's American owner James Pallotta.
In partnership with Google, Roma is attempting to transport the match-day experience across the globe, using the latest technology and the power of social media to attract new fans from every corner of the world.
"We know we're not going to win over many more fans in Italy," says Foley.
The Raptor Group's involvements in sport, technology and social media, as Foley explains, means Roma is uniquely positioned to exploit new technologies.
"When people tell you there are 3.5 billion football fans in the world, as a way to engage people on our platforms, it's certainly something for us to look at," says Max Goldstein, sports partnerships manager for Google.
"If you look across all social media platforms, there's a huge amount of interest in football," says Goldstein.
Tomkins has been involved with football and Liverpool as a fan, season ticket holder, journalist and author and has seen social media change how rival supporters interact with each other.
"You see a lot of fans tweeting about their rival's demise and the whole schadenfreude thing.
Tomkins also doubts whether increasing a club's social media popularity necessarily translate into creating true football fans.
"I just don't know how much of the true club can come across on social media," he says.
Google and Roma will be hoping that the football fans of tomorrow disagree.
