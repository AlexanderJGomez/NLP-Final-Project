It is still unclear what exactly happened when Sainz, from the Mexican network TV Azteca, entered the Jets locker room last Saturday after practice but Sainz told CNN's Rick Sanchez on Monday that from the moment she entered, she felt all eyes were on her.
"If Jets players, coaches and staff allegedly involved in the incident are found to have acted in unprofessional and harassing behavior toward Ms. Sainz, we expect and demand reprimand and punishment by the NFL and Jets," the association said in a statement.
Sainz told CNN that she accepted the apology from Johnson and that she also made a statement to the NFL about the incident.
