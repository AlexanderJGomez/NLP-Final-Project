SB 1070 will be subject to multiple legal challenges, and the state will devote precious resources to defend a law that has so many serious constitutional flaws that it will likely never be implemented.
Moreover, even though Proposition 187 was never implemented, California suffered other repercussions besides the waste of limited state financial resources.
Coincidentally, Arizona's SB 1070 suffers from many of the same constitutional flaws as California's Proposition 187.
Sen. Russell Pearce and others who support the bill are now arguing it does nothing but reiterate existing federal law and that the law is legitimate because police officers always had "inherent authority" to enforce federal immigration law.
Nonetheless, Arizona will experience extreme and dire consequences, just as California experienced a decade-and-a-half ago.
