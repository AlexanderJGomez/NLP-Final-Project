That amount, officials believe, will help contribute to aid for an estimated 4 million people inside Syria who urgently need help.
The aid announcement comes on the same day that one of the United Nations' outreach groups told reporters that about 100,000 Palestinians have fled a large refugee camp in the Syrian capital of Damascus due to government airstrikes and fighting there.
"The camp was supposed to be a safe haven," he said.
"The Yarmouk camp was safe business as usual until the last few weeks, when the FSA started shelling the camp from outside," said Hussam Arafat, of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine General Command.
Interior Minister Mohammed Shaar was admitted to the American University Hospital in Beirut on Wednesday for treatment for injuries sustained when his ministry building was bombed last week, the official Lebanese news agency NNA reported Wednesday.
