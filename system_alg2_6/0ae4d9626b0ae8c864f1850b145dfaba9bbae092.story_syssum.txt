I thought 'this is it - I'm not coming out of here,'" said earthquake survivor Anne Vos.
There wasn't any time to think, but I am lucky I didn't go to the stairs.
I don't know what might have happened.
Some time after those initial calls, Vos says she passed out.
The whole time I was thinking about my family and my friends and I just wanted to make it out.
She said the feeling of relief was hard to describe, especially when she saw the state of the building.
I was just trapped under my desk, you know.
I feel a bit like I have nothing keeping me here.
I think I would be too afraid to go into a tall building for a while," she said.
