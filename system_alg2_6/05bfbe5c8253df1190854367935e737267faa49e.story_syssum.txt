(CNN) -- In an unprecedented action, the NCAA is restoring scholarships to the Penn State University football team that were originally lost last year when the school was sanctioned for its handling of the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal.
Mitchell said Tuesday that the school has consistently cooperated with the NCAA since the sanctions were imposed.
NCAA President Mark Emmert, who has been widely criticized for relying on the university's independent report instead of launching his own NCAA investigation at Penn State, said the board was "pleased" to make this decision.
In an internal investigation done for the university, FBI director Louis Freeh concluded that Paterno played a role, but former state prosecutors handling the case said they found no evidence of that.
