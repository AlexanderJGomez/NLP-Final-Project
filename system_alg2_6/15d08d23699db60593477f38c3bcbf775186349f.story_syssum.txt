More than 7 in 10 Americans think Obama should ask Congress for the ability to strike ISIS militarily.
While the CNN poll indicates Americans think ISIS has the ability to attack the United States, Obama said in the NBC interview there has been no "immediate intelligence" that signifies the terrorist group is a threat.
The CNN/ORC Polls shows that 45% of Americans see that ISIS is a "very serious threat to the U.S," while 49% thought the same of al Qaeda 11 years ago.
In September 2010, only 3% of Americans named terrorism as the most important problem facing the country.
