(CNN) -- More than 40 years after pingpong diplomacy led to a thaw in Sino-American relations, it was on display again -- in rudimentary form -- as Michelle Obama visited a Beijing high school during her family's first full day of a visit to China.
"Don't be nervous," Obama said.
"OK, we're going to get this," Obama said.
Armed with a paddle, she volleyed for about five minutes -- first with the instructor, then with a young woman, as students looked on.
As the members of the first family departed the school, 33 American exchange students -- one of them from Sidwell Friends, the Washington school attended by Malia -- lined up in front of the red carpet and across from their Chinese counterparts to shake hands with the family before they left for their next stop, the Forbidden City.
"We don't expect the people of China to agree with all of our policy positions at any given moment, but the more they understand the United States -- the more they understand the President and the first lady and their values and their priorities -- we think the better it is for both of our countries," Rhodes added.
China is the fifth most popular country for U.S. students studying abroad, and more students from China study in the United States than from any other country.
