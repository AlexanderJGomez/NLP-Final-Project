In a new attack on Google, Microsoft's Bing search engine accuses its rival's Google Shopping tool of being dishonest by only including paying vendors, ranking listings by how much they pay, and not clearly marking the results as sponsored.
To appear in Google Shopping results, merchants must now pay for Google's Product Listing Ads.
Bing has actually shut down its free sign-up for the holiday season, and any new vendors interested in being listed are directed to Shopping.com, where they will have to pay to be included in search results.
On the main Google Shopping page, a disclaimer that Google is "compensated by some" vendors is buried at the bottom of the page.
Search results are formatted to look like a typical Google results page, and you must click on a link that says "Why these products?"
Bing Shopping still includes Amazon results, but Amazon has positioned itself as an entry point for online shoppers in direct competition with Google and Bing.
Google Shopping currently has around 100,000 vendors and over a billion products in its listings.
Luckily, with access to browsers that support multiple tabs and basic math skills, shoppers can easily comparison shop their comparison shopping tools.
