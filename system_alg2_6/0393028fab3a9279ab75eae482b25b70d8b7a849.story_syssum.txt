Washington (CNN) -- Rep. Charlie Rangel temporarily stepped down as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday, a decision forced by a growing storm of ethics controversies threatening the longtime congressman.
That fact had not been divulged to the ethics committee when Rangel asked for and received approval to attend the trips, according to the committee's report.
House Republicans plan to introduce a resolution Wednesday calling on Rangel to permanently step down and again force House Democrats to go on record defending him.
Rangel is a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, which has 42 members in the House.
