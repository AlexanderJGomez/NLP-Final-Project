This ain't that.
But not so fast -- before we go inside, Boeing has laid down some rules: no photos, no video, for our eyes only.
Suddenly, we're surrounded by partly assembled airliners in a room so big it takes on the feeling of an entire world.
Boeing paints the tails before they're attached to the planes.
The "Wing Build" area -- where workers attach wings to the planes -- is the loudest part of the entire facility.
I can't even go in there!"
In fact, Boeing says it's so big you could fit the body of a 737 airliner inside it.
Just a few hours earlier, a handful of aviation geeks were hanging out at a hotel next to Paine Field, the airport Boeing uses to test and deliver the factory's planes.
In the entire world, there are only four of these giant planes.
Boeing uses them to ferry big sections of the 787 for final assembly here in Everett.
Aviation news sites like Airchive, AirlineReporter, NYCAviation and AirlineGuys all share common friends, connections and interests.
This one is the birthplace of what Guinness calls the "most produced large commercial jet in aviation history" -- the 737.
This is a tour for avgeeks and VIPs.

—The planes also get "winglets" — the tiny, upward pointing wings you see on the wingtips of 737s and other airliners.
Driving off the property, we spot a train loaded with brand new wingless 737 fuselages headed to the factory behind us.
