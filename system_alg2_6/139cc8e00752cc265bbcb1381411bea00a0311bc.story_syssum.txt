Nance, a third-year student at the Art Institute of Dallas, was found stabbed to death Saturday in her apartment.
"She was a very talented animation student," Stockton said.
Dallas police said officers were asked to investigate after Nance had not been seen for several days.
Reyes said officers are in the process of interviewing people.
"It's just a tragedy."
