Erick Munoz,  husband of Marlise Munoz, broke down in tears after Judge R.H. Wallace told John Peter Smith Hospital  to act on his order by 5 p.m. Monday.
The hospital could appeal or decide to remove Marlise Munoz from a ventilator and respirator before that deadline.
Once there, Erick Munoz said, he was told his wife "was for all purposes brain dead."
After the Friday hearing, another family lawyer, Jessica King, said, "Pregnant women die every day.
The hospital and the Tarrant County District Attorney's Office, which defended the medical facility, did not offer the same level of detail as members of the Munoz family.
