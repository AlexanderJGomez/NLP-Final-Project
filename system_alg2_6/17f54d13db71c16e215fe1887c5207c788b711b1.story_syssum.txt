(CNN) -- A roller coaster at Six Flags Fiesta Texas in San Antonio has been temporarily closed as a precautionary measure after a woman died last week on a similar ride at Six Flags over Texas in Arlington.
At its highest point, the Texas Giant is 153 feet and has a drop of 147 feet, according to the theme park.
Segovia also told CNN that Esparza was sitting by herself, contrary to initial reports she was sitting beside her son.
