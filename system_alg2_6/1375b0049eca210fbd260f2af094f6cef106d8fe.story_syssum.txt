"It was a time when China had very few friends, so we decided to step in and help with what we could put together; funding and expertise," says Wong, founder of the China Exploration & Research Society.
In 1985, when Wong led an expedition to find the source of the Yangtze River, he says he and his team traveled for nine days on horseback.
Now we could probably drive all the way to the source," says Wong, who began leading expeditions for National Geographic before setting up CERS.
Today Wong has to look harder to find truly out of the way places he deems worthy of exploration.
The often complex cultural and historical backgrounds of frontiers can make them especially interesting, but timing is everything when it comes to the exploring border regions.
During a visit two years ago to China's border with Vietnam, Wong said political unrest made exploration problematic.
"You can drive almost to the source of the Amur River, the 10th longest river in the world, and see the border troops talking to each other, people ice fishing and crossing the river even through they're not supposed to," says Wong.
He recently set off on a month-long expedition to western Tibet -- a trip made easier by a new road, but complicated by red tape.
