What's at stake is I-522, the initiative that would mandate labeling food that is genetically modified.
Maine and Connecticut have passed mandatory GMO labeling laws.
In Washington, supporters of labeling have raised money from more than 13,000 contributors, with the median donation of $25 a pop.
Residents of Washington have a big opportunity to vote yes on I-522 and turn the tide on labeling laws.
The use of GMO ingredients in food is similar to the issue of money in politics.
