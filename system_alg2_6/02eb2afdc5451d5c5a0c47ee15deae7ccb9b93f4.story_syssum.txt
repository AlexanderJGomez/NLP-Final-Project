(CNN) -- Four human rights organizations are urging authorities in the United Arab Emirates to drop charges against five pro-democracy activists.
The best-known of the five activists on trial is Ahmed Mansour Ali Abdullah Al Abd Al Shehi, more commonly known as Ahmed Mansour.
All were arrested on the heels of a recent decision by the UAE's government to dissolve the elected board of directors of the Jurist Association, a prominent civil rights organization in that country, and replace it with state appointees, according to Human Rights Watch.
Long-standing regimes in Tunisia and Egypt were toppled earlier this year, and Damascus has launched a violent crackdown against protesters in Syria.
Migrant workers comprise the bulk of the population in the country.
