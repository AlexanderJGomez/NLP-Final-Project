The calls for his resignation came after months of CNN exclusive reporting on U.S. veterans who have died while waiting for care at VA hospitals across the country, including in Phoenix.
Many of the veterans, the doctor and other VA sources told CNN, were placed on a secret list created by VA managers to hide the wait times of veterans seeking medical care.
On Monday, Dillinger of the American Legion said that growing concerns about the problems at numerous VA facilities are what led him to call for the resignation of Shinseki and two other top VA officials: Under Secretary of Health Robert Petzel and Under Secretary of Benefits Allison Hickey.
The director of health care at the U.S. Government Accountability Office, Congress' watchdog organization, told CNN on Monday that even the VA does not truly know how many American veterans are waiting for care across the country.
"The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) takes any allegations about patient care or employee misconduct very seriously.
Late Monday, another veterans group joined the American Legion in the call for Shinseki to resign.
We applaud their demands for accountability at the very top of the Department of Veterans Affairs."
