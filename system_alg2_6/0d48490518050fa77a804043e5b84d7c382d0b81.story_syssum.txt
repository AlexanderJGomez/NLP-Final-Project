The state-run Middle East News Agency, citing medical sources, said he was declared clinically dead shortly after arriving late Tuesday at a military hospital in Cairo, where he had been taken after suffering a stroke and cardiac arrest earlier in the day.
He is not dead as reported."
He was taken from Tora prison hospital to Maadi military hospital, El Deeb told CNN.
The prosecutor and the military council denied Mubarak had been moved.
"Clinically dead is not a phrase that is commonly used, but when it is used, what it usually means is that someone is brain dead," said CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen.
Final results have not been announced.
"If he's really dead, its God's will," said Nasser Shaaban, another demonstrator.
Across the street perhaps a half-dozen journalists sat on the curb smoking cigarettes.
