Pick a color that has life and personality," Thom Filicia says.
Filicia: Make sure that your furniture layout works.
Make sure that the things you love to look at, you're seeing.
You always want to have a Lutron dimmer you plug into the wall.
Those things start to add layers to the room and make it a little more acoustical.
Also, I think that color definitely adds a lot of warmth to spaces.
Filicia: The first thing you want to really focus on is a great sofa, because it is really the anchor for the room.
Filicia: It's very easy to use eco-friendly cleaning supplies, environmentally friendly lighting throughout your house using low wattage or eco-friendly bulbs.
