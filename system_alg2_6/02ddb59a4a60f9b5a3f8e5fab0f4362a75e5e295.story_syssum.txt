(CNN) -- An eastern Pennsylvania police chief who went on profanity-laced video rants against those who disagreed with him on gun laws has been suspended for 30 days without pay.
Kessler posted his videos to YouTube in mid-July.
Kessler did not respond to repeated requests by CNN for comment, but he told WFMZ at the time that he was not in uniform in the videos and was exercising in his First and Second Amendment rights.
On the CSF Web page, Kessler is identified as the group's president and is featured in his Gilberton police uniform.
