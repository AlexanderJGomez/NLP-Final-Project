When Brown told the Des Moines Register over the weekend that he was heading to the Iowa State Fair "to determine whether there's an interest in my brand of leadership and Republicanism," the news was met with some amusement by political insiders.
asked Will Ritter, a Boston-based GOP operative and former Mitt Romney adviser.
Brown knows exactly what he's doing.
Just look at this month's Family Leadership Summit, a gathering of social conservatives in Iowa that drew potential 2016 presidential contenders Ted Cruz and Rick Santorum to the first-in-the-nation caucus state.
"The focus on the 2016 presidential contest is completely ridiculous, and everybody knows it," wrote David Weigel of Slate after witnessing the cattle call.
Still, there's a difference between running for president and "running" for president, even though it's sometimes difficult to tell the difference.
Before his Iowa trip, Brown met privately with Christie at the Republican National Committee's summer conference in Boston, a meeting first reported by the New York Times.
But what if Brown takes off?
"The fact that he is in Iowa doesn't surprise me," the Republican told CNN.
I could definitely anticipate this."
