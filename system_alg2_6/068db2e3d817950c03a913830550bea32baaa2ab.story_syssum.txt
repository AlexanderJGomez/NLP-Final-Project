Only one of those five states, Virginia, has a contested U.S. Senate race this year.
Sure, vulnerable Southern Democrats -- like Sen. Mary Landrieu in Louisiana and Kay Hagan in North Carolina -- may be wary of letting social issues become a prominent force in the midterms, as they tend to galvanize conservative bases.
"As a general rule, it won't have an effect on these midterms because I think the issue is fading," said Quentin Kidd, director of the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University in Virginia.
I think the states should.
With half of Virginia voters supporting same-sex marriage, according to a Quinnipiac poll earlier this year, a Republican candidate running for a statewide seat would almost need to take a measured approach on the issue.
In Colorado, Republican Cory Gardner -- who's angling to oust Democratic Sen. Mark Udall -- has yet to comment on the Supreme Court decision.
Over in North Carolina, where Republican Thom Tillis is working to unseat Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan in the most expensive race this year, neither candidate has commented on the decision.
