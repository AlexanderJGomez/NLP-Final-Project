In another of the group's songs entitled "Nefsy Afagar" ("I Want To Explode") Eid sings: "A new order, just like the old one.
"We have many fans that will get very angry if we didn't release these songs," says Eid, who claims the band speaks the mind of many Egyptians.
Sitting at the makeshift studio within Eid's family apartment in which the band recorded most of their songs for the past 10 years, they insist they are not political.
We didn't sing about politics, but we sing about basic human rights," says Eid.
The band is honest about the potential violent consequence of taking a stand against deep-seated views, but they choose to remain optimistic.
