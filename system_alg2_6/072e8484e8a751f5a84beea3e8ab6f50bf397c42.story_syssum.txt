(CNN) -- It seems like the opposite of what you'd expect, but my cancer diagnosis -- a staggering Stage IV colon cancer diagnosis, delivered to me at the age of 28 -- gave me a new lease on life.
And it has.
Just months after my diagnosis, I made the jump to strict veganism.
Becoming sick was the way I learned how to be well.
That's because they are.
A simple but revolutionary initiative that sees every penny donated going to cutting-edge research that I hope will get us to the cure for colon cancer in under 10 years.
The cure.
Is money the only thing standing in the way of the cure?
It sounds like an impossible goal -- to find the cure for cancer -- but it is possible.
And through The Wunder Project, I know it will be.
