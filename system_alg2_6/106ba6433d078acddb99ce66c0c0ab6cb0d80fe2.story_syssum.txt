" Simon said with a laugh on Marc Maron's WTF podcast that first ran in May 2013.
"Sam brought a level of honesty to the characters," Levine said.
'What are they thinking?'
If I could make Sam laugh, I was excited."
He was in his mid-30s.
"The sort of lifetime achievement stuff that I'm getting now is kind of like Tom Sawyer's funeral because they all know I'm sick," Simon told THR's Gary Baum.
Simon, who won eight of his Emmys for writing/producing "The Simpsons" (many after he left) and one for producing "The Tracey Ullman Show," was married to and divorced from actress Jennifer Tilly (1984 to 1991) and Playboy Playmate Jami Ferrell (for mere weeks in 2000).
An avid poker player, Simon re-created his home game in a penthouse at the Palms Hotel in Las Vegas for a Playboy TV show in 2009.
