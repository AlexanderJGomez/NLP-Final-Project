(CNN) -- Liz Lee is not your typical MTV reality show star.
The fact that a show like that is on now is amazing and great," said Fogelnest, who hosted his own show on MTV as a teenager (from his bedroom, no less), "Squirt TV," in the mid-1990s.
MTV also told the Los Angeles Times last year that neither the terms "reality show" nor "sitcom" fully captured the show.
Benjamin Nugent, author of "American Nerd," noted, "When you have people choosing to be nerds, questions of authenticity can come up.
"Liz" something of a sister show to "The Paper."
Characters like Daria show you that you don't have to."
"He was completely real," said Curry.
'Hey, it's OK to be a nerd, you can be famous.
MTV recently announced that "Beavis and Butt-Head" are returning to the network in some form: Can "Daria" be far behind?
"I can actually have conversations with significantly more people about 'Green Lantern' and people will actually know what I'm talking about," he said.
"(MTV was) able to take fan culture and market a show specifically to it," said Nugent.
