Juror B29 got it right when she said the six Florida jurors had to follow the law, rather than their hearts, Mark O'Mara said in a statement Friday.
O'Mara said that the defense acknowledged Zimmerman killed Martin -- in self-defense.
"Based on her comments, Juror B29 accepted a tremendous burden, set her feelings aside, and cast a verdict based the evidence presented in court and on the law she was provided."
Zimmerman has been out of the public eye since the jury found him not guilty of second-degree murder on July 13.
