(CNN) -- The University of Kansas men's basketball team squeaked by Ohio State late Saturday night, setting up a NCAA tournament championship showdown with top-seeded Kentucky.
Louisville entered the NCAAs with momentum after winning the Big East post-season tournament.
Ohio State and Kansas entered the night's second tilt as No.
The rest of the game was nip-and-tuck, with rarely more than a few points separating the two teams and several lead changes in the final minutes.
