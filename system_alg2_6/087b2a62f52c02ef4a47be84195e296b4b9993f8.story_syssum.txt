Now aged 23, the former Sao Paulo star has been offered a shot at redemption.
Having served 13 months of his sentence, Breno is being allowed to leave prison on day release and has been given the chance to rejoin Bayern as part of the coaching staff at the club's youth academy.
The opportunity Breno has been given at Bayern, and the fitness work he has been doing in prison, could see the former Brazil under-23 player given an unexpected chance to resurrect his career.
Hoeness assured Breno he will receive Bayern's full backing, despite no long being under contract at the club.
