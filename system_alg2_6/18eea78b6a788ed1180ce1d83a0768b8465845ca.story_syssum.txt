Rome (CNN) -- Italian President Giorgio Napolitano said Wednesday that his country will adopt a series of austerity measures promised to the European Union, as officials try to allay investor fears and head off a eurozone debt crisis.
The move, analysts say, could suggest that Italy may need more than a change in leadership to address investor concerns.
"The global economy has entered a dangerous and uncertain phase," Christine Lagarde said in remarks prepared for delivery at the International Finance Forum in Beijing.
Berlusconi later said he would resign, and on Wednesday his spokesman, Paolo Bonaiuti, said Berlusconi would not run in the country's next parliamentary elections.
"I cannot remember a time when events in Europe moved so swiftly.
Italy is the world's eighth-largest economy.
"Italy's debt level is sustainable, but it needs to implement policies that will support economic growth."
Now it is time for Alfano.
Names being floated include political figures such as Gianni Letta, Berlusconi's chief of staff, and Mario Monti, a former commissioner with the European Union.
Other business figures such as Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, chairman of Ferrari, and Alessandro Profumo, former CEO of Italy's largest bank, UniCredit, are also considered candidates.
