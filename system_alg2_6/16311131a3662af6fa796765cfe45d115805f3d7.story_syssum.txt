NEW YORK (CNN) -- Fans of Michael Jackson lined the streets outside Harlem's Apollo Theater on Tuesday for a chance to pay their respects to the late "King of Pop" at the hall that helped launch his career.
Fans have been gathering outside the theater since last week to remember Jackson, who at age 9 won a 1967 Apollo amateur night showcase with his brothers in the group the Jackson 5.
"Michael wasn't no freak," Sharpton said.
He was extraordinary.
"You've got to come from the stage of the Apollo and go all over the world to understand Michael," Sharpton said.
