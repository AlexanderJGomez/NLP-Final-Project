"It wasn't mom," Kondvar said.
Other than a pacemaker and a right hip replacement, Kondvar said, her mother was in good health and very active.
Kondvar said her family was told their mother's body had been taken to Emerald Funeral Home in St. Maarten, where the funeral director denied their request to see their mother and demanded a $7,000 wire-transfer-only fee to send the body back to the United States.
Now, Kondvar and her family want answers, and they want their mother back, she said.
According to Kondvar, Emerald Funeral Home in St. Maarten was supposed to notify the U.S. consulate of Porkka's death so the office could arrange for the body to be accompanied back to America.
Unruh said Reed has expedited a DNA test to determine whether the body that was sent to Canada is in fact Kondvar's mother.
The body that was flown to Canada has since been cremated," the government website said.
Kondvar told CNN the St. Maarten government is performing an internal investigation into what went wrong.
Kondvar, a resident of Warwick, said she's not sure whether she will ever return to St. Maarten, although she has fond memories of the island and the residents from her family vacations.
