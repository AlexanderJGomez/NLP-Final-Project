The official government list of victims from this week's earthquake in central Italy reached 287 on Friday, as Italians held a mass state funeral to lay the victims to rest.

Bertone said the funeral was a "precious moment" to understand the meaning of life and death.

"My son died here," she said.
"There is no way I'm leaving this town -- not ever."
