The lawsuit "may be the first civil lawsuit of its kind on behalf of a child victim of sex trafficking against a buyer of a commercial sex act with that child," the victim's attorney, Gloria Allred, said at a news conference.
Taylor, who has said he was unaware that Fierro was underage when he had sex with her, was sentenced to six years' probation in March and assessed a $2,000 fine.
The lawsuit seeks "compensatory and punitive damages" from Taylor, Allred said, but she declined to specify a dollar amount.
"Suing the buyer can have an impact on the demand for commercial sex of children," Allred said.
