(CNN) -- As India hosts the world's second largest automobile trade show, its domestic market seems to be having some difficulty getting out of first gear.
New cars for the Indian market aspiring to lure the growing middle classes include the 2014 Hyundai Xcent, Honda Amaze and Maruti Dzire, Ford Figo Concept.
Hyundai, currently the country's second-largest car manufacturer, will cut export figures to focus more on the domestic market and maintain market share.
The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) said sales of passenger vehicles declined by 5.72% during April-December 2013, compared to the same period the previous year.
Mumbai, the country's financial capital, has attempted to address the issue with the recent addition of a nine-kilometer-long monorail.
