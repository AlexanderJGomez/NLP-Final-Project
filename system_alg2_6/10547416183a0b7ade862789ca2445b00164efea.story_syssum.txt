McDonald was arrested on August 31 on suspicion of felony domestic violence after he allegedly got involved in an altercation with his fiancee, who was 10 weeks pregnant, a police source told The Sacramento Bee.
ESPN and Pro Football Talk said Rice will appeal Monday.
After public outcry over a two-game suspension for Rice, the NFL established a six-game unpaid ban for personnel who violate the league's policy on domestic violence, Goodell said Thursday.
But his attorney said Peterson is "a loving father" who was disciplining his son.
ESPN anchor and "life-long fan" Hannah Storm deplored the abuse cases in an emotional sign-off on Sunday.
Storm said she has some lingering questions of her own.
