A Massachusetts man was arrested Friday on suspicion of obstructing the investigation of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, authorities said.
In the hours and days following the bombings, Matanov contacted and attempted to contact the suspects by phone and saw Tamerlan Tsarnaev at least twice, according to the indictment.
"In addition to deleting information from his computer, Matanov made a number of false statements to federal investigators," the office's statement said.
Attorneys for the men denied the allegations.
