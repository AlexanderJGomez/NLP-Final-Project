The top rural speed limit is normally 70 mph, but in 2006 it set a maximum daytime speed of 80 miles per hour, the highest speed limit on the country, on more than 500 miles of rural interstate in its southwest corner.
The speed limit for rural roads in Montana is 75 mph.
Meanwhile, much of the eastern Midwest and the Northeast has opted for maximum speeds of 65 mph, although Michigan and Indiana chose the 70 mph standard more common to the South and the Great Plains states.
Speeds are slower in more populous Eastern states and faster in the wide-open West, although the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety argues that some of the new, higher speed limits out West and elsewhere are costing lives.
Ironically, the new regime of U.S. speed limits has helped researchers make sense of whether higher rural speed limits are dangerous.
While Yowell admits most states are well-intentioned, he's "not willing to accept that speed limits are solely a function of safety," he said.
His organization had lobbied heavily for an end to the federal limits.
If you put the limit below that speed, some vehicles are traveling far more slowly than the fastest drivers, creating the most dangerous conditions of all.
