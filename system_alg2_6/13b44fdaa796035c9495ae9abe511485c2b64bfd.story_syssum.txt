While Cosby offered Stacy Brown more than the head-shake that caused several moments of awkward radio silence during an interview with NPR, he did not address the allegations.
On Monday, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Spelman College, to which Cosby and wife Camille donated $20 million in 1987, has suspended the Cosby Chair for the Humanities while the controversy continues.
"Love and the strength of womanhood," Cosby said.
Brown said he came away with the clear sense that Cosby actually doesn't want to stay silent at all but is nevertheless deferring to the guidance of his representatives for the time being.
