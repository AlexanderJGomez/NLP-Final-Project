Club members voted overwhelmingly to try to work things out with the day-care center, which accused some swim club members of making racist comments to black and Hispanic children contracted to use the pool, said Bernice Duesler, the club director's wife.
she said.
Some children said white members of the club made racist comments to the children, asking why "black children were there" and raising concerns that "they might steal from us."
But John Duesler said last week that the Valley Club also canceled contracts with two other day-care centers because of safety and overcrowding issues.
Bernice Duesler said she wasn't yet sure how the club will "reach out" to Creative Steps and the other two camps.
