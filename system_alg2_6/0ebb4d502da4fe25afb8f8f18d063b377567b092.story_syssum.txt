"All of a sudden, the captain came on and said brace for a landing, and that's when we knew we were going down," he said.
As the plane headed down toward the river, the cabin was mostly silent, he said.
Then the plane hit the water.
"Then all of a sudden, it was 'Get out, get out now,' " Panero said.
When the plane began to sink, some passengers began to panic, Panero said.
"Our raft was tethered to the plane, and we worried we might go down with the plane," he said.
As Berretta exited the plane, he said that besides a few passengers remaining, the crew and pilot stayed behind to make sure everyone was out.
