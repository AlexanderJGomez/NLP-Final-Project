Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Ten Americans detained last week while trying to take 33 Haitian children out of the country were charged Thursday with kidnapping children and criminal association, a government official said.
Told that the families of the detained Americans had pleaded for him to intervene, Bellerive said he could not.
"Until now, I was not asked," he said.
The Americans have said they were just trying to help the children leave the earthquake-stricken country.
