The Grammy Award winner started the Common Ground Foundation to help underserved youth develop leadership and life skills.
Common: I grew up on the South Side of Chicago with my mother and my stepfather, and I was provided a nice home, a home with love in it.
My whole life growing up, I was doing the little things that I could do (to help people).
I want to empower them first by letting them know that they are loved and people do care.
My mother told me before going there: getting invited there, that is an important place to be because that is where a lot of people that do the real work are.
And it was super-inspiring to me.
Common: A hero to me is someone who is able to take whatever talent, gift, personality, quality and utilize it to help build others.
