Save the Children Chief Executive Jasmine Whitbread said the "vast majority" of children on their own in Haiti are not orphans, but were simply separated from their families in the chaos.
The United Nations Children's Fund, or UNICEF, does not facilitate adoptions, but it has been bombarded with calls from people who want a Haitian orphan, said Christopher de Bono, a UNICEF spokesman.
Adoptions without consent are child trafficking.
She has been taking care of children who waited for years in the orphanage to be adopted.
For those who want to help Haitian children, Whitbread said, they should donate to aid agencies that are working on reuniting children with their families.
