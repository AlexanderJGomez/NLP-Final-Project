Rami and Kamal, both gay Iraqis, say they rarely show affection for men in public.
"  Watch the tormented life of gays in Iraq Â»
"I told my family that I was beaten by them, but I did not dare to tell my family that I was raped by them.
CNN spoke with Kamal, now 18, and his 21-year-old friend Rami about what it's like to be gay in Iraq.
Lesbians are also victims of harassment and violence, but not nearly as often as gay men.
"Gay men and lesbians in Iraq face a lot of risks right now, because homosexuality is sometimes interpreted by people in Iraq as being a Western import," said Scott Portman with the Heartland Alliance, a group that promotes human rights worldwide.
Kamal and Rami say the dangers are all too real in Baghdad -- and they live in secrecy not to shame their families.
Rami added, "I do not know why people hate gays even though so many have this tendency.
"One day he told me he would come over to my house and kill me in front of my family," Rami said.
"During my sleep, I only see nightmares, and I start crying.
"Only my close friend Rami knows about this secret."
