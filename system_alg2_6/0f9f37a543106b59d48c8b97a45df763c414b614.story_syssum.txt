The legendary Formula One team has re-signed Finn Kimi Raikkonen to partner Fernando Alonso in 2014.
Ferrari will be the only team to race two world champions next season, making it the most potent, but potentially risky, pairing on the grid.
Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo had said earlier this year he did not want "two roosters in the same henhouse" but that view softened at last weekend's Italian Grand Prix.
Raikkonen, who has won two races since returning to F1 with Lotus in 2011, will be determined to fight for victories -- something Massa has struggled to do alongside Alonso.
Ferrari will hope their "fire and ice" combination will bring out the best in each other as it seeks to win its first team title since 2008.
Ferrari has now returned to Raikkonen for a quick fix as the Scuderia desperately seeks to rein in the all-conquering Red Bull team.
Raikkonen, who turns 34 in October, will not be able to offer a long-term solution -- but Ferrari chiefs are gambling on the fact that given the right car he will deliver, and deliver quickly.
