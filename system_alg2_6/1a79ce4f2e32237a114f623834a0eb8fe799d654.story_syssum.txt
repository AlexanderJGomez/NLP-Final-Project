(CNN) -- A body was recovered in the vicinity of a boat accident in the Delaware River, a Coast Guard spokeswoman said Friday.
We've never had a problem with this boat," said Chris Herschend.
While the boat was in the river and waiting for help, it was hit by a barge, he said.
National Transportation Safety Board officials will interview crew members on Friday, NTSB spokesman Robert Sumwalt said in Philadelphia Thursday afternoon.
Herschend said the company is investigating and assisting fire and police officials.
"Our first priority is the people on board," Herschend said.
The NTSB will also conduct a 72-hour history to determine the mental and emotional state of the crew of boat vessels, Sumwalt said.
In the interim, we have voluntarily suspended our Ride The Ducks operations nationwide.
