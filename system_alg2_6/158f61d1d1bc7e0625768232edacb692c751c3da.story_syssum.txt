That's the message from Eric Post, lead scientist of a new report into the effects of climate change on life in the Arctic.
The report found that some native Arctic species have also benefited from climate change, including wild reindeer on the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard.
said Post.
These species may be headed for extinction, said the report.
