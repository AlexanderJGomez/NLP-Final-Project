(CNN) -- Manchester United was left reeling Sunday after a demoralizing loss to arch-rival Liverpool that kept it a dozen points adrift of a Champions League spot but there was respite for under-fire manager David Moyes and his team Wednesday.
"I said to (my team) on Monday morning we have to win 3-0, give the crowd something back because the crowd here has been incredible," Moyes, the successor to managerial giant Alex Ferguson at United, told Sky Sports.
Van Persie, who led United to the league title last term, and Wayne Rooney were isolated in the loss to Liverpool, with the Dutchman spending the majority of his time in midfield instead of up front.
Referee Bjorn Kuipers pointed to the spot when the striker was pushed by Jose Holebas and van Persie made no mistake as he picked himself up in the 25th minute.
But Olympiacos was dealt a blow when van Persie converted Rooney's low cross -- after Giggs' pivotal ball -- in first-half injury time.
Olympiacos pushed forward and although De Gea had to be sharp, he and the United defense held firm to the delight -- and relief -- of most of those at Old Trafford.
"We have had a lot of injuries this season, but this result shows we are well prepared."
