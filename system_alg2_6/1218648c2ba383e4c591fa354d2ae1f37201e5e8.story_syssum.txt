Roland S. Martin says issue of Obama's birth certificate is being pushed by conspiracy theorists.
They have latched onto this story like bloodsucking leeches, and actually want us to believe this story has legs.
They will then accuse the president of doctoring the document and ordering up the state of Hawaii and federal officials to create the birth certificate.
President Obama is right to ignore these losers.
In such difficult times, we all need a good laugh every now and then, and you provide great comic fodder.
