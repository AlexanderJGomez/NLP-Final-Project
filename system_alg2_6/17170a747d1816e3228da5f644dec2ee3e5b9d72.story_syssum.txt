Like a football or basketball game, a host can't "win" "SNL" with a great opening monologue, but he or she sure can screw it up.
For the second straight year, EW.com readers have voted to determine who was "SNL's" best host.
The electorate rescued Seth MacFarlane to join our final five: Martin Short, Justin Timberlake, Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig and Ben Affleck.
It helps, of course, if you think CK is a comic genius, but even if you're not tuned in to his brand of comedy, his first time hosting had a refreshingly off-beat vibe.
CK lasted a few weeks in our voting contest before being eliminated by Jeremy Renner, but if he hosts again next year he's a total must-watch, especially with one show under his belt.
With those out of the way, he should be even freer and more unpredictable the next time he visits.
Was it half-scripted?
But as time went on, he seemed perfectly in control.
Can we hope "Homeland" is in the middle of a season again the next time Hathaway gets the call?
The show occurred at the center of a Timberlake promotional blitz that was anything but subtle â€” he even spent an entire week on "Late Night" with his "History of Rap" partner Jimmy Fallon.
Thanks again for voting throughout the year, and congratulations to Justin Timberlake, Mr. Saturday Night 2013.
