So how do you become a Davos delegate?
For a delegate arriving from New York this week flying business class, the price comes in at between $4,200 and $5,300.
Finding accommodation in Davos during the week of the World Economic Forum is not easy, with a limited number of large hotels.
It is not uncommon to see $2,000 bespoke suits finished off with bulky snow boots around the Congress Center.
$40,000-per head well spent.
