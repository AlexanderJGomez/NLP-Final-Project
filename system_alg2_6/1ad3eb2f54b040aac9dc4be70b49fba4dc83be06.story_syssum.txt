Wissam Tarif, executive director of the human rights organization Insan, said at least 34 people have been killed in Daraa in the past two days.
Kamal Aswad, a political activist in Daraa, said people in the funeral procession were chanting: "Those who kill their own people are traitors" and he said activists are trying to generate support for a big protest on Friday -- a "Day of Martyrs" to be held after Friday prayers.
The government also said it would study lifting the country's emergency law and new legislation that would license political parties.
"I was an eyewitness to his excellency's orders that no live bullets would be used against the demonstrators," Shaaban said.
In 2010, Syria ranked 127th out of 178 countries in transparency and accountability to the public, according to the international government watchdog group Transparency International.
Joshua Landis, who runs the Syria Comment blog and is director of the Center for Middle East Studies and associate professor at University of Oklahoma, told CNN that the unrest in Daraa is spurred by a number of factors, widespread poverty, a dislike for the emergency law and the arrests two weeks ago of young people who scrawled anti-government graffiti.
Along with many killed in the violence over the past 36 hours there were 92 confirmed arrests, according to Neil Sammonds an Amnesty researcher on Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.
It's "hard to imagine these are front-line protesters," Sammonds said.
