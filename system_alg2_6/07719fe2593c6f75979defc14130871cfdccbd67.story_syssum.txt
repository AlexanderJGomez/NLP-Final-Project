Miller said that Roosevelt did not use the "big stick"-- he did not threaten and he did not pound the table.
"It revolutionized the game," Miller said.
There was no Internet when Roosevelt brought the football men to the White House; there was no television; there were no radios in American homes.
If football leaders were called to the White House today, the whole country would know it in advance, and for any president, "the risk of getting involved at that level is the risk of not succeeding."
