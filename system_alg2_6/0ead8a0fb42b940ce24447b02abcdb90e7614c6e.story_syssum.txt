A man shot and killed four children and two adults Wednesday at a Houston-area home belonging to relatives of his estranged wife, authorities said.
Haskell, apparently posing as a parcel delivery driver late Wednesday afternoon, entered the home of one of his estranged wife's relatives while only the children were there, Hickman said.
"Fortunately, they were brought out of the house before that could happen, (or) we would have had more tragedy."
Haskell has children with his estranged wife, but those children were not believed to have been in the Spring-area home where the shootings happened, Hickman said.
