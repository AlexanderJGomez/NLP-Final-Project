"I'm done, that was my last race and this is my last Olympics," confirmed the 27-year-old.
"Ryan and I like racing each other," Phelps said.
On the future of men's swimming, Phelps said he is looking forward to taking a back seat and watching new rivalries like the one between Lochte and Agnel develop over the next four years.
"It's kind of sad that people have a great swim and that's the first thing they say," said Phelps.
