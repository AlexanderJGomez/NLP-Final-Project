Being able to ride along narrow trails and carry out maintenance checks on a motorbike are not talents most health workers in the world need to possess, but for Jallow these skills are crucial.
Jallow says all this wouldn't be possible without Riders for Health (RFH), a social enterprise working to transform healthcare delivery across rural Africa and provide outreach health workers with the transport they need.
"I received this motorcycle four years ago when it was brand new and I have ridden until now over 50,000 kilometers," says Jallow, whose work covers more than 10,000 people in 13 villages.
"Barry came back and said there are children in rural communities who really need to be reached because they need immunizations; women are dying in childbirth and then 30, 20, 10 miles away in ministry of health car parks there are motorcycles and ambulances that are simply broken because nobody has been trained to repair them, there's no supply chain of parts, there's no knowledge of transport maintenance," remembers Andrea, a mother of three and former motorcycle racer.
In one year, RFH says, mobilized health workers have transported more than 400,000 medical samples and test results between rural health centers and labs.
"What gets me up in the morning is the idea that health workers who are very highly trained -- women and men living across Africa -- really want to get out to their rural communities and make sure that they are healthy," says Andrea.
