Tom Shupe thinks black bears have a people problem.
Instead of scaring it away, too many people say: "Oh, isn't he cute.
But it's the beginning of the end for that bear, because the people are teaching it to associate the smell of people with food.
But the bear has learned people equals food, and does it again.
Why?
We put out all sorts of food for them: lawns, gardens, shrubbery, birdseed, grill grease, garbage, dumpster waste.
How did we turn this story into such a mess?
Over the last century and half, forests grew back on abandoned farmland; a century ago we ended commercial hunting and began restoring wild bird and animal populations.
There we get most of our nature on digital screens, where wild creatures are often portrayed as pets performing all sorts of antics.
Estimates say about 100 people die in hunting accidents, mainly in cases of mistaken identity.
These days, deer kill more than twice that many, both in deer-vehicle crashes and when drivers swerve into a tree or an oncoming vehicle.
Black bears are shy and docile creatures motivated by hunger and fear, but they, like deer, beavers, turkeys, waterfowl and others, were almost wiped out in the United States by the end of the 19th century.
It isn't.
Conflicts between people and wild animals will continue to rise as both populations grow into one another.
Reinstilling their fear will help.
