New York (CNN) -- When US Airways Flight 1549 ditched in the Hudson River and all of its 150 passengers and five crew members were safely rescued in January, the landing of the airplane by pilot Chesley Sullenberger was quickly proclaimed the "Miracle on the Hudson" and dominated national news for days.

Sullenberger, for his part, has been critical of Langewiesche's book, saying it makes too much of the aircraft's automation.
In an interview with The New York Times, Sullenberger said, "There are some situations where the automation will protect a pilot, but at the same time a highly automated airplane makes possible other types of errors, so it's a mixed blessing.

Langewiesche: Of course, it's justified.
While in most simulations conducted after the fact, pilots were able to get back to the airport safely, he made the right decision.
In a way to use the word miracle is to insult what they did -- skilled flying in an extremely competent airplane.
It's technically possible, and the U.S. flies drones in Afghanistan ... but obviously that's not the future of airlines in a dense traffic world with the public aboard.
Langewiesche: Pilots, of course, are central.
In day-to-day operations the pilot is central to flight safety -- the relationship between that and salary is a whole different question.
Let's face it, airlines are extremely safe, specifically because of the contributions of the people involved in this success story -- the pilots, the engineers, the flight controllers, the flight attendants.

Clearly, they were flying a fly-by-wire airplane, and that's part of the story.
