Speaking to Clintonville residents Thursday night, Kuss said the U.S. Geological Survey has determined that "our community did in fact experience an earthquake that registered 1.5 on the earthquake magnitude scale."
Based on all the data, the USGS believes the shaking and strange sounds are the result of  "a swarm of several small earthquakes in a very short amount of time," Kuss said.
"It was just pop-pop-pop," she said.
No, said one one tongue-in-cheek Twitter user.
While the cause of the shaking has been solved, it's still not clear if the rattling in Clintonville is over, Kuss said.
"All throughout the eastern United States, even small earthquakes are felt great distances," Caruso explained.
When asked why Clintonville residents heard such strange noises during the apparent quakes, Caruso said all seismic shifts generate noise but these sounds cannot be heard during major quakes.
Or other sounds going on (like) things falling down."
