LONDON, England (CNN) -- DNA testing to try to identify hundreds of bodies buried in a mass grave during World War I will start this week, the British and Australian ministries of defense announced Monday.
The DNA testing program will be the largest undertaking to identify individuals killed in combat ever commissioned, the ministry said.
Last year, preliminary digs commissioned by the Australian government located five mass graves near the site of the battle.
The resulting graveyard will be the first new one consecrated by the commission for almost 50 years, Francis told CNN by phone.
The bodies of more than 165,000 Commonwealth soldiers killed on the Western Front during the First World War are still missing, the commission says.
