The IRS is trying to reach people who do not normally file tax returns so they can apply for stimulus checks.
The checks mailed nationwide so far total $63.8 billion, Shulman said.
The notices sent to those who didn't file an income tax return in 2006 told them they should file a 1040A tax form for 2007 even if they had no tax liability.
