The Wolong Giant Panda Reserve Center in southwest Sichuan province is home to about 86 giant pandas, who were reported safe Tuesday.
Zobor said the WWF had confirmed the safety of staff members based in Beijing but had not received word on the conditions in Wolong.
In the late 1990s, the captive giant panda population was in decline, with more animals dying than were born, Wildt said.
Wildt said that Chinese scientists have also addressed the issue of alternative food sources.
If the staff is fine, then the animals will be fine," Wildt said.
