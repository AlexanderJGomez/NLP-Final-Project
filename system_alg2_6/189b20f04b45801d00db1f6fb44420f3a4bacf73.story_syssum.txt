"I already feel like I spend too much time online.
Inspired by my conversation with Leda, I sorted my Twitter buddies so that the people I loved most were in a special group.
Online conversation can be a great boon to your friendships, but only if you organize your online socializing around the kinds of relationships -- and that specific people -- that matter to you.
Focusing my phone time on my oldest and dearest friend means that when we talk, we can actually have a meaningful conversation about the latest chapter in our lives, rather than using an hour to catch up on news highlights.
Make that "friends," not friends.
Whether you move every year or plan on living in one place your whole life, an imaginary move is a great way of focusing your email, chat and Facebook time on the people who you love most.
Know the balance of friendship types and friendship time that makes you happy, and you'll be better able to create that social life by cultivating current or new relationships online.
Maybe you'd like to spend more time with your BFF, but your husband finds her husband dead boring.
