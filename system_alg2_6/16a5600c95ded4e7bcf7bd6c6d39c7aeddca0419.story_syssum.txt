A new survey reveals that one in seven Americans -- more than 46 million people -- relies on charitable programs and services to get the nutrition they need to remain healthy.
While the number of households receiving nutrition assistance from the federal government's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (previously known as food stamps) increased by approximately 50% between 2009 and 2013, the report found that this was matched by radically increased need for outside charitable resources.
Around 7 million of those included a family member who skipped meals or went hungry so that other members could have enough to eat.
The group assists more than 46 million people annually, including 12 million children and 7 million seniors.
Still, hungry Americans are left with hard choices about how to keep their families healthy.
Buy day or two old bread for toast, bread pudding or a breakfast.
In Aiken's eyes, the struggle for healthy food is one that all Americans must first acknowledge, and then help shoulder.
