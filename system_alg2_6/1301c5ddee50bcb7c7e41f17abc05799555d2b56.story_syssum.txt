(CNN)Vladimir Putin is not a self-effacing man.
Early on Friday, officials released what they said was a picture of Putin taken the day of.
This whole thing started after Putin's trip to Kazakhstan was canceled on Wednesday and a Kazakh official told a reporter that the Russian President had fallen ill. Then the Kremlin released a picture of Putin speaking with the leader of the Republic of Karelia.
Does Putin ever catch a cold?
Putin is the state.
His approval ratings are stratospheric, even if his brazen policies would warrant more significant levels of disagreement.
The recent murder of Boris Nemtsov, Putin's foremost critic, has spawned fears that there is a hit list, a roster of Putin critics whose days are numbered.
The next day, the Russian people were told that Gorbachev was ill, and could not perform his duties.
Even if Putin is in perfect health and the social media whirlwind turns out to have just been an outlet for creativity, talk of Putin's disappearance raises important questions.
Whatever Putin is doing at this exact moment -- whether he is hunting tigers, visiting with friends, or convalescing from an illness -- and no matter what he does in the days ahead, the Internet tempest of the past few days is a reminder that the man who embodies today's Russian state, who dismantled the country's once-fledgling democracy, won't be around forever.
