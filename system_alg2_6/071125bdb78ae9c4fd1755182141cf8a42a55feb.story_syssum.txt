At the end of the '80s Albania, under the totalitarian regime of Enver Hoxha, was one of the planet's most isolated states.
The Block ('Ish-Blloku' in Albanian) was Hoxha's refuge.
At street level too, the neighborhood is almost unrecognizable.
The Block was his perfect opportunity.
On big nights tables are booked in advance, even for drinks.
"English is a way to look trendy," says Rudina Hoxha, a journalist.
"I like it here," she says.
In 2007 a shade more than a million people visited the country.
It's great: the people are young and nice."
For coffee: Radio Cafe Tirana.
1, Tirana;
Good for a romantic meal beside the madness.
