The parents have filed a lawsuit alleging their son never posed a threat to the deputy and that Nino de Rivera suffered a permanent brain injury when he hit the ground after McMillan tased the teen.

(Nino de Rivera) was not acting aggressively," the attorney said.
Deborah Fowler, legal director for Texas Appleseed, a group that fights for social and economic justice in Texas -- and a signatory to the ACLU letter calling for a Taser ban in schools -- said there is no state or national data on how frequently Tasers are deployed on students.
