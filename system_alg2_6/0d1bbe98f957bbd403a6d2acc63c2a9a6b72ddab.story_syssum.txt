Mycoskie: The TOMS initiative is very simple: For every pair of shoes we sell, we give a pair away.
When we know that say, we're going to sell 10,000 pairs this spring, we make another 10,000 to be given away.
Mycoskie: I had absolutely no experience in shoes or fashion so I approached the business how I have done everything in my life, and that's with reckless ambition.
I wanted to be able to sell the shoes for enough money to give away another pair and to hire one or two people to administer it and keep it going once I went back to work.
Mycoskie: A very big passion of mine and that of the people that run our production is finding factories that have fair labor practices and treating them more like partners in our family than people just who are going to produce for us.
Mycoskie: I can honestly say that TOMS is my future.
Mycoskie: The future of TOMS is really creating a whole new business model of this one-for-one giving and expanding the TOMS model from shoes into other products as well.
