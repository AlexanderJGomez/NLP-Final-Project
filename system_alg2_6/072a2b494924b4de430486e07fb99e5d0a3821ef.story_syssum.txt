The ruling that Kerviel must pay â‚¬4.9 billion (about $6.3 billion) in damages to the bank, Societe Generale, was also upheld.
The bank was pleased with the original conviction because it placed responsibility for the rogue trades on Kerviel and not the bank.
Metzner filed the appeal against the sentence, but Kerviel switched to Koubbi as his attorney in March this year.
