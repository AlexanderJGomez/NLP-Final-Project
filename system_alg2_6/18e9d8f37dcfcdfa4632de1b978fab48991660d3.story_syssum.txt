That thought alone -- that someone would sit in a public restaurant and order dog from a menu -- is likely enough to get most "dog people" to stop reading this column, much less look at the photo essay featured this week by CNN's photo blog.
The images featured on the CNN Photo Blog take viewers inside Southeast Asia's illegal dog-meat trade.
"The dogs are illegally smuggled out of Thailand -- that is the illegal part," he said.
I fear you'll see Duggleby's photos and think only one thing: How awful that people in Vietnam would eat these loveable, intelligent animals.
That shouldn't.
The United States euthanizes 1.2 million dogs per year, according to the ASPCA.
But eating those strays, those runaways, those not-quite-cute-enough-to-take and not-quite-well-behaved-enough-to-keep dogs would be killing a flock of birds with one stone and eating it, too."
You can abstain from meat because you believe that the mental capacity of animals is too close to that of humans.
I went to Vietnam earlier this year to report a story on the illegal trade in pangolin, which is a scale-covered mammal few people care about (except me and maybe this guy) in the way they care about dogs.
I didn't.
If we think dog shouldn't be eaten -- like, ever, regardless of how clean the trade is and how quick the kill -- then maybe we should think about the other animals we eat, and if and why we don't feel the same way about them.
"When I was photographing inside a dog meat restaurant -- claiming to be a chef studying Vietnamese food -- I was offered to try it," he said.
And it's the one all of us should further examine.
