But one thing I, and I'm sure many of you, think we understand is obesity.
Pretty much everything we "know" about obesity and weight loss is wrong.
I know I've told people that making small, sustained lifestyle changes is the best way to lose weight over time.
It turns out that studies don't show that's the case.
People will say that eating more fruits and vegetables is a great way to lose weight.
People will say that snacking in between meals can lead to weight gain.
Over the past five years, my wife and I have lost quite a bit of weight.
Each time, I had ambitious goals of 15 pounds or more in two to three months, and each time I really restricted my caloric intake.
I tell you this because more and more, I think that the journey to sustained weight loss is a very personal and individual path.
But one thing I doubt will ever be proved false is that it's much easier not to gain the weight in the first place than to take it off later.
