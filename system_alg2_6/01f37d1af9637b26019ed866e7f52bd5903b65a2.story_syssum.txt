But why was Macy so excited?
What does she like about Hillary Clinton?
I was just like, 'Wow.'
(long pause) I turned back at my family and I, like, I, you know, made the face.
And she is just a good role model for girls because, you know, she is just sort of, like, to everybody, 'Girls can be awesome, too.'
Macy: I didn't know, too, too, too much.
Did I already say Taylor Swift?
Macy: Maybe!
CNN: Thanks Macy...
