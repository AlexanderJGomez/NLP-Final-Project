The justices unanimously found the world's largest seed producer has intellectual property control over its best-selling "Roundup Ready" soybeans.
"Bowman planted Monsanto's patented soybeans solely to make and market replicas of them thus depriving the company of the reward patent law provides for the sale of each article," said Justice Elena Kagan.
He used the patented soybeans for his main spring crop, but went to a local grain elevator and purchased so-called commodity seeds for a riskier, late-season crop.
But Bowman said there were no restrictions on how he used the mixed-variety seeds, which he did for eight consecutive fall crops.
But Monsanto, backed by the Obama administration and a range of businesses, say protecting intellectual property is more important than ever, especially in fast-developing technological fields.
The case is Bowman v. Monsanto Company (11-796).
