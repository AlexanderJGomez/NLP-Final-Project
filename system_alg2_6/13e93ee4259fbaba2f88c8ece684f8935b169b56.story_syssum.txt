(CNN) -- Last August, a 10-year-old boy from Missouri wrote an iReport to CNN.
This week, "Dennis" wrote that he keeps on his computer a picture that CNN published of Braydon and his father wearing matching military uniforms.
It's been incredible for the whole family to know that people do care," Nichols told CNN this week.
Last year, weeks before that horrible August morning that she had to tell her son that his father was gone, Jessica Nichols recalled how Braydon loved to fantasize giddily about how he and his dad were going camping when he finished fighting bad guys.
It's hard," Monte Nichols said.
There were 32 children who lost a parent in the Chinook tragedy, and two of the wives of the men on board were pregnant, said retired Air Force Maj. Steve McLeary, the executive director of the Special Operations Warrior Foundation.
But five families who lost loved ones on the helicopter were Army and not in Special Operations, McLeary said.
The Special Operations Warrior Foundation is covering all college tuition and room and board expenses for those children, too, McLeary said.
The Special Operations Warrior Foundation has over 900 kids in their program, McLeary said.
