"Across the board they thought it was ugly," said Shea Munroe, who sorts the art and collectibles donated at Goodwill Industries in Federal Way, Washington.
"This is probably the real deal," Munroe said of her discovery of the Dali work.
Goodwill doesn't know the donor, who managed to sneak away during a busy time at the drop-off facility, Munroe said.
An appraiser retained by Goodwill also confirmed the authenticity of the Dali, and the charitable organization also ensured the art wasn't stolen, said Amanda Bedell, spokeswoman for Goodwill in Tacoma, Washington.
Most donated goods are sold at Goodwill stores, but prizes such as the Dali are auctioned online -- to maximize their value, said Munroe, who works for Goodwill's online department.
The bidding for the Dali piece is still short of the most prized art auctioned by Goodwill: A Frank Weston Benson oil painting, dated 1924 and also donated anonymously, was sold online by Goodwill in 2006 for $165,002.
