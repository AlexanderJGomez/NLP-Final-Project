(CNN) -- Reigning world champions, Italy have been held to a 1-1 draw by New Zealand in their World Cup Group F match at the Mbombela Stadium in Nelspruit.
A win against Slovakia would ensure qualification, but they must rely on New Zealand getting a result against Paraguay to have any chance of topping their group.
"The result is 1-1 so we just have to pull up our socks and win our next game because we don't want to go home early," Lippi said, AFP reported.
The result leaves Slovakia needing to beat Italy in their final group match this Thursday to have any chance of progressing to the next round.
Roque Santa Cruz should have doubled Paraguay's in the 38th minute, when he latched onto a loose ball on the edge of Slovakia's penalty area.
Weiss went close for Slovakia in injury time, but he and his team toiled fruitlessly in search of a goal for most of the game while Paraguay, who with Santa Cruz, Nelson Haedo Valdez and Barrios had class to spare in midfield.
