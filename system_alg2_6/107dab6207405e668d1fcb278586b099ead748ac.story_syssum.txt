Saleh has threatened to withdraw all members of his party from the national government and warned the prime minister he could face imprisonment.
Prime Minister Mohammed Saleh Basendowah recently attended a ceremony at Change Square in Sanaa and condemned the old regime's attacks against unarmed youth protesters.
Senior GPC officials told CNN that Saleh was angered at the president and prime minister's stances.
Saleh is still the president of the largest party in the country and must be treated with respect," said a senior GPC aide who asked to remain anonymous.
