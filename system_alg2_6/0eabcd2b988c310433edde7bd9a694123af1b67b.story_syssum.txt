Oklahoma will seek the death penalty for Alton Alexander Nolen, 30, who is charged with first-degree murder in the beheading of a 54-year-old woman at his former workplace, District Attorney Greg Mashburn said in a court document Thursday.
The FBI is also investigating the attack because Nolen "was saying Arabic terms in the attack," Mashburn said.
Vaughan arrived at the plant with a rifle and shot Nolen as he was charging with knife in hand, Mashburn said.
In unrelated incidents, Nolen was convicted of assault and battery on a police officer, escape from detention and possession of marijuana, all in January 2011, according to court papers filed by prosecutors.
