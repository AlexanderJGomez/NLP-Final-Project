Everyone has the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.
Individuals with mutations in either of these genes have increased cancer risks, most notably for breast and ovarian cancer.
A positive BRCA2 result gives a woman a 50% to 70% lifetime risk of breast cancer and a 10% to 20% lifetime risk of ovarian cancer.
If not, who should be?
Individuals with a personal or family history of breast cancer appearing before age 50, ovarian cancer at any age, breast cancer in both breasts, male breast cancer, multiple cases of breast cancer within a family, and breast cancer in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry should get genetic counseling to determine whether they should be tested.
Since BRCA mutations are not associated with pediatric cancer risks, testing for children is not recommended.
Since ovarian cancer screening has not been proven reliably to catch ovarian cancers early, risk-reducing oophorectomy is recommended for BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers, ideally between the ages of 35 and 40.
