Robb Reiner and Steve "Lips" Kudlow have never given up on playing rock 'n' roll.
Watch Kudlow and Reiner talk about their passion Â»
The enthusiastic Kudlow and laconic Reiner came by CNN Center to talk about the film, their inspirations and why they've always been successful.
Steve "Lips" Kudlow: I started crying, because it seemed like kismet, as if it was all meant to be this way.
Reiner: It's fair.
[The director] is the other Rob Reiner, and Spinal Tap is the fake Anvil.
CNN: A lot of times when a director sets out to make a documentary, the people who are in the documentary say, "You cut this out, you changed this."
Kudlow: It might have been five more-boring movies.
You don't.
CNN: It's easy to make fun of a band -- or make a tragedy out of a band -- that doesn't quite make it.
Even if it had ended then, you say in the movie that you've had the kind of success you were always hoping for.
...
Reiner: It's called the Anvil Experience.
We were going to keep rocking whether this movie came along or not.
