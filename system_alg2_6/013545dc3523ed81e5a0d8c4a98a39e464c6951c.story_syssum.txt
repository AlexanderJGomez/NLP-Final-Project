A safe distance from Nairobi's Westgate Mall, several Kenyans stare through a stand of trees at the site of one of the nation's worst terrorist attacks.
On the day of the attack, my cousin, Charles Mugo, and his two daughters, ages 6 and 3, found themselves with about 40 other shoppers in the mall parking garage.
When the gunmen demanded to know if they were Muslim, Mugo hesitated just long enough for the attackers to turn their attention to a man nearby.
The interaction lasted long enough for Mugo to push his two girls under a parked car, and for him to stoop low behind it.
"Westgate bad, blood," the younger daughter told me later.
Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Pakistani terrorist group that attacked the hotel for more than three days, killing 166 people.
This is -- this was well-planned and well-thought out."
Four days after the attack, Mugo is still trying to sort out his feelings.
At the time, all I kept thinking was I just couldn't let these girls die."
