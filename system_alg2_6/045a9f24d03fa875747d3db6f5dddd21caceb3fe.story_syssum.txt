Islamabad (CNN) -- Pakistan's former president Pervez Musharraf is back in Pakistan after years of self-imposed exile and is facing a hard time from courts in Pakistan amid a range of charges, including claims he illegally placed senior judges under house arrest during a period of emergency rule he imposed in 2007.
Open hostility is not all Musharraf has faced, though.
He has given President Barack Obama's administration a much-needed headline of Pakistani support for U.S. drone strikes.
His consent does not extend beyond those strikes to cover those carried out under Obama, when the intensity of drone strikes escalated dramatically to form the bulk of all drone strikes.
The reality is drones -- with or without consent -- are a seductive option for the leader of the free world.
Obama campaigned and was elected on a platform of change, one that would end the abuses and torture so prevalent during the early years of the so-called war on terror.
