(CNN) -- Oscar Pistorius, the South African amputee who is running in the 2012 Olympics on prosthetic legs, might be surprised to learn he is part of a history that traces back 3,500 years.
For most of history, prosthetic limbs were used primarily to restore function and secondarily to mimic the human form (one of the Egyptian toes even had a false toenail).
In 2007, however, the International Association of Athletics Federations banned Pistorius from competing in able-bodied competitions after tests at the German Sport University showed the Cheetah blades allowed him to expend less energy than able-bodied runners.
The issue will have to be revisited by each new athlete who wants to use artificial mechanisms in competition.
What about a swimmer who wants to use prosthetic hands or legs?
What is a disability?
In the Martin case, it was the U.S. Supreme Court, who overruled the PGA and allowed Martin to use a golf cart.
Sport is an artificial world.
Pistorius' supporters argue instead that fairness in sport means allowing all qualified people to compete, even those born without fibulas.
The decision to let him compete in the Olympics is the beginning of this conundrum.
