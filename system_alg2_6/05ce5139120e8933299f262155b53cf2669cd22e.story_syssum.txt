Democrat Harry Reid, majority leader of the Senate?
No recent majority leader of either party has been saved the headache of trying to lead a Senate in which minorities can exploit the rules and stymie the chamber.
Twice this week, the Senate has opened debate with its party leaders engaged in a caustic battle over Reid's plans to seek changes to Senate rules in January.
A top priority should be to eliminate filibusters of the "motion to proceed" to a bill and the three motions that are required to send a bill to conference with the House.
Banning the filibuster on this motion would still allow a minority to filibuster the underlying bill and amendments to it.
The first cloture vote would require 60 votes, as is required under Senate rules.
The Senate should consider new "fast-track" confirmation rules.
That is the unfortunate history of Senate reform: Senators rarely want to give up their parliamentary advantages.
Because changes to Senate rules can be filibustered, efforts to reform the Senate typically crash and burn.
