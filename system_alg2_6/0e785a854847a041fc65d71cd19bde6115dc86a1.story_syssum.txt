(WIRED)  -- Microsoft showed off a host of visual and search enhancements to its search engine Bing Wednesday, in hopes that better packaging will help it eat away at Google's online dominance.
The Movie page for that movie will, like those for in-theater movies, show you a preview and links to reviews.
Perhaps most importantly, Bing now has a partnership with Facebook, and one out of five Bing users are candidates for "instant personalization," since they are logged into Facebook and haven't chosen to opt-out.
For instance, if you search for "how to quiet a baby" and one of your friends on Facebook has liked one of the articles that shows up in the search results, you will see their picture next to that result.
Being in second place also lets Microsoft play with new visual approaches to search faster than Google can, as there are fewer users who will get upset when the location of a link moves.
