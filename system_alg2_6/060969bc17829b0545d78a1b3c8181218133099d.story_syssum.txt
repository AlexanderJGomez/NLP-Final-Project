Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), which came to power in 2002, was always conflicted in its relations with Israel.
This effort fit well with the AKP's grand vision of its foreign policy -- Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his party were intent in making Turkey an important international player.
From then on, Turkish foreign policy vis-Ã -vis Israel was dramatically transformed.
He then began to challenge Israel's nuclear arms while defending Iran against the West.
Ultimately, it is the incompetence of the Israeli decision-makers who failed to properly analyze the groups' intentions that in many ways handed the AKP, Erdogan and Hamas a public relations victory.
Even though Arab countries have been mistrustful of Turkey in the past, Erdogan has successfully transformed himself into the leader of the Middle East.
