(CNN) -- Gabriel García Márquez, the influential, Nobel Prize-winning author of "One Hundred Years of Solitude" and "Love in the Time of Cholera," has died, his family and officials said.
He's just as admired in Mexico as he is in (his native) Colombia, all of Latin America and throughout the world," Ortiz told CNN en Español.
García Márquez's early life was shaped by both familial and political conflict.
García Márquez spent his early childhood with his grandparents while his parents pursued a living in the coastal city of Barranquilla.
The influence is obvious in García Márquez's works, particularly "One Hundred Years of Solitude."
For years, García Márquez had been writing and publishing fiction, including short stories in Latin American journals and a handful of longer works, including "Leaf Storm," which was published in 1955.
It is, in short, very much like Márquez's astonishing novel," wrote The New York Times in a 1970 review upon the release of the English translation by Gregory Rabassa.
García Márquez worked on "Solitude" tirelessly, selling off family items, living on credit, smoking up a nicotine frenzy.
"I was saddened to learn of the passing of Gabriel García Márquez," he said in a statement.
He is said to be the most popular Spanish-language author in the world.
What I didn't like about journalism before were the working conditions," he told The Paris Review.
"On behalf of Mexico, I would like to express my sorrow for the passing of one of the greatest writers of our time, Gabriel Garcia Marquez," tweeted Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto.
"I see dreams as part of life in general, but reality is much richer.
