(CNN) -- A congressional hearing Thursday on aviation security will be missing its chief witness, who declined to testify.
The committee insisted it has legislative jurisdiction when it comes to the airline industry and its passengers, who help finance TSA operations through security fees.
Pistole said TSA would continue to work with "committees of jurisdiction" on agency matters.
