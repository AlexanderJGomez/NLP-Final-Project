Obama is also scheduled to deliver a speech to U.S. troops in South Korea on Thursday, the Veterans Day holiday in the United States.
Widespread protests are expected at the summit, for which South Korea has mobilized its largest security force ever, according to the Yonhap news agency.
Obama said he returned as president of the United States seeking "a deep and enduring partnership" with Indonesia.
"We see the G-20 as fundamental not just to our international economic agenda, but to our ability to have a lasting recovery at home, because fostering balance, global growth is essential to fostering growth here in the American economy," Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications said ahead of Obama's Asia trip.
After South Korea, Obama will head to Japan for the APEC summit, which will be held in Yokohama on Saturday and Sunday.
"Further economic integration [and] trade liberalization in Asia Pacific is vital to our own interests and our ability to export more and grow our economy here at home," National Security Advisor Mike Froman said ahead of Obama's Asia trip.
