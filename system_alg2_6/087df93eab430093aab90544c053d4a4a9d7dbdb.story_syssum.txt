Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reflected that tension this week when she urged Islamist parties in Egypt to "embrace democratic norms and rules" by creating a government that respects the full range of human rights.
While the Muslim Brotherhood has pledged to respect minority rights and work with liberal parties, much of the concern has focused on the success of al-Nour, a Salafist party that supports broader application of strict Islamic law in Egypt.
"He was chosen by the Supreme Council with no political base from Tahrir," Shaath said.
But even if the United States and other countries do continue to support democratic movements in the Middle East, public opinion in the region has barely shifted, Heydemann said.
But the only way these parties can retain their popularity once in power is to govern effectively, he said.
But it won't be a quick process, Heydemann said.
"We're kind of stuck in a way."
