President Obama was convinced he could change all that with programs that would deliver for America—such as health care reform—and the public would be grateful.
All of which makes you wonder: Does the President himself trust government anymore?
"If people can't trust not only the executive branch but also don't trust Congress ... to make sure that we're abiding by the Constitution ..." he said, "then we're going to have some problems here."
So far as I can tell, the governing style of this administration has two extremes: issues singled out for micromanagement (as in, foreign policy, from the West Wing) and issues completely delegated (as in, VA management).
Government is unwieldy and difficult and hard to tame, sure.
He's top dog, he's not negotiating with anybody, and he's not trying to get people to do things they don't want to do.
By nature, bureaucracies are hard to trust and even harder to tame.
"I can't go back to yesterday," she said, "because I was a different person then."
