We use antibiotics to treat bacterial infections.
They developed the ability to fight the antibiotics that we use.
This isn't fear-mongering.
Over time, though, a strain of bacteria, known as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, became a problem in hospitals.
Every time we use antibiotics, we give bacteria a chance to evolve.
Each time we use antibiotics unnecessarily, say to treat a virus, we make the problem worse.
It's much, much more likely, though, that these same people will ask for antibiotics when they get a cold.
