(CNN) -- Dennis Rodman's flashy visit to North Korea is just a big elaborate show.
What this portrait lacks is the unimaginable level of the suffering of people inside the country who are deprived of basic human rights and food.
Children's growth and development is being permanently stunted.
In its November 2012 crop and food security assessment, the U.N. predicted a gap of 207,000 tons of food this year in North Korea.
Most importantly, such sideshows are not in the interest of the North Korean people.
Instead, the world needs to focus on the dire situation of the North Korean people and stay committed to finding solutions that will alleviate their hunger and improve their living situations.
