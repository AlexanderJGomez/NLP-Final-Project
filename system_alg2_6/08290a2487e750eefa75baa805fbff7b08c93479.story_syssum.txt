(CNN) -- A copyright dispute over royalties from an acclaimed film, "Raging Bull," can go the distance after the Supreme Court on Monday allowed a lawsuit to move ahead.
She claimed ownership over the original screenplay and the subsequent rights to the story.
Paula Petrella claims she is the sole owner of the book and the original screenplay, and that the subsequent film infringes on those copyrights.
The companies say having an open-ended period to file copyright claims makes it hard to make future business decisions.
Copyright experts say the high court's ruling will make it easier to press decades-old copyright claims.
The case is Petrella v. MGM, Inc. (12-1315).
