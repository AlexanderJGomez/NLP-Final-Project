The State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons Report also says trafficking has increased in Africa and slaps six African nations on a blacklist of countries not meeting the minimum standard of combating trafficking.
African countries Nigeria and Mauritius are praised in the report for making strong efforts to combat trafficking.
Most of the countries are "source" and "destination" countries, the report says, meaning trafficking victims both come from and are sent there.
This year, the Justice Department also put out a report on U.S. efforts to combat trafficking efforts at home.
For the first time, she said, the United States next year will rank its own efforts at combating trafficking along with the rest of the world.
She expressed hope that it will be on the Tier 1 list of countries that are making robust efforts.
