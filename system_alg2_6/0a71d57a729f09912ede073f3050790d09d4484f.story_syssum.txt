Etan Patz, who disappeared in 1979, was the first missing child featured in the milk carton campaigns of the 1980s.
When no one had seen Etan, she called police and filed a missing person's report.
Etan's case was the first of the milk carton campaigns of the mid-1980s.
In 1982 he was arrested after boys in a neighborhood in the Bronx complained that he had stolen their book bags while trying to coax them into a drainpipe under a bridge, where he lived, said the Patzes and federal prosecutor Stuart GraBois, who spent years investigating the case.
GraBois said he learned in 1988 that Ramos had  been arrested and convicted of child molestation and was serving time in a Pennsylvania prison.
When questioned further, Ramos refused to say anything more and asked for a lawyer, according to GraBois.
GraBois said he had Ramos transferred to a federal prison, and planted informants as his cell mates.
Anyone with information on the whereabouts of Etan Patz or that leads to the arrest and conviction of the individual responsible for his disappearance is asked to call the FBI/NYPD Etan Patz hotline: 212-384-2200.
