Capable of soaring leaps and flawless turns, Tetsuya "Teddy" Kumakawa has thrilled audiences the world over.
Meister encouraged him to travel and recommended that he attend the Royal Ballet School (RBS) in London or the Canadian National Ballet School.
In June he won the Classical Ballet Prize at the Eurovision Young Dancer of the Year competition held in Paris.
In 1998 he left the Royal Ballet to found his own company -- the K-Ballet -- back home in Tokyo.
The same year, the K-Ballet became the first Japanese ballet company to perform at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York.
In the meantime, Kumakawa -- who continues to enjoy pop star status in Japan -- continues to pass on his expertise to a new generation of dancers.
