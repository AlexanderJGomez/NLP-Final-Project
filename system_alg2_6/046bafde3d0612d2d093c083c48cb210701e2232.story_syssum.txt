Aides to Perry, who allowed Willingham's execution to go forward, started off with general questions about how things were going at the commission, a relatively new agency, Bassett said.
"As soon as we started discussing the Willingham investigation, the meeting got more confrontational and more difficult," Bassett said.
For Bassett, an Austin defense lawyer, it's the culmination of what he now calls a methodical campaign to shut down an investigation that might embarrass Perry.
He said Perry's office called him just days before the commission was slated to hear from the expert it hired to review the evidence in the Willingham case.
Bassett said July's opinion from Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott "provides Governor Perry with the cover he probably needs to totally squash the investigation."
The state fire marshal's office has told the Forensic Science Commission it stands by the findings in his case.
Nashed told CNN that Hurst's review of investigators' findings in the Willingham fire was also reviewed by appeals courts and the state Board of Pardons and Paroles, which rebuffed a plea for clemency.
Stephen Saloom, the group's policy director, told CNN that the investigation should go forward for the sake of hundreds of other prisoners now serving time for arson, some of whom also may have been convicted based on outdated fire science.
"The Willingham case really demonstrates how severe the consequences can be when you use bad forensic evidence," Saloom said.
