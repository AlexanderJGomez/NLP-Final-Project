She received new lungs on June 12 after a six-hour surgery that included resizing lungs from a grownup.
Sarah received lungs donated by an adult, according to Simon, meaning the lungs needed to be modified.
At that time, Sarah had been on the waiting list for new lungs for 18 months.
Doctors previously have said they believe modified adult lungs could save her life.
"So if there ... is another adult who is more severe, who has a higher lung allocation score, they will still get their lungs first."
It read: "You have the ability and authority to intervene to allow for Sarah and other children under the age of 12 to become eligible for adult organs."
Sebelius sent a letter to the OPTN the following day directing it to comply with the judge's order.
