The killing and the threat, along with all the evidence ISIS is leaving as it gouges its way across the region, are a direct challenge to the American people, to the U.S. government and to the international community.
It is important to prevent ISIS from scoring a recruiting victory among Muslims and anti-Western and anti-American camps by portraying this as a war between Islam and the West, which it is not.
ISIS is the enemy of anyone who does not belong to ISIS.
The U.S. should seek a U.N. resolution declaring that the international community, including the Muslim world, considers ISIS and its methods repugnant.
But it seems no group has advertised its bloodlust with such relish and effectiveness.
That the man who murdered him might have been British should erase any remaining fantasy in the West that this gruesome war, now raging in Syria and Iraq, will stay within any country's or any region's borders.
There have been reports of hundreds, even thousands, of Europeans training, fighting and killing alongside ISIS.
Graduates of the Syria war, from where ISIS pushed into Iraq, have killed in Europe.
It is politically and strategically complicated, because ISIS is also fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Hezbollah, and defeating ISIS would also be enormously pleasing to Iran.
That suffering has now extended to Iraq, and it will only become more widespread if ISIS is not stopped.
