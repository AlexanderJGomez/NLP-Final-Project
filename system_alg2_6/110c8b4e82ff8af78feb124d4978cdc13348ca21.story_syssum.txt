Pauley had been leading an 18-strong patrol of the United States First Armored Division in the city of Tal Afar when he was hit by the blast.
Private First Class Jody Missildine of Plant City, Florida, just 19 years of age, had died that day, April 8, 2006 and Pauley blamed himself.
"I battled three or four years of just helplessness, anxiety and depression, until I was introduced to the Wounded Warriors Project," Pauley says.
Like Pauley, his army days were over and with discharge came the same sense of helplessness and loss.
Pauley had also dabbled with the game before his life-changing incident and, like Lara, has found some inner peace while walking the 18 holes of his local courses in northern California.
"We've hit a chord within the golfing community," Hill tells CNN.
Missildine's family invited Pauley to visit and pay his respects, something he had been unable to do in 2006 because he was in hospital recovering from his injuries.
Lara, who works full-time for Wounded Warriors, will perform similar speaking duties at 1757 Golf Club in Dulles, Virginia before showing off his golfing skills.
"It's broken down the some of the barriers to people who want to play golf, particularly women, who are worried about too many rules and too much protocol," Hill says.
"It's a great way to raise money and awareness for the Warriors, " Lara says.
