Republican House Speaker John Boehner informed President Barack Obama that he would not bring a vote on immigration reform to the floor this year.
Then, Republican leadership announced they wouldn't move on immigration reform unless the majority of the Republican caucus supported it, even though the votes were there to pass reform and poll after poll showed the majority of the American people support reforming our immigration system.
A week later Republicans said they couldn't move on immigration reform because they couldn't trust the President to enforce the law.
Never mind that the Senate bill the GOP refused to bring up for a vote in the House would have doubled the amount of agents on the border to 40,000 and provided an extra $38 billion dollars to increase border security.
No more.
The American people and the immigrant community support reform, and want brave leaders who are willing to fight for them and do the hard work.
Mr. President, America is behind you on this every step of the way.
