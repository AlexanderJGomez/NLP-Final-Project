I don't know if Hillary Clinton is going to run again.
I think we are well positioned to do that.
A: No.
When it comes to money are there concerns that you won't have the cash to do what you need to do and how will you retire that debt?
We are going to have what we need to accomplish our goals this cycle, but we're still working to retire that debt and Democrats can help us out by going to Democrats.Org and giving what they can.
And I think there are a lot of places where we can do that.
There are going to be a lot of competitive races where we can pick up seats, we think.
A: This has nothing to do with Hillary Clinton.
That's why I'm over here.
We've got a lot of important races in 2014.
