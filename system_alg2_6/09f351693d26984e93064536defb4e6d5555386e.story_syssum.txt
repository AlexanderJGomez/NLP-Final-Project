A woman in Argentina says the pope called her Monday and told her she could receive Communion, despite being married to a divorced man, reports say.
The Catholic Church officially teaches that marriage is for life and that couples who divorce are still married in the eyes of the church unless they receive an annulment -- a process that literally nullifies the first marriage.
On the other hand, more liberal Catholics are hopeful, given speculation that pastoral practices toward divorced and remarried Catholics may change after a worldwide meeting of bishops in October.
Even if he is the pope, such a private conversation does not automatically change centuries of church teaching, as the most recent Vatican statement points out.
It's too early to tell if this is the pope's way of asserting his position on a possible change in pastoral practice or even church teaching.
