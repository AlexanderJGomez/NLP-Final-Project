The indictment charges Portillo with embezzling tens of millions of dollars in public funds, "a portion of which he then laundered through bank accounts located, among other places, in the United States and Europe," the indictment says.
That money was eventually laundered into his family's accounts in Europe, the court document states.
Some of the money that Portillo took went to buy expensive watches and cars, the indictment says.
