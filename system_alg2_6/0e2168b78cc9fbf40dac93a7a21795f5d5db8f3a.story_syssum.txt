That's how Utah County Sheriff Jim Tracy described a high-speed, bullet-riddled rampage that went on for 50 miles across two counties, until officers were able to corner a suspect.
"He was helping people when he stopped."
The suspect shot Wride, while he was still in his squad car, with what "appears to be a high-powered rifle," Tracy said.
Seconds later, the officer was shot in his vehicle, wounded in the head, Tracy said.
He later crashed it, too, Tracy said.
Wride's killing to his family.
