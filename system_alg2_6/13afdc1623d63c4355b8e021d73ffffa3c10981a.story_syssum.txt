(CNN) -- The mother of a 25-year-old woman killed in a Boston hotel more than a week ago said Friday that she will remain haunted by her daughter's death for the rest of her life.
They say Markoff may have met her through the online site.
Markoff is also charged in connection with the April 10 robbery of Trisha Leffler, 29, at a Westin Hotel in Boston.
McAllister said Markoff "is the wrong man" and "was set up."
Authorities believe the motive in Brisman's death was robbery, Conley told reporters.
He said the incident "may be related to similar crimes occurring in the Boston area" but that had not been determined.
