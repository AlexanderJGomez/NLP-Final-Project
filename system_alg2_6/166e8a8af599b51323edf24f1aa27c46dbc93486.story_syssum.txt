New York (CNN) -- Jazz master Wynton Marsalis says the blues is the true American music -- the heartbeat and unifying principle of jazz, country, R&B, gospel and other styles -- but it's been relegated to the back of the bus by greed and the legacy of racism.
Marsalis says that's because of racism -- it was the music of a whole people granted only secondary status -- and its inability to make a lot of money.
WYNTON MARSALIS: The blues.
It's in New Orleans music, it's in jazz, it's in country music, it's in gospel.
It's like in cuisine, that would be like fried chicken and red beans and rice, it would be like potato salad and barbecued ribs.
MARSALIS: It came from who we didn't like.
So black people didn't appreciate it?
That's a long time.
...
But the blues is not only Afro-American music.
MARSALIS: It is America.
That's how the blues is, that's why it fits with everything, country-western, bluegrass -- everybody's playing the same music.
And that's the main thing our music, and the history of our music, can teach us as a nation.
From him.
We'd go to our gig, there'd be thousands of people, dancing having a good time.
I'd bring people to see him.
MARSALIS: The main three components are the blues, improvisation -- which is some kind of element that people are trying to make it up -- and swing, which means even though they're making up music, they're trying to make it up together.
