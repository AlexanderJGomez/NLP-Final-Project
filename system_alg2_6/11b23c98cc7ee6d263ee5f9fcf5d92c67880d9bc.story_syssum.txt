The driver and four members of the bachelorette party got out, but the bride -- identified by a relative as 31-year-old Neriza Fojas -- and four others died in the burning limo Saturday night, the California Highway Patrol said.
The driver was uninjured, but the four surviving women were treated for smoke inhalation, California Highway Patrol spokesman Ron Simmons said Sunday.
The Fresno woman was slated to be married in June, and she and her friends had hired the Lincoln for her bachelorette party, Nicolas said.
