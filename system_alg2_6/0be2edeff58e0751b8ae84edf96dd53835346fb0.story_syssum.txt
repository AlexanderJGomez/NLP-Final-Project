After launching a campaign to clean up "rampant online rumors," Chinese authorities in late March ordered the country's leading micro-blogging sites -- including Sina Weibo -- to disable their comment function for three days.
One of the two, a young man who declined to give his name, said: "It was all over Weibo for a while before the topic was censored."
Then people tried Abing, the famous early 20th Century Chinese musician who was also blind.
One of the tags for the video was "Chen Guangcheng."
By Monday afternoon, "StevenCNN" -- my Weibo name -- has become a banned search term.
