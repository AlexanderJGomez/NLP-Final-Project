Prajapati's invention is part of a growing trend in India that has become known as "frugal innovation" -- below-the-radar inventors across the country devising low-cost solutions to local problems, often borne of necessity, using bespoke technologies of their own creation.
At the forefront of the frugal innovation movement is Professor Anil Gupta who, for the last 20 years, has been travelling across India in search of local inventors whose creativity has had a positive impact on rural poverty.
Kirsten Bound, the author of Nesta's report, says "frugal innovation is all about creating advantage out of constraint.
In a bid to reduce the work involved, Patel invented a cotton-stripping machine that can be operated by one person.
"Frugal innovation coming out of India could have important implications for the rest of the world" says Bound.
It looked like a regular bike, but had large retractable floats attached to the sides of each wheel.
Gupta says there is work to be done yet in connecting creative people with funding, and not all of it can come from the public purse.
