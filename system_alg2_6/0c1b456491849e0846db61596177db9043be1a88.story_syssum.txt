Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Fighting continued Monday as rival Libyan militias battled for Tripoli International Airport and the interim government said it was considering asking for international military help.
While Libyan officials have called for calm, the government is weak and militias outnumber and outgun its security forces.
The government said the customs building, maintenance building and some national security department planes had been destroyed.
The United Nations, which stood by the Libyan people in their revolution in 2011, will not abandon them as they seek to build a democratic state."
Other militias have tried to wrest control of the airport from the Zintan brigades for years.
The U.S. State Department said this past weekend it was concerned the fighting could lead to widespread conflict and backed the new government.
