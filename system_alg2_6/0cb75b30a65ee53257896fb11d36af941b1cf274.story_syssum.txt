"And I think that understanding the history of the Confederacy and understanding the history of the Civil War is something that every American and every young American should be part of."

We Americans -- from native Americans to those who have ancestors who wore the blue or gray to those who are descended from slaves to those who have recently come to our shores -- want to know ourselves.
And to know the Civil War, we must know and understand the Confederacy -- in all of its diversity.
