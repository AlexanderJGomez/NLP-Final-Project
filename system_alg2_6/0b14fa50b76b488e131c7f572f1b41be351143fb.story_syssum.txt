The franchise came out of part two with a little credibility intact, but this last installment -- unless you include "The Next Karate Kid" (which no self-respecting "Karate Kid" fan would) -- managed to kill off our last shred of enthusiasm.
The first "Under Siege" was a surprisingly good film, and Hollywood's best martial arts expert acquits himself well, but this follow up is laughable.
This tacky movie features fight scenes shot before Lee died, interspersed with material filmed using lookalikes and a cardboard cutout of the great man.
