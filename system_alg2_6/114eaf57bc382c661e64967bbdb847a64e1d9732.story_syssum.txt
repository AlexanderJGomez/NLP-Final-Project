Most recently, two police officers died as a result of attacks with petrol bombs and a homemade bomb, the IAA said.
Violent clashes have broken out between security forces and opposition protesters on numerous occasions since protests began in the Persian Gulf kingdom in February 2011, spurred by uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt.
The ministry said the protests were a continuation of those held in February and March of last year that it said called for the overthrow of leading figures and the state.
Last November, Bahrain's Independent Commission of Inquiry issued a report critical of authorities' reactions to the protests.
