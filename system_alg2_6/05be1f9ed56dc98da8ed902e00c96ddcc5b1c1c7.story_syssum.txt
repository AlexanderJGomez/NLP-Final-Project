Clearwater, Florida (CNN) -- After another marathon session of questioning about everything from their news-watching habits to criminal records, the Florida jury that could decide Casey Anthony's fate started rounding into shape Friday.
Once there are 12 jurors, Perry will ask the defense and prosecution teams if they want to use their preemptory challenges -- allowing them, at the judge's discretion, to disqualify certain men or women from the jury pool.
That would be followed by testimony by investigators, experts and others involved in the case -- including Casey Anthony's father, mother and brother, who have testified in pretrial hearings.
Casey Anthony made allegations of sex abuse against her father and brother in a letter from jail last year.
Casey Anthony has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
