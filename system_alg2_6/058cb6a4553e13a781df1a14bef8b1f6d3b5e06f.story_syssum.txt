Radamel Falcao Garcia Zarate, Falcao for short, is a Colombian soccer star.
United is yet to win this season and recently suffered a humiliating 4-0 defeat to third division team MK Dons in the League Cup.
In his absence, James (pronounced "Ham-ez") Rodriguez scored six goals as Colombia swaggered its way into the last eight before defeat to hosts Brazil.
A new star was born, and Rodriguez is now strutting his stuff at Real Madrid having also left Monaco.
He's a big guy...
Monaco did qualify for the Champions League, even if Falcao missed most of last season through injury.
The Manchester club isn't in Europe after an awful season under Alex Ferguson's successor David Moyes, who was subsequently sacked.
