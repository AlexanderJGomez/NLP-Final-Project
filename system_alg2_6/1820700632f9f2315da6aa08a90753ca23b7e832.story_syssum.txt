Los Angeles (CNN) -- Legendary fitness pioneer Jack LaLanne saved millions of lives by teaching people to eat right and exercise regularly, Arnold Schwarzenegger said in his eulogy for LaLanne on Tuesday.
He had self-esteem.
"Jack is now in heaven and, of course, that's going to be very annoying for a lot of people up there," Schwarzenegger said.
People doubted what LaLanne was promoting in his early years, he said.
Schwarzenegger said he first met LaLanne soon after he moved to Venice Beach, California, as a young bodybuilder.
"'This guy's a monster, he just keeps going and going and going with the exercising.'"
