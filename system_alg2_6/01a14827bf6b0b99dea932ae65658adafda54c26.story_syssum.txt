Alice Schroeder says investor Warren Buffett has become a symbol of stability in American business.
Alice Schroeder got Buffett's cooperation in writing her new book, "The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life" (Bantam Books).
Schroeder: I think he's transcended business to become a national figure because of people's trust in him as a symbol of stability and a symbol of someone who knows how to manage risk and avoid catastrophe and of how to run a business on principles.
What he really likes to do is run Berkshire Hathaway, and he's not going to let anything take him away from that.
...
He always says, don't sell into a panic, don't let the fear and the emotions of the market change how you feel.
...
Schroeder: He is somebody who can be very tough in business and very impersonal, including with people he likes.
The book refers to him, in my words, as a great white shark, and the book describes the battle between his avarice and his higher principles.
He was criticizing Wall Street and saying if you want to make a lot of money, hold your nose and go to Wall Street, and at the same time he was already there.
Schroeder: You've got an economy in which financial intermediaries who don't add anything to the economy ... have in the past two decades stripped off huge amounts of fees, particularly buyout funds, and hedge funds and funds of funds, and he's very, very critical of the amount of fees that have been taken out.
So they're getting paid these huge amounts of money as an incentive to stay and then they get paid the consolation prize when they get fired.
Think about what could go wrong.
