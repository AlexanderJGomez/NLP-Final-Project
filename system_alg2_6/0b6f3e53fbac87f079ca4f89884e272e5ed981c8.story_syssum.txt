Tenzin is the ninth Tibetan -- all monks or former monks -- to commit self-immolation in protest against Chinese rule since March, the advocacy group said.
Activists say the disturbing acts reflect an increasingly repressive environment under Beijing's control.
Another incident in Aba in March, in which a monk died, sparked weeks of often violent confrontation between local monks and authorities.
The Dalai Lama denies seeking independence for Tibet, saying he wants genuine autonomy, under which Tibetans can make their own policies on key issues, such as religious practices.
