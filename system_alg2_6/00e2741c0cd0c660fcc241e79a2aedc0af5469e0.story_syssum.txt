Britain's Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, is going back to work, taking on a new role as an air ambulance pilot.
"He regards his work with the RAF search and rescue force as having been an exceptional privilege and the Duke wanted to make his own contribution to the outstanding work of the air ambulance service."
There's also the risk of additional hoax calls.
William will spend the autumn and winter in training with the East Anglian Air Ambulance and, once qualified, will start co-piloting in the spring of next year.
The Duke will also continue his work with his patronages and with the Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry."
This job will allow him to balance both positions whilst having his young family close-by.
