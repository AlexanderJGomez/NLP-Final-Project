(CNN) -- The Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries has tagged two great white sharks off Cape Cod in an area where shark sightings have been reported, state officials said Sunday.
Chatham's beaches were closed to swimmers after the sightings, Skomal said.
Skomal identified a great white shark on Friday, and then the two were tagged Saturday.
