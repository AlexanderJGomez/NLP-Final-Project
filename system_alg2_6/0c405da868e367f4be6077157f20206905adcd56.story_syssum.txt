Before I became a father, I struggled to find advice that really spoke to me, and I hope that the following bits of wisdom speak to other American dads, men who really want to be the best they can be.
My son, still inside her, was slipping away from us.
After they clipped the cord and I said the call to prayer in his ear, we brought him around the curtain to his mother.
Are they sure they know what they are doing?"
But how do we do this?
Getting married was step one.
Constantly strengthening our own sense of faith as he watches is step three.
I have to nurture and bring out the best in him.
Third, my son was born intelligent, as a whole human being, with the ability to express and understand human emotion.
Right now, my son is sleeping.
And we will do the best we know how, praying all along that it is enough.
