(CNN)Just over a month ago, Kamron Taylor sat in an Illinois courtroom to hear a jury convict him of murder.
Looking for Taylor is job No.
No.
The guard was left on the jail floor, going in and out of consciousness, for about 35 minutes before authorities -- concerned because the guard hadn't responded to calls -- found him, the sheriff said.
Taylor walked out the door and into the detention center's parking lot, where, authorities said, he clicked the correctional officer's key fob to find the Chevy Equinox.
The fact that he tried to get away once before and has been involved in fights "raises an alert, I guess," the Kankakee County sheriff said.
