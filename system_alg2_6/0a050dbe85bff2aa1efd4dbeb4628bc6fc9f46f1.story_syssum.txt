Cooper took up the "Fusion Journey" challenge to travel from New Zealand to New Delhi, India's capital.
There she was tasked with creating a new fashion line that would combine her own sophisticated modern style with the vibrant, brightly colored traditions of Indian dress-making.
From one village to the next you find whole families, generations, that have their own specialties of stitch work.
However, I think this was the first time I've traveled to India with a conscious intention to create a fusion of styles: their own traditional dress with my more modern, western creations.
In fact, when it comes to bold use of colors and the use of these rich, deep dyes, how can anyone deny the huge influence of India on fashion around the world?
However, what I took back to New Zealand, was their techniques, their intense celebratory colors, their detailed embellishments, their expert use of beads and sequins.
But I'll only know I have finished the creative process when someone comes in and says that, no matter what, they have to have it.
