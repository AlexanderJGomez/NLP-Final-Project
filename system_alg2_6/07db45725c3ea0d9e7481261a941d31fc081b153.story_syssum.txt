(CNN) -- No one may ever know for sure whether Ohio's execution of Dennis McGuire -- in a procedure during which he reportedly gasped, snorted and struggled -- was inhumane, but his family and medical and legal experts said Friday the ordeal points out fundamental flaws in the use of lethal injection.
He said the family plans to file a lawsuit next week in federal court seeking an injunction against the state's use of the drug combination, alleging that it represents cruel and unusual punishment and, as such, violates the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution.
Douglas Berman, a professor at The Ohio State University and the Moritz College of Law, said in a telephone interview that such a suit would be "groundbreaking."
"What happened to Dennis McGuire is consistent with what a number of prominent medical experts said would happen," she said.
"Ohio will have to review this new procedure they've put in place," said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, about the drug combination that was used for the first time on McGuire.
And then that's all."
The problem had nothing to do with what drugs may have been used and everything to do with how they were used.
The compounds used by Ohio are in short supply, and their diversion from use in treating people to use in execution is questionable, he said.
But lethal injection is called for by all 32 states that have the death penalty.
