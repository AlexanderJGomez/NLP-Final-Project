Guy Heinze Jr. faces eight counts of first-degree murder in last month's killings in a Georgia mobile home.
The elder Heinze told relatives about the award days before his death, family members said.
Police also are aware of it, Glynn County Police Chief Matt Doering said, but he declined comment on whether it is being explored as a possible motive in the slayings.
An arrest warrant said he provided police "with false and misleading information about his whereabouts and involvement in the circumstances leading to him calling 911 to report the deaths of his family members" and that he removed a shotgun from the mobile home and hid it in his car.
Family members said he was on his way to attend the visitation for the victims but was arrested before arriving.
"We want to know what really happened," he said.
