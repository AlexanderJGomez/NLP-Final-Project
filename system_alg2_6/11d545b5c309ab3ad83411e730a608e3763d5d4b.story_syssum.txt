Modern motherhood is a cultural invention, I argued, not biological destiny.
After all, the women's movement was still relatively young, and I was mothering during the height of the Mommy Wars.
Why?
Maternal employment continues to pose a threat to our strongly held belief about motherhood -- it is natural for mothers, not fathers, to have primary responsibility for raising children.
When women are pregnant, people ask them, but not the fathers of their children, whether they plan to return to work.
The cost to women is great in lost opportunity.
By encouraging women to "lean in," some, such as Slaughter, say Sandberg is placing undue burden on individual women.
Only then will we change our culture.
