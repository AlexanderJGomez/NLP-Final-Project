New York (CNN) -- New York City will pay  more than $7 million to settle a civil lawsuit brought by the estate of a man killed by police outside a Queens' nightclub in 2006 and by his two friends, who were seriously wounded, a spokeswoman for the city's Law Department said Tuesday.
Bell, 23, was  African-American, as were the two men wounded and two of the three police  officers.
Citing insufficient  evidence, the Department of Justice announced in February that it would not  pursue federal civil rights charges against police officers involved.
"We will always pursue justice for the family of Sean Bell, Joseph Guzman  and Trent Benefield."
