Debbie Rowe said she married Michael Jackson to avoid the taboo of having childrien out of wedlock.
"Debbie's a very caring, wonderful, warm person," said Marc Schaffel, who met first met Rowe when he worked for Jackson.
'Let me do this.
I want to do this.
Rowe gave up parental rights to Jackson in 2001, but she changed her mind more than two years later and sought temporary custody of the children.
"It's not that they're not my children, but I had them because I wanted him to be a father," she said.
"She spends time with all of her horses and her dogs," Schaffel said.
Debbie is just as happy at home in her very modest, humble, horse ranch."
One letter sent Tuesday demanded the New York Post retract its report that Rowe had agreed to drop her custody claims for $4 million.
Rowe also filed a lawsuit this week against a woman who claimed in a TV interview to have e-mails from Rowe saying she didn't really want to raise the children.
