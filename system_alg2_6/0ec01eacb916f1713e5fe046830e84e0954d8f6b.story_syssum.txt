Tanaka, son of a Japanese salaryman, launched Gree initially as a social network in Japan before moving into mobile social gaming.
I think we (Gree) can change society in that way too, so I want to continue making a challenge.
Originally there were many Japanese game companies like Nintendo which became successful globally.
In that sense we can do our business without having the disadvantage of being on an island, so I think it is a good industry for Japan.
Not just our company but the whole of Japan should consider developing an industry like that.
