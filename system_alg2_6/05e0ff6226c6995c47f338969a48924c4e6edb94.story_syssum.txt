This month, Saudi officials said airstrikes have degraded Houthi-controlled military infrastructure, including key buildings in the capital Sanaa.
A senior Saudi official told CNN that the Houthis agreed to "nearly all demands" of the U.N. Security Council.
"We promise to restructure the Yemen military to ensure that it serves the people of Yemen," Hadi said, calling on the Houthis to withdraw, and saying that he would return to Yemen at "the right time" to rebuild the country.
Also Tuesday, a U.S. military official told CNN that the United States is conducting "manned reconnaissance" off Yemen.
