By early Saturday, police were nowhere to be seen in the capital of Cairo, with military forces deployed on streets all around the nation for the first time in more than three decades.
"We haven't seen this many people on the streets at the same time."
Mohammed Mansour, a resident of the Shubra neighborhood of Cairo, said that he and fellow demonstrators had been "beaten and assaulted by police" since Monday, when the popular unrest began.
In Cairo and Alexandria, many protesters greeted troops with embraces and cheers, some even shaking hands with soldiers.
"If the army comes out, that means the government ... is no longer in control."
"We are one of the richest Arab countries, and we want to live," said a 20-year-old student named Mohammed, whose last name was withheld to protect his identity, from Alexandria.
There, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali left the country after 23 years in power following weeks of demonstrations against his rule.
