No shape more aptly fits the diamond nickname "ice" than the emerald, a rectangular cut with lean facets extending down the sides.
A square with diagonally cropped corners and stepped sides, it features a high crown and sheds a gentle light.
The long shape is especially flattering.
This rectangular stone, introduced in the seventies, lives up to its name: By combining long, lean, step-cut and triangular facets, it refracts lots of light.
Most diamonds have a flat top with facets on the edges and bottom, but a rose-cut diamond is domed and covered with facets.
