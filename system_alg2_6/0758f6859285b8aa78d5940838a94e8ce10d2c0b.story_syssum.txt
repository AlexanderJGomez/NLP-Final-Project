(CNN) -- A month before Delvin Barnes grabbed a woman off a street in Philadelphia, he hit a teen with a shovel in Virginia and stuffed her into the trunk of a car, authorities say.
Like in Philadelphia, the abduction in Virginia was brazen.
She was taken to the home of the suspect's parents in Charles City County, where she was sexually abused, authorities said.
While there, the suspect showed the teen pictures of other girls he said he had abducted, authorities said.
The mother says Barnes allegedly told her daughter that he was going to kill her.
Then her abductor pounced.
(It) really was horrific to watch it unfold," Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said.
A day after the kidnapping, the suspect allegedly used her ATM card at a machine in Aberdeen, Maryland.
Barnes was told the device was in the car, Schwartz said.
As for Barnes, he now sits at the Riverside Regional Jail in Prince George, Virginia, just over the James River from Charles City County.
