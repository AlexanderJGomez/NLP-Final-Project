We don't know how many are responsible, we don't know motive, if any, and we don't know whether it's domestic or foreign.

We do not need the president to say the word to feel it.
But then again, is our paranoia that irrational if something as celebratory as the Boston Marathon is no longer a safe place to be?
So while Obama telling the American people those responsible will "feel the full weight of justice," we are haunted by the fact that "justice" won't bring the victims back.
If April 15, 2013, was the day the Boston Marathon became a target for terrorism, then September 11, 2001, was the day we all were warned that it would be.
Nothing will be the same.
