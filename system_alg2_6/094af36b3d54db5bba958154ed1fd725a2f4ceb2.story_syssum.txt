Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- Tunisia's interim president and prime minister resigned from the ousted leader's ruling party, state TV said Tuesday, a move seen as a gesture to placate angry street demonstrators and keep the unity government afloat.
The union's administrative committee, which met Tuesday in a Tunisian suburb, decided not to accept any government that has officials from the old regime and called for demonstrations against the ruling party.
Many of the injured were police officers, according to the country's interior minister.
Ghannouchi -- who said the military didn't shoot people -- emphasized that he never gave any order for police to shoot people and only allowed tear gas and rubber bullets.
The new government will be tasked with leading Tunisia toward new elections, he said.
"There are still a couple of demonstrations because people are against the fact that older members of the political party (will remain) in power," she said.
Unlike the previous two days, no demonstrations had taken place in Sfax Tuesday, the report said.
"The United Nations stands ready to provide assistance to the Tunisian people," he said.
