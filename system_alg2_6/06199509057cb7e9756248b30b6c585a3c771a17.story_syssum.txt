BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Hurricane Bill spun northward toward the New England coast Saturday with wind and rain as officials warned beach lovers to head indoors for the night.
Bill's sustained winds remained at 100 mph, with higher gusts.
The core of the storm should pass New England offshore Saturday night, and approach Nova Scotia on Sunday.
The hurricane itself is predicted to stay offshore, the hurricane center said.
Patrick said advisories will be posted, and beaches on the cape were closed.
Hurricane Bill skirted Bermuda, leaving rain in its wake.
A tropical storm warning means tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area within 24 hours.
