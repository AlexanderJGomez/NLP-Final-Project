Los Angeles Police Detective Orlando Martinez testified in the Jackson wrongful death trial that Murray was trying to deal with the large drop in value of his Las Vegas home, unpaid taxes and child support payments for eight children with seven women.
"Seeing the scene and talking to him about what he had done and how he did it raised questions."
The judge ordered that only one of Michael Jackson's brothers and sisters can come to court to watch the testimony at at a time -- and then only if Jackson family matriarch Katherine Jackson is present.
The defense lawyers asked that Randy Jackson, the only one attending the trial Tuesday with his 82-year-old mother, be booted from court.
"No, no, this just happened," Murray told him, Senneff said.
Panish even asked Senneff whether he had ever rescued a cat.
His ambulance was called to a west Los Angeles apartment to help an elderly Russian woman, Senneff said.
Martinez will return to court Wednesday to resume his testimony, but the trial will break early so a juror can attend a funeral in the afternoon.
