KEY WEST, Florida (CNN)  -- The USNS General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, a retired U.S. Navy warship, embarked on a sedentary new career Wednesday on the floor of the Gulf of Mexico.
About 300 boats positioned themselves as close as possible to the site, and cheers went up when the Vandenberg slipped beneath the water seven miles south of Key West, the spokesman said.
To sink the Vandenberg, holes were made above the waterline in the side of the ship and throughout various decks, Newman said.
During the 1950s the ship was used to transport refugees from Europe and Australia to America.
In the 1960s the Air Force used the Vandenberg to track missiles.
The largest ship ever scuttled to create an artificial reef was the decommissioned aircraft carrier USS Oriskany, which sank to the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico off the Florida coast in 2006, according to the U.S. Navy.
It sank in water about 212 feet deep.
