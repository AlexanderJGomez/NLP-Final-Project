The Spanish star scored two magnificent first half goals to seal three points for Roy Hodgson's men.
Hodgson, who was under pressure before his side's improvement since New England Sports Ventures took control of the club, was delighted to see Torres back to his best.
It was the third straight win for improving Newcastle, who were rarely troubled by a labored Arsenal side.
Italian striker Mario Balotelli scored both City's goals in the first half, but blotted his copybook by being sent off after the break.
