Police were offering few details Wednesday of the robbery at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. Detectives on the scene were carrying out a "slow and painstaking" forensic examination, police said in a statement.
Hatton Garden is a storied area in London and the heart of the city's diamond trade.
But how?
Many of those who rent safe deposit boxes at the company are reportedly in the jewelry trade.
