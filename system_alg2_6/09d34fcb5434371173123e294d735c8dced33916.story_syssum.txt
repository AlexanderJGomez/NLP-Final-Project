Rick Perry again asserted his innocence in the felony abuse-of-power case against him Wednesday and pledged to fight the charges, despite a Texas judge's refusal to dismiss the case this week.
The Texas governor is openly preparing for another presidential bid, and though the indictment was then seen as a possible impediment to his candidacy, he continued his travel to early primary states, and in fact drew widespread support from Republicans when the indictment was reported.
"We're moving right along as we have intended to" with those plans, he said, and hinted that he may already have his mind made up on whether to go forward with another bid.
