"The brothel where I was ... there [were] many customers coming in every day.
By raiding brothels, patrolling the India-Nepal border and providing safe shelter and support services, Koirala and Maiti Nepal have helped rescue and rehabilitate more than 12,000 Nepali women and girls since 1993.
According to the U.S. State Department, some 10,000 to 15,000 women and girls from Nepal are trafficked to India and then sexually exploited each year.
Maiti Nepal was her brainchild for giving voice, legal defense and rehabilitation to victims of sex trafficking.
The group has facilities throughout Nepal and India, but most of the rehabilitation work takes place at its main campus in Kathmandu, Nepal.
Many of the staff are sex trafficking survivors now committed to helping rehabilitate other girls.
For these girls, Maiti Nepal becomes their new, and possibly last, home.
People even forget [she is] HIV-positive or was trafficked," Koirala said.
They easily recognize a girl that is being trafficked or will be trafficked," Koirala said.
She credits Koirala and Maiti Nepal for the strength to keep living and the confidence to join the fight against sex trafficking.
