The mysterious tunnel measured more than 6 feet in height, nearly 3 feet in width and about 33 feet in length, Toronto Police Deputy Chief Mark Saunders told reporters Tuesday.
"I wasn't overly concerned that 'Oh my goodness this is going to be something horrific,' " said Saunders, a 31-year veteran overseeing security of the world's third largest international multi-sport games.
"There is nothing right now that suggest that this is criminal," he said.
"This was built with a considerable amount of sophistication," Saunders said.
"We don't know whether someone is building one somewhere else," Saunders said.
