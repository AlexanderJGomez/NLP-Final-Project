In the Richmond case, the victim escaped from captivity in 2012 with help from a relative, who brought her to police, Richmond Police Chief Chris Magnus said in a letter to the city council, confirming a local newspaper account this week of the crime.
"I want to make you aware of a horrific case (initially dealt with in the summer of 2012) involving long-term sexual abuse of a developmentally-disabled individual by a very close family member that took place in our city," the chief wrote in a Thursday e-mail to the council.
At the time, she was visiting Ochoa in his family's home, according to CNN affiliate KGO and authorities.
Police arrested Ochoa after having the victim place a phone call to him, Hill said.
One neighbor told KGO that she always sensed something was not right at the Ochoa house.
No one has the right to do this to a person."
Ochoa, who pleaded guilty to one count of forced lewd acts on a child and two counts of forcible rape, is now being held on $30 million bond, according to a detention facility in Contra Costa County.
