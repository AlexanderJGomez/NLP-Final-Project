TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- When Japanese police arrested three sumo wrestlers and their stable master on Thursday over allegations they beat a 17-year-old wrestler to death, the case sent shockwaves across a country that links its national identity to the sport.
Police say on June 25, Yamamoto instructed the wrestlers to beat the boy using sticks and a metal bat.
The results of an autopsy conducted last year by Niigata University concluded that Saito died of shock caused by multiple injuries.
The Sumo Association says it will look at how young sumo are hazed, a process that often batters them to toughen them up.
