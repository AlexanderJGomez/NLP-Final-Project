The main "downs" of buying a used car are that it's a used car, not new -- so there's no new car warranty and you are more vulnerable to used car problems that could cost you money, as well as aggravation.
CPO used cars are usually clean and well-maintained -- the "cream puffs" of the used car market.
Have a third-party mechanic (not one working for the dealer) look the used car over as a condition of sale.
If the used car records are not available, you should be suspicious.

Lexus LS400/LS430 -- New, these large rear-drive, V-8 powered luxury sedans cost tens of thousands less than an equivalent Mercedes-Benz, BMW or Jaguar.
Acura RL -- A conservatively elegant large luxury car that, like the Lexus LS, enjoys a reputation for absolutely superb engineering and quality.
These are also the only late model sedans that offer standard V-8 power and rear-wheel-drive in a full-size chassis for the price of a V-6 powered, front-drive, midsize sedan.
Excellent used car resale value and top of its class occupant protection are additional reasons to consider an Odyssey.
Toyota Sienna -- Another Toyota product that's got an established track record for high quality and a low incidence of significant problems, defect or recalls.
