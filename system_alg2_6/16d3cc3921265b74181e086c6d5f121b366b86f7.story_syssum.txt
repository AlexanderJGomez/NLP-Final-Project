Paris (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday that Saudi Arabia will support military intervention in Syria by the United States and its partners.
"As we discussed today, all of us agreed -- not one dissenter -- that (Syrian President Bashar) al-Assad's deplorable use of chemical weapons -- which we know killed hundreds of innocent people, including at least 426 children on this occasion, this one occasion -- this crosses an international, global red line," he said.
Al-Assad on Sunday denied again he had anything to do with the use of chemical agents, U.S. journalist Charlie Rose reported.
Videos that purport to show the results of a chemical weapons attack are part of a White House campaign to inform Congress about the nature of the incident, Kerry said.
He said a vast majority of the members are undecided as to how they will vote on authorizing force against Syria.
Obama met with his Russian counterpart, President Vladimir Putin, on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg summit Friday.
