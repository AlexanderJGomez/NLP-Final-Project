WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A national poll suggests that nearly three-quarters of all Americans support the plan to withdraw most U.S. combat troops from Iraqi cities and towns, even though most respondents said they think the troop movements will lead to an increase in violence in that country.
Seventy-three percent of Americans questioned in the poll favor the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Iraqi cities and towns, with 26 percent opposed.
The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.
The latest deaths happened Monday when four U.S. soldiers serving in Baghdad died of combat-related injuries.
