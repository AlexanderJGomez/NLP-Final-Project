He said that when his daughter returned the gas cans to him, there was no tape on them.
Morales testified that the two continued their friendship after breaking up, to the point that Anthony stayed overnight at his house June 9 and 10, 2008.
At no time did she mention that her daughter was missing or had been kidnapped, he testified, and he saw no change in her demeanor.
Morales was one of numerous people, including Lazzaro, his roommates and other acquaintances, who said Anthony did not mention Caylee's disappearance between June 16, 2008, the day the little girl was last seen, until the evening of July 15, when Anthony's mother, Cindy, reported her missing to authorities.
England also testified that Anthony received a call and told some other friends that she had car trouble and couldn't go out with them.
Anthony told him "she was in Sanford on a playdate with one of her girlfriends who also had a child."
George Anthony testified Thursday that he owns several shovels.
