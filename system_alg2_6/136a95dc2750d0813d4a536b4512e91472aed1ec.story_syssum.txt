The Malaysian-registered tanker Zafirah was exactly the kind of ship pirates love.
Fortunately for the owners and crew of the Zafirah, good regional cooperation and information sharing led to the rescue of the crew and, after a 50-minute stand off with Vietnam's Marine Police, the recovery of the vessel and the arrest of the pirates.
According to the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP) -- an information sharing center set up under a regional Asian agreement to combat piracy -- the high price of oil has been behind at least four pirate attacks in 2011 and 2012 where diesel or MGO fuel was siphoned.
Some ships operating in Somali waters have even resorted to 'citadels'; safe rooms where the crew can barricade themselves into a ship that has already been boarded by pirates.
According to statistics from the International Chamber of Commerce International Maritime Bureau, there have been 22 attacks in 2013 of which nine took place in waters around South East Asia.
