One of Mexico's most notorious accused drug lords, Edgar "La Barbie" Valdez Villarreal, was also indicted in the case Tuesday, but authorities did not specify the connection between him and the military officials.
"While the army is in the streets, when there are these kinds of topics that are very sensitive coming up, it seems to me that we must look at this process with all the transparency in the world so that there aren't any doubts about the fair trial that everyone deserves, including the generals," Sen. Ruben Camarillo of the conservative National Action Party told Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency.
Angeles' attorney, Ricardo Sanchez, told CNNMexico.com that the former defense official had been expecting the charges and welcomed the opportunity to defend his innocence in a trial.
