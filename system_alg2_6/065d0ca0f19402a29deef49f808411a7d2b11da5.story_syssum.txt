The number of people arrested in London since the violence began has risen to 334, police said Tuesday.
People already in the city centre should leave the area and go home," Bristol police said in a statement early Tuesday.
In Lewisham in south London, a car was set afire.
There was no obvious sign of violence at the station but a policewoman told CNN it was not safe for people to go near the station.
Saturday's riots occurred after the shooting death Thursday of Mark Duggan, a black man, as he was seated inside a cab.
The man's family and friends, who blamed police for the death, gathered Saturday night outside the Tottenham police station to protest.
Looting also occurred in pockets of Enfield, next to Tottenham, in north London.
"This is not about the black community and the police, it's about young people and the police," said Shaun Bailey, a youth worker, in a statement circulated by the mayor's office.
The Labour MP for Tottenham told a reporter in March that Tottenham could become a scene of violence as cuts to social-service programs for youths were implemented.
Police say they have evidence that some of the rioting was coordinated using social media, including Twitter.
Like the current violence, a protest outside Tottenham Police Station sparked the 1985 conflict.
