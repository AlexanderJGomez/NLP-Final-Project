One month before the Winter Olympics begin in the Russian resort town of Sochi -- and in the shadow of last month's deadly bombings in Volgograd -- a huge security operation has swung into gear.
Despite the shockwaves of the Volgograd attack, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach said he was confident that Russia would keep the Winter Olympics safe.
The bombings in Volgograd, which lies about 400 miles (650 kilometers) from Sochi but is a major rail hub for passengers traveling to the Black Sea resort, were not the first such attacks Russia has faced.
"My basic explanation is that they're still inspired by the Olympic Games in Moscow in 1980," he said.
There is a slightly higher risk of attack on softer targets in the wider Sochi area, Clements said.
In the wake of the Volgograd attacks, Russian officials said they did not intend to change their security plans for Sochi -- since they were already so developed -- but vigilance will likely be stepped up elsewhere.
"It's a smaller Games, and it's got twice as many personnel," Clements said of Sochi.
The twin bombings in Volgograd caused grief and disbelief in Russia, he said, especially after the second attack -- staged when security had been stepped up.
"In the wake of that attack, a lot of people came out and said, 'We will run in the marathon, we will come out in the street to demonstrate to the terrorists that they cannot intimidate us.'
Coira, who runs an underwear business, also had a business meeting scheduled in Moscow to coincide with the Sochi trip but will lose out on the chance to launch his product in Russia for the moment.
