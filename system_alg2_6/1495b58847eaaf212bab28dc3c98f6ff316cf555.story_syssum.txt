Jaycee Dugard is reuniting with her close relatives for the first time in 18 years, after having been found on August 27.
Sometimes children involved in custody disputes are taught to hate their father or mother, and "extreme tactics" may be used, although usually not to the extent of hiding a child in crawl spaces, said Jay Lebow, psychologist at The Family Institute at Northwestern University.
"This is a joyful time for my family," she said.
Learning to live with and even like the perpetrator has survival value, Napoletano said, and also explains why someone like Dugard probably would feel somewhat torn about returning to her original family.
It is also important to know how Dugard felt about her family before she was taken away, Tabin said.
Lebow said.
Dugard's reuniting with her family could also be likened to a soldier coming back from a "hellacious war," Lebow said.
When service members come home, they may find life "shallower," and feel that they are not the same people as when they left, she said.
"Well, consciously he is -- he's not awake when he dreams."
