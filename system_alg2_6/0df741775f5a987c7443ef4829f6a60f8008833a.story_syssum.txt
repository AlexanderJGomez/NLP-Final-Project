But Macdonald said that the situation involved Dobbs and his Dobbs Group hiring contractors that she said used undocumented workers.
Dobbs, who called the article a "hit piece," countered that he had no legal right to do so.
Macdonald said Dobbs is responsible for those working at his properties.
In the article posted Wednesday on The Nation's website and headlined "Lou Dobbs, American Hypocrite," the leftist political magazine reports that Dobbs hired contractors who used illegal immigrants for landscaping work and caring for horses ridden by his daughter, Hillary Dobbs, a champion show jumper.
In particular, he has said that employers who hire illegal immigrants should be prosecuted.
Another man whom the article says cared for Dobbs Group horses is quoted as saying the job required him to be available at all hours, day and night.
"You put out an article that is being used by the left-wing press as a hammer on me," Dobbs told Macdonald.
"Your listeners deserve to know the truth," said Macdonald.
