Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel approved Wednesday the construction of a settlement in East Jerusalem just before U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is to visit the country on a peace mission.
"This is a provocation by Netanyahu's government when John Kerry is coming to re-start the negotiations," Margalit said.
This means that Israel has no serious intentions to restart the peace process," Margalit said.
Thousands of housing units are expected to be built throughout Jerusalem in coming years, Sprung said.
