The 34 miners in the Lonmin mine in Marikana, South Africa, died after police opened fire on a gathering of thousands of machete-armed workers striking for higher wages.
The violence exploded when police shot at striking rock drillers in the "Easterns" area of the Marikana mine.
Rivalry between the AMCU and the NUM is widely blamed for feeding the violence.
According to Rosenberg, however, violence at Marikana could prove to be detrimental to the union's aggressive recruitment strategy.
The video appeared to show the police response was "very forceful," Turner said.
"We are a peaceful organization and we do not condone violence," he said.
Mphahlele said police initially shot at the protesters from behind, although when asked if they shot first he said: "I was not there," adding: "The killing of those people was not necessary."
Re-election is "significantly less likely" Rosenberg said.
Lonmin acting CEO Simon Scott said the company and unions have agreed to "negotiate to address the wage demands within a legal framework."
