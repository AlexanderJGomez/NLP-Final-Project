Dumig met Sahra through a photo workshop at Refugio, a shelter in Munich, Germany, for refugees and torture victims.
One of the reasons Dumig decided to photograph Sahra is because growing up in Germany made Dumig realize that she lived a fortunate lifestyle.
"Apart Together" serves not only as a documentation of Sahra, but as a far-reaching story about people from all backgrounds.
"Every one of these (refugees) have strong stories, and in the bureaucratic system, they are just a number or a document," Dumig said.
Many of Dumig's photos are not of Sahra herself, but instead show her surroundings.
"It was just something we both got something out of," Dumig said.
Ines Dumig is a photographer based in Germany.
