(CNN) -- Two of the four survivors of this week's crash on an Alaska mountainside were well enough to talk with government officials looking into the cause of the crash, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Chairwoman Deborah Hersman told reporters on Friday.
Smith had been involved in a prior accident, in 1997, said Hersman.

"Despite suffering serious injuries that have required surgery, Kevin is also showing dramatic improvement," the statement said.
Federal officials are continuing to probe the cause of the crash, said NTSB's Hersman.
