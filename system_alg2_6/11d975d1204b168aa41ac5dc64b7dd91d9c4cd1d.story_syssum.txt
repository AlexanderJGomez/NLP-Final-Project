A stunned Scott, who had started the day four shots ahead of American Brandt Snedeker and Graeme McDowell of Northern Ireland, admitted he had blown it.
McDowell, the 2010 US Open champion, also disappointed and fell away with a 75 to tie for fifth at two under with England's world number one Luke Donald, who raced up the leaderboard with a 69.
"It was my time for some reason," Els said.
He is the same age as last year's surprise British Open winner Darren Clarke, who missed the cut in his title defense.
