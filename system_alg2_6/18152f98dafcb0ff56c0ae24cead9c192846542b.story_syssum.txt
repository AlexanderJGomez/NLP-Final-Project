(CNN) -- An attempted breakout by Muslim Brotherhood prisoners left at least 36 dead Sunday as Egypt's military chief urged supporters of ousted President Mohamed Morsy to quit resisting the new government.
An earlier report by the state-run news agency EGYNews said a group of armed men attempted to free the prisoners.
"The Egyptian people are free to choose whoever to govern them, while the armed forces will remain the safeguard of the will of the people and of their choice," he said.
The Interior Ministry said Sunday evening that some of those groups were taking advantage of their positions to carry out "criminal acts."
On Saturday, Egyptian security forces arrested more than 350 people at a mosque where throngs of Morsy supporters were hiding, including a handful from outside Egypt -- three Irish citizens, one Turkish and one Syrian, the Egyptian Interior Ministry said.
The new government urged the global community to listen to its side Sunday, accusing international media of being sympathetic to Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood.
In a statement also released Sunday, the interim government said it would set up a National Council for Human Rights and document "all the events that took place during the crisis."
Fahmy also said he greatly appreciated the foreign aid that Egypt gets.
U.S. law bars support of a government that has taken power by extraconstitutional means, but the administration has said it won't make a formal determination as to whether Morsy's ouster was a coup.
And Mohamed ElBaradei, who stepped down last week as interim vice president, boarded a flight to Austria, after the interim president accepted his resignation, EGYNews service reported.
