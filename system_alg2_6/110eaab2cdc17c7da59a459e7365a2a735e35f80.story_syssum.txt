Afterward, speaking to media, she said, "I just want to turn to Palestinian parents and say maybe you can stop Hamas from using you as human shields and your death as propaganda."
Some Palestinian parents visited her family after Naftali's death and they had very good conversations, she said.
The Gaza Health Ministry said Wednesday 695 Palestinians have been killed in the fighting, including 166 children.
Three more Israeli soldiers were killed Wednesday, bringing the total to 32 plus three civilians.
"There seems to be a strong possibility that international humanitarian law has been violated, in a manner that could amount to war crimes," U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said Wednesday.

Also Wednesday, Ban announced he was ordering a review of incidents where rockets were placed at United Nations Relief and Works Agency schools.
An IDF force found another "terror access shaft" in Gaza on Wednesday, Israel said.
