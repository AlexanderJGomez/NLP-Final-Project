The demand for heroin is reaching unprecedented proportions -- fueled in part by a growing number of people who get hooked on prescription painkillers and soon need a cheaper way to get high.
In Chelsea, according to Betz, the majority of illegal prescription pill sales take place behind closed doors, but a heroin deal can be made in the heart of downtown Chelsea, at a busy part of town called Bellingham Square.
They search the informant to make sure there is no pocketed  heroin or cash, and have the person hand over the drugs.
But Betz says Chelsea is not so different from any other town when it comes to drugs.
Betz says small cities often have a tougher battle against drugs than bigger cities because of lower income and resources.
What's more, much of the drug problem in Chelsea doesn't come from inside Chelsea, Betz says.
Still, Betz knows that each day is a new day, where the effort to end the heroin problem in Chelsea continues.
