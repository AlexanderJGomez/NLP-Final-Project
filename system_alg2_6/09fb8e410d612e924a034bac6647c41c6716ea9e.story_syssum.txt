(CNN) -- A former Florida middle school principal stabbed four people Friday at a group home for the hearing impaired, killing two of them, then struck five others with a car, the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office said.
The sheriff's office said the man's injuries "appear to be life-threatening."
The sheriff's office said the suspect then drove west and struck another person, this time a 13-year-old boy.
It was not clear whether he had retained a lawyer.
Then, in early 2010, Giancola was arrested again and charged on two counts -- intent to purchase cocaine and loitering -- according to online records from the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office.
