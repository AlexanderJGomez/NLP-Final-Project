Launched earlier this week, the Tony Elumelu Foundation Entrepreneurship Program (TEEP) wants to help find and grow businesses who will contribute $10 billion in revenue across Africa over the next 10 years.
"We must strive for entrepreneurial innovation in Africa," says Songwe, "and my participation in this program further promotes the World Bank Group's push for entrepreneur-led global development."
"African entrepreneurs have ideas, they have products but they don't have support," says technologist Marieme Jamme, a Davos Young Global leader and CEO of SpotOne Global Solutions.
"Mentorship for entrepreneurs in Africa is the key," she continues, calling for governments to improve educational efforts work with the private sector to create new markets for entrepreneurs.
