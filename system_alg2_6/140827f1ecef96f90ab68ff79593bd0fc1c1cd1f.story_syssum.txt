President Obama attended a community service forum at Texas A&M University on Friday hosted by one of his Republican predecessors, former President George H.W.
Obama lauded the former president's lifetime of service -- from his enlistment at 18 to his community work during retirement -- noting that Bush was the first president to create a White House office devoted to promoting volunteer work.
The law created four national service corps and launched several other initiatives, including, among other things, a "Summer of Service" program to spur greater community outreach by middle- and high-school students.
