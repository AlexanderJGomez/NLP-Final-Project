A new iPhone.
Battery life was a frequent complaint about the iPhone 3GS, but concerns about the phone's short battery life seemed to have been addressed on the next-generation iPhone 4.
Various independent tests of the new phone have suggested that some phones have problems with poor battery life, while others don't.
That could cut battery life, even though Apple CEO Tim Cook specifically said that it wouldn't during the iPhone 4S unveiling event last month.
Apparently, reading from the well-worn Apple playbook, the company has not commented publicly about the battery complaints.
There would eventually be a news conference in which then-CEO Steve Jobs spent most of the time denying there was any real problem, then announcing that the company would give away free bumpers -- minimalist iPhone cases -- to prevent dropped calls.
"It's your iPhone 4S battery life, and it sucks."
