Residents of this sleepy Turkish border town breathed a sigh of relief on Thursday.
Fighting first erupted in the area on November 8, when Syrian rebels mounted an assault on Syrian government forces in the neighboring Syrian town of Ras Al Ain.
But the Turkish government said at least a half dozen Turks were wounded during the week of fighting.
Whether or not Damascus heeded Ankara's warning is not clear.
These frightened Syrians said Ras Al Ain had been a safe haven until last week's rebel attack.
"We are angry at both of them (the rebels and the government), because the rebels entered Ras Al Ain and because the regime bombed us with its aircraft," Mohammed said.
"The FSA has to know that their enemy is not in Ras Al Ain and in other Kurdish areas.
Speaking by phone from the Kurdish-controlled Syrian town of Qoubani, Aloush said his Kurdish faction would not use force to push Syrian rebel groups out of Ras Al Ain.
On Friday, the Turkish government once again denounced the Syrian regime, claiming it had no legitimacy.
