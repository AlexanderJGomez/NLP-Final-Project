(CNN) -- Six inches of snow in Chicago.
Many drought-stricken states need a foot of rain, not snow.
Lake City, Minnesota, has received 11.5 inches of snow since Sunday morning, which amounts to about an inch of rain.
But the state is still plagued by "severe," "extreme" and "exceptional" drought, U.S. Drought Monitor said.
At the same time, the storms that sweep the United States should grow more intense, said meteorologist Marshall Shepherd from the University of Georgia.
Snowfall has bolstered water levels on the Mississippi River, which had dropped due to drought, said Ann McCulloch, spokeswoman for American Waterways Operators.
In the parched Plains states, snow hasn't helped enough.
They could use that rain.
