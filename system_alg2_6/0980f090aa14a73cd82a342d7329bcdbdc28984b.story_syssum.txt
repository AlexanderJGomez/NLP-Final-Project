"The French army is not in Afghanistan to be shot at by Afghan soldiers," he said.
France has 3,935 troops in Afghanistan, according NATO's International Security Assistance Force.
The attack in Kapisa province follows a similar shooting last month by an Afghan soldier that killed two French soldiers serving in an engineers' regiment, also in eastern Afghanistan.
"This was the latest attack by those sensible and zealous Afghans who have entered the enemy's army and it was also the best one so far as it killed more soldiers than any other such attacks before,' Mujahid said.
Friday's shooting was the latest in a series of attacks on NATO forces by members of the Afghan army.
There was no enemy activity in the area when the helicopter went down in Helmand, said Col. Gary Kolb, an ISAF spokesman.
