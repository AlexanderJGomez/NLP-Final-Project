Actress Skye McCole Bartusiak, who played Mel Gibson's youngest daughter in "The Patriot," died Saturday at her home in Houston, her mother said Sunday.
Bartusiak had been preparing to produce and direct her first feature film in recent months, her mother said.
The images include pictures with Presidents George W. and George H.W.
"The girl has lived such an amazing life," she said.
