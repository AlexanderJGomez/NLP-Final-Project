Now the Supreme Court will decide whether the Kansas native can hold former Bush administration officials -- especially onetime Attorney General John Ashcroft -- personally liable for wrongful arrest and detention.
American Civil Liberties Union lawyers representing al-Kidd say the government has warped the law to allow open-ended arrests and confinement of citizens, without being later held accountable for those wrongfully held.
An affidavit submitted to a federal magistrate said al-Kidd had a one-way first class plane ticket, and that he was "crucial" to the prosecution of Sami Omar al-Hussayen.
He now teaches in Saudi Arabia and did not attend oral arguments at the high court.
A federal appeals court had allowed his civil lawsuit to continue, but Ashcroft argues officials under his supervision obeyed the letter and spirit of the material witness law.
"We are talking about the attorney general and the attorney general's immunity," she told the Justice Department lawyer arguing the case.
Ashcroft has the support of the Obama administration, which argued the case in the high court, as well as several former attorneys general.
"And in fact, Mr. al-Kidd did exactly that.
The case is Ashcroft v. al-Kidd (10-98).
