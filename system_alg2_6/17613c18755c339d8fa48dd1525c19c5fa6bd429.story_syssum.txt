A report released Thursday alleges that Angelyn Donald, principal at PS 386, was told by a number of students about note passing and even kissing between their 10-year-old classmate and her 40-year-old special education teacher, Anthony Criscuolo.
Another student told investigators that Donald demanded proof of the alleged conduct.
Criscuolo, who taught 5th grade special education, was immediately reassigned away from the school and any students, Connie Pankratz, a spokeswoman for the Department of Education, told CNN.
Criscuolo began working in the New York City school system in 2002 as a substitute teacher in the Bronx.
