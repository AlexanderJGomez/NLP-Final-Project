Britain's Prince Charles has called on governments around the world to do more to ensure religious freedom and urged religious leaders to promote tolerance between people of different faiths.
"First and foremost, rather than remaining silent, faith leaders have -- it seems to me -- a responsibility to ensure that people within their own tradition respect people from other faith traditions," he said.
And he urged those facing persecution not to give up hope, while remaining strong in their faith.
"In the period under review, global religious freedom entered a period of serious decline," the report concludes.
