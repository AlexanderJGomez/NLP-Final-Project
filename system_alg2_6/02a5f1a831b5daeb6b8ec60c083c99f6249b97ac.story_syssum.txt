By 2008, when recession caused many small businesses to close shop, the Scotts left their day jobs to grow the business, Barn Light Electric Company.
The company, based in Titusville, Florida, manufactures and sells vintage-inspired lighting fixtures and has expanded into other industrial-styled goods.
They've been married for 29 years, Scott said, and building Barn Light made them stronger.
He is the "gas," and Donna is the "bricks," he said of their collaborative management of the company; he runs the manufacturing while she heads the administration, sales and marketing.
The company bought the patents of old lighting businesses, including Benjamin Electric Manufacturing Company, and allows employees and customers to suggest ideas for new styles.
Johnny Bragg, manufacturing general manager for Barn Light and Bryan Scott's uncle, calls Barn Light the best job he's ever had.
They "don't just leave because it's the end of the day but because they've done a good job for Barn Light."
Locals may see a new building and go "Oh, its Barn Light, they're getting bigger again," Barn Light's communications coordinator Betty Lynne said.
