"I used to steal my older sister's pink-and-green Maybelline mascara," says Adams, 33.
It's good to be my friend when I clean out my makeup bag!"
I had to go into the bathroom at my agency and have my agent do my makeup.
My sister used to call me Fish-Belly Blue because I was so pale.
I had really dry skin.
I really like red, but I'm always open to change.
I think when you have blond hair, people associate those behaviors with being flighty.
I put my makeup on, take them out, spray, then just shake my head and I'm ready.
To build Breck Girl bouncy waves, hairstylist Andy LeCompte set Adams's hair in pin curls for 20 minutes after winding 2-inch sections around a curling iron.
