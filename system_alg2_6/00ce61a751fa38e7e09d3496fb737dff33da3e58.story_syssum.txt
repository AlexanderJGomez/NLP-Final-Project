The result has been a new documentary film, "Chasing Ice," based on 36 time-lapse cameras looking at 16 different glaciers in locations in Alaska, Bolivia, Canada, France, Greenland, Iceland, Nepal, the Rocky Mountains and Switzerland.
A landscape that is now gone and will never be seen again in the history of civilization."
While accepting that glacial ice melting has happened many times before in human history, Balog says what he is documenting now can no longer be considered a natural process.
"In the past 100 years, the atmosphere has accumulated 40% more carbon dioxide in it than had been seen in the peak over the past one million years.
I believe that this film can help shift public perceptions by telling people a story that is real and happening now," he says.
