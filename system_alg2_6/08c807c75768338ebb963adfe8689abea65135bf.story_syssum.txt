"The English were very true to their strengths and weaknesses at Euro 2012," Winner told CNN.
The breeding ground for this English style of football has its roots in the boisterous games of the medieval period, Winner argues, and the intrinsic love for "testosterone festivals" like rugby, which was invented around the same time as soccer.
This then infiltrated the nation's best-loved game, reinforcing the idea of a "warrior" culture, when grit and determination were valued over technical skill.
Hope can be extracted from two titans of Europe, Spain and Germany, both of whom radically revamped their approach to the game in the last 15 years.
"Look at how the Spanish used to play and the way they play now," Winner explains.
German football expert Raphael Honigstein told CNN an insistence on better technical development for young players, instigated in the late 1990s and early 2000s as a result of an under-performing national side, are now starting to pay dividends.
"They invested lots of money into coaching and youth development and they produced better players.
The English Football Association told CNN its new National Football Center, which will act as a development hub for young players and coaches, is due to be handed over next week.
He and his colleagues are trying to mesh the traditional English "warrior" style with the more cultured flavor of Spain and Germany, in order to produce players who are comfortable in any type of match situation.
Both Winner and Kuper agree that England needs a new model, and beginning with a detailed look at how Spain and Germany transformed their fortunes would be a productive starting point.
They qualify for tournaments almost always.
