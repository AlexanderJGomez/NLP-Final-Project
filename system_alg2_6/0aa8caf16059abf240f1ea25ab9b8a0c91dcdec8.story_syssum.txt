The 32-year-old from Pasadena, California, recently filed a petition on Change.org asking Disney to make an animated character out of a pangolin, a little-known, scale-covered mammal that's notoriously shy and, to Kit's point, can protect itself from pretty much anything in the wild -- lions, tigers -- by rolling up into a ball.
I hadn't heard of pangolins before readers voted for me to cover the illegal animal trade as part of that project; and Kit hadn't heard of them until she read the story last week.
Disney and Disney Pixar have the reach to make the pangolin popular.
CNN readers are voting on a name for pangolin P26, which was rescued from the wildlife trade and was recently released back into the wild in Vietnam.

"Maybe I didn't have enough friends and the animals were always super friendly all the time," she said.
"I can tell you many Chinese citizens do not support this cruelty, and I believe we can bring wildlife advocates from around the world together to ask Disney to take this simple, fun, positive step to help pangolins."
