Throughout his career, Gelbart developed a portfolio of more than 40 works spanning radio, television, theater and film.
"I never had any aspirations of [a] literary career, but writing for radio seemed to be a natural extension of being such a radio fan," Gelbart told CNN in 1999.
In 1972, Gelbart helped create the Korean War comedy drama "M*A*S*H." The show went on for another 11 years, although Gelbart only wrote and produced "M*A*S*H" for the first four seasons.
Gelbart also was involved in the short-lived sequel, "After MASH."
Gelbart continued steamrolling through the industry, with works including the 1982 hit film "Tootsie," "Oh, God!"
