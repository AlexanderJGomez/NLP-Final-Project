Republicans think that young voters -- particularly Americans who were in diapers or listening to N*SYNC during the eight years that Hillary Clinton lived in the White House -- could use a refresher course on all things Clinton.
Details about the Clinton White House years is not old news for people who were in "grade school" at the time, she said.
Clinton is also one of the most recognizable people in America.
"I think that is going to be a big issue in framing the debate and framing who Hillary is to those voters," Kukowski said.
Top Republican strategists, like Karl Rove, have shown how Republican might try to bring up Clinton's age and health in a campaign.
Although Democrats have called Rove "sleazy," the stepped up attacks have already had an impact on the early 2016 presidential wrangling by solidifying what Republicans have been saying for months: Hillary Clinton is who they see as the most formidable potential candidate.
Tim Miller, executive director of the anti-Clinton America Rising PAC, said comments like that are an acknowledgment that she knows their time in the White House from 1993-2001 will be an issue if she runs.
Miller added that while he doesn't think the 2016 election will be won or lost on issues like Whitewater and other Clinton White House scandals, he does think  informing young voters, especially, about them is necessary.
President Barack Obama's campaign famously began to define Republican challenger Mitt Romney as out-of-touch early in the race.
Republicans say that is only because of the unprecedented shadow campaign around Clinton right now.
