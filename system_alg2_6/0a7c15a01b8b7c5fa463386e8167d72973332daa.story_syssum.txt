Doctors performed the autopsy at a Misrata hospital in the presence of officials from the prosecutor's office, Zentani said.
Leaders of Libya's interim government have said Gadhafi was killed in crossfire after fighters captured him Thursday.
An amateur video distributed by the Reuters news agency Sunday showed NTC fighters congratulating a man the fighters say killed Gadhafi.
"The contradictory statements issued by the NTC excusing these barbaric executions and the grotesque abuse of the corpses make it clear that no person affiliated with the former regime will receive a fair trial in Libya nor will they receive justice for crimes committed against them," the statement said.
The United Nations human rights office and activist groups like Amnesty and Human Rights Watch have called for a probe into Gadhafi's death.
"We believe there is a need for an investigation and more details are needed to ascertain whether he was killed in the fighting or after his capture.
