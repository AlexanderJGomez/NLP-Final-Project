First responders could still have problems communicating with one another, and there is confusion in some communities about who would be in charge, Hamilton told the House Homeland Security Committee.
Tom Ridge, the first secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said competing measures to deal with the problem are being considered by the House and Senate, while police and fire departments are waiting for some kind of action.
Ridge said the United States has been able to thwart many terror plots, but in some instances it was because the bombers made mistakes and were ineffective.
"Luck is not a strategy," he said, warning that the United States must adapt to detect the evolving tactics of terrorists.
