(CNN) -- Lance Armstrong has been asked to return all prize money from his seven annulled Tour de France victories by the sport's governing body, who confirmed the history books will show no winner of the famous race between 1999-2005.
"The International Cycling Union (UCI) has asked Lance Armstrong to return all the prize money he won from his seven Tour de France victories, that have been struck off due to allegations of doping.
He told CNN: "The sport is going to have some tough times and I think there needs to be a leadership change for it to really be able to move forward.
The UCI said it would soon appoint a fully independent external commission that would look into the role it played during the Armstrong affair and report no later than June next year.
Riders are now subject to the most innovative and effective anti-doping procedures and regulations in sport.
