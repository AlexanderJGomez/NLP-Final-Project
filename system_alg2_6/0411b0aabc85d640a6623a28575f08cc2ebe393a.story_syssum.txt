Stuck in a foot of snow on a road somewhere outside Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, the couple from Wisconsin pulled all the clothes out of their suitcases and wore them, trying to keep warm in their car with temperatures dipping below zero.
In fact, the highway was shut down in mid-September due to heavy snow, with signs posted saying so, the Park County Sheriff's Department said.
"I decided about 9 o'clock that it was too late to go out," Barnett told CNN.
Then he got on the snowmobile and minutes later, found the couple just about where he thought they'd be.
"They were really grateful and there were some tears," he said.
Barnett loaded Mark and Kristine on his snowmobile and drove back to his truck.
"It's really rural up here, we're just up in the mountains."
