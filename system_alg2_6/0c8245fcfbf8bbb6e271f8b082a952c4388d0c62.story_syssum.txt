At the time she was playing for the U.S. National Team and had begun feeling extremely fatigued; regular training sessions left her with joint pain and muscle soreness.

I deal with fatigue and joint pain just like with lupus, but it also affects my skin, my eyes and my mouth.
I remember in 2010 going to training sessions completely exhausted and my knees throbbing from all my joint pain.
The medicine I am on now helps control the amount of "flare-ups" I may have, as well as control the amount of inflammation in my body.
The best solution for me is, if I start to feel more fatigued than normal, I will train lighter that day or even just take it off completely.
I think it's important that you have someone who understands that you can feel good a majority of the time but are there for you when a flare-up happens.
As I am nearing the tail end of my career, I have realized it is a lot more important to use my voice to help bring awareness to lupus and Sjogren's.
If I can help spread the word about what lupus or Sjogren's is and what the symptoms are, maybe I can help get people in to visit a doctor sooner.
My hamstring healed and I was able to start in the final game and help my team to an Olympic gold medal.
