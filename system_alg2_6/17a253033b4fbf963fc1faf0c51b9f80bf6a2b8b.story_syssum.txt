(CNN) -- California's Supreme Court on Tuesday denied the San Diego County clerk's request to immediately halt same-sex marriages in the state, the latest, if not necessarily last, key ruling in a years-long legal fight.
Earlier Tuesday -- before the state high court's decision came down -- same-sex marriage supporters gathered in San Diego to decry the efforts by Dronenburg and his supporters to continue their fight.
The clerk said he wanted California's Supreme Court to halt same-sex marriages because of what had happened once before: such weddings took place only to be later ruled to be against state law.
That happened June 26, when the nation's high court -- in a 5-4 decision -- dismissed an appeal of the earlier lower court ruling on narrow, jurisdictional grounds.
