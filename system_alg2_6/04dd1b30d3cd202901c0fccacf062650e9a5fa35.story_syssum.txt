London (CNN) -- South African double-amputee sprinter Oscar Pistorius, who made headlines at the Olympics, set a world record on Saturday in London in defense of the first of his three Paralympic titles.
He's also part of South Africa's 4 X 100-meter T42/T46 relay team, which is scheduled to race Wednesday.
Britain's Sarah Storey, wife of Barney Storey, made it a double gold for the household Saturday with victory in the women's individual C4-5 500-meter time trial, while U.S. cyclist Jennifer Schuble took silver.
British medal hope Ellie Simmonds, also 17, won her heat in a time a fraction faster than Arlen, the world record holder.
That order held up in the finals, with Simmonds setting a world record in finishing a second ahead of Arlen -- with the two of them both 13 seconds faster than any other competitor.
Vergeer -- who already has five Paralympic wheelchair tennis titles, three in singles, two in doubles -- beat Japan's Kanako Domori in straight sets in the first round of the women's singles.
