John Couey had been sentenced to death for killing 9-year-old Jessica Lunsford in Florida in 2005.
"To me, death is sad," he said.
The girl was snatched from her bed in her family's Homosassa, Florida, home the evening of February 23, 2005, by Couey, a registered sex offender.
"
"I'm sorry I won't get to look him in the eyes as he died, but I'm relieved to know he'll never hurt another child again."
He told Lunsford he was planning to take her home, but did not want her to be seen, and so persuaded her to get into a trash bag.
"He caused a slow, suffering, conscious death," Howard said of Couey.
Although Lunsford's death was one of several that contributed to the passage of a federal child-protection law dealing with sex offender registration and other matters related to child sex offenses, Mark Lunsford said at the time of Couey's sentencing the law does not go far enough.

He called on Couey to drop his appeals.
