Ben Folds was so impressed by a cappella groups' performances of his songs, he made a record with them.
And so an idea was born: Folds would travel to university campuses around the country and record an entire album of a cappella covers.
Ben Folds spoke to CNN about his youthful-sounding new release, why being married four times isn't much of a drama and why he faked an album leak.

I mean these guys, they'd just do a live take and they just don't know that the pros don't do it that way.
I think that people have a natural tuning mechanism.
There's always something new.
Folds: Well, I think that we get very uptight when it comes time to record because there's a process, an imminent process that has to do with just selling the record, mostly.
I mean, that's a lot of drama.

Folds: Yeah, that's heavy, dude.
I wouldn't know about that with my (jokingly flexes muscles) -- it doesn't really occur to me, those things.
