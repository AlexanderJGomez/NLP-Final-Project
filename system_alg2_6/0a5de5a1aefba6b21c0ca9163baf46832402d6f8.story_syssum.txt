A Cleveland police officer shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice about two seconds after the officer and a partner pulled up in a car to investigate reports that someone was brandishing a gun at a park, surveillance video that police released Wednesday shows.

"It is our belief that this situation could have been avoided and that Tamir should still be here with us," the family said.
"(The officer's) door was open as they pulled up," Tomba said.
Between 1.5 to two seconds elapsed from the time the car pulled up to the moment Tamir was shot, Tomba said.
Investigators determined that Tamir's weapon was an air gun, and that an orange tip that is meant to indicate that it's not a real firearm had been removed, police said.
