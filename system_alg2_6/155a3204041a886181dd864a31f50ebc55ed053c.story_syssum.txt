Washington (CNN) -- The United States is biding its time in its effort to get fugitive leaker Edward Snowden delivered to its custody, hoping that Russia wearies of him and Ecuador decides against granting him asylum, senior U.S. officials said Wednesday.
WikiLeaks said Snowden flew out of Hong Kong on refugee papers issued by Ecuador, where he has requested asylum, but Ecuador's deputy foreign minister said Wednesday that his country had provided him no documents.
Speaking in Vietnam this week, Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino said his government will consider the U.S. request when it decides on Snowden's plea for asylum, which the United States considers a sign that the highest levels of the Ecuadorian government have gotten the message.
"We are reserving the harder line until they know for sure whether the Ecuadorians are willing to take him in."
