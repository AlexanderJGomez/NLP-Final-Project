Massachusetts GOP Sen. Scott Brown -- who broke the Democrats' 60-member filibuster-proof majority by winning the late Ted Kennedy's seat in January -- said after meeting with Kagan that he is satisfied she supports members of the military.
"It was the first question I actually asked her because, having been in the military, I had concerns about [her] position at Harvard," Brown said.
Earlier in the day, Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins said she doesn't have any concerns about Kagan's experience.
Specter said Kagan may be open to the idea of allowing television coverage of Supreme Court hearings.
Specter has not said how he will vote on her Supreme Court nomination.
Obama nominated Kagan on Monday to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens.
