Ed O'Neill is one of the stars of the Emmy-winning "Modern Family," which begins its sixth season September 24.
Katey Sagal has gone on to lead roles in TV hits such as "Futurama" and "8 Simple Rules," and currently stars in the FX drama "Sons Of Anarchy," which kicked off its seventh and final season earlier this month, to record ratings.
