Thursday's announcement was made in Hawthorne, California, where Tesla unveiled the Model S sedan at a base price of $49,900, after a federal tax credit of $7,500.
SpaceX recently won a NASA contract to deliver cargo to the international space station when the space shuttle program is retired next year.
Nonetheless, Tesla predicts it will manufacture 20,000 Model S vehicles a year.
