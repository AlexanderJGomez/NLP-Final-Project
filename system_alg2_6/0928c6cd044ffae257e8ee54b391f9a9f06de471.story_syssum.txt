Sala is one of scores of animals orphaned by drought, poaching and shrinking habitats, which have decimated wildlife across Kenya.
The foundation takes in orphaned elephants and rhinos from across the country, a popular tourist destination because of its animals.
Sala and the other animals will be released back into the wilderness when they are old enough, which takes years.
"After working with these elephants, it's no longer just a job," said Edwin Lusichi, the chief keeper.
