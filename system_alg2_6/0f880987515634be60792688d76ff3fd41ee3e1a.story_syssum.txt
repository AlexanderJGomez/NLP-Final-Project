Some coin-operated newspaper machines have lasted for 30 years, but lack of sales may force their retirement.
Mike's job, which takes less than a couple of minutes per stop, entails filling the coin-operated machine with the day's papers, collecting unsold copies and emptying the machine of its coins.
Mike loads 15 copies of the Record into one machine -- and that's a good load, he says.
The publication that touts "All The News That's Fit to Print" has been relying less on newspaper racks.
"There'll be printed newspapers for years and years" said Kaspar, president of a company that is actually part of the larger Kaspar Wireworks.
But the heart of any machine is the coin mechanism, which can have 150 moving parts, according to the manufacturer.
Coin- operated machines?
"We're not dependent on any one industry," Kaspar said.
For the Kaspar Sho-Rack Company, as long as newspapers are printed and sold, its machines will gladly continue to accept coins.
