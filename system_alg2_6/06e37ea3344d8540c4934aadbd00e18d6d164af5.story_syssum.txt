Outlaw Run, the first wooden roller coaster with multiple inversions, opened in 2013.
"When [theme park supplier] Mack decided to build its first upside-down coaster in 2009, engineers also decided to design one without an overhead restraint.
"The tubular steel roller coaster is probably the biggest game changer in rides.
"Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey was the first ride system to combine a tracked dark ride vehicle with a row of seats mounted to the end of an industrial robotic arm," says Craig Hanna, chief creative officer at theme park design firm Thinkwell Group.
"This ride was introduced in 1972 and was the first wooden roller coaster built since 1947," says Speigel.
"The Omnimover ride system allowed ride designers, for the first time, to change the direction that riders were facing as they moved through the ride," says Robert Niles at ThemeParkinsider.com.
"Pooh's Hunny Hunt was a huge game changer because this was the first trackless ride and the first time ride designers were no longer forced to use a linear path," says Craig Hanna at Thinkwell Group.
"One real game changer is the Spider-Man ride system and its multimedia technology," says Maximilian Roeser at Mack rides.
