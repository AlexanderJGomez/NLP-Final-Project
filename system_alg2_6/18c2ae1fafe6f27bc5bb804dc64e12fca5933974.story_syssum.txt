Some women -- many who haven't read it -- have slammed it as elitist or as placing the burden of change too much on women and not enough on workplaces.

It does mean not backing off.
If women quit arguing and work toward systemic changes together, we can retool the workplace for a successful 21st century.
If we don't?
