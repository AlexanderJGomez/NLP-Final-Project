(CNN) -- Jes Baker is cutting retailer Abercrombie & Fitch down to size.
"I challenge the separation of attractive and fat, and I assert that they are compatible regardless of what you believe," Baker, 26, wrote in a public letter addressed to the CEO.
Baker spoke to CNN about Jeffries' comments and her motivations to address them.
I wanted to not say, "This is an outrage, I've never heard of this before," but say, "OK, well, look at this.
Baker: In the body-positive world, which is still a subculture, fashion for fat people -- what they call "fatshion" -- is a really big political statement.
Baker: No, no, no.
CNN: The response has obviously been huge.
For a lot of people, it's just a light bulb.
In the beginning, I was nervous, but mostly because I had never modeled with other people.
We never see this pairing; we never see a fat woman in a positive light.
