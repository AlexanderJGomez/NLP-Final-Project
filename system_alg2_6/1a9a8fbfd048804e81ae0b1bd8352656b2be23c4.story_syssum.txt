With 56 million passengers passing through last year, it's the third busiest airport in Europe and claims to serve more international destinations than any other airport in the world.

While most meals for economy class are deep frozen, for business and first-class passengers food is freshly prepared on the day.
There's just one chance to deliver good food on a plane."
