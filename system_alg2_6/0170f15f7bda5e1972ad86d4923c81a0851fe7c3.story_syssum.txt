(CNN) -- A fire erupted Friday at the headquarters of the Shanksville, Pennsylvania, memorial to United Airlines Flight 93, which crashed on September 11, 2001, officials said.
Four buildings were damaged, the park service said.
"I think stuff has been lost," Nacke said.
"We are deeply saddened to learn that a fire occurred at the Flight 93 National Memorial headquarters," Gordon Felt, president of Families of Flight 93 said in a statement.
"Neither the memorial proper nor the new visitor center currently under construction were affected, as the headquarters is located approximately two miles from those sites," Litterst said.
The 2,200-acre memorial park is managed by the National Park Service.
