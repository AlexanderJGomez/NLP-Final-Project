And they hope pharmacy employees -- or anyone, for that matter -- will report such activity to its new prescription drug abuse tip line.
"It really is out of control here," said Rick Allen, director of the Georgia Drug and Narcotics Agency.
Prescription drug abuse is a national epidemic, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
"The illegal prescription drug market and relative ease of which pharmaceutical substances can be obtained has resulted in a sharp increase in prescription drug abuse," said Harry Sommers, special agent in charge of the DEA's Atlanta division.
A prescription with all the words spelled out or with perfect handwriting is also suspicious, according to the DEA.
Sommers said he doesn't think his agency will get a ton of tips through the new tip line, but he believes the tips it does get will yield good results.
