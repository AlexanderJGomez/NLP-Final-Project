When asked when the ship might have been looted, Clifford said he didn't know.
"I'm looking for the government (of Haiti) to protect this."
Two years ago, after having researched the type of cannon used in Columbus' time, "I woke up in the middle of the night and said, 'Oh, my God,' " Clifford said.
The ship was found in the exact area where Columbus said the Santa Maria ran aground more than 500 years ago, Clifford said.
Among the islands on which Columbus set foot was Hispaniola, which is divided between Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
Columbus set off back to Spain with the two remaining ships, the Nina and the Pinta, in January 1493.
