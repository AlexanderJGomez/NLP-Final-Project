(CNN)  -- Spain needed an injury-time goal from substitute Fernando Llorente to beat Saudi Arabia 3-2 in a World Cup warm-up match in Innsbruck on Saturday.
It was his third in two games for his adopted country after a double against Malta and presses his claims for a place in the World Cup squad.
"Of course, it will hurt for the players concerned, but unfortunately we can only take 23," he told AFP.
The result is setback for Serbia, who face Australia -- winners over their neighbors last week -- in Group D in South Africa, as well as Germany and Ghana.
