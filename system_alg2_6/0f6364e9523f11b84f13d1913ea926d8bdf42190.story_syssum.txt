(CNN)Kayla Mueller made helping people her life's work.
The Mueller family confirmed her death on Tuesday and said ISIS took her captive in August 2013.
She spent two years living and working with humanitarian  groups in northern India, Israel and the Palestinian territories, according to a family spokeswoman.
Upon returning to Arizona in 2011, Mueller volunteered in a women's shelter and worked at Northland Cares, an HIV/AIDS clinic, helping to facilitate events and providing local coordination for World AIDS Day, the family spokeswoman said.
On a trip home in 2013, she told the Kiwanis Club in Prescott about her work in the Mideast, saying she often drew, painted and played with Syrian children in refugee camps, according to The Daily Courier.
ISIS took Mueller captive in the summer of 2013 after she visited a Spanish MSF (Doctors Without Borders) hospital, according to the family spokeswoman.
"Upon completion of the repair work on August 4, the MSF team organized transportation for Kayla and the technician to the Aleppo bus station, from where they were to depart for Turkey.
The family hasn't said whether they know how she was treated.
"We can honor Kayla most by asking all the parties involved to seek understanding of difference, of those with whom we most disagree," Thompson said.
