Bush's spokeswoman, Kristy Campbell, confirmed Wednesday that Bush will attend the event in the Hawkeye State, which holds the first nominating contests in presidential election years.
Bush skipped the most recent cattle call in Iowa last month, when close to 10 potential GOP presidential candidates addressed an assembly of core caucus goers in Des Moines.
The Hawkeye State is already seeing a range of potential candidates making stops in the state.
