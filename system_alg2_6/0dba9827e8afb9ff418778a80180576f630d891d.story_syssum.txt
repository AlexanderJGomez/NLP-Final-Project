HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- It's small, affluent, tech-savvy and it has a very obvious pollution problem -- Hong Kong is arguably an ideal destination for electric cars.
Hong Kong is not without EVs though.
"[Hong Kong Electric] only use them inside their private site and they have to get a very special licence and they can't drive outside their site and they are restricted to certain uses," she says.
"This will only happen with market pressure - it is hard to see it otherwise," says Masset.
And education needs to come from the government, he says.
"Taxis, minibuses, buses can be forced to go electric but the government isn't doing anything," says Cheng.
How can we build a new generation of EVs for Hong Kong?
The government needs to give them financial support and I am not talking about one or two million Hong Kong dollars.
"We want to come here -- as long as the policy is there to make it happen," says Chung.
