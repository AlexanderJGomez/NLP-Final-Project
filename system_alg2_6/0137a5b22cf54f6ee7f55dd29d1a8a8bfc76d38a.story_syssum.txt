As a music style, heavy metal has completely passed me by.
Why would I want to listen to anyone even suggesting I do that?
There's only one thing for it -- a crash course in all things metal with the man who knows, self-confessed metalhead Malcolm Dome, who also presents the chart show for 24-hour UK rock and metal radio station TotalRock.
"You'd probably be surprised how many heavy metal fans there are who have very high-powered business jobs -- even members of parliament who are into metal.
If there's anyone who can convince me of the joys of heavy metal, it's someone who also appreciates the soothing, melodic tones of Sinatra.
And that's what metal does.
"You can understand people actually seeing what was being presented to them thinking 'I don't get it and I don't want to get it,'" Malcolm says.
Some 30,000 people listen to TotalRock each week, many of them women.
It should be stated here that there are varying degrees of heavy metal, from the hair metal of carefully-coifured Jon Bon Jovi to the black art of New York doom metal band Unearthly Trance.
Dozens of sub-categories of metal have evolved to include black metal, stoner metal, thrash metal, power metal, goth metal, death metal and grind core, to name a few.
"Absolutely not, no, no, no," Malcolm says, looking slightly shocked.
What a relief.
