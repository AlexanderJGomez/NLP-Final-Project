Slidell, Louisiana (CNN) -- Authorities dropped a mandatory evacuation order Sunday for neighborhoods threatened by a strained lock on a southeast Louisiana canal, but still recommended people stay away.
That will result in "major flooding" of at least two subdivisions near the banks and threaten areas in the southeastern corner of the parish, according to the National Weather Service.

Parts of Missouri and Illinois saw up to six inches of rain Saturday, and the National Weather Service issued a flood warning Sunday for parts of southern Illinois.
Isaac is blamed for at least 19 deaths in Haiti and at least four more in Louisiana and Mississippi after making landfall last week as a Category 1 hurricane -- on the seventh anniversary of Hurricane Katrina -- near the mouth of the Mississippi River.
Residents began returning home over the weekend in Helena, Mississippi, where National Guard troops rescued hundreds trapped by rising waters brought on by Isaac.
