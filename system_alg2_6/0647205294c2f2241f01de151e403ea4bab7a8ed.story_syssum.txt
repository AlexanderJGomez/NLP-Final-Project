Liverpool supporters at the Kop end paid their respects in an emotional afternoon at Anfield.
Club legend Kenny Dalglish, who was Liverpool manager at the time of the disaster, then read a short prayer.
The Liverpool fans died in a crush which started just before the kick-off as the gate at the Leppings Lane End was opened with terrible consequences.
"It was wrong for people to blame, as some did, Liverpool fans on that day," he said.
Fittingly, the ceremony was concluded with Gerry Marsden leading the fans in singing Liverpool anthem 'You'll Never Walk Alone'.
