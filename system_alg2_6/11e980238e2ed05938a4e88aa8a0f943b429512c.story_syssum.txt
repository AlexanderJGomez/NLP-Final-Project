When the Parr family started having serious health problems late in 2008, they had no idea it was associated with what they call "a multitude" of drilling operations that popped up near their 40-acre ranch in Decatur, 60 miles northwest of Dallas.
According to the lawsuit, Aruba Petroleum had 22 natural gas wells within a 2-mile radius of the Parrs' property, with three wells in close proximity to their Texas home.
Aruba Petroleum argued to the jury that it consistently met state regulatory standards for air emissions and that there was no evidence its fracking of the wells harmed the Parr family in any way.
The wells can be deeper than 8,000 feet, and the process fractures the shale around the well, allowing the natural gas in the shale to flow freely.
Eventually, some of the energy companies were dismissed from the case, and some reached settlements before the trial.
He said he believes the Parrs' court victory -- which he says is the first jury award for personal injury in a U.S. fracking case -- "marks an important precedent for the future of natural gas production."
Wendy May, a Dallas-based attorney who represented a prior defendant in the case before that company was dismissed from the lawsuit, says she doesn't think the Parrs' jury award will survive an appeal.
Gail Wurtzler, another environmental defense attorney, agrees with May that this is a one-off case because of the "situational" facts involved.
I don't trust this company," Lisa Parr said.
"We are not anti-fracking or anti-drilling.
If you are going to put this stuff in close proximity to homes, be respectful and careful."
