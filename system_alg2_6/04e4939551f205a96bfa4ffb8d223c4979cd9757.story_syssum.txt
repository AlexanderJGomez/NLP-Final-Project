It was a little tougher than the scoreline suggests," Lions head coach Warren Gatland said after the match in Hong Kong.
Then after just eight minutes South African Schalk Brits, forgetting any club loyalty, sent a punch towards his Saracens teammate and Lions flyhalf Owen Farrell, earning the Barbarians' hooker a yellow card and 10 minutes off the field.
"From our point of view, the good thing is that Owen wasn't injured or knocked out, and from a rugby perspective I'm glad (Brits) wasn't sent off, it was just a yellow card, because it would have been less of a workout for us and the rugby as a spectacle," said Gatland.
O'Connell was pleased with the performance from a team that has only had a few weeks to bond.
"Going forward I think these players that have played tonight have laid down a marker and the players that get picked and play against the Force they will know they will have to perform," the New Zealander said.
"Today's performance wasn't about Australia it was about us, and us putting down some foundations in place; the first two or three games are about that.
