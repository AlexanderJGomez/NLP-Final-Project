Now, Iqbal is considering suing the U.S. government for unlawful detention.
It would not be the first lawsuit brought against the U.S. government by a former Guantanamo detainee.
"I never [made] that statement," Iqbal said.
Six months after he was admitted to Guantanamo, Iqbal said he tried to kill himself.
Former President Bush and other senior officials have repeatedly denied that the U.S. government used torture to extract intelligence from terror suspects.
With the help of a U.S.-based lawyer, Iqbal was released in September without ever being charged.
