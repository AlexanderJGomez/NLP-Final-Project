But with U.S. and Europe shrinking from the fight, this rag-tag band of civilian volunteers know they could be the first, last and only line of defense if Moscow rolls into this corner of northeast Ukraine.
Now, with Russia estimated to be massing up to 88,000 troops just across the border from Ukraine's eastern frontier, he finds himself marshaling a newly formed self-defense committee.
Fedorok said they've also been getting refresher courses from friendly Ukrainian army officers in recent days.
This region is home to sweeping expanses of farmland and scattered forests, classic terrain for a tank war -- the kind of scenario both Soviet and NATO forces drilled for during the Cold War years.
We know this outpost is only an effort to slow down the Russians," Fedorok said matter-of-factly.
The major, who declined to give his name, said the order was to defend the bridge or blow it up if the Russians advanced across the border.
The major said he could scarcely believe he was on high alert to battle troops from Moscow.
The Pentagon's latest figures put the number of Russian troops massing just over the border at about 40,000.
He suggested Ukrainian ultra-nationalists had been threatening ethnic Russians and driving them out of their homes and businesses -- the same accusations that Moscow used as a pretext to intervene in Crimea.
