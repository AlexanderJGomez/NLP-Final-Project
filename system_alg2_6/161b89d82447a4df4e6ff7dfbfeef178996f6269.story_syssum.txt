(CNN) -- Barcelona failed to keep pace in the La Liga title race with record breaking Real Madrid Saturday after being held goalless at Getafe.
It was a rare failure to register on the score sheet for Messi, all the more galling after his scoring rival Cristiano Ronaldo scored a late double in Real's victory the previous evening.
It left Chelsea three points clear of reigning champion Manchester City, who continued its fine recent form with a 1-0 victory at bottom side Leicester City.
It left Bayern 10 points clear of Wolfsburg, the second-placed side playing Paderborn Sunday in an attempt to close the gap.
