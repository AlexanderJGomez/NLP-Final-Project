"I'm going to stay on this," the President said Monday in an interview with BET, a network that reaches a predominately young African-American audience.
"As long as they're peaceful, I think they're necessary.
When they turn violent then they're counter-productive."
The President will be interviewed by both Univision and Telemundo on Tuesday, both of which are networks that target primarily Latino audiences.
