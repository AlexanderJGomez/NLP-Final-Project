London (CNN) -- Eight female badminton players were disqualified from the Olympics on Wednesday for trying to lose matches the day before, the Badminton World Federation announced after a disciplinary hearing.
The disqualifications mean the world's No.
In the first of the Tuesday matches under scrutiny, Wang and Yu played South Korea's Jung Kyung-eun and Kim Ha-na in a game in which "neither side seemed to be exerting themselves," the official Olympic news service said.
"These players, I feel for them a little bit, because this wasn't their decision; their team has told them to lose these games," he said.
The Chinese Olympic delegation "fully respects the Badminton World Federation's decision to punish" its athletes, it said in a statement.
"Chinese players failed to demonstrate their fighting spirit of the national team.
Competition has been dominated by China, Indonesia, South Korea and Denmark, according to the federation.
