The Scottish government released al-Megrahi from prison just over a year ago on the grounds that he had cancer and was not likely to live more than three more months.
"At three months, just over half [of people with his cancer] would be dead," Swire said.
Swire thinks al-Megrahi feels guilty about having withdrawn his appeal, since it leaves him with no way to clear his name or for those -- like Swire -- who think he is innocent to have the case reviewed.
Menendez noted that on August 20, 2009, al-Megrahi stepped off a plane into the arms of a cheering throng in Libya.
The case has outraged many on both sides of the Atlantic and led U.S. senators to demand answers from Scotland about the details of his release.
