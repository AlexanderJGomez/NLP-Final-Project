London (CNN) -- Two men went on trial Friday accused of the "cowardly and callous murder" of British soldier Lee Rigby, who was hacked to death in a London street.
Leave our lands and you will live in peace."
Footage from a different surveillance camera showed two men dragging the soldier's limp body from the sidewalk into the middle of the road.
Whittam, the prosecutor, said the defendants were armed with a meat cleaver, knives and a revolver when they got out of the car.
When police arrived at the scene, the two men moved toward their vehicle, Whittam said.
While the gun carried by Adebowale was not loaded, he also had on him the bloodstained knife he'd used to attack Rigby, the prosecutor said.
Jurors were also shown pictures of the bloodied weapons allegedly used by the two men.
Some family members left crying as images were shown of the soldier shortly before the attack, as he left the public transit system in Woolwich.
The car allegedly used by the suspects was also caught on surveillance video maneuvering in the vicinity of the street where Rigby was attacked later that day.
