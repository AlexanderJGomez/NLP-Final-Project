(CNN) -- With extreme heat and the worst drought in half a century continuing to plague the farm states, there are important lessons to be learned for all of us -- farmers, consumers and the world's poorest populations alike -- about the effect of climate change.
Will high commodity prices affect the prices of food you eat?
People in rich countries like the U.S. are not going to eat much less or much differently as a result of modestly higher prices.
In 2008 and 2011, when corn prices went up to levels nearly as high as today's, the world saw a sharp rise in food riots.
Record high temperatures are occurring with far greater frequency than in decades past, and crop yields decline sharply in extreme heat.
This summer's extreme heat may just become typical in 15 years.
And farmers planted much earlier than usual, many using new drought-tolerant varieties.
