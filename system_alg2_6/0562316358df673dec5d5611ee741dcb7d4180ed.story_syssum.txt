The 2009 champion from Argentina and Snedeker, who tied for third at Augusta in 2008, both shot three-under par rounds of 69 to finish on seven under par, one shot ahead of Australia's Adam Scott, who also shot 69 on Saturday.
Woods is tied for seventh place with South Africa's Tim Clark whose five-under par round of 67 was the best of the day.
His ball also found water at the 15th which contributed two more dropped shots before bogeying the 16th to leave McIlroy five over for the tournament.
Defending champion Bubba Watson posted a two-under par round of 70 -- his best round of the week -- to leave him in a tie for 28th on two-over par.
