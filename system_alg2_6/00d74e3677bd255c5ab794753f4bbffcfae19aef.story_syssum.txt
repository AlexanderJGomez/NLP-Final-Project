(CNN) -- Comprehensive immigration reform.
What's the most important piece of comprehensive immigration reform you never heard of?
Many Americans think reform is about the 11 million unauthorized immigrants already living in the United States.
And they are sure to be the most contentious issue when the immigration debate resumes in months to come.
But we do.
Today, less than 10% of the native-born men in the labor force are high school dropouts.
But very few Americans with high school diplomas aspire to careers as busboys or home health aides.
No, we don't need as many immigrant workers in a down economy -- and far fewer want to come to the U.S. when jobs are scarce.
Unless we create ways for the immigrants of the future to enter legally, we're going to find ourselves in exactly the same predicament a decade or two down the road -- wondering what to do about 10 or 20 million unauthorized immigrants living among us but beyond the rule of law.
The only way to prevent this: a legal immigration system that works.
