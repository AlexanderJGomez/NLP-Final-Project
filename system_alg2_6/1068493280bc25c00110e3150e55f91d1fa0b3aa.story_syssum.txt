A laboratory in Maryland confirmed the presence of ricin after initial field tests indicated the poison was present, according to Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Terrance Gainer.
A law enforcement source said more tests would be conducted at the Army's biomedical research laboratory at Fort Detrick, Maryland.
A previous ricin scare hit the Capitol in 2004, when tests identified a letter in a Senate mailroom that served then-Majority Leader Bill Frist's office.
There is no specific test for exposure and no antidote once exposed.
Before that, he served in the Mississippi Senate.
