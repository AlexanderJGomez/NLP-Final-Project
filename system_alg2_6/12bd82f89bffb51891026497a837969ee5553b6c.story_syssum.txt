(CNN) -- After 60 years of waiting, Egyptians may very well find themselves with a strong, assertive Parliament.
The ruling military council is hoping for a weak Parliament; Egypt's political parties, however, may have other plans.
Because Egypt is still operating under a presidential system, with the ruling military council as the executive authority, Parliament will not be able to form a government.
At the same time, with the real risk of a military-approved candidate winning free presidential elections, a mixed system with a powerful president comes with its own pitfalls.
But the Parliament will be the only nationally elected body that can claim to represent the will of the people.
