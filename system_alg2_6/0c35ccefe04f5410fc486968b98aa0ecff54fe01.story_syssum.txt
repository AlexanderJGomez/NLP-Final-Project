The Justice lawyers  filed the notice of appeal and the proposed stay with U.S. District Court  Judge Royce Lamberth, who had granted the injunction sought by plaintiffs opposed  to research in which embryos had been destroyed.
In a 12-page statement attached to the appeal, Collins  said the court order prevents NIH from providing $54 million in funds to 24  human embryonic research projects currently under way that were expecting to  receive funds within the next month.
The legal arguments with  which Lamberth sided were brought by researchers opposed to use of embryonic  stem cells.
