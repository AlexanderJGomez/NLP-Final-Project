Belying the moribund state of the global economy, sales of luxury models are now leading the charge.
The booming Rolls-Royce sales figures come days after its former sister company, Bentley, posted a 37% rise in global sales, also on the back of rising sales to China and the U.S.
Between 2001 and 2011 there were only 133,000 workers in the industry, but they produced 16.1 million cars.
The Rolls-Royce brand was doing well, he said, because it married British heritage with BMW's sales and marketing expertise.
Industry analyst Paul Nieuwenhuis said that while many customers bought luxury cars "by the meter" -- that is to say they care more about the image than the machine -- modern Rolls-Royce cars were exceptional vehicles.
The rights to use the Rolls-Royce name have been owned by BMW since 1998 when Vickers sold off Rolls-Royce Motors, which also made Bentley cars.
