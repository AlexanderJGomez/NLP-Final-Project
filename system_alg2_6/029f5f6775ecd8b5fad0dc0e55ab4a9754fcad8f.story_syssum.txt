Obsidian -- a type of volcanic glass -- can produce cutting edges many times finer than even the best steel scalpels.
Dr. Green said he once helped documentary makers produce a program on surgical technology in ancient Egyptian, setting up a blind test on the cutting power of obsidian.
"The feel is very different because obsidian has no 'bite,'" he said.
"If you look under the microscope at a steel scalpel edge it looks almost like a saw, it has teeth, whereas obsidian is smooth even microscopically.
"For studies where trace metals from ordinary scalpel blades cannot be tolerated, these very special obsidian scalpels may provide the answer," the company says.
"It's very fragile and it's very easy to break pieces off."
