However, the arrival of Dutch coach Robert Baan as the nation's first technical director signals a possible revival of a country with a 1.2 billion population.
This grassroots project involves the All India Football Federation (AIFF) opening residential academies all over the country, free to athletes and providing education alongside football training.
Up until the 1970s, India, which has long been one of the world's top sides at cricket, was among the best sides in Asian football and the national team was even invited by FIFA to play in the 1950 World Cup in Brazil.
"India has been playing football, as well as cricket, for over 100 years," Roy told CNN.
Former Indian soccer star Baichung Bhutia, who briefly played for English lower division team Bury FC in 1999, added: "If the AIFF says India's not a sporting nation, then what are they doing there?
However the influence of England -- or rather the English Premier League -- still hangs heavy over Indian football.
The Indian Football Association (IFA), which manages football in West Bengal, organized the country's first international friendly between the hugely popular Venezuela and Argentina in 2011.
Last year, private company Celebrity Management Group organized a Premier League Soccer, spending almost $7 million bidding for retired World Cup players, including former France international Robert Pires.
He argues that AIFF should be working with and advising clubs on management, attracting investors and developing players.
"Here you have over one billion people; if you can make football popular, it will be one of the most popular things."
Along with Manchester United, Liverpool and Barcelona have also opened football academies in the country.
Das points out that this would be the first time that India would play in a World Cup.
