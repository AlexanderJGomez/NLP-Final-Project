The British Film Institute is about to release the full 144-minute version of The Shining -- 24 minutes more than previously seen in Europe.
In 1974 King and his wife stayed at the majestic Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, a small town at the foot of the Rocky Mountains.
There was one on the wood-panelled ceiling of the ballroom and later, when we checked back through all the pictures, we discovered that another had appeared on the photograph we took of the reception before meeting or tour guide.
The images were taken in different places, with very different lighting and of the 200 photographs we took during our holiday no orbs appeared on any other photograph -- nor indeed on any photograph ever taken on that camera before or since.
But for some fans of the film, ambiguity leaves a void which must be filled with conspiracy theories.
Which is good," said Harlan.
And if there is anyone out there with a good theory (conspiratorial or otherwise) about those we'd love to hear from you.
