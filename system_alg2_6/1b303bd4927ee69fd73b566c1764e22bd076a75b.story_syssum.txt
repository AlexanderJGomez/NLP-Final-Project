Carla Hughes met the victim's fiance at the middle school where she was a teacher.
"She took Avis Banks' life and the life of her unborn child because she wanted that life," the prosecutor said.
"I'm not asking you, I'm pleading with you, to spare my daughter's life," said Hughes, who is also a teacher.
Prosecutors alleged the murder weapons connected Hughes to the crime.
... She was met by a stone-cold killer," he said.
