On July 9 2011, the Republic of South Sudan was born.
I was born into Sudan's civil war and before I could read or write I was using an AK47 in the conflict between the Muslim north and Animist/Christian south over the land and natural resources.
Now there are a few in Juba and a significant need for more all across the country.
Why?
To do this we need to work together with world powers while ensuring that the resulting plans hold the interests of South Sudan at heart.
All around the world there is corruption, tribalism and division, as many find it easier to pick on those that are different, which is why we need to hold tightly to the good in this world.
