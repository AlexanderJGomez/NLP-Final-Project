A storm survey confirmed that an F-1 tornado touched down in Jeffersontown, Kentucky, east of Louisville, according to the National Weather Service.
In a statement early Thursday, Churchill Downs announced that the horse track would be closed all day for racing and training because of damage left behind by the storm.
Churchill Downs spokesman Darren Rogers said no one was injured, including any of the 1,400 horses stabled at the facility.
