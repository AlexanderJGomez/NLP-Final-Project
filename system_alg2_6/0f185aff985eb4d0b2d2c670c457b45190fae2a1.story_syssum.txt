"The president's policy is Gadhafi must go.
"What John McCain was suggesting (in the reaction above) frankly strikes me as a very dangerous argument -- that in a place where we have clearly limited interests, clearly nonvital interests, the United States and the president should (have) an open-ended policy of military escalation and say we will do whatever it takes to get Moammar Gadhafi out of office.
"I thought he did a good job talking about the signal we would send, that we are a values-based people, and stranding by these young people in Libya will serve us well in the future.
"I think it is a great speech.
"The president's speech tonight has made things even murkier than they were before.
It says limited action; we're not going to go any further than just protecting the people of Libya; we're not going to be for regime change.
P.J.
The issue is not with the policy.
"I was very satisfied with his speech tonight.
...
I think the president did a great job.
At the same time, he made very clear that in his U.S. policy -- and the policy of many of our allies -- that Libya needs to have a new government that responds to the demands of the Libyan people, and that we will pursue every diplomatic and economic means to that end.
And furthermore, I think he made a compelling case that these early U.S. actions really have accomplished what the United States promised to do, and that was to stop Gadhafi from killing other people.
What do we do then?
On the most important issue that he had to face tonight -- why he went in -- I thought he made a very, very strong case."
"The tricky think here is, when you have a president who does the right thing, but who does it four weeks too late, can you really say it is the right thing?
