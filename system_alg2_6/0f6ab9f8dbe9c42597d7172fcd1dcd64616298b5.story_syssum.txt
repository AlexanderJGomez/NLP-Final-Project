A video installation, called "A Letter Can Always Reach Its Destination," featuring people reading from scam emails, is one of the five winning pieces of the Abraaj Capital Art Prize unveiled at Art Dubai this week.
Hadjithomas said they chose 45 emails to read out for "A Letter Can Always Reach its Destination" from some 4,000 received over the years.
"Sometimes the stories are not very far from their lives of the people reading them and some were very touching to film.
A more personal piece comes from the Palestinian artist Taysir Batniji, who produced "To My Brother, which he describes as a tribute to his brother Mayssara, killed by an Israeli sniper during the First Intifada in 1987.
His work "China" features seven Chinese porcelain vases featuring key battles from Lebanon's civil war.
"Apart from being trade gateways, these cities were also sites of resistance and rebellion against the imperial powers," says the exhibition booklet.
Muller said the $120,000 prize money given in advance based on proposals allowed artists to make work that would not otherwise have been possible.
"Now in Dubai there's an art scene that's maturing so these political and critical artworks can be appreciated in a place like this," added Muller.
