1890 is also the year Carmelo Flores Laura was born, or at least, that's what his family and the Bolivian government claim.
The documents include a birth certificate showing his birth date as July 16, 1890.
Coles said the first red flag was the fact that Flores is a man.
The Gerontology Research Group has found a document that purportedly shows Flores is actually 107 years old, and not 123.
His son Cecilio Flores, who's 65 years old, has to speak loudly in his ear to communicate with him, but his memory seems to be in perfect shape.
"I was born here in the highlands," Flores told CNN in Aymara, with his son translating into Spanish.
Flores' wife lived to be over 100 years old.
They only have one detail in common: they have relatives who have lived a long time and children (who) also tend to live a long time," Coles said.
Cecilio is the only child of Flores still alive.
