Aberdeen, Maryland (CNN) -- The man who abducted the mother of Baltimore Orioles legend Cal Ripken Jr. from her Maryland home restrained her and appeared to have used her credit cards, a law enforcement official said Wednesday.
He also said police don't know of any relationship between the suspect and the Ripken family.
Police believe the suspect drove the woman's silver 1998 Lincoln Towncar throughout central Maryland but they aren't sure of precise locations and counties.
He died in 1999.
