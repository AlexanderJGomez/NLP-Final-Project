The first African-American president is confronting the delicate issues of justice and discrimination after renewed violence this week in Ferguson, Missouri, sparked by a grand jury's decision not to indict a white police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown, a black youth, this summer.
But he added that "nothing of benefit results from destructive acts.
"He doesn't want to be the black president.
"When Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son," Obama said.
But he had to confront the issue more directly later in 2008 amid a furious debate over the incendiary remarks of his then-pastor Jeremiah Wright.
For five years after Obama's seminal speech on race in Philadelphia, he tried to avoid racial issues but stumbled over the controversial case of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. who was arrested in his own home in 2009.
People who have seen him in private settings say the president speaks more frankly about race than he has in public.
Rogers Smith, co-author of  "Still a House Divided," a study of racial politics in the Obama era, said the president understood the symbolism.
