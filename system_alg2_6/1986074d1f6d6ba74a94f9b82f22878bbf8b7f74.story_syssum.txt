Louay Shabana, head of the agency, said more than 22,000 buildings were damaged or destroyed.
Israel said its offensive was aimed at stopping Hamas militants from firing rockets into southern Israel.
"The pervasive sense here among the population is one of overwhelming grief, so many families have been destroyed in so many ways," said John Ging, the top United Nations official in Gaza.
"This was not a war against the Palestinians," he said.
He said seven rockets have been fired from Gaza into Israel since Sunday's cease-fire declaration.
