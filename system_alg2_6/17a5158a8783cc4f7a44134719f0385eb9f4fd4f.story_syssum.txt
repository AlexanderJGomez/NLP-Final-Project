Marching band director Jonathan Waters was fired Thursday after the report's release, Ohio State University President Michael Drake said.
These tricks were to be performed by members "on command or at their own volition," the report said.
When Waters was asked by investigators about the offensive nicknames, he said "50%" were probably "questionable," according to the report.
It is unclear what steps Waters will take next, Axelrod said.
Jon was Ohio State.
