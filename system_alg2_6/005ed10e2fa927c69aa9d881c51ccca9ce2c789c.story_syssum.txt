(CNN)At least 10 people and two attackers were killed in Tuesday's attack against the luxurious Corinthia Hotel in Tripoli, Libya, a spokesman for a security division of the Ministry of Interior in Tripoli said.
Al-Naas earlier said at least two Libyan security personnel had been killed in the attack and that three gunmen were holed up in the hotel.
Al-Libi was an alleged al Qaeda operative accused of involvement in the bombing of U.S. embassies in Africa.
A witness to the events told CNN that all roads leading to the Corinthia Hotel had been sealed by security forces.
