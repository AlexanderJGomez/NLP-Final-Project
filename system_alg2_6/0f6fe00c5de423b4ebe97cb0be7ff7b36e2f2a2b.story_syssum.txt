Babies of women taking SSRIs were born earlier and were more likely to have been admitted to intensive care.
The new study, led by Dr. Najaaraq Lund, of Aarhus University, in Denmark, found that babies whose mothers had taken SSRIs were born earlier and were more likely to require treatment in an NICU.
Lund and her colleagues tackled this issue by including a group of women who reported a history of some type of psychiatric illness but weren't taking SSRIs.
Antidepressant medication is just one part of the equation in addressing women's mental health during pregnancy, notes Oberlander, who says depression in pregnancy is a "huge public health issue" with lasting implications for women and their children.
"As depression itself can influence birth outcome in a negative direction, treatment is warranted in some cases based on the existing body of evidence," Lund says.
