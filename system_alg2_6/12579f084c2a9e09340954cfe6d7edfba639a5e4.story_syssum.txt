If the plan is actually passed, Hong Kong will get universal suffrage in the narrow sense that eligible voters will be the ones to pick the chief executive, not an election committee.
And surprise, surprise: the nominating committee will be modeled on the old election committee.
This new system is unlikely to be established because it must be approved by a two-thirds vote of Hong Kong's legislature.
But whatever one thinks of Occupy Central's goals and tactics, it has given voice to the more general public desire for genuine democracy and to frustration at Beijing's rigidity.
In the end, Beijing opted for the certainty of knowing that it could control Hong Kong's leadership by controlling the nomination process for the chief executive election.
But without genuine elections to legitimize Hong Kong's leaders, solving those problems will be impossible.
