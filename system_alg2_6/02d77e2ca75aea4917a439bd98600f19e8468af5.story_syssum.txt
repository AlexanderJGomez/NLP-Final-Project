What would it mean for North Korea's young leader as he is about to mark the first anniversary of the death of his father, Kim Jong Il?
"The question is what does Kim Jong Un intend?
"He wants to show his people after one year in leadership, North Korea is a strong military, technological, space, nuclear power (with) nuclear weapons," Richardson said.
"I think this is very important to Kim Jong Un to build political legitimacy and bolster the spirits of his people," he said.
"This is a tremendous psychological boost vis-a-vis the South," Park said referring to the fact that South Korea has not yet put a satellite in space.
The rocket launch allows Kim to establish military security for North Korea, said Park, and allows him to move forward with another priority: economic progress.
"In the big scheme of things, Kim Jong Un must have thought that North Korea would be taken more seriously (after a rocket launch)."
Sigal said.
"He's saying to the world, 'Look, I'm back,'" Richardson said about Kim Jong Un.
Sigal said the only way to get what Washington wants on the nuclear front is to come to the table.
Sigal likes to say that there is only one thing tougher than negotiating.
