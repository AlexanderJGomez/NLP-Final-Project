Shanghai (CNN) -- One recent afternoon, two 17-year-old migrant workers from the nearby province of Anhui came to an electronics market in this Chinese metropolis with one goal in mind: To purchase a smartphone.
"The migrant workers are different than before," Wang said.
"China has long had a very active, even militant, working class," said Jack Linchuan Qiu, an assistant professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong's communication and journalism school, who researches information and communication technologies and their impact on labor movements in China.
"This is all possible because they have smartphones," Qiu said.
Technology is of no use if no one has the political will."
"Am going to bed now," posted one migrant who writes under the name "Blue Piano" on Sina Weibo.
Marry.
It is only under particular circumstances they get the spotlight, but what we are seeing is a big sign of what could happen further down the road."
