Taking a cue from some of its competitors, Apple on Tuesday announced a smaller version of its popular iPad tablet -- the iPad Mini.
The iPad Mini's display will be nearly an inch bigger than those of competitors like Amazon's Kindle Fire and Google's Nexus 7.
"This isn't just a shrunken-down iPad," Schiller said.
said Schiller, while presenting an update of the company's smallest desktop computer, the Mac mini.
Both the Mac Mini and the new MacBook Pro begin shipping today.
The Kindle Fire is great for buying books, movies and shows from Amazon, and the Nexus 7 has Google's well-stocked Play store for media and apps.
The smaller iPad's screen is expected to have the same aspect ratio, so those apps would work the same on the new device.
A smaller, lighter device is more portable, and people might not be as afraid of taking a cheaper tablet out into the big bad world where it would be less protected.
