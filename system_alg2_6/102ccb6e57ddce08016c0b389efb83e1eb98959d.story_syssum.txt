The U.S. government suspended its aid Wednesday amid the instability near the Turkish border, State Department officials said.
In the Bekaa in eastern Lebanon, where thousands of Syrian refugees were living in tents, emergency crews were distributing aid, it said in a statement.
"Reports from Syria and parts of Turkey spoke of similarly grim conditions there," it said.
