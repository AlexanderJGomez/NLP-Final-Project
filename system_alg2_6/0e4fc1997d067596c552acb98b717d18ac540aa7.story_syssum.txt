"This magnitude 8.2 is not the large earthquake that we were expecting in this area," said Mark Simons, a geophysicist at Caltech in Pasadena, California.
Or it could be 50 years.
Simons says Tuesday's quake is of interest because the fault line along Chile's coast has constantly shifted during the last 140 years.
Given that it's an area of frequent quakes, and frequent ruptures, it may only be a matter of time.
"It may not occur for many, many years."
