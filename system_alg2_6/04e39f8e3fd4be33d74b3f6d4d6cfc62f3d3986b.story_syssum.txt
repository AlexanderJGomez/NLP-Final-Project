The police dashcam video, released Friday, shows Cottonwood Police approaching the group of eight people -- all identified as members of the Gaver family -- around a large SUV in a Walmart parking lot on March 21.
On the video, an officer tells the group that they "need to separate these folks and talk to them."
Police charged four members of the family with assaulting an officer and resisting arrest.
