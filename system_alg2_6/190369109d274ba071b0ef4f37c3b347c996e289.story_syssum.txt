Threats to rape and kill her were posted across the Internet as part of an assault that seemed intent on humiliating and silencing not only Roberts, but any woman who dares to speak up against inequality and expose the truth about how women are treated in our society.
This was not the first time such an attack was mounted against a woman advocating for gender equality.
These threats are not just happening to high profile women, but to women and girls everywhere.
It is a hate crime against women.
When such hate-fueled acts are targeted specifically at another historically oppressed group in our society, then they are seen for what they are, a hate-based violation.
It is time for the silencing of women stop.
