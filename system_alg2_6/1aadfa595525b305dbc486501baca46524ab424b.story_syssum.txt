The response of London 2012 organizers to the grandiose opening ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, such was the scope and spectacular nature of the Chinese curtain-raiser, was always going to pique curiosity.
The Beatles may well be a band form another century but the 28 million people who follow the now defunct band's official Facebook page suggests they are loved the world over as much as ever.
Jamie Fullerton - features editor for the NME (New Musical Express), Britain's pre-eminent weekly music magazine, told CNN: "What's really interesting is the set included bands like New Order and Happy Mondays, organizers tipping their hat towards the cult element of British rock 'n' roll music, which is very different to what you see at an event like the Superbowl.
Sales of British music abroad reached $2.9 billion in retail value in 2011 with British artists accounting for almost 13% of global sales of recorded music, according to BPI (the representative body of the British Music Industry) figures.
Geoff Taylor, the chief executive of BPI -- a body that represents independent and major record labels in the UK -- told CNN in a statement: "I think British people are more obsessed by music than any other people in the world, they buy more CD albums per capita than any other nation, it's fundamental to our life.
We ran a survey last year to ask whether the UK population thought that we'd made an important contribution to world music.
Ultimately, the success of the opening ceremony to the London 2012 Olympics can probably only be judged properly with the perspective of hindsight and when measured against the others that have gone before it.
