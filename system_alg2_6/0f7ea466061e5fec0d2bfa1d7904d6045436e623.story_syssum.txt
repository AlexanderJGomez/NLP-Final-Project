"Puss in Boots" cost $130 million to produce, and it earned Dreamworks' third-worst debut for a computer animated film, beating only "Flushed Away" and "Antz," which started with $18.8 million and $17.2 million, respectively.
The found footage horror sequel has scared up $81.3 million after ten days in theaters, and considering the huge business the film will likely do on Halloween, "PA3" is only a day away from passing Paranormal Activity 2's $84.8 million cume.
Fox's $40 million Justin Timberlake/Amanda Seyfried thriller "In Time" underwhelmed with just $12 million in its opening weekend.
The $24 million production has now earned $38.5 million after 17 days in theaters, and it will pass the total of Julianne Hough's first feature film, "Burlesque" ($39.4 million), sometime this week.
The $50 million picture marks the third straight box office disappointment for FilmDistrict, the young distributor that found success with Insidious ($54 million) earlier this year.
It has earned $1.5 million so far.
