Why would they do that?
First, I am surprised that, before this study, most people assumed that children wouldn't engage in a behavior that is so common in teenagers and young adults.
Anyone who has children knows that they are subject to the same powerful emotions as adults.
The final thing about non-suicidal self-injury that surprises me is that it occurs at all.
This is more often the case with women and usually involves cutting the skin, although I've treated patients over the years who were addicted to other types of self-damaging behavior, such as hitting themselves in the face or inserting sharp objects into various bodily orifices.
You'd think that people who recurrently injured themselves would be at increased risk of committing suicide, but this is far from clear.
Young adult females make 25 suicide attempts for every one completed suicide.
Older men make 1.6 suicide attempts for every completed suicide.
