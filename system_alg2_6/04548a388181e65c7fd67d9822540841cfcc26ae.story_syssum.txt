Gibbs, an Auburn, Alabama, native who has worked for Sen. Fritz Hollings, the Democratic Senatorial Committee and Sen. John Kerry's presidential campaign, was communications director and then a senior strategist for the Obama campaign.
Dan Pfeiffer, current communications director with the transition team, will be Obama's deputy communications director.
Two sources close to the transition team said New York Federal Reserve President Timothy Geithner is "on track" to be offered the Treasury secretary post.
Geithner began working with the Treasury Department in 1988 in the International Affairs division.
The two sources close to the transition team said they do not consider Richardson's appointment to the Commerce Department to be a done deal.
Also Friday, Sen. Hillary Clinton's camp shot down reports that she had agreed to accept the secretary of state position.
The sources said Jones has been given the impression by Obama that the job is his if he wants it.
