(CNN)  -- Actor Wendell Pierce's biggest role today is running the Pontchartrain Park Community Development Corp., which is hard at work trying to rebuild the New Orleans neighborhood devastated by Hurricane Katrina.

In the middle of it was this wonderful golf course created by Joseph Bartholomew, who did most of the golf courses in New Orleans but couldn't play on any of them.
PIERCE: It's going great.
We have the properties, the homes; we have people qualified with the bank, and we are still trying to access the money.
That's because the state is hostile to the city and is trying to reappropriate the money to other parts of the state and not to the city of New Orleans.
And there's $3 billion to assist them to get back in their homes, and the state is not doing anything to help them out.
Because it's a concerted effort to reappropriate the money and keep the poor and black people out.
PIERCE: We have everyone imaginable; we have elderly, we have young couples trying to get in, we have 80-year-olds trying to get back into their properties.
CNN: The government's not rebuilding New Orleans.
PIERCE: It's no good to build one or two houses in a city that has 50,000 blighted properties.
My  group is not put together to do a hundred houses.
PIERCE: Yes, I do play the trombone, but I play very poorly, so they turn my mic off, and my sound double plays.
