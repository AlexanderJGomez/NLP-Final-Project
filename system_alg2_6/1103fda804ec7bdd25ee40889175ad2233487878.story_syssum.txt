Kessler's death is a reminder that stings can be deadly for those with an allergy to certain insects, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology said Friday.
Typically, when stung by an insect, a person will have no reaction or a mild local reaction, such as redness, swelling or itching at the site of the sting.
Even if the reaction is not severe, Benadryl will help with normal symptoms of insect stings, Capes said.
Besides anaphylaxis, people may experience other kinds of reactions, Bassett said.
In rare cases, even mosquito bites can lead to anaphylaxis, Bassett said.
