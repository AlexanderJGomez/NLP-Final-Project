And as trivial as it may seem, a lot of that had to do with Red Lobster.
It meant twice, sometimes three times a year, a poor family like mine could order a steak in a middle-class restaurant and pretend we were rich.
But statistics suggest that we haven't been going to restaurants like Red Lobster the way we used to, and it's not because our collective palate has changed.
But for black households like the one I grew up in, income fell by nearly 11%, more than twice the rate of Latino homes and three times that of whites.
And that may not seem like much until you realize that almost every year since 1983, a series of small ticks like those two examples has been widening the gap between between what we earn and what we can buy.
It's just the one that happens to have an interesting tie to the poor folks I knew.
That also happens to be the same year Red Lobster was founded.
