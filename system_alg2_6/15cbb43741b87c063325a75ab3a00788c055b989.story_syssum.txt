The world finally knows how to address the latest addition to the British royal family: HRH Prince George Alexander Louis of Cambridge.
Authors Mary Anne Evans and Eric Arthur Blair also chose George as their pen names: George Eliot (1819-1880) and George Orwell (1903-1950) respectively.
The name "Alexander" is a feature of the Dutch royal family: Willem-Alexander ascended to the throne after the abdication of his mother Queen Beatrix earlier this year.
No British monarch has been named Louis, but it is very popular across the English Channel in France, where 18 kings have taken the name from 814 onward.
