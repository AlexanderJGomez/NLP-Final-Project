Sopo says his grandfather was murdered by the Castro regime.
According to analysts, as more Cuban-American millennials begin to question the embargo, more will begin to abandon their Republican roots for the Democratic Party, like Sopo did.
At a debate sponsored by CNN in Florida earlier this week, Crist said he wouldn't be willing to go so far as meeting with Raul Castro, but he defended his opposition to the embargo.
Twenty nine-year-old old Chicago-based writer Hector Luis Alamo, who is of Puerto Rican and Honduran descent,  says people in his generation feel that "It's about damn time" for the embargo to end.
"For the first time in more than 50 years, shifting politics in the United States and changing policies in Cuba make it politically feasible to re-establish formal diplomatic relations and dismantle the senseless embargo", wrote the Times' editorial board.
"The Cuban-American community is definitely different from that of several years ago," says Professor Mauricio Font, Director of New York University's Bildner Center for Western Hemisphere Studies.
Furthermore, the 'historicos' who came to the U.S. in the late '50's and 60's are also experiencing attrition from aging."
