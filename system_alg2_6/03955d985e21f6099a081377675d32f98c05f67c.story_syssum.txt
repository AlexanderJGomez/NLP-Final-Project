(CNN) -- The Gettysburg Address was a quick-hitting speech that was built to last.
His words are some of the most memorable in American history, forever stamping our collective minds with "four score and seven years ago," and "all men are created equal," and of course a "government of the people, by the people, for the people."
Lincoln was able to get straight to the point and deliver a punchy speech in part because he came after Edward Everett's marathon presentation about the war, explains James Cornelius, curator of the Lincoln Collection in the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum.
Lincoln just said in two minutes what Everett tried to say in two hours.
We found that people in some states, like Delaware, were particularly fond of quoting the address and that different parts of the speech were more popular in some states than others.
Pretty much everyone knows this part of the Gettysburg Address, even if they think a score is just something from sports.
That, and people tend to remember the beginnings of speeches, Cornelius said.
Little doubt exists that Lincoln opposed slavery, and in fact loathed it, Cornelius said.
This part was the second-most-mentioned phrase in the entire speech, rivaling "four score and seven years ago" in popularity, despite the fact that it's not a particularly well-known part of the Gettysburg Address.
They felt so strongly about preserving the union and ending slavery that you should not let their efforts carry into the wind.
There are five versions of the speech, and one of them omits those two words.
Even Lincoln himself is said to have used a version of the phrase in a letter 20 years before the address, Cornelius said.
Maybe that's why people can't help but post the speech on social media, 150 years after the fact.
Why do you think the Gettysburg Address endures today, and why do some lines seem to resonate more with different places and groups in the United States?
