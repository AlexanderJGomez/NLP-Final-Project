Among the items going under the hammer at Henry Aldridge & Son is a canvas bag that might have been used to lift the infant Dean from a lifeboat to a rescue ship, said Alan Aldridge of the auction house.
Given that the auctioneer cannot prove Dean was rescued in the bag, "we expect it to fetch £3,000 ($4,480).
She's paying £3,000 a month in nursing home fees," he said -- the amount he hopes her canvas bag will sell for.
Dean's previous sale, in October, raised just over £30,000, Aldridge said.
The auction will include 17 items from her collection, most of them memorabilia related to the Titanic and signed by her but not from the ship itself.
Dainton-West, who was 10 months old when the ship went down, died in October 2007, the auctioneer said.
