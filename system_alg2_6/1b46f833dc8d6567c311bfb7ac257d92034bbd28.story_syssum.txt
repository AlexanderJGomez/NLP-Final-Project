The Olympic and Paralympic sprinter is facing a maximum five-year prison sentence after he was found guilty of the negligent killing of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on February 14, 2013.
Born with a congenital abnormality, Pistorius, 27, had both his legs amputated below the knee before his first birthday, but through sheer determination carved out a career in world-class athletics.
In a story titled "The Fast Life of Oscar Pistorius" published in the New York Times, writer Michael Sokolove wrote: "Pistorius is, as well, blessed with an uncommon temperament -- a fierce, even frenzied need to take on the world at maximum speed and with minimum caution."
In an exclusive interview last summer, Arnold Pistorius said his nephew was heartbroken.
he told CNN.
"I grew up in a family where disability was never an issue.
He said thousands of people had sent messages of support from all over the world in the wake of the shooting.
Her father Barry Steenkamp told the Afrikaans-language newspaper Beeld: "It doesn't matter how rich [Pistorius] is ... and how good his legal team is.
In 2004, Pistorius took his first gold at the Athens Paralympics and one year later competed against able-bodied Olympics for the first time, at the South African Championships.
During the very last track event of the Paralympics, Pistorius again picked himself up and smashed the 400-meter T44 Paralympic record in a time of 46.68 to take gold.
When asked about his thoughts on being a role model, Pistorius told CNN before the shooting: "I think it's a massive blessing.
The message said: "No words can adequately capture my feelings about the devastating accident that has caused such heartache for everyone who truly loved -- and continues to love Reeva.
