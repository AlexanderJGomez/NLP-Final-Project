Sure, there may now be digital radio and more interaction between programs and their listeners today, Cliff explains.
The idea is to engage directly with listeners (and attract advertisers) and the early benefits are many, Cliff says.
South Africa will remain the largest smartphone market in Africa in the near-term with more than a million units being shipped there each month, the IDC said last year.
The most intriguing development, however, is what Cliff Central is doing on the hugely popular mobile communication app, WeChat.
"I think that's a real value proposition to an audience," Cliff says.
Closer to Cliff Central in South Africa, other web-only stations have popped-up in recent years.
Broadcast radio remains popular, free to listen to and attractive for advertisers, Botha adds.
He is clear that he doesn't want to replace radio in South Africa, rather offer something different.
