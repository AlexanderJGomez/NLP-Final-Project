Daniel Muvia, a resident of Chibok who witnessed the attack on his village, says he is too scared to take his daughters to school.
"I'm not feeling good that they're at home and I'm not feeling good to send them to school because of the attacks."
Analysts say that if the Boko Haram attacks on schools continue unabated then those levels of illiteracy will significantly increase, further compromising the future of the country's young people.
"If in Chibok, I'll never go again," she says.
