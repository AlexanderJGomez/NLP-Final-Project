Obama spoke with Richardson about the position November 14, a senior Democratic source said.
One of the most prominent Hispanic politicians in the nation, Richardson withdrew from the race for the Democratic presidential nomination January 10 and later endorsed Obama.
It's a very different situation in neighboring Arizona, where another Democratic governor, Janet Napolitano, is also stepping down to join the Cabinet.
Obama and Sen. Hillary Clinton both lobbied Richardson for his endorsement.
Richardson caused controversy in Democratic circles with his endorsement of Obama this year.
