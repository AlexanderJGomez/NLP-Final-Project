Mike Mette, a Chicago police officer, says he acted in self-defense when he punched Jake Gotthard, a student at the University of Dubuque.
Gotthard claims someone in Mette's group had stolen his cell phone and he wanted it back.
"That's when Mr. Gotthard hit me.
"[Gotthard] had bruises on the side of his neck, his arms, his elbow, his shoulders, on his back, that were simply not consistent with Mr. Mette's version that he only struck him once," said Assistant County Attorney Tim Gallagher.
Gallagher said the decision to prosecute Mette was a tough one.
"Mette played baseball in college.
Mette is currently on unpaid leave from the Chicago Police Department and is appealing his case.
