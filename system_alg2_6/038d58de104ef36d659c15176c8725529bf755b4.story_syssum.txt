And just 20 miles east of Kabul, Taliban "judges" operate openly in the back of pickup trucks, settling legal disputes between villagers in makeshift "mobile courts."

"We don't want a tyrant who oppresses the people," Fawad said when asked who he would vote for in the elections.

"There are cases of rule of law being taken care of by the Taliban instead of the Afghan government," said Col. Paul Kolken, a Dutch military spokesman at Kandahar Air Base.
"Karzai has really regressed over the past seven or eight years," Zarifi said.

"People are frustrated with things not happening," Mohseni said.
