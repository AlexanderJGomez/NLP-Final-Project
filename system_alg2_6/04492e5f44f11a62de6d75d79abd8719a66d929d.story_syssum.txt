It's just one of hundreds of activities and events which Copenhageners have organized to coincide with the 11-day U.N. summit taking place at the Bella Center in the Orestad district in the southeast of the city.
"It is, by far, the largest conference we have ever held and the largest political conference in Europe," the Bella Center press manager, Lars Lemche told CNN.
Outside the conference center solar-powered streetlights are helping light the car parks.
Inside the conference center delegates will eat from a menu that is 65 percent organic and drink water that has come out of a tap rather than a bottle.
Until about two weeks ago it's not been talked about a lot in the press and maybe a month ago half the people in Denmark didn't know there was going to be a conference," he told CNN.
Last week, police unveiled a 22-ton vehicle armed with a water canon which will be used if trouble flares during the conference.
So the city council have been trying to pre-empt it by sending postcards saying please refrain from going to these areas.
Perhaps the U.N. could take a leaf out of their host's book.
