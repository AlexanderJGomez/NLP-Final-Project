This week, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission held a scheduled two-day public hearing on a nuclear power plant near Victoria.
And that's exactly what rancher David Huber is afraid of -- a larger Victoria with a nuclear power plant.
Huber, a 6-foot-2 rancher with a thick Texas accent and an affable personality, said he loves his land and his way of life.
"Nuclear power is a high risk, high stakes business," said Jim Blackburn with Texans for Sound Energy Policy at this week's NRC public hearing.
No new nuclear plant has won final approval in the United States since the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, although site work is being done at a couple of locations around the country.
The situation in Japan doesn't seem to have any effect on those who steadfastly support the proposed nuclear plant near Victoria, Pozzi said.
"There's going to be nuclear power."
Those who oppose the plant said the site where Exelon would build the plant lies on a "growth fault" which doesn't trigger earthquakes but can cause the Earth to shift.
He did say all safety structures including vital safety cooling ponds would be located away from the growth faults.
"(What if) all of a sudden that (proposed) plant has a problem and there's an evacuation for a 10-mile radius?"
What do I do?
