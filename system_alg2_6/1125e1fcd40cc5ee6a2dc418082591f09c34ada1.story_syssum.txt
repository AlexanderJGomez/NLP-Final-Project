This was the concern guiding Arthur Brutter and Ido Bruno when they dreamed up the earthquake-proof table -- an invention that aims to provide affordable protection to people in earthquake-prone areas of the world.
The earthquake-proof table "transforms energy and absorbs it," says Brutter.
Brutter and Bruno estimate that 300 million children live in areas of the world prone to earthquakes with weak school buildings.
"It's always a good feeling to be recognised, but really it's not awards but exposure leading to the possibility of the table being used ... we want there to be no earthquakes, and we want it (the earthquake-proof table) to be used to save lives."
