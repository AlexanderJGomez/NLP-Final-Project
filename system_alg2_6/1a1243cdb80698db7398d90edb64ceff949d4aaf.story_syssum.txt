The Wisconsin River crested Sunday at 20.4 feet -- nearly 3.5 feet above flood level, according to the National Weather Service, putting major pressure on the 120-year-old Caledonia-Lewiston levee system.
The river is expected to begin gradually falling Sunday evening before dropping below flood stage by Wednesday, the weather service said.
CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said Sunday that there's no immediate end in sight to the flooding.
"Many of these rivers are all going to be dumping into the Mississippi River which then in turn will rise up and we'll see some flooding there, maybe in La Crosse and the Winona areas later in the week."
