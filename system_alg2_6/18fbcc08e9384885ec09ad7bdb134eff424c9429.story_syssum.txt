"So I ran and tried to cover her body and pull her out," Suleiman said.
Suleiman is one of three people in the video interviewed by CNN, with one of them saying he was shot.
The military has denied the use of live ammunition.
The beatings and the use of live ammunition against protesters, particularly women, have outraged Egyptians.
Others came to Suleiman's aid, such as businessman Ehab Hanna, who was also beaten up and shot after he tried to help the woman with the veil.
I tried to walk but fell to the ground, so they started beating me and Azza relentlessly," he told CNN.
He told CNN that he is filing a complaint against military leaders because they "dragged, stripped and beat" women and journalists.
He too said he tried to come to the aid of the veiled woman, who suffered serious cuts and bruises.
"Our troops do not just attack people for no reason," he said.
Where is she?"
