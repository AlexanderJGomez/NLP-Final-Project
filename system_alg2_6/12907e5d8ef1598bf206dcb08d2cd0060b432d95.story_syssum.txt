But in fact, the insanity defense is raised in less than 1% of felony cases, and it's only successful in a fraction of those.
The M'Naghten rule was thereafter widely adopted almost word for word in the United States.
The Durham rule was also criticized as vague and overly broad; many states rejected the test, and in 1962, the American Law Institute, or ALI, announced yet another insanity defense, which enjoyed immediate popularity with many legislatures and judiciaries.
Notice the difference from the M'Naghten test -- the ALI test accepts not only cognitive impairment but also volitional impairment as an excuse -- which is the loss of control or ability to "conform" conduct to the law.
Some states don't even have the insanity defense.
It may seem strange that a medical-sounding determination like insanity has different definitions from state to state.
But the law is fundamentally different than medicine.
With a success rate so low, many would say the insanity defense is effectively abolished already.
We'll reconvene after.
