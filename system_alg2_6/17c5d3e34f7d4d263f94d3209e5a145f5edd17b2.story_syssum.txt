Dr. Abhin Singla said he suspects a woman he treated this weekend was suffering from krokodil addiction.
Krokodil causes serious damage to the veins and soft tissue infections, rapidly followed by gangrene and necrosis, according to a 2013 study (PDF).
Geller said he hopes the drug "doesn't show its ugly face" in Georgia but said doctors across the country are aware of the drug.
CNN affiliate KOCO-TV in Oklahoma City spoke with a woman who said her best friend from Duncan, Oklahoma, died after using krokodil last year.
There have been many confirmed cases of krokodil abuse in Russia and Ukraine.
"This may be an inexpensive high compared to other drugs, according to its reputation, (but it) is more likely to cause withdrawal symptoms and be a real problem for users," Geller said.
According to the Joliet hospital, the five people brought in who may have used krokodil said they thought they were buying heroin.
