A patient being treated at a Dallas hospital is the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, health officials announced Tuesday.
The patient is believed to have had a handful of contacts with people after showing symptoms of the virus, and before being isolated, Frieden said.
The ambulance that carried the patient - ambulance # 37 --- was in use for two days after the transport but was adequately decontaminated, said Dallas city spokeswoman Sana Syed.
"The bottom line here is that I have no doubt that we will control this importation or this case of Ebola so that it does not spread widely in this country," he said.
He spoke about what's being done at airports to help stop the spread of the disease.
More than 3,000 people in West Africa have died after being infected with Ebola, according to a World Health Organization report from last week.
