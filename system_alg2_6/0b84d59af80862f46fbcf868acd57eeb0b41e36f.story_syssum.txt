A Pakistani military spokesman said the attack hit the wrong target.
"It's what Pakistan intends to do about its airspace," he said.
"If it's saying, in addition to the base closing, that it will no longer cooperate to allow the United States to use Pakistani airspace and there will be no cooperation on targeting and no quid pro quo where we would use systems to hit at insurgents or extremists which were threats to Pakistan as well as Afghanistan, then it goes much further," he said.
High-level Pakistani officials have supported, quietly, the U.S. drone campaign for years, he said.
U.S. officials have long prepared for Plan B in Pakistan, he said.
He said the incident was not a deliberate attack on Pakistan, the White House said.
The U.S. Embassy in Pakistan confirmed Monday that Munter said the United States is complying with the request.
