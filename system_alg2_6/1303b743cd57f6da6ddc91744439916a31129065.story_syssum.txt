The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland at the base of the neck.
"Our thyroid, even though it's a small gland in your neck, controls everything," says endocrinologist Karen Smith.
This is called hypothyroidism, and the symptoms are somewhat elusive.
"There is actually an acronym that we use for hypothyroidism," she said.
"Hyperthyroidism is when the thyroid is actually making too much thyroid hormone.
My memory was poor and I had a hard time concentrating.
"The treatment is very different from hypothyroidism; we are actually trying to slow the function of the thyroid down.
Today's most common treatment is anti-thyroid medications, which  slow hormone production.
Because there are certain risks with even mild changes in thyroid levels, those considered at high risk, including pregnant women and those with a family history of thyroid problems, need to get tested earlier and more frequently, Smith said.
