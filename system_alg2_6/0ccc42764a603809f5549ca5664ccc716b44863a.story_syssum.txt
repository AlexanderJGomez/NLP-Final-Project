Police found six people -- two men, two women and two boys -- dead in a home in a north Memphis neighborhood Monday, said Memphis police Lt. Joe Scott.
"We need the community's help," he said.
At least one of the wounded children also was stabbed, police told the Commercial Appeal newspaper.
"I heard about six or seven shots," said Wayne Bolden, a landscaper who said he lives across the street from the home where the killings occurred.
Monday, he saw many police cars at the home and heard about the killings, he said.
He said he had been asked by the police to counsel the family members of the victims.
Neighbor Leo Baker told WMC-TV he has lived nearby for 10 years but did not know the residents of the home.
"I've been on a scene where there were one or two or three [victims], but I don't remember anything this large," Guin told the Commercial Appeal.
