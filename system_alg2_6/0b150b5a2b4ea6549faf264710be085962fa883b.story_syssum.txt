Natalie Dylan, 22, said she has put her virginity up for auction through the Moonlite Bunny Ranch.
But as to why men would bid so much money on virginity, she said she has no answer.
Through the 1950s in America, women were expected to remain virgins until marriage, Carpenter said.
Today, about 95 percent of Americans have sex before they're 25, Carpenter said.
The new part is the Internet," Carpenter said.
Kiara Daines, a 17-year-old from Detroit, Michigan, said she's saving herself until marriage for personal and religious reasons.
Many people say losing one's virginity has different implications for men than women.
Generally people have been supportive, Dylan said.
Honestly, even if I didn't do this, I'd always be the girl who thinks prostitution is OK," she said.
