And more than half of those attacks were carried out by suspected Somali pirates, an international maritime watchdog group said Wednesday.
Somali pirates are still holding four ships for ransom with 80 crew members as hostages.
But because of the presence of naval vessels, the success rate of the pirates have decreased," Mody said.
That cargo is an easy target for robbers in countries that lack the resources to secure their shorelines, such as Somalia.
Those who have tracked pirate activity say it started in Somalia in the 1980s, when the pirates claimed they were aiming to stop the rampant illegal fishing and dumping that continues to this day off the Somali coast.
But at the same time, from the owner's point of view, there is no other way currently to secure the safe release of the vessel along with the crew and the cargo," Mody said.
