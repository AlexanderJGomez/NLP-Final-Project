Watch an interview with Regina Spektor Â»
CNN: Your song "Eet" is about forgetting the lyrics to your favorite song.
Regina Spektor: Yeah.
Spektor: I'm not really thinking that much of anything.
But I just love the fun of it.
Spektor: No.
I like things that are just all over the place.
Spektor: Yeah and some of the bad ones stick, and some of the good ones get forgotten.
Spektor: I feel that feeling all the time that I need to record before I forget it.
Spektor: No I've never been that not involved.
And I just got to come in and be directed more, be part of his take on a song, and that was really fun, too.
I don't know.
