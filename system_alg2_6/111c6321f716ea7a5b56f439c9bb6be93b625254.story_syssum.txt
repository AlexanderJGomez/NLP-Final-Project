Shank suffered severe brain damage after a traffic accident nearly eight years ago that robbed her of much of her short-term memory and left her in a wheelchair and living in a nursing home.
After legal fees were paid, $417,000 was placed in a trust to pay for Debbie Shank's long-term care.
"We assumed after three years, they [Wal-Mart] had made a decision to let Debbie Shank use this money for what it was intended to," Graham said.
Legal or not, CNN asked Wal-Mart why the company pursued the money.
Jim Shank said he believes Wal-Mart should make an exception.
"The recovery that Debbie Shank made was recovery for future lost earnings, for her pain and suffering," Graham said.
But just last week, the high court said it would not hear the case.
Jim Shank said he's disappointed with the Supreme Court's decision not to hear the case -- not for the sake of his family -- but for those who might face similar circumstances.
