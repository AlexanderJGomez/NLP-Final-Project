The first Iraq war combat veteran to serve in the U.S. Senate introduced legislation on Thursday aimed at reducing the number of military veterans who commit suicide.
The Suicide Prevention for America's Veterans Act is collaboration between Walsh and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America.
Currently, when a service member separates from active duty -- whether they are transitioning to being a veteran or becoming a Reservist or a member of the National Guard -- they have five years to receive care from the Department of Veterans Affairs, O'Gorman said.
To address that, Walsh's bill would extend the time to receive mental health treatment from five years to 15 years.
Currently, they use different drug prescription protocols, Walsh and military experts told CNN, and that can create a difficult situation.
The bill was introduced the same week that Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America held its annual Storm the Hill initiative.
But the senator stressed that it will cost far more in years to come if changes are not made soon to improve mental health care.
The Iraq and Afghanistan wars are the longest continuous battles the United States has fought.
Walsh's legislation, IAVA's O'Gorman told CNN, has bipartisan support.
Walsh said lawmakers must also address suicides amongst military family members, too.
The relatives have made "enormous sacrifices," he said.
