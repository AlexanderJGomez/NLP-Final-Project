by the Pew Research Center found that those who have a college degree believed that they make about $20,000 more per year than those who didn't attain a college degree.
The survey found that a majority of college presidents don't think it likely that we will make that goal.
Yet, for those who are college graduates, 86% said college was a good investment for them personally.
For those who did not receive a college degree, 30% said they had wanted to apply for a job, but had not because the job required a college degree.
