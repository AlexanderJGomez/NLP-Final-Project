(CNN) -- Two Alaskan volcanoes that began minor eruptions weeks ago are showing their strongest seismic activity yet, emitting small amounts of lava and ash along with smoke plumes, the Alaska Volcano Observatory said Tuesday.
The ash has at times affected those local flights.
"So far there's been trace amounts of ash, so it's just a fine coating," he said.
