What I want is not complicated -- a recognition that, when Salman died beneath the rubble that day, he died as a first responder.
In the months before 9/11, Salman had served as a cadet in the New York Police Department.
Salman was determined to keep trying to get into medical school.
When Zeshan and I left the house, at about 7:15, Salman was still sleeping.
Clearly, he did not make that decision and take that fatal detour as a lab analyst, but as the first responder he was trained to be.
Yet, at the 9/11 Memorial, his name is grouped among the miscellaneous victims, not among the first responders who sacrificed their lives, where it belongs.
But I will speak for him.
