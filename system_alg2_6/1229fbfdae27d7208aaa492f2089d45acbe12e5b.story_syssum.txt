(CNN) -- Israel's military said Tuesday it shot down a Syrian warplane over the Golan Heights amid what it described as growing tensions in the border area.
Militants in the area are trying to dislodge Syrian government forces from their last two strongholds in the area, the group said.
U.N. forces withdrew last week from the Syrian-controlled side of the Golan Heights, a little more than two weeks after Islamic militant fighters took some peacekeepers hostage and besieged others.
