Masters was convicted of murder in 1999, but a judge last year threw out the conviction and released him from prison, citing new evidence that did not implicate Masters.
Watch Masters the day after his 2008 release Â»
Masters: Yeah, I think that has a lot to do with it.
That's it.
I try and buy it cheap enough that I can make a profit on it, load it into the truck, bring it back to the house.
Masters: Not enough.

Masters: Maybe cell phones?

Masters: There's so much.
Masters: Yeah, in '92.
Masters: No.
Masters: I don't want to talk to them at all.
Masters: I don't know what I'd say to them.
Masters: Yeah, and every time I go over there I feel like I'm on the defensive, every time I see a police car with someone pulled over or something -- well, let me give you an example.

Masters: Yeah, pretty much.
