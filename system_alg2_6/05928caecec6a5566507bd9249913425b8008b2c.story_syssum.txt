(CNN) -- Though Sir David Frost doesn't see his 1977 interviews with former President Richard Nixon as "an intellectual 'Rocky' " -- in the words of "Frost/Nixon" playwright and screenwriter Peter Morgan -- he does agree that the sessions had their "adversarial" moments.
"I'm saying when the president does it, that means it's not illegal," Nixon said during the interview, cementing his ignominy.

"He was really carefree for 20 minutes, and then, just towards the end ... the screen came across again."

"We've found that people are so interested in this film that they want to see, again, the original DVD of the Watergate [interview], so we've done that," he said.
Many reviewers have made much of a scene in which a drunken Nixon makes a late-night phone call to Frost, an event that never happened.
