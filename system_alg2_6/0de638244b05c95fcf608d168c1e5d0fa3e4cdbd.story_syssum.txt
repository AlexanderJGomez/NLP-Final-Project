Los Angeles (CNN) -- Additional police officers were patrolling Los Angeles International Airport and two other airports Wednesday after a former Transportation Security Administration employee was accused of making a false threat against LAX, authorities said.
Onuoha, 29, of Inglewood, California, is a former screener with the TSA at LAX, FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said.
The caller told the employee that he would "be watching" to see if TSA was evacuating the terminals as he instructed, the FBI said.
Police cleared the terminals, but no threats were found, the FBI said.
