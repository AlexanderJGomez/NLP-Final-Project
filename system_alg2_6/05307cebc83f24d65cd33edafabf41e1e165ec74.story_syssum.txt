Suraya Pakzad tells CNN any deal between the U.S. and Taliban moderates should consider women's concerns.
"It makes me scared and everybody has the fear that one day [the Taliban] will be back again," Pakzad said.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will bestow the honor on eight other women on Wednesday, including Wazhma Frogh, an Afghan woman who heads Global Rights, which fights against domestic violence, marital and child rape, and sexual abuse in Afghanistan.
But even now, women are still targets of domestic violence, and Afghan girls have been attacked for attending school.
She said she hopes that one day, Afghan women will secure the same rights that American women have achieved.
