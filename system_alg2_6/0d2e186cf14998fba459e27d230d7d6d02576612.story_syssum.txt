(CNN) -- For the Dawsons of Tauranga, New Zealand, the canoe slalom event at the London Olympics will be a family affair.
As one of the gate judges, Kay Dawson has an important role, but her decisions will be scrutinized by other officials -- each gate judge also monitors the two gates on either side.
The International Canoe Federation, which selected her as the only judge from New Zealand for the Olympic event, agrees.
Despite the multitude of officials at the canoe slalom event, the role of individual judges is still significant, Kay Dawson has said.
He is not the only New Zealander competing in the canoe slalom: Luuka Jones, also from Tauranga, became the first New Zealand woman to compete in the kayak competition in the Olympics after qualifying for the 2008 Beijing Games.
