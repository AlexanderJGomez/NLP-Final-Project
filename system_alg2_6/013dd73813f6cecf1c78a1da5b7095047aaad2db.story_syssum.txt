According to testimony, police were ordered to use police vehicles to disperse protesters, Egyptian state television reported.
"The policemen are beating us to please their commanding officers," said Amal Eid, sister of a teenager allegedly killed by police on January 29.
The clashes began when the families of those killed tried to push their way into Cairo's police academy, the site of the trial.
Police chased the protesters and family members, beating some and arresting others.
In addition to accusations of ordering the killing of protesters, Mubarak faces corruption charges.
He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
