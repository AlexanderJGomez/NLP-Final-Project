(Tribune Media Services) -- We don't know where to look first.
Welcome to Antoni Gaudi's unfinished masterpiece, the Sagrada Familia, Barcelona's most famous site and Spain's most visited.
Luckily, Gaudi had made plaster models of the church (we see them in the museum at the site) and though they were also smashed, his supporters were able to painstakingly put them back together so the work could continue.
Sometimes, you have to know when to call it quits, even at incredible sites like this one.
"Cool," Erica says.
And with such friendly locals, there's no better place for the kids to practice their Spanish.
We're holing up overnight at the Hotel Arts Barcelona, a Ritz Carlton, a famous icon of the Barcelona skyline and a short walk from the beach and many of the city sites.
It's housed in three spectacular stone mansions in the historic quarter of the city and showcases works from the artist's early years, his Blue Period and early works from Barcelona.
I didn't really see evidence of that, but, after all, we were there at 8:30, early by Barcelona standards.
We are in Barcelona after all.
Erica unfortunately isn't.
We dig into our paella.
