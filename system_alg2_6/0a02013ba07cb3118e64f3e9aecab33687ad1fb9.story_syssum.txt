This music even has the ability to make us like our old Aunt Emily.
Then there's one that the marketers made sure really goes for the heart -- "I'll Be Home for Christmas" -- and the line, "if only in my dreams."
(Even if we never really liked her -- but then, it's Christmas.)
Next up are the seasonal songs that really have little or nothing to do with the holiday.
Of course, Christmas is children.
Then there are Jimmy Boyd's "All I Want For Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth", The Singing Dogs version of "Jingle Bells" and Homer and Jethro's "Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer."
I realized a while ago that indeed we all need a little Christmas.
Is there a Santa Claus?
So deck the halls and please stop leaving Santa those fattening chocolate chip cookies -- he's gained a lot of weight during the past 200-plus years.
