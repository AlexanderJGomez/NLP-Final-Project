(CNN) -- The assistant coach of Togo's national soccer team is among the victims of Friday's machine-gun attack on a bus carrying the squad to a tournament in Angola, the country's official news agency reported Saturday.
The team was headed to Angola for the tournament when it was attacked near the border between Angola and the Republic of Congo.
Angolan officials -- trying to assuage security fears that could dampen the war-torn nation's sporting aspirations -- vowed to heighten security, particularly in Cabinda, a disputed oil-rich enclave located within the Democratic Republic of Congo and the site of eight matches in the tournament.
"We vehemently condemn the ignoble action, lament the loss of lives, and we reiterate our commitment to guarantee security so that the CAN ORANGE 2010 (tournament) will firm itself as a great sporting event and a manifestation of friendship and solidarity among the African people," an Angolan government statement said.
It also marks the beginning of a year in the spotlight for African football, with South Africa set to become the continent's first country to host the FIFA World Cup in June.
