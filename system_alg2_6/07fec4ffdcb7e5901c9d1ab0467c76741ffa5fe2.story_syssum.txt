The gels, AndroGel and Testim, are approved for use in men who produce little or no testosterone.
The ratio of skin surface area to total body size of a child is much greater than in an adult, Murphy said.
Although most children's signs and symptoms regressed after they were no longer exposed to the gel, in a few cases the enlarged genitalia did not return to normal, and the bone age was still higher than the child's chronological age, the FDA said.
The FDA recommends that children and women avoid contact with the places where men have applied these products.
â€¢ Wash the site where the gel was applied with soap and water before coming into skin contact with another person.
