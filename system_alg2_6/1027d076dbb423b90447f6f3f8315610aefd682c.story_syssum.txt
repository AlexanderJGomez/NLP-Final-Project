For this we should all feel shame: shame that we live in a world where the lives of young girls can be shattered with impunity by fanatical thugs.
My heart goes out to the grief-stricken loved ones of these missing girls on this painful anniversary.
But it can be done.
Our common humanity compels us to do our part, to right this shameful wrong.
