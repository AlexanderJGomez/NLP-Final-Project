Los Angeles (CNN) -- Cast members of the hit television show "Happy Days," who are suing CBS, accused the company of "despicable conduct" for not paying them for merchandising revenues.
"People loved 'Happy Days,' and it's been on everything from bedsheets to lunch boxes."
The latest court filing follows a response by CBS to the suit last month.
The actors said CBS claimed it did not pay them for the "Happy Days" slot machine proceeds due "to oversight."
But in revenue statements sent to Pfeiffer after the lawsuit was filed, CBS did not include any revenue from four of those companies.
I'm hoping this case gives visibility to not only help us, but to help thousands of other individuals in the entertainment business."
