Addressing an audience of about 150 people at an Asian-American and Pacific Islander Ready for Hillary event, Tanden -- president of the Center for American Progress -- said she was looking forward to seeing everyone in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada.
Tanden, who has worked with Clinton since 1997, is very close with the former first lady.
When Clinton ran for president, Tanden served as policy director and adviser.
Tanden has not said whether or not she would leave the think-tank and join the likely Clinton campaign.
