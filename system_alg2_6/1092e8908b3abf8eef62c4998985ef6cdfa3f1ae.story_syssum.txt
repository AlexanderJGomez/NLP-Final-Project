"I am thrilled to report that Dr. Stacey Addison has gotten her passport back, and is now on a plane returning home here to Oregon," Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon) said.
On September 5, she was sharing a cab from near the Indonesian border to the East Timor capital of Dili.
The package was found to contain methamphetamine, Addison has said.
