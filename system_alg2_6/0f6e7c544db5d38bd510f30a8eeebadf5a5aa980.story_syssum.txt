WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The United States ambassador to Afghanistan, William Wood, said Friday that changes in communications with Afghan military forces have been made in the aftermath of a disputed U.S. air raid on an Afghan village.
"Speaking as an official of the American government, I can say there is no one who works harder than the United States does to minimize such casualties.
"The United States delegation expressed regret over the loss of any innocent civilian lives incurred during security operations," the statement said.
In addition, both sides recognize the need for establishing a mutually agreed-upon framework and mechanism to minimize civilian casualties and to maintain the strong support of the Afghan people in fighting terrorism."
