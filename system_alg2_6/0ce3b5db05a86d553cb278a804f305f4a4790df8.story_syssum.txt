Sterner had been picked up by sheriff's deputies on a warrant for a charge of fleeing and attempting to elude police in an incident in October of last year, his attorney said.
"This deputy ... she looked at me, she didn't believe that I was a quadriplegic, I guess, and she walked behind me with those handles on the back of that hospital-grade wheelchair and she just dumped it straight forward," Sterner told Tampa television station WTSP.
The deputy responsible for dumping Sterner from the chair has been suspended without pay, Gee said in his statement.
Trevena said his client would likely not file a lawsuit in the matter, because Gee has pledged to "make it right."
Sterner became disabled in a wrestling accident when he was 18, Trevena said.
