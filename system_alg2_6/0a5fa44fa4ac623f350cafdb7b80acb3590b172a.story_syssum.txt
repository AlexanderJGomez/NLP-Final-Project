As McCartney was awarded this year's prestigious Women's Leadership Award from the Lincoln Center Corporate Fund, CNN spoke to the mother-of-four about sustainability in a notoriously "unaccountable" fashion industry.
Both my mum and dad [former Beatle, Paul McCartney] are known to be vegetarians, world rights activists and environmentalists, and that definitely came into my place of work.
That's a hurdle, that's a challenge, but it's a worthwhile one.
I've had people say to me: "You'll never sell handbags, you don't work with leather and leather is luxury."
The fashion industry, is not really as accountable for some reason.
I'll always admit that it was easier for me to question people telling me I couldn't do something because I had a pretty nice place to fall back on.
