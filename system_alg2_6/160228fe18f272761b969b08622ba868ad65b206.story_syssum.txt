The plea deal may include prison time, but the NFL has not yet decided what football sanctions, if any, it should impose on Vick, a spokesman said.
For anyone thinking he should be let off easy for admitting his guilt -- think again.
Patricia Reese of Paola, Kansas Yes, I think Mr. Vick should be allowed to play football again.
Debbie Clayton of Greensboro, North Carolina He should never be allowed to play [in the] NFL or earn a dime associated with the NFL.
Angela Ziegler of Cleveland, Ohio The NFL needs to "step up to the plate" and be the man that Michael Vick is not.
Unless we make a policy that all players who are convicted of a felony are banned from the league, then Vick should be allowed to play after a suspension.
Dog fighting is brutal but if it's only dog fighting/killing, he should get whatever the feds give him and be able to return to football once his debt is paid.
Not by his fame, nor his race.
Everyone is equal regardless of popularity, fame, and race.
Leah Perry of Chelmsford, Massachusetts I don't think Vick should be allowed to play football, nor should he get off easy.
I do not think he should be banned for life.
I applaud the people sending Michael Vick jerseys into the Atlanta Humane Society to use cleaning the kennels, now that's appropriate!
He's through.
John Brandon of Old Hickory, Tennessee To make a long story short -- my family will never watch a game with Michael Vick in attendance.
