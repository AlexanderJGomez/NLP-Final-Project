(CNN) -- An apparent tornado touched down Saturday afternoon in a small town east of Kansas City, Missouri, blowing roofs off houses and toppling trees and power poles, the National Weather Service said.
The McNarys' chicken coop next to the dogs was turned upside down, but all 15 chickens were unhurt.
It's a mess," Jerry McNary told CNN Kansas CIty affiliate KSHB.
Stosberg said 80% of the town was affected.
