Teachers and doctors in Buenos Aires went on strike Wednesday and are scheduled to go back to work Friday, the government-run Telam news agency and other outlets reported.
"Provinces that have petroleum income, for example, are provinces that have better budgets, that have better hospitals" said Aldo Neri, a former national health minister.
The teachers say they want their raises by year's end.
They, too, want pay raises.
Educators also are on strike in neighboring Chile, where professors say they are owed a "historic debt."
