She said she thought she was going to die as her car crashed into the concrete and plunged into the water.
I thought I was going to sink with my car," she said from her hospital bed Friday, her left shoulder bearing the bruised imprint of a seatbelt.
Patterson said that as she watched the dust settle, she began to realize what had happened.
The woman's car was found at the disaster site, but she was not.
At least 100 people have come to hospitals with injuries, said Dr. John Hick of the Hennepin County Medical Center.
Friday morning's recovery effort went more smoothly than anticipated, Stanek said.
Stanek said National Transportation Safety Board investigators had told him that 60 vehicles were visible at the collapse site.
"If there's anything good about it, maybe we can look at other bridges."
President Bush, who on Thursday pledged federal aid to rebuild the bridge, will visit the disaster site Saturday.
