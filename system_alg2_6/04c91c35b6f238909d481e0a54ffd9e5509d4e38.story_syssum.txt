(CNN) -- Some years ago, I interviewed a pair of farmers selling pastured, hormone- and antibiotic-free turkeys for $4.75 a pound.
I thought of those birds recently when College Board President and CEO David Coleman explained sweeping changes planned for the SAT exam.
And, the SAT word will be no more, Coleman said.
You know these words if you took the test, its preparatory cousin, the PSAT, or almost any college-minded standardized test.
If the college exam tests only obscure vocabulary words, "students stop reading and start flipping," he said.
The SAT wasn't keeping them alive, he said, and flash cards weren't doing justice to many words, anyway.
Regardless, the test will never get much credit; if you memorize a word and use it often enough, he said, you're unlikely to be able to pinpoint that you learned it for the SAT.
"Everything is an SAT word to somebody," he said.
The SAT word is dead, long live the SAT word.
What do you think of the changes to the SAT?
