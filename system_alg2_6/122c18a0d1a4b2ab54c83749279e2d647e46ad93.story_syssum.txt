Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Hurling rocks and brandishing daggers and sticks, supporters of longtime President Ali Abdullah Saleh plunged into a crowd calling for his ouster in Sanaa on Friday as rising momentum in Yemen sprouted similar protests in other towns.
After midday prayers concluded, they marched from the gates of Sanaa University to the streets, where security forces and riot police tried to stay between rival demonstrators Friday.
The day before, at least 20 people were injured in Sanaa.
Aref al-Qubati, a participant whose friend was one of the victims, said police fired to disperse protesters.
Saleh has called for an investigation into the Aden violence, and Vice President Abdu Rabo Mansour Hadi met with the governor Thursday, Saba said.
In an attempt to quell growing discontent, Saleh, a U.S. ally in the fight against an offshoot of al Qaeda in Yemen, has announced he won't seek another term in 2013.
