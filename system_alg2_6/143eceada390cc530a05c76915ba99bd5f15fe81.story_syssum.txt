That was pretty much the last thing I remember," Beatty recalled eight years later.
But ... it's just the way it has to be.
He persuaded the Iredell County Builders Association -- of which he was a member -- to help Beatty build a wheelchair-accessible home with wide doorways and roll-in bathrooms.
When the house was finished, Beatty and Gallina decided to "pay it forward" to help other disabled veterans.
"There's thousands of veterans right here in our midst," Beatty said.
"The Gulf War vets have a lot of issues, and we know there are people who got hurt in Bosnia, Kosovo ... Vietnam," Beatty said.
Beatty and Gallina also want to help those who can't afford to buy their own home, many from the younger generation.
"When you have people saying thank you (by coming) to your home to swing a hammer and paint a wall, it says something different than shaking your hand and buying you a drink," said Gallina, 34.

Beatty and Gallina say their new mission is more than just providing veterans with accessible homes; it's about encouraging communities to get involved with those who served their country.
Kevin Smith is a Vietnam veteran from Newton, North Carolina, who suffered knee and back injuries in an accident aboard an aircraft carrier.
But when Purple Heart Homes built a wheelchair ramp in front of his home, it changed his life.
"They jump-started me back into life ... (and) said welcome home," Smith said, tearfully.
Why would we do it at home?"
