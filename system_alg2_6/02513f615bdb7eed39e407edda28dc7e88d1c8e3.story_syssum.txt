Jos√© Miguel Vivanco says conviction of Peru's ex-president is a warning to those who deny human rights.
Just a few years ago, Fujimori had near-total control of Peru's judiciary.
Just 20 years ago, it was exceedingly rare for even the most brutal leaders to be brought to book.
After the creation of UN tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, the world established the International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and serious war crimes when national courts are unable or unwilling to do so.
It is likely, however, that yesterday's verdict will help give momentum to efforts currently underway in many Latin American countries to bring other human rights violators to justice.
As Fujimori discovered yesterday, crimes they may be able to get away with while in power can come back to haunt them years later.
