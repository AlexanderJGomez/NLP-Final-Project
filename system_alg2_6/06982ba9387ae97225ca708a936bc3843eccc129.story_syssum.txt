Hamid Dabashi says protesters in Iran would be harmed by U.S. aid to "promote democracy" in that nation.
As the whole world is now a witness to it, the civil rights movement in Iran is a nonviolent demand to exercise people's constitutional rights to participate in the democratic aspirations of their homeland, turned bloody only by the custodians of an Islamic republic who seem to be too conscious of their own illegitimacy.
The only thing it needs is the moral voice of the American civil rights movement to come to its aid.
I would call it the Rosa Parks-Neda Aqa Soltan Prize for Non-Violent Civil Rights Movement.
But the other three swords are held over this movement from outside Iran, in fact from the United States government.
By wedding the freshly cut flower of Neda Aqa-Soltan's young life in the fertile soil of Rosa Parks' memory, Iranians and Americans will finally come together in their common dreams of basic human decency.
