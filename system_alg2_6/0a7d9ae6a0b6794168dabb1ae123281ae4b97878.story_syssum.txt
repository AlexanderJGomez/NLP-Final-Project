The airline does allow passengers with children traveling in first class or business class to board early.
"There are very few things a parent can count on when it comes to air travel these days, but one of those things was always the ability to board first to get your children settled in and all of their needs met before the throngs of people board the plane," said Hanni in an e-mail to CNN.
As a policy, American Airlines also does not specifically allow families with children to get on aircraft before general boarding.
JetBlue offers families traveling coach with children under age 2 to board early, the airline said.
