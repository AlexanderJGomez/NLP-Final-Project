(CNN) -- Delta Air Lines is reviewing surveillance video from an incident last week in which a 9-year-old boy boarded a flight from Minneapolis to Las Vegas, apparently alone and without a ticket, a spokeswoman for the airline said Monday.
The boy spent a good amount of time at the airport before boarding the plane, KARE reported.
A flight security expert said the incident highlights the gaps in security, especially when it comes to children.
Over the years other airports have had similar incidents.
He made it all the way to Rome without a boarding pass or a passport.
