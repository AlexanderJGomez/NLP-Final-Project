(CNN) -- Tiger Woods won his first golf tournament in more than two years, narrowly defeating fellow American Zach Johnson to capture the Chevron World Challenge title Sunday.
"If I don't make that putt it's in Zach's control," Woods said.
Even so, the PGA Tour website noted that Woods moved up 20 spots in the Official World Golf Ranking with the win.
In April, Woods likely will be among those battling in the season's first major, The Masters, which he has won four times.
