About 3,700 children in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone  have lost one or both parents to the disease, according to U.N. child agency, UNICEF.
In Liberia, the children's aid agency said it is training additional mental health workers to ensure children affected by the deadly virus get the support they need.
The U.N. children's agency said  it has received only 25% of the $200 million it needs for emergency assistance for families affected by Ebola in the region.
Ebola has killed more than 3,000 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and the United Nations says those numbers are vastly under-reported.
