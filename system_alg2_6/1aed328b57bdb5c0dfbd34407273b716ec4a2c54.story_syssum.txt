(NEW YORK) CNN -- After raising a staggering amount of money for the general election, President-elect Barack Obama must now rake in more cash for his transition and inauguration.
"I really do hope Obama sticks by his principles and does not accept corporate money, does not accept money from lobbyists, and places a very, very low ceiling on the amount of money he'd accept from individuals to pay for his inauguration," said Craig Holman, a legislative representative for Public Citizen.
Obama could decide to accept corporate donations for the inauguration, but impose tighter limits.
As of mid-October, the Obama campaign had spent about $594 million, but any money left over from the general election cannot go toward the transition.
