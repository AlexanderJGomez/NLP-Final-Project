Retired Col. John Leech narrowly escaped death at the Pentagon on September 11, 2001.
...
As he walked the now-renovated halls where he spent the morning of September 11, he recalled the horror of the day.
Among the 184 people killed in the building and on the plane were a 3-year-old girl and a 71-year-old retired Navy captain, the youngest and oldest victims, who were both passengers on Flight 77.
...
What little girl did that belong to?"
Seven years after that horrible day, Leech visited the chapel at the new Pentagon Memorial, a two-acre park, which opens to the public Thursday.
A lot of very good people."
