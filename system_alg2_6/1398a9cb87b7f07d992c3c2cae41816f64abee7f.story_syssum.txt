Now, thanks to some clever retro-style trading cards, we know the names of their characters.
According to the cards, Isaac, the X-wing pilot seen in the first trailer, is playing someone named Poe Dameron.
And Daisy Ridley, the actress we see speeding through a desert landscape in the trailer, is playing a character named Rey.
The movie is set to bow on December 18, 2015.
