WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Pirates off the eastern coast of Africa fired on U.S. sailors Saturday as they tried to reach the lifeboat where an American captain is being held, a U.S. official familiar with the situation told CNN.
FBI agents will debrief members of the crew on board the vessel before they disembark.
The U.S. Navy -- which is in charge of the situation -- requested help from the FBI to resolve the standoff.
That's kind of the way it is in these communities.
Pirates have been searching the waters off Africa's coast for the Alabama's lifeboat, a U.S. military official with knowledge of the situation said Friday.
The guided missile frigate USS Halyburton, with helicopter capabilities, has joined the Bainbridge in the area.
For the U.S. Navy, bringing in more firepower is more than just a means to resolve a hostage situation, said Chris Lawrence, CNN's Pentagon correspondent.
"Well, we got the international news stories on television on the ship and everybody's concerned about the route that we were on because there was always the possibility that we would be approached by pirates," one male passenger said.
