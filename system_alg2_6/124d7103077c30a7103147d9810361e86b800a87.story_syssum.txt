(CNN) -- Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said Monday he will appeal a Superior Court's decision to reverse Monsignor William Lynn's conviction for covering up crimes of offending priests.
"Monsignor William Lynn knew Father Avery had sexually molested children."
Williams said it is undeniable Lynn, now 62, was responsible for endangering the child.
