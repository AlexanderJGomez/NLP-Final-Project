(CNN) -- Gore Vidal, the eclectic author who faithfully chronicled the major shifts and upheavals in the United States in books, essays and plays, has died.
Vidal also appeared in a number of films, including the political satire, "Bob Roberts," where he played a U.S. senator.
The more they communicated, the more impressed he was by McVeigh, Vidal said.
Vidal "was always a gadfly," Bram said.
To be fair, Vidal had called him a "crypto-Nazi" first.
... And because I'm a writer, people think that I'm this poor little fragile thing.
He detested his mother ("drunks are not much fun to be around") and worshiped his grandfather, from whom he inherited his love for politics.
It was well-received.

Vidal himself once said of the book, "I sold a million copies and it caused much distress at The New York Times."
"I would say that since 1945, the United States, which was absolutely the 'mandate of heaven,' as Confucius would say, had fallen upon us," he told CNN in 2007.
"We share a plot, and I'll be there," Vidal said.
