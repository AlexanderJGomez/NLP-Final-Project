WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A lawsuit filed in California against Kellogg, Brown and Root on Wednesday alleges the company and its subcontractor were involved in a human trafficking plan that forced Nepali men to work against their will in Iraq.
When the Nepali men arrived in Jordan, according to the lawsuit, the contractors took their passports and drove them into Iraq.
Twelve of the Nepali men were taken by the insurgents and later killed.
Gurung and the families of the 12 men who were killed have brought the lawsuit.
However, the case led to increased awareness and enforcement of trafficking laws by the U.S. military.
