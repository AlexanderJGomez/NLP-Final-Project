Following CNN's 2012 interviews with several voice actors, John DiMaggio (best known as Bender on "Futurama" and Jake on "Adventure Time") had been finishing work on a documentary that sought to pay tribute to those unsung famous voices behind animated icons.
John DiMaggio: Larry [Shapiro] and I were in Amsterdam for a thing we've been doing for a long time called "Jam in the 'Dam."
It is a close-knit group of people, and it's a group of actors that really look out for each other.
It's just a really good group of people and that's what we wanted to show in the film.
DiMaggio: People are starting to recognize me at these conventions, but as soon as I walk away from the convention, people don't really know who I am, which is great because I love flying under the radar.
Some people say, "I want to get into voice acting because I have an interesting voice," but there's so much more to it than that, bringing characters to life through your acting abilities.
DiMaggio: That's a difficult call, from a producer's standpoint you want to bring in names just to create a buzz.
It's nice to see (voiceover actors) get more recognition, that's for sure.
