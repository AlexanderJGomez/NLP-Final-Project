Earlier this week, European Union data watchdogs, fighting to protect our privacy in an age of big data, put pressure on Google over the privacy of user information.
But these glasses, a kind of digital surrogate for our eyes, are strange in a creepy, Hitchcockian, "Rear Window" sort of way.
But in the eyes of the EU, those of us using products like YouTube, Gmail or Google+ are being, to borrow a Microsoft coined neologism, "Scroogled" by Google's new privacy policy.
But Google Glass opens an entirely new front in the digital war against privacy.
By getting us to wear their all seeing digital eyeglasses, Google are metamorphosing us into human versions of those Street View vans -- now thankfully banned in Germany -- which crawl, like giant cockroaches, around our cities documenting our homes.
Erin Burnett's strange "world seen through Google Glasses" is actually, as another leading tech site Techcrunch notes "the world seen through Google's omnipresent eye."
And the terabytes of data sucked up every five seconds by its omniscient glasses will, of course, flow to Google.
And Google Glass could, I fear, become the focal point for all our data in a world where privacy no longer exists.
You see, the whole point of Google Glass is actually to successfully engineer serendipity.
But what to do?
No, Google Glass must be opaque.
