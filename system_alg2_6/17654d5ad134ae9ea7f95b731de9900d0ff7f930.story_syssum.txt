(CNN) -- European leaders meeting in Brussels Thursday need to send Russia an unmistakeable signal that its military intervention in Ukraine will not be tolerated.
Putin wants to rebuild his influence over Ukraine as a whole and recognizes that the occupation of Crimea is more likely to unite the country against him.
Indeed, the only metric by which Russia remains strong is its ability to generate scary headlines in the western media.
One important focus of attention should be on political and economic reform in Ukraine itself.
Targeted measures aimed at the financial and personal interests of the Russian elite will also help to focus minds.
Travel bans and asset freezes aimed at Russian officials who supported and facilitated the invasion of Crimea should be combined with a rolling program of money laundering investigations into Russian financial assets held in western banks.
With deeper ties of energy and trade, European leaders feel they have more to lose and are reluctant to endanger what remains a fragile economic recovery.
