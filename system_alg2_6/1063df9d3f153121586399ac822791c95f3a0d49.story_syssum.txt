(CNN) -- If you've ever had a group of friends who have meant the world to you, take a look at the old black-and-white photo that accompanies today's column.
It wasn't to be.
In 1960, the three had been teammates on The Ohio State University basketball team that won the national collegiate championship.
Which is why the photograph of them taken barely three years later -- it was shot on October 17, 1963, in the Cincinnati Gardens -- is, in its low-key way, so mesmerizing.
I watched those friends on the court at every home game on their way to the championship; I watched that magical basketball friendship form and grow and become so strong that their team became the finest in the country.
"It's probably something the rest of us can never fully comprehend," said Lee Caryer, a sports historian who wrote the book "The Golden Age of Ohio State Basketball," and who knows every member of that championship team.
That's the lesson for all of us, as this new year takes its first faltering steps, and, all across the country, new friendships form and old ones seem to splinter.
But the friendships not only lead the way home.
