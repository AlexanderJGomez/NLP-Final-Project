Xavi told Barcelona's official Web site: "I want to hang up my boots here.
I wanted to know that I'm not going anywhere.
From the moment he became one of the captains of the team, with players like Puyol, Iniesta, Valdés, Messi and Piqué, he has shown the personal and sporting profile which proves that the youth academy has triumphed."
I'd like to thank the board for the support they have given me.
