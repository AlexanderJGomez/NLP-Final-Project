Who wouldn't have been?
Some of these "Dreamers" had been deported to Mexico by the Obama administration, though President Obama has repeatedly said that his administration is not looking to deport Dreamers--the name taken by young immigrants who are in the U.S. without papers.
Pending those hearings, the nine have now been released into the waiting arms of family members within the United States.
All nine will get asylum hearings.
The letter -- signed by Reps. Mike Honda, D-California, Raul Grijalva, D-Arizona, and Ruben Hinojosa, D-Texas, among others -- describes the activists as "victims of our broken immigration policy" who "deserve to come home to the United States."
Didn't Obama say that the Dreamers were Americans except for legal status?
Besides, Obama made quite a show -- before the election -- of announcing that his administration was sparing Dreamers deportation by offering deferred action and temporary work permits.
I think that many of these young people have a sense of entitlement, like most young people in the United States.
The Dream 9 are back where they belong -- in the United States.
