(CNN) -- It takes a special person to join Mensa.
But a new partnership between American Mensa and online dating giant Match.com offers a new, enticing reason to join the society of geniuses: true love.
Sereg found she does not connect with people who are athletes or sports nuts, for example.
There's no way to say if this person interacts well with others," he said.
The new Mensa partnership will give Match.com users a new way to find common ground, said Helen Fisher, a professor at the University of Indiana and Match.com's chief scientific adviser.

"One of the most recent marriages in our Mensa group came through finding each other on Match.com, and that was before the partnership," she said.
