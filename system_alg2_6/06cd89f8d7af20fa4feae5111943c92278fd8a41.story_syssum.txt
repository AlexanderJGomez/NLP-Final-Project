Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- The Mount Merapi volcano in Indonesia erupted at least three times Tuesday, forcing thousands of nearby residents to flee.
One of them was World Vision Indonesia, a Christian relief and development agency.
Usman said about 1,500 people -- mostly women and children -- had found refuge at a four-building shelter about 7 miles (12 kilometers) from the volcano.
Usman had reported earlier that traffic was heavy as people left the region near the mountain.
