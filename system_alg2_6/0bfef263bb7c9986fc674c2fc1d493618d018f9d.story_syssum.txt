Will it be the oddly named Wii U, Nintendo's attempt to update its aging Wii console for a new wave of gamers?
"I think we may be seeing the last generation of dedicated handheld gaming systems with the PS Vita and Nintendo 3DS," said Blair Herter, co-host G4TV's "X-Play."
Nintendo is the only one of the Big Three console makers -- a trio that includes Microsoft and Sony -- that will be demonstrating a new gaming system this year -- the Wii U.
At last year's E3, Nintendo showed a Wii U video demo featuring gameplay from Xbox 360 and PlayStation games.
Some observers think the current lineup of consoles -- the Wii, Sony PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Xbox 360 -- will all be replaced by newer systems by late 2013.
Microsoft will concentrate its E3 efforts on development for the popular Kinect motion controller and additional games for the venerable Xbox 360.
Other exclusive, unannounced titles for the Microsoft console and Kinect are also expected -- although some franchises may be holding out for a next-generation console in a year or so.
One, "Defiance" (Trion Worlds), features a unique tie-in with a new sci-fi TV series, where what happens on the show can affect what happens in the game.
Despite persistent rumors, Valve Software has said it doesn't expect to reveal any new hardware -- or popular games such as "Half-Life 3" or "Portal 3" -- next week.
By next week at this time, we'll know much more about the best gaming has to offer for the next 12 months.
