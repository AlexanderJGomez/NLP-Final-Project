Dandong, China (CNN) -- The sun is rising over the Yalu River and North Korea.
Tourists often do just that when they go right up to the fence that separates the two countries and leave cigarettes, old watches and other goodies for the North Korean border guards.
"Go inside North Korea!"
We meet "Chen," a smuggler who makes a midnight run across the Yalu several times a month to trade with North Korean soldiers.
But Chen says he can never trade with ordinary North Koreans, the soldiers wouldn't allow it.
And as the four-piece all-female North Korean band plays to the Chinese tourists drinking North Korean beer, I think how perfectly it sums up this city: extremely bizarre and perhaps a little tragic.
