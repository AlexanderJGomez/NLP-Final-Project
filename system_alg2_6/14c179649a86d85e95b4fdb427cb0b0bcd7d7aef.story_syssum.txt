(PEOPLE.com) -- A "devastated" Simon Monjack told PEOPLE his wife Brittany Murphy did not overdose on drugs and did not suffer from an eating disorder.
During a sometimes tear-filled interview, an exhausted Monjack, 39, who hasn't slept since his mother-in-law found his wife collapsed in the bathroom early Sunday, said all he knows is what doctors told him at the hospital: She died of cardiac arrest, but they won't know details until after an autopsy.
That was it."
"She was tired and a little sad because she was sick," Monjack said about Brittany.
"One of the saddest things is that Clara has looked everywhere for Brittany and can't find her," said Monjack.
"She was an only child," said Monjack.
"
"We don't want to accept that a beautiful young wife and daughter woke up one morning and died a tragic death."
She has lived with us and saw the love and support.
