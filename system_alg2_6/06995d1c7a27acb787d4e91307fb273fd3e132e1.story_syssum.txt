Plate had already had the conversation about the drug with his daughter.
What if that were my daughter?
While parents like Plate sympathized with the Bauers, others said it would never happen to their kid.
"Honestly, if my child was seriously showing signs of wanting to smoke pot, or even just try it, I'd probably buy it for them myself and make them do it at home, in a safe environment, just to make sure they're responsible," commenter Rob Doerr wrote.
While Bryant knows there will be critics and people out there questioning his parenting, he said he's just thankful to have more time with his daughter.
Why or why not?
