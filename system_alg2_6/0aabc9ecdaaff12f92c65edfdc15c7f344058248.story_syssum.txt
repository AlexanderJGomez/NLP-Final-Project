Rihanna was allegedly attacked by her boyfriend, singer Chris Brown, before the Grammys on February 8.
With the entertainment world buzzing about pop sensation Rihanna, whose boyfriend Chris Brown has been formally charged with assaulting her, public interest in domestic violence has been reinvigorated.
"What they need to do when they get out of the relationship is make sure they're aware of their own anger, and then they can learn how to freely express it in a healthy, normal way," he said.
Women who have been abused prior to, but not during, the past five years had depression rates 1Â½ times greater than those without abuse experience, said Bonomi, who has collaborated with Dimer on research on abused women.
A 2008 study of 3,333 women, which Bonomi worked on, found that middle-aged women who suffered child abuse, sexual or other physical abuse, had a greater likelihood of depression, as well as a higher body mass index.
Some women do feel stronger having been through the experience of abuse, Dimer said.
Calling a domestic violence hot line is a good first step for anyone who is experiencing abuse, Dimer said.
