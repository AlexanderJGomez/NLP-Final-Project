Los Angeles (CNN) -- The man accused of shooting and paralyzing a U.S. Army soldier at a homecoming party in the soldier's honor faces one count of attempted murder, the spokesman for the San Bernardino, California, district attorney said Tuesday.
He was shot at the party after an "argument and physical confrontation" with Jurado, San Bernardino Police Department Sgt.
The fight at the party broke out after Jurado and Sullivan's younger brother began arguing about football, the brothers' mother, Suzanne Sullivan, told CNN.
She also said she couldn't believe what had happened to her son, who she said joined the Army to try and help her out.
A fellow soldier from Christopher Sullivan's 101st Airborne Division brought the infantry's flag to the hospital, Suzanne Sullivan told CNN.
"I asked Chris if he wanted to me to hang it on the wall or cover him in it," Suzanne Sullivan said.
"He once told me that if defending this country takes his life, so be it," she said.
