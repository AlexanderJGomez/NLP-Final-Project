CIA Director Michael Hayden said hunting down bin Laden remains his agency's priority.
Hayden said al Qaeda has been hurt by a sustained fight with the United States and its allies, but remains a threat.
Hayden said it remained to be seen whether bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, could maintain unity in the ranks without him.
