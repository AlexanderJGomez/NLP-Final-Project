Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- The U.S. military launched airstrikes targeting ISIS fighters around a key dam in western Iraq on Sunday, the Pentagon said.
Al-Issawi said the area was being used by militants to launch mortar and other attacks on Haditha and the dam and officials have been concerned that these attacks could hit the dam and cause flooding that would impact the entire province.
"Potential loss of control of the dam or a catastrophic failure of the dam -- and the flooding that might result -- would have threatened U.S. personnel and facilities in and around Baghdad," Kirby said in a statement.
Last month, U.S. airstrikes helped Kurdish and Iraqi forces recapture Mosul Dam from ISIS.
