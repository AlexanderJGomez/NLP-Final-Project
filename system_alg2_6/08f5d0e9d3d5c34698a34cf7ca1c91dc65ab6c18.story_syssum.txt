(CNN) -- Sen. Ted Kennedy would have had a "very, very difficult" time politically surviving the drowning death of a young woman if it happened in the era of blogs, talk radio and 24-hour news cycles, experts said.

According to a Time-Harris poll in August 1969, about 44 percent of respondents said Kennedy failed "to tell the real truth," 51 percent said his explanation was inadequate and 77 percent said he was wrong not to report the accident immediately.
New media and talk radio would be a "much more ferocious force" today, he said.
In his national address, Kennedy said he was driving Kopechne to a ferry landing because she was tired.
"The car overturned in a deep pond and immediately filled with water," Kennedy said.
They, too, failed in saving Kopechne, he said.

"In the cable news era, that would not have been possible," he said, explaining that blogs and other new media would have prodded the networks and newspapers.
