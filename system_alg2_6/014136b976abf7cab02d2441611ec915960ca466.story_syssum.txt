(AOL Autos)  -- Recently, Consumer Reports magazine issued its list of best and worst used cars, and divvied them up by price range.
Consumer Reports also recommended the 3-Series coupe and convertible that joined BMW's model line-up in '07.
The M3 is the top-of-the-line, high-performance-tuned version of the 3-series coupe.
During the last used-model year, '07, the primary distinction between the two was that the M35 was powered by a V6 that kicked out 275 horses, while the M45 muscled up to a 325-hp V8.
