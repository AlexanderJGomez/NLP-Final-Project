Ahead of the meeting there's talk of increased military support for Ukraine, and that may yet be delivered; but direct confrontation with a nuclear-armed Russia is regarded by member states, including the EU, as a non-starter.

That deadlock will simply have to be broken if this Ukraine crisis is going to end without further bloodshed or territorial losses.
