Many other chains are open Thanksgiving Day, but their Black Friday sales don't start until midnight or Friday morning.
"It's one of few days retail employees get to spend with their families, but at this point there's no time to see family," St. Clair said in a phone interview.
More than 40 petitions have been launched on Change.org asking retailers including Sears, Target, Walmart and Kohl's to "give Thanksgiving back to families."
"Employees and customers alike are saying, 'Thanksgiving should be about celebrating with family, not shopping for the latest deals,' " Hill said.
Give these people the day off that they deserve," said another person who signed the petition "Wal-Mart: Move Black Friday Start Back to Friday."
"Family has always been important to me and Thanksgiving is all about family," Jennifer Ann said in her petition, "Target: Don't take away Thanksgiving."
Target and other big-box retailers say they're responding to consumer demands as best they can -- with employees in mind.
Walmart also was named in several petitions, though most of its stores are open 24 hours and 365 days a year, including Thanksgiving.
Most of our stores are open 24 hours and, historically, much of our Black Friday preparations have been done on Thanksgiving, which is not unusual in the retail industry."
Black Friday alone last year led to almost $12 billion in sales, so you can understand the employers stance on this issue," he said.
But she is hopeful that her petition and others like it will make Target's leadership reconsider opening early for Thanksgiving next year.
