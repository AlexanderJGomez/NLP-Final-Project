To kick off the conference, Def Con founder and veteran hacker Jeff Moss welcomed the kids with a talk on the ethics of hacking and rules for how to stay out of trouble with the law.
"I think it's harder for you guys now than it was for me," Moss told a room of kids and their parents.
When Moss was starting out, computer technology wasn't widely understood by law enforcement, and laws weren't yet in place that classified his actions as illegal.
However, Gelman pointed out that in many cases, the rules are still not clear or current, and that current laws are far behind what Def Con attendees are doing.
Breaking the law isn't the only concern Moss, Gelman and parents have for the budding hackers -- true anonymity online is harder to come by and a bad reputation can follow these kids into adulthood.
Now, most communications that take place online are stored permanently and some can be dug up by law enforcement and human-resources departments.
With so many dangers, why would parents encourage their children to hack at all?
Def Con Kids organizers believe in the good that can come from hacking, including making the country more secure and helping encourage freedom of speech around the world.
"What you're doing here to help train those folks is absolutely superb, and you should be proud."
