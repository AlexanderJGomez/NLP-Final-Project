(CNN) -- Some of golf's biggest names failed Friday to make the cut at the U.S. Open, victims of the Olympic Club's unforgiving roughs and slick greens.
McIlroy finished 10 over.
"You really have to be so precise out there, and if you're not, you're going to get punished," McIlroy told reporters.
Donald said his game was off both Thursday and Friday.
Casey Martin, playing his first major since the U.S. Open at the same venue in 1998, missed the cut by one shot.
He was the first golfer to use a cart in a major 14 years ago, causing controversy and sparking a law suit by the PGA Tour.
