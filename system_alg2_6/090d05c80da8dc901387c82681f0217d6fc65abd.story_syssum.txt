The Department of Energy's Blue Ribbon Commission has been given the task of finding an alternative to the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada, which President Obama has vowed to close.
It is highly likely that the 15-member commission will abandon the option to store nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain.
The Hanford facility is one of more than 100 nuclear sites across the country where about 70,000 tons of radioactive waste are stored.
The search for future uses of Yucca only came into question, according to Voegele and others, when the Department of Energy filed a petition to withdraw its Nuclear Regulatory Commission license application for Yucca Mountain earlier this month, effectively killing the project.
