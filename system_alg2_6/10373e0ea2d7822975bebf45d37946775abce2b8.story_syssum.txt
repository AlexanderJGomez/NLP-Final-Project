Grace Yoon, 15 months, was killed after a military jet crashed into her home.
Maintenance rules don't require immediate repairs for the problem, he said, but the squadron flew the jet 146 times before it eventually crashed because its left engine was starved for fuel.
"No one in the ready room stated or understood the severity of the low fuel emergency at this time," Rupp said.
In an emotional press conference in December, Yoon said he did not blame the pilot and urged the public to pray for him.
I know he did everything he could," Yoon said at the time.
