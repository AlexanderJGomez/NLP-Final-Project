(CNN) -- The first clue was a boat floating in the ocean with no one on board.
"We did two sweeps and then when we came across some guys on the rocks and we saw SOS written in the sand so we knew it was them straight away," crew member Damien Kross told Seven Network.
Kross said the five were in good spirits despite being a little dehydrated.
