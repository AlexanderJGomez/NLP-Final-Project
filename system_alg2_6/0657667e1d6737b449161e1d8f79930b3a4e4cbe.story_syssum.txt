Jeb Bush's surprise announcement that he'll "actively explore" a presidential bid Tuesday morning did little to dissuade his potential Republican opponents from the race.
But a source close to Rubio said Tuesday that while Tuesday's announcement changes the dynamic of the race, the junior Florida senator is still "on track to run for president" in 2016.
Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, who recently left the door open to his own 2016 bid, said the Bush announcement was "kind of expected."
Rob Portman, considered a possible vice presidential pick, told reporters he has talked to Bush recently about a potential campaign.
New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, also seen as a possible vice presidential pick, noted Bush has yet to stop by her state — which hosts the first primary in the nation — to meet with grassroots activists.
"It will make a difference how hard the candidates work in terms of meeting the activists and answering the hard questions," Ayotte said.
