Asked which school meals were their favorites, students at a public school in the New York borough of Queens don't say chicken fingers or meatballs.
The school went meatless three days a week about a year and a half ago.
"We've been working with tofu for a few months," Groff said.
But "the vegetarian menu fits right in with our mission, and we are thrilled that our students in pre-kindergarten all the way up to grade three understand the importance of healthy and nutritious meals," Groff said in a statement.
Groff worked closely with the department so that the menu changes came at no additional cost to the school.
