Marlon Jackson: I talked to Frank Dileo, Michael's manager.
Michael looked great.
Jackson: He wasn't in a wheelchair.
Jackson: May 14 was the last time I spoke with him.
I talked to my brother Jackie and he said, "Marlon, is it true?"
This morning he wasn't breathing and they rushed him to the hospital.
People are at the hospital, at the Jackson family home in Gary, Indiana, at his star on the Walk of Fame.
Michael was known all over the world, and that's why people care, and it's nice to see that people care.
Jackson: He's going to live on.
The memories, all the great things he has done, and my family is going to miss him.
Jackson: And that's the way we saw him, as a younger brother.
It hurts right now.
