That's not something that I get to do,' " Lang said, "I think that's what we're trying to instill back in everyone."

"We have people from well over 50 countries in our community who can all contribute to how to make the design better and how to use it better," Stackpole said.
"OpenROV is an open-source community," Stackpole said.
And our answer certainly is, 'both,' " Stackpole said.
