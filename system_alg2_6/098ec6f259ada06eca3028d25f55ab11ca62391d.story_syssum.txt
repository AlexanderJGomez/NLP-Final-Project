As the head of a home care agency in Massachusetts, I am required by state law to pay overtime to caregivers who are eligible.
Why?
Let's say you need more than 40 hours of custodial home care every week.
Do you keep the same caregiver coming and pay $28/hr, or do you hire another one to finish out the week at $20/hour?
For a professional caregiver who wants to work more than 40 hours a week at the regular rate (and many do), that option evaporates when overtime pay is required.
Paying home care workers more money would have clear social benefits, but if it comes at the cost of pricing vulnerable seniors out of the home care market or reducing the earning potential of caregivers, then we need to rethink our laws.
