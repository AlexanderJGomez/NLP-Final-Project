As things become clearer, it seems that the video was created and promoted by members of the American Coptic Christian community -- a community with its roots in Egypt.
These people within the Arab world began blaming the Coptic community -- a community whose very name means "Egyptian."
In response, the Coptic Church, both in Egypt as well as in the United States, insisted that it has nothing to do with the video.
But the Coptic Church should never be placed in the position of having to apologize for the actions of a few of its members.
The violent actions of a comparatively small number of individuals do not represent all Muslims, just as the video does not represent the views of all Coptic Christians.
Whether it's through legal channels or social pressures, they must be dealt with.
The least we can do now is to make sure not to blame the wrong people for the vile actions of a few individuals.
