David Goldman has been locked in a legal battle over custody of his son, Sean Goldman, with the family of the boy's deceased mother.
Tostes also said that the family would consider allowing the boy to go to the United States, perhaps for the holidays, if Sean wants to go.
The family argues that it would traumatize Sean to remove him from what has been his home since 2004, when his mother took him to Brazil on what she said would be a vacation.
Instead of traveling to Brasilia, where the high court is, Goldman planned to stay in Rio de Janeiro on Friday, where he is just miles from Sean.
Smith said Sean was previously put in front of a video camera as adults asked questions.
If the court does not do so, Smith said, he and Goldman hope Chief Justice Gilmar Mendes will.
The family has said Goldman can visit his son.
