(CNN) -- FIFA has imposed a worldwide lifetime ban from football on 41 players from Korea who became embroiled in match-fixing activities in their domestic league.
"Of the 51 cases, only one was for betting, whereas all the others were either for giving, or accepting bribes to fix matches.
In response to this threat on soccer's integrity FIFPro, the worldwide players' union, recently announced a project to tackle fixing that will include an education program and an online tool for their members to report illegal approaches.
The 21 Korean players who handed themselves in voluntarily will also be required to put themselves forward for community service if they decide they want to return to the game.
