The ninth-grader told CNN that after a bullet hit his left shoulder, he lay under one of the benches in the room.
Muhammad Anas, 15, said that students in the auditorium were initially told that the sounds of bullets might be firecrackers.
"I saw a pair of big black boots coming towards me, this guy was probably hunting for students hiding beneath the benches," he told the French news agency.

"I told the children to get off their school benches and go under the benches.
"Some children got up and then they were shot, after which the attackers left the room," he said.
The exams and the lecture in the auditorium meant students were grouped in different parts of the school, he said.
"My son was my dream," Ali told The Associated Press.
She was throwing herself against an ambulance at the Lady Reading Hospital, AFP said, one of many inconsolable parents.
