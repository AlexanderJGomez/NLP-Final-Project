Among the dead were two Boeing employees, among four onboard the flight, their company said late Thursday in a posting on its Web site.
Among those injured in the crash, 63 remained hospitalized Thursday, six of them in critical condition, said Theo Weterings, the mayor of Haarlemmermeer municipality, where Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport is located.
One week ago, an employees' union accused Turkish Airlines of "inviting disaster" by ignoring aircraft maintenance, it emerged Thursday.
Turkish Airlines posted a statement on its Web site on Thursday saying it takes safety seriously and that it followed all "maintenance procedures of the plane manufacturer, national and international authorities directives" for the plane.
A special Turkish Airlines flight landed in Amsterdam Thursday morning from Istanbul, carrying about 70 relatives of those on board the fatal flight.
Aviation experts say Turkish Airlines has a relatively good safety record, though in 2003, more then 70 people were killed when a Turkish Airlines domestic flight crashed in fog near the southeastern city of Diyarbakir.
An employee in Turkish Airlines' advertising department said the promotional campaign was suspended in the wake of the fatal plane crash.
