Northern Syria (CNN) -- Tanks pounded the Syrian city of Aleppo on Saturday, a sign that a much-feared government offensive in the country's largest city has started, as the opposition warned its allies they would bear responsibility for a "massacre" if they don't act soon.
At least 160 people were killed across Syria on Saturday, the LCC said.
Fighters have been preparing for a major confrontation, and security forces continued military buildup with reinforcements from Raqqa province and other regions, opposition groups said.
"I believe that the escalation of the military build-up in Aleppo and the surrounding area is further evidence of the need for the international community to come together to persuade the parties that only a political transition, leading to a political settlement will resolve this crisis and bring peace to the Syrian people," he said in a statement.
Russia and China -- major trade allies with Syria -- have vetoed tough resolutions on Syria at the U.N. Security Council.
One Free Syrian Army commander said the regime has labeled the confrontation for the city as the "mother of all battles."
French President Francois Hollande reiterated his position calling for the U.N. Security Council to urgently intervene in Syria, a source in his entourage confirmed.
The LCC said dozens of people were killed across Damascus and its suburbs, and others died in Idlib, Deir Ezzor and Hama provinces.
While Sunnis have a significant presence in the Syrian regime, they are also dominant in the opposition movement.
