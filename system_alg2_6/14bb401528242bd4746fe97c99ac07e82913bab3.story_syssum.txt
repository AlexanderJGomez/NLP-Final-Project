(CNN) -- Police recently seized a cab owned by Jesse Matthew, the last person seen with missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham and who also has been linked to another college student's death in 2009, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN.
Previously, Matthew had worked for at least one other Charlottesville taxi company -- Yellow Cab -- according to its owner Mark Brown.
It's certainly a legitimate question," Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo told reporters last month.
