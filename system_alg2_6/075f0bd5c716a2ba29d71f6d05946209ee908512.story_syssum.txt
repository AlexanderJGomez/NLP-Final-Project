One of the most urgent is child farm labor.
Children 14 and older can work long hours at all but the most dangerous farm jobs without their parents' consent, if they do not miss school.
Unlike teen retail and service workers, agricultural laborers 16 and older are permitted to operate hazardous machinery and to work even during school hours.
According to the 2010 Human Rights Watch report, the Department of Labor employees were spread so thin that, despite widespread reports of infractions they found only 36 child labor violations and two child hazardous order violations in agriculture nationwide.
Farm parents, their children, and the American Farm Bureau objected strenuously to the proposed new rules.
Second, the Department of Labor must institute age, wage, hour and safety regulations that meet the standards set by retail and service industry rules.
Finally, the Department of Labor and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration must allocate the funds necessary for meaningful enforcement of child labor violations.
