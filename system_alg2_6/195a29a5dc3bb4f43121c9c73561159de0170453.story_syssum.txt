Like so many of the other children here, 9-year-old Mohammed Hoot is wandering around the camp, bored.
"We want to enter Turkey ... they are not letting us in," says Hoot.
The U.N. says some 1.2 million Syrians are displaced inside Syria.
"Since the beginning of November, the number of registered refugees region-wide has risen by about 3,200 a day," the UNHCR announced this week.
"And these are people who lived a good life at one time.
Now, this 32-year-old violinist -- who used to perform at the Damascus Opera House -- is one of the faceless millions of Syrians now living on the run.
He does not know where he will be living several months from now, and he has no idea when he will be reunited with his sister, who fled with her husband and children to the U.S., or with his parents, who remain in Damascus.
I just want people to feel for us."
