When I speak about getting him a Father's Day gift, he says the best gift I can give him is to live a good, healthy life.
Many people are not as fortunate as I was.
I believe that many more people would do what my father did for me if they knew more about the transplant process and outcomes.
To show my appreciation, the best gift I will give my dad this Father's Day is to take care of my health and to live each day to its fullest.
And I plan on giving that gift to him for many Father's Days to come.
