BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Soon after I first came to visit China in the autumn of 1971, I saw a contingent of militia soldiers doing marching drills in Tiananmen Square.
It was on the Tiananmen rostrum where Chairman Mao formally proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic.
In Mao's ideology, the Chinese people found hope in a New China, wherein citizens would always have a bowl of rice to eat and clothes to wear.
In the late 1960s, Mao would again stand in the Tiananmen rostrum to launch the Cultural Revolution.
For ten years, China was condemned to political turmoil and economic malaise.
Mao died in 1976 and his remains are kept in a mausoleum in Tiananmen Square.
Not every Chinese embraced Deng's reform and open-door policy.
