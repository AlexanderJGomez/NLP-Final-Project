Ribery plays for German club Bayern Munich, while Benzema is at Real Madrid.
One of the girls, Zahia Dehar, appeared on the cover of "Paris Match" magazine in April that year and in an interview said she had sexual relations with several players on the national team, including Ribery, whom she had met at the club.
Ribery allegedly bought a plane ticket for Dehar, but Bottai said he never personally booked it and never saw her passport.
