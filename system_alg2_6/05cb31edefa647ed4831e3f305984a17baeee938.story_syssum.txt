(CNN) -- The Cannes Film Festival entrusted its opening to a Pixar film, and the animation studio did not disappoint.
"Up" concerns Carl Fredericksen, a balloon seller voiced by Ed Asner.
A stowaway -- a Junior Wilderness Explorer named Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai) -- is in the house as well, and the two of them become mutually dependent after landing a continent away.
"But really the reason 'Up' is opening the festival is not because it's animated, not because it's 3-D, it's ... because it's a wonderful film.
Turan said he sees Pixar's work, and its recognition by Cannes, as another sign that animated features are among the best films being produced right now.
