(CNN) -- You knew Tony Soprano from the small things.
You're like Mozart,' " David Chase, who created "The Sopranos," said in a statement.
"The Sopranos" was TV on a knife's edge.
He was chosen because, Chase said, "the show I envisioned is the show that's got Jimmy in it.
"
And with Gandolfini, Edie Falco, Michael Imperioli, Lorraine Bracco and so many more, "The Sopranos" gave life to the scripts.
It's easy to confuse actors with their most famous roles; with this one episode, Gandolfini showed that he was no more Tony Soprano than he was Kevin Finnerty, but that he was playing them.
"If anything, Gandolfini often took things further than Chase had planned," Sepinwall wrote.
In it, Gandolfini plays another New Jersey sad sack, this one a 1960s grocer failing to connect with his rock 'n' roll-besotted son.
Gandolfini will almost certainly be best remembered for Tony Soprano, his role of a lifetime.
