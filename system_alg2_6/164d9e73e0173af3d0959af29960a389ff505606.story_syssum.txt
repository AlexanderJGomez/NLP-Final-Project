The three siblings -- Kimberly, Neil and Reid -- have been performing together for 14 years.
In October 2010, the group released "If I Die Young," a single that, ironically, given the title, brought The Band Perry to life.
"The most nerve-racking moment was releasing 'You Lie,'" Kimberly said of the band's success since the first single.
"Reid's on the base guitar, I'm on my mandolin... it's like there's a pot in the middle and we're all throwing stuff in."
"We do have to sleep with one eye open when we're out on the road," Kimberly said.
"He's a great guy to be out on the road with," Kimberly said.
Faced with pressure to duplicate the success of their first, the Perrys are trying to remember that they've been doing this for years -- and will continue to play after the spotlights fade.
