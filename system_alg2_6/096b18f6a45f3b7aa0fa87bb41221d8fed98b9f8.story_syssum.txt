(CNN) -- We learned a few things on Monday night, those of us watching Anderson Cooper on "AC360," about Alex Teves, one of the people who died in the gunfire at theater 9 in the Century 16 multiplex in Aurora, Colorado.
Teves had something to say to the news media, too, something impossible to ignore: "And if we don't stop talking about the gunman -- so somebody took a gun and went in and shot a 6-year-old girl?
He will never see the light of day again.
Still, if mass shootings weren't big news, you would worry.
Like Teves, many people suspect that some sort of media glory is part of the payoff for these mass killers.
The problem, unfortunately, is that people still jump on ball fields.
News outlets should never glorify killers in any way.
As Teves said, "You know, Alex would have expected us to live.
Still, when something like this happens, we are, as a society, like a tribe discussing the events around the campfire.
Tell us about the wolves.
