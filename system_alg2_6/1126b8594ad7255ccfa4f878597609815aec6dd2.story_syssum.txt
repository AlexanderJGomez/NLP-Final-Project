(CNN) -- Current TV's co-founders, including former Vice President Al Gore, announced Friday that the network has ousted its highest-profile on-air personality, Keith Olbermann.
The 53-year-old was suspended from MSNBC for two days after the news website Politico revealed that he had made donations to three Democrats.
Besides hosting and producing his new prime-time nightly news and commentary show, Olbermann was named Current Media's chief news officer and had an equity stake in the company.
He had resigned as New York's governor in 2008 after it was revealed that he visited a high-priced prostitute.
