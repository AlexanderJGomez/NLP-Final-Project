Ishant Sharma gave India early breakthroughs in the morning, Virender Sehwag and Zaheer Khan chipped in with vital wickets and Amit Mishra completed a four-wicket haul as India cantered to victory with a session to spare.
But that reprieve hardly proved costly as Mishra held a low return catch from Shafiul in the next over to send back the batsman.
With an attacking field in place, runs were there for the taking and Mushfiqur cashed in, reaching his maiden century with a straight-driven boundary off Mishra, his 17th boundary.
