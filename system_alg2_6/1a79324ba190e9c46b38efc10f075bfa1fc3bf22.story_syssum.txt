The measles outbreak that began when unvaccinated Amish missionaries traveled to the Philippines has more than doubled in size in 10 days, Ohio health officials reported Friday.
Amado said the number of cases had slowed down, but then picked up to about 20 cases per day this week.
"This year represents the highest number of cases reported in the United States during this time period in 18 years,"  Dr. Greg Wallace, head of measles activities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an e-mail.
Ten years ago there were 37 measles cases in the United States, the lowest number since 2000, when the disease was considered eliminated in this country.
