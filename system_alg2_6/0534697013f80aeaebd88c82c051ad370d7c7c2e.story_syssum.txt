Also Wednesday, France recalled its ambassador to Syria, the French Foreign Ministry said.
Activists also reported damage at the complex in Harasta, an eastern suburb of the capital, Damascus.
It was one of five actions reported by the opposition force, which has recently emerged as an important factor in the opposition movement as more and more soldiers have left the Syrian army.
"A clash between the Free Syrian Army and Assad's criminal gangs and his mobsters (the shabiha) in Douma, our Free Syrian military caused the Assad's gangs a lesson that they will never forget and heavy losses at the roundabout in the Douma municipality," the army said.

The Arab League, meeting in Rabat, Morocco, said al-Assad didn't stick by his pledge to release detainees, withdraw armed elements from populated areas, and allow unfettered access to the nation by journalists and Arab League monitors.
He said Syria hadn't fulfilled commitments to the league and the Turks to rein in the instability.
