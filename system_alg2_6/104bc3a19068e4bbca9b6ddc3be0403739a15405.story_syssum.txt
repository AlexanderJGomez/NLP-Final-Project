Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Scores of bodies were found in a mass grave outside the capital city of Port-au-Prince on Friday, a sign of Haitians' desperation three days after a 7.0-magnitude earthquake devastated the impoverished nation.
Meanwhile, a crucial 72-hour window elapsed Friday afternoon -- the time to free those who still may be alive trapped under the remains of buildings.
Aid workers continued to trickle into the country Friday, trying to provide water and food to survivors in the capital, which still was being rocked by aftershocks Friday.
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also announced Friday that she will visit the quake-battered capital on Saturday, the first major U.S. official to do so.
But, Ban said, aid flights are arriving, and food and medical supplies are beginning to be distributed in Port-au-Prince.
Preval said that he has been touched by the friendship of the American people.
