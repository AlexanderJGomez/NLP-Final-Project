Take for example the story of how a simple father-and-son chat led to a prototype spacecraft for landing on other planets.
" 'You never talk bad about NASA, Dad,' " Altemus recalled his son saying.
What could we do together?'
They were in.
"
"It was nothing like what NASA was used to."
But it resulted in an offshoot project called the Morpheus planetary lander.
It's the first NASA prototype spacecraft to be propelled using liquid oxygen and liquid methane.
Today, the latest version of the Morpheus lander "is a centerpiece for the agency to show what a fantastic team it is, and what incredible things can be done with just sheer willpower to imagine," said Altemus, who in 2013 ended a 25-year career at NASA to start an engineering products business based on space technology.
The sophisticated self-guided system that prevents Morpheus from setting down in hazardous landing zones could be used on a lander that could safely put astronauts on another planet.
It's possible that Morpheus' fuel -- liquid oxygen and methane -- could be found on Mars or other planets.
The fuel-making spacecraft would then harvest methane from the atmosphere, said Altemus.
As long as there are planets in the sky that are unreachable, somebody's going to try to reach them."
