The discovery of a slain Palestinian teen in Jerusalem early Wednesday further inflamed tensions in a region already unsettled over the killings of three Israeli teens, not to mention decades of entrenched enmity between all sides.
Israeli authorities are probing Wednesday's death, with police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld tweeting this effort will try to determine if it is a "criminal or nationalistic" act -- the latter term referring to a politically motivated act in retaliation for the Israeli  teens' killings.
Israel is a country of law and everyone is ordered to act according to the law."
Yet Hussain Abu Khedair, the boy's father, blamed Israelis and vehemently denied reports that this may have been tied to any sort of family dispute.
The Israeli military destroyed the homes of the two suspects in the killings of the three Israeli teens.
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who heads the Fatah party and is based in the West Bank, called Mohammad Abu Khedair's father and promised that those behind his abduction and death will be brought to justice, WAFA, the Palestinian state news agency, reported.
But his father said Thursday he was still waiting to hear from Israeli authorities when the body would be handed over to the family.
"The autopsy should be done around 1 p.m., and then I am supposed to wait for a call," Hussain Abu Khedair said on Palestinian television.
Israel Defense Forces said the airstrikes -- going after 15 Hamas targets -- were in response to the firing of more than 20 rockets into Israel since Wednesday.
"They sanctify death; we sanctify life.
