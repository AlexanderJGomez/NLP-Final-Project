(CNN) -- First lady Michelle Obama is heading to Iowa next month to campaign in one of the closest Senate races of the 2014 midterms.
Other popular Democrats will appear in Iowa this weekend as well.
Braley will also be though, though neither of the Clinton's have plans to stump specifically for him.
