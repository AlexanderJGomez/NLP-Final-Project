As you and your family look forward to countless holiday meals yet to come, the recently celebrated Antibiotic Awareness Week might have passed by unnoticed.
Some infections didn't respond to antibiotics, because the bacteria that caused them were "resistant" -- that is, they could disable an antibiotic, or pump it out as fast as it got into a bacterial cell.
These antibiotics act on the bacteria that live on and in all animals, suppressing the growth of bacteria that are sensitive to the antibiotic and favoring the growth of bacteria that are resistant.
These antibiotic-resistant organisms can transfer the genetic know-how for antibiotic resistance to other bacteria within us.
In the intervening 40 years, the evidence linking antibiotic use in food animals and antibiotic-resistant infections in humans has continued to grow.
The FDA has done little more than to urge drug companies to "voluntarily" stop marketing antibiotics for growth promotion -- but antibiotic use for disease "prevention" is not discouraged, and proposed rules even weaken veterinary oversight of this practice.
But it's clear that the solution requires action on a bigger scale if the United States is to implement recommendations made repeatedly for more than 40 years to limit antibiotic use in animals to the treatment of infections.
Campaigns to promote judicious use of antibiotics in hospitals are likewise followed by decreases in the number of infections caused by multi-drug-resistant bacteria.
