Concern is growing for the well-being of four journalists, three of them American citizens, apparently detained in Iran this week, according to The Washington Post.
The Committee to Protect Journalists said it was alarmed by The Post's report and urged Iran to release the four journalists.
According to The Washington Post, Rezaian, 38, holds American and Iranian citizenship.
His wife, an Iranian citizen who has applied for U.S. permanent residency, is a correspondent for the UAE-based newspaper the National, The Post said.
The organization also highlights past instances in which Iran has detained international journalists, including the case of U.S. freelancer Roxana Saberi.
