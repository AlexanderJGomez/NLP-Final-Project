For weeks before the vote, Chavez signaled a willingness to surrender power, should the result go against him.
Yet it should also be said: In Venezuela, the most important forms of vote fraud happen well before Election Day.
While each candidate's campaign is allowed no more than three minutes, the government can run as many 'institutional' ads as it wants to promote its work.
Apart from campaign ads, however, the president himself can commandeer as much TV time as he wishes, although in the case of the long-winded Chavez, such appearances may not be vote-winners.
The use of state oil funds for this kind of electioneering is driving Venezuela's budget deficit for the year to the astounding level of 20% of GDP, an incredible figure for an oil-exporting economy at a time of very high oil prices.
Yes.
And if middle-class neighborhoods evince any disaffection from the regime, they lose what little police protection they have, or even discover the police suddenly abetting and aiding the criminals that prey upon their community.
Did Venezuela vote for more of the same?
But then, Vladimir Putin wins elections, too, and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won at least one.
