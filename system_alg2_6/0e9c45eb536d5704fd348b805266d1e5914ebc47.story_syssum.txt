Nina and Edgar Otto say their cloned puppy crosses his paws like the original dog did.
"We just got him because we wanted to have Lancelot more than just the 11Â½ years," Nina Otto said.
They say Lancy walks just like Lancelot and crosses his paws like him, too.
"This dog was immediately accepted by the nine dogs," Edgar Otto said.
Four customers who also placed winning bids in an auction by BioArts International will have their dogs cloned, and those pets will be delivered in the coming months.
But, the Ottos say, he's taken a particular fondness to a bush planted at the spot where his original, Lancelot, died last year.
The Ottos can do whatever they want with their money, but "a shelter dog just lost out on a great chance of having a home," said Cherie Wachter of the Humane Society of Broward County, Florida.
"Think about this," he said philosophically.
