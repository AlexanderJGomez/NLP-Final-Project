BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) -- Thailand's Constitutional Court Tuesday fired the country's prime minister, Samak Sundaravej, for violating the constitution by hosting a TV cooking show while in office.
Further, he said, the show was not on the air any more and that he received just $2,300 for his appearances.
I said, 'No, I checked the constitution already.
The protesters are demanding that Samak step down.
Thaksin, who was ousted in a coup in 2006, returned to England last month just as he was to appear in court in a corruption case.
