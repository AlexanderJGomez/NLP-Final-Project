De Menezes was killed on a London Underground train weeks after four suicide bombers struck on the London transport system on July 7, 2005.
Jurors at a 2008 inquest found that the police who shot de Menezes did not shout a warning before firing at him.
De Menezes was killed July 22, 2005, a day after four failed bombings aboard the London transit system.
"I am sorry."
