The leading candidate, interim President Bronislaw Komorowski, failed to garner more than 50 percent of the vote, which would have clinched victory in the first round of voting to replace President Lech Kaczynski, who was killed in a plane crash in April.
Jaroslaw Kaczynski, once prime minister, is a divisive figure in Polish politics.
"We have been on this road for 21 years together and we have been right," Komorowski said on the campaign trail.
