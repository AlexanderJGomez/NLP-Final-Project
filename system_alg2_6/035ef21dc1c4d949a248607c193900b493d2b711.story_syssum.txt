In Urdu, Pakistan means the "land of the pure."
Pakistan may be a world away from the United States, but instability feeds the extremism that fuels terrorism, so we ignore this crisis at our peril.
The Pakistan my father brought us home to experience was disappearing before our eyes.
But Pakistan couldn't.
Since 9/11, Pakistan has supported America's intervention in Afghanistan, the right decision but one fraught with controversy.
Pakistan needs America's help.
The Pakistan government needs to focus on three things to stop the country's downward spiral: education, infrastructure and security.
Educating the country's Muslim leaders is just as important.
In terms of security, with Afghanistan at war on one side and the barely held truce with India on the other, Pakistan needs to secure its borders, ignore the problems of its neighbors and focus internally.
I believe in Pakistan, as my father did.
