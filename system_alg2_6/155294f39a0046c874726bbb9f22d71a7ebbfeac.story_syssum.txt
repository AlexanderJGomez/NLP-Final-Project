Giglio, Italy (CNN) -- Italian rescuers and divers continuing their perilous work Tuesday located a second "black box" and the remains of five people in the wreckage of the Costa Concordia cruise ship.
In a later conversation, an Italian coast guard official demands Schettino return to his ship, the transcripts show.
Rescue and recovery efforts continued Tuesday, with divers searching the ship for survivors and remains.
There were roughly 4,200 people on the Costa Concordia when it ran aground -- about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members, the vast majority of whom made it off the ship safely.
The ship had about 2,300 tons of fuel on board at the time of the wreck, said Costa Cruises chairman and chief executive Pier Luigi Foschi.
Italy's Coast Guard said it has located a second "black box," or data recorder, from the ship.
People were hysterical," Moore said.
Human error can't be regulated, said an official with Cruise Lines International Association, which represents the industry.
"Nautilus is concerned about the rapid recent increases in the size of passenger ships, with the average tonnage doubling over the past decade," said Nautilus general secretary Mark Dickinson in a statement.
Maritime law attorney Richard Alsina said the agency has little teeth and is dealing with an industry that has a strong lobby.
