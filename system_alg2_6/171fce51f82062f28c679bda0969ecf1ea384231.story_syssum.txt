New York (CNN) -- Former pharmaceutical executive Gigi Jordan at first appeared calm as she described for a New York jury the last time she saw her son alive, those now-fuzzy final moments before she gave the 8-year-old autistic boy a lethal drug concoction.
defense lawyer Allan Brenner asked.
"I gave him more Xanax, but the Ambien is the one I gave him the most of.
One ex-husband had allegedly threatened to kill her, a crime that would have left Jude with her other ex, his biological father, who she believed had sexually abused the boy.
She said she checked into the luxury Peninsula Hotel in Manhattan.
Jude and Jordan spent about six hours in the room before she gave him the pills.
Brenner asked.
Jude!
On Wednesday, Jordan, fighting back tears, testified that she knowingly gave herself and Jude enough drugs to kill them both.
"No," Jordan told the jury.
She testified that one night Jude started screaming, according to Jordan: " 'Dad bad.
He also kept saying dad, and it was clear he was talking about his dad," she told the jury.
In court, no one has disputed the unthinkable manner in which little Jude spent his final hours on February 5, 2010.
Brenner said Jordan, believing she was ultimately protecting her son, brought the drugs to the hotel room with the intention of killing them both, but she survived the suicide attempt.
The exact time of the boy's death could not be determined, but Jude's body temperature was 80 degrees, suggesting that when police arrived, he had been dead for 8 to 14 hours, Bogdanos said.
Brenner said Jordan told a therapist and local authorities about the alleged abuse but no action was taken.
