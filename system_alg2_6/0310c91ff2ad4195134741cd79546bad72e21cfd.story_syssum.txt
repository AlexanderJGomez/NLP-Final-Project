What Awuah wanted to begin was to create a university in his native Ghana, a state-of-the-art education hub that would help educate the country's next generation of leaders.
And while Ashesi has already come a long way -- when the school first opened in 2002 there was no campus, just a couple of rented buildings for its 30 students -- Awuah plans to expand his offering as part of his dream of finding and developing Africa's next problem solvers.
Awuah, who grew up in Accra, left Ghana in 1985 to pursue his own education in the United States.
"I won't lie to you -- it was tough," says Awuah.
Awuah says the university brings together a diverse mix of students from different backgrounds, including scholarship-winning undergraduates from humble beginnings who are the first in their families to attend college.
"If you come back in 30 years, universities will be competing for the best and brightest students," he says.
