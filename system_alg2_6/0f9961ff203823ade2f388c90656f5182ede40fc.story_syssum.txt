If confirmed, Elena Kagan may or may not turn out to be that intellectual counterweight to conservatives Justice Antonin Scalia or Chief Justice John Roberts.
"It means I'd have to get my hair done more often, Sen. Specter," Kagan replied.
Kagan found that in the folksy, clever phrasing of Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, who asked her about her 1995 statements criticizing past Supreme Court confirmation hearings as a "vapid and hollow charade."
"All I can say about that paper is that it is dangerous to write papers about the law before you've spent a day in law school," Kagan said.
"You know if I accept your answer, it is going to spoil a whole five minutes I had here," Grassley responded.
Late in the day, conservative Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, said he would ask Kagan a "softball" question.
Graham asked.
Justice Stephen Breyer is equally smart and he too shares a sense of humor, but that tends to fall on the quirky, self-deprecating side.
Schumer paid Kagan a high compliment Tuesday, noting Scalia gets the most laughs during high court oral arguments.
