(CNN) -- Most Americans don't think that midterm elections really matter.
While Republicans will certainly retain control of the House, it is unclear whether Democrats will continue to control a majority of the Senate.
The most important reason is that the Senate Democratic majority is the only effective counterweight to the immense power that the tea party Republicans can wield within the House Republican Caucus.
Immigration reform is dead for the rest of the Congress, but it is an issue people are still talking about and proposals will be back on the table if Democrats have their say about it.
If Republicans gain control of the Senate, the White House will be in big trouble with its appointments.
What happens to the Senate will play a very important role in the direction of U.S. politics in the coming years, even if Congress remains in its current dysfunctional state.
Americans should not be complacent.
