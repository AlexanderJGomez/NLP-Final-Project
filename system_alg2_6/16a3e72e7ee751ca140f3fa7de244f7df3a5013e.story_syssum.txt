The focus, instead, will be the latest offerings from an array of global car manufacturers, which -- models or not -- are pulling out all the stops to compete for Chinese customers in what since 2009 has been the world's largest car market.
"The SUV is popular as a first car," said Raymond Tsang, a Shanghai-based partner at consultancy Bain & Company.
It would be the first car made in China to hit U.S showrooms and may pave the way for Chinese brands to shake up the U.S. market like Japanese and Korean car manufacturers did decades earlier.
Just maybe, China will need those car babes to boost sales after all.
