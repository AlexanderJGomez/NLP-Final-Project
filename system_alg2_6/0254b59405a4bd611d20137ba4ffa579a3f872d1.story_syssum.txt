Peter Bergen says Osama bin Laden is still alive and still significant eight years after September 11.
Given the hundreds of billions of dollars that the "war on terror" has consumed, the failure to capture or kill al Qaeda's leader is one of its signal failures.
Does it even matter whether bin Laden is found?
Since September 11, bin Laden has released a slew of video and audiotapes, many of which discuss current events.
Not one of the dozens of tapes released by bin Laden after 9/11 has been a fake.
The situation is further complicated by the fact that bin Laden and al-Zawahiri are almost certainly hiding out in the tribal areas of Pakistan, on the Afghan border.
However, it is clear from the videos of bin Laden and al-Zawahiri that aired in the years since the attacks that they are not living in caves.
Between July 2008 and this month, U.S. drones have killed dozens of lower-ranking militants and at least 10 mid- and upper-level leaders within al Qaeda or the Taliban.
...
Should bin Laden be captured or killed, that would probably trigger a succession battle within al Qaeda.
