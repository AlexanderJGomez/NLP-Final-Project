"Each awards show has a different personality style-wise, and people have learned to dress accordingly," said Sarah Bernard, host of "The Thread" on Yahoo!
See, not taking a fashion risk is a risk in itself, Bernard said, adding, "It's important to mix it up."
One red-carpet regular who has stunned this season, wearing gowns that complement her shape, is "The Help's" Octavia Spencer, said Yahoo!
It's common for a celebrity to have a relationship with certain designers, Bernard said, referencing Charlize Theron, who wore a standout pale pink Dior gown to the Globes.
The potential for discomfort is one reason footwear expert Meghan Cleary says shoes are the most important part of any red carpet look.
And with so much focus on the dress, shoes become a way for celebrities to experiment, and maybe take a fashion risk.
The saturated, rich jewel tones are all over the red carpet this season, like the jade green Oscar de la Renta dress Emily Blunt wore to the SAG Awards, or the fuchsia Marchesa gown Sofia Vergara donned the same night.
Chavez said she expects to see a mix of vibrant, nude and sherbet colors take over at the Academy Awards.
In the end, any celebrity can end up on a list of best- or worst-dressed stars.
