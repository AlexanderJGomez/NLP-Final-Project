People in more than 170 communities -- from Anchorage to Allakaket -- are planning to hold public "Choose Respect" rallies in honor of survivors of sexual and intimate partner violence.
"When victims and survivors see their communities standing up for them, they see a great deal of strength.
The rallies start Thursday and will continue through the weekend in some locations.
I hope CNN readers will join the state in demanding an end to the violence there and elsewhere.
As for his kind words about the series, CNN shares the credit with the brave people in Alaska who told me their stories -- and with the dozens of readers and viewers who shared their stories of survival in solidarity with Alaskans.
They will be with the people of Nunam Iqua, Alaska, which is one of a reported 75 communities that do not have any local law enforcement presence.
The state troopers have told me they're having difficulty finding someone who would take the job in Nunam Iqua.
And, finally, my thoughts will be with Erin Merryn, a victim of child sexual assault from Illinois who, I'm told by a local lawmaker, will be traveling Alaska this week campaigning for a bill that would require state school districts to teach about the warning signs of child sexual abuse.
Once you start to be in national press for this, that really is a catalyst for change.
I will anxiously await photos from the "Choose Respect" rallies.
And this week, all of us will get a chance to see them -- and, hopefully, you -- demanding a safer future.
