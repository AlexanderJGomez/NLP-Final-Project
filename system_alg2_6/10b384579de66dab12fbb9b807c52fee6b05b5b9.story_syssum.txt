At least one gunman opened fire, wounding three girls.
Two suffered non-life-threatening injuries, but bullets struck Malala in the head and neck.
Now, it is nothing short of a miracle that the teen blogger, who fights for the right of girls to get an education, is still alive and even more astounding that she suffered no major brain or nerve damage.
Malala wrote in her online diary about intimidation tactics the Taliban used in the Swat Valley in northwest Pakistan to coerce girls into not going school.
"We will certainly kill her," a spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban said.
Around the world, the young blogger has become a poster child for a widespread need to permit girls to get an education.
The United Nations launched a campaign for girls' education named "I am Malala."
Brown, who heads up the "I am Malala" campaign in his role as United Nations special envoy on global education, toured Pakistan to boost education with international funding and local initiatives.
More than a week after being shot a world away, Malala got back on her feet again, able to stand when leaning on a nurse's arm at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham.
She has returned to her family and continues therapies as an outpatient at the hospital where she will undergo further surgery on her skull.
She called Malala her sister.
Doctors at Queen Elizabeth hospital will replace the piece of skull extracted in Pakistan.
She is all about education.
