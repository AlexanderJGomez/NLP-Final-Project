The journalists were among seven Europeans a Chadian judge released Sunday, including a Spanish flight crew, whom Sarkozy dropped off in a brief stop in Madrid on his way back from Chad.
Those who remain under arrest in Chad are six members of the French charity, four Chadians and four remaining members of the flight crew.

"They never said they would take away our children," he told the newspaper.
