At the 2012 International Consumer Electronics Show, computer makers will be pushing a new breed of ultra-thin, ultra-light laptops amid a sea of razor-thin smartphones and tablets.
And Microsoft, which will deliver its 14th CES presentation Monday, announced recently it will not have a booth or participate in the keynotes after this year's event.
At CES, tech companies will showcase plenty of phones with that software, but the touchscreen tablets with Android 4 will be prevalent.
Analysts expect to see a bevy of Windows 8 tablets at CES.
Microsoft will enable this anti-disc computer with the application store in Windows 8.
"And then you've got Microsoft pushing the touchscreen tablet experience."
Meanwhile, Internet services are also working their way onto television sets.
Don't expect Apple to show up at CES with a big screen though.
"These companies see the car as a software platform," Westergren said.
"Software has simply become so critical to the overall customer experience," said Rubin, the NPD Group analyst.
"It's the only trade show I attend all year," she said.
