Almost 20 years later, that stupid "French girls" line has become a bit of a catchphrase, and if you Google it you'll find countless images of people unintentionally, yet seductively, sprawled out like Kate Winslet.
"Huh huh.
Now, the basic idea of French Girls is that users anonymously post selfies and then other users draw them from within the app.
It's fun.
So, I added another selfie - one where it looks like I'm grasping at the air -- and somebody actually did turn me into a nude.
And it's obvious that he put literally seconds into his effort.
Because here's how the app works: When you want to start drawing, you are given a choice of nine different images.
Anyway, despite a severe lack of artistic ability, drawing my blue girl was a creative way to kill some time when I could've dangerously been interacting with other actual humans.
Because next thing you know a friend invites you to get outside and go to the pool.
