Guangzhou, China (CNN) -- In a voice alternating between desperate and hopeful, Qu Feifei talked to her daughter continuously Tuesday afternoon through a window left ajar at the main military hospital in this southern Chinese city.
While the initial video went viral on Chinese Internet, state-run newspapers and television stations have since seized on the story, turning their spotlight on an unlikely hero as well as many villains.
Camera crews chased Chen for interviews, while local government and businesses fought to award her money.
Wang's mother said in tears that she still couldn't comprehend the behavior of the passersby but wanted to focus on the positive.
"I'm so grateful for all the nice people," Qu said.
