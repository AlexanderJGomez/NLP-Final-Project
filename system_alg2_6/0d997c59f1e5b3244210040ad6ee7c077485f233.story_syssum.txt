Cooper.
A retired law enforcement officer brought a tip to the FBI about a year ago, said Fred Gutt, a spokesman for the FBI's Seattle Field Office.
Cooper.
"Cooper was a quiet man who appeared to be in his mid-forties, wearing a business suit with a black tie and white shirt," the FBI said in a summary of the case on its website.
But Cooper jumped out of the plane.
The "D.B."
"We originally thought Cooper was an experienced jumper, perhaps even a paratrooper," said Special Agent Larry Carr in 2007.
Agents also believe Cooper had no help on the ground.
"But Cooper simply said, 'Fly to Mexico,' and he had no idea where he was when he jumped," authorities said.
Fred Gutt said while the FBI understands there is great public interest in this long-unsolved case "it's a fairly low-priority case for the FBI" as it pursues new investigations involving cases like missing children that have a current impact on public safety.
Even so, Gutt said the FBI always follows up on any new tips on the case.
