South Africa is a country adrift.
Mandela's passing will not herald any shock new direction, but his funeral took place against the backdrop of massive political and economic disappointment, most powerfully demonstrated by the booing of Zuma -- for traditional Africans an unprecedented break with culture -- at Mandela's memorial service at the FNB stadium on December 10.
Thabo Mbeki, Mandela's successor who was removed from the presidency by Zuma in 2008, said last week that there was increasing frustration among ordinary people about the direction the country was taking.
Ordinary South Africans inured to corruption told me last week that they have no doubt that his hiring was corruptly influenced.
Members of the ruling ANC and society are now asking questions about the current crop of leaders' ability to get South Africa out of its current slump.
Doomsayers have beaten this drum many times before in the past 19 years, even when Mandela left government in 1999.
The young are ubiquitous on the streets and they are now being attracted in significant numbers by the young, former ANC radical Julius Malema's breakaway party Economic Freedom Fighters.
In the meantime, South Africa will have a noisy election in 2014, remain on an unremarkable growth path and fail to live up to the promise it showed when Mandela became president in 1994.
