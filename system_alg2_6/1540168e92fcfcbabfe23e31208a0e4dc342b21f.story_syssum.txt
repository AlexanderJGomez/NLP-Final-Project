It's commonplace in this country now: A deranged shooter appears, armed to the teeth, out of his mind.
The Second Amendment!
James Madison and the others who framed this single sentence understood perfectly well that you can't have unregulated mobs running around in the streets with guns.
Patrick Henry, George Mason and James Madison knew, as they considered the Second Amendment, that it would be essential if they hoped to get the Southern states to ratify the brand-new U.S. Constitution.
James Madison, a slave-holder himself, had no doubt about the need to keep these slave militias going in the South.
In fact, at its headquarters in Washington, the words of the amendment are emblazoned right in front of the entrance.
There just is no right for the individual to bear arms in the Bill of Rights.
Of course, the Supreme Court did an end run in recent years around what the framers of the Bill of Rights actually intended.
It should be just fine to belong to a gun club and shoot skeet or whatever.
It's time for us to revisit the Second Amendment and get every assault weapon off the streets, for good.
