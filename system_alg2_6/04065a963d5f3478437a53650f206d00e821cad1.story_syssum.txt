Editor's note: Dr. Vance Harris is a primary care physician in Redding, California.
Fewer and fewer medical students are choosing primary care and many primary care doctors are leaving the field.
The cost savings to the system is thousands of dollars each and every time I am willing to make the call and go with the treatment.
My reward is about $55 from Medicare and private health insurers.
How many diabetics do I struggle with, trying to get them to take better care of themselves?
Having me in the system has resulted in savings in the hundreds of thousands of dollars each and every year.
Isn't it a shame that after all this time and with skills honed by decades of experience, many of us can no longer afford to work as a physician?
I know this is true because I am struggling to find a primary care doctor to take care of my wife and myself.
