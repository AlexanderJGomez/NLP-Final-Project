The weather here is spectacular.
But the president (and the country) must listen closely to the trends coming from here, because what starts in California often ends up spreading across the country.
There is a state budget deficit which would make even the eurozone blush.
Over the past few years, California has made deep cuts in education, social services, and even releasing some prisoners early to save money.
In the past, when California fell on hard times, it could rely on a rising national economy to pick up the slack.
What I am suggesting is that the European austerity, which so far has not hit most of America, has well and truly arrived.
