"The Middle East likes to use words like 'iconic' and 'world class,'" says Anthony Mosellie, a managing principal at Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates, the architecture firm in charge of the Abu Dhabi Midfield Terminal Complex design.
Doha's impending Hamad International Airport will house the world's second longest runway, while Istanbul and Dubai are competing for the title of world's largest airport.
Perhaps more telling than the various design features are the airports' planned capacities; combined, they will ultimately accommodate 450 million passengers a year -- a significant jump from the 140 million that currently make their way through the region.
It seems it will be quite difficult for them to reach their aspirations when you view them in a cluster," says Rend Stephan, partner and managing director of The Boston Consulting Group.
In Dubai, aviation already accounts for 28% of the city's GDP -- a figure that's expected to grow to 35% once the new airport is fully operational.
By the end of the year, we should reach 66 million," says Riley.
But they are quite strong, and I have no doubt this will continue into the foreseeable future," he says.
Riley admits that there won't be room for two Dubai airports.
