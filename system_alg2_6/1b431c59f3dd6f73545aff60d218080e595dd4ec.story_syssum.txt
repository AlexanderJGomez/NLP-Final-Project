(CNN) -- Israeli police have stepped up their search for a New Jersey man who went missing while hiking in a forest outside Jerusalem.
The friend "lost contact" with Sofer while walking with him and reported the disappearance to the police, Rosenfeld said.
"There are concerns, as we all know, about the possibility of abduction," Smith said, according to CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey.
