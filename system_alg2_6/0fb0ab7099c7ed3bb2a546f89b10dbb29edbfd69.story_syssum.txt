(CNN) -- As captain of the Neptune tugboat, Viktor Nikolsky spends his days gently directing giant cargo vessels in and around the vast port of St. Petersburg, Russia.
"When they saw what kind of cargo they were surprised," Nikolsky said.
A U.S. Navy ship kept watch of the Faina from a distance while pirates patrolled the decks.
"The crew was under control all the time.
They left, and the ship and crew free to go.
He told us that everything was clear and all the pirates left the vessel."
"Sometimes when I dream I see the very clear water and my ship moving over the clear water in open sea," he said.
