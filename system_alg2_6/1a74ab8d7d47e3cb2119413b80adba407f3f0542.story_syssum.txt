Over the last week, thousands seeking free medical care have turned up at the mobile health care clinic set up by Remote Area Medical, a non-profit organization founded by Brock.
On the final day of the Los Angeles operation, Brock said crowds were still gathering with the hope of receiving care.
RAM has had to turn away some patients because it didn't have enough volunteers to provide treatment.
"We could have come to Los Angeles 15 years ago and I guarantee there would have been just as big of a turnout of patients," he told CNN.
In that isolated area, it would take 26 days on foot to reach care, Brock recalled, and he wanted to find a way to bring medical care to such remote areas.
Brock's day starts at 4 a.m. and runs well into the night.
