The United States pumped 3.7% less carbon dioxide into the air in 2012 than in the previous year; Europe 1.8% less.
Globally, greenhouse gases are being emitted at a slower rate this year than they were last year, and in both years the climb in emissions was less intense than in the past decade taken as a whole, said researchers at Britain's East Anglia University.
Not only must the increase stop, the researchers said, but industrialized nations must achieve a global reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
On an individual basis, China and the EU were at the same level, with 7.7 tons of carbon gas emitted per person and year.
