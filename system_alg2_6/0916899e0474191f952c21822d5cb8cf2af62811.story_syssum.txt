Events include everything from chocolate-shoe molding workshops to sleepovers with chocolate and wine pairings, do-it-yourself chocolate artwork (with white, dark and Belgian milk chocolate serving as paint material) and an in-room chocolate fountain.
The on-site Chocolate Spa offers treatments like the Whipped Cocoa Bath, the Chocolate Bean Polish and the Chocolate Fondue Wrap.
It culminates in a chocolate bar workshop and tasting.
The real sugar rush comes from the Three Ways' special chocolate indulgence package, which includes a box of handmade chocolates, a chocolate-featured snack, dinner and breakfast, a chocolate treasure hunt and, finally, a chocolate cookery demonstration and tasting.
