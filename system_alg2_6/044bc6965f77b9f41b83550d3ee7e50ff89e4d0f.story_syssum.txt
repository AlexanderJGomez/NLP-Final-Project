The sweat-stained sheets of Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, still on her bed, a woman quarantined in a Dallas apartment said Thursday that she desperately wants her family's nightmare to end.
She said no one brought food Thursday to four people who can't leave to get it themselves, at least until later in the day.
"But (authorities) said we shouldn't throw anything away until they can get back with me," Louise said.
And Louise, her son and her nephews must wait 21 days from when Duncan first showed symptoms before they can leave the apartment.
"We have some hygiene issues that we are addressing in that apartment," Jenkins said earlier in the day.
On September 25, she took him to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital where, Louise said, hospital staff were told twice that Duncan had come from Liberia.
But Wayne doesn't want his 13-year-old son, who is the youngest person quarantined in the apartment of his mother, Louise -- to know that what he's feeling.
He said that Duncan had come to Texas to "help his son" and visit his family.
(Louise said she didn't think she had.)
Still, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta said the continuing presence of the sheets, on which Duncan may have transmitted the virus through sweating, are disturbing.
