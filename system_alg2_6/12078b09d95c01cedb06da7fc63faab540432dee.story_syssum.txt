I see signs of a revolution everywhere.
I see it in the faces of good parents, uprooting their lives to get medicine for their children -- and in the children themselves, such as Charlotte, who went from having 300 seizures a week to just one or two a month.
I see this medical marijuana revolution in surprising places.
Even as a grown man, mom can still make my cheeks turn red and shatter my confidence with a single word.
I had my own turn around a couple of years ago, and at the time it was a lonely place to hold a supportive position on medical marijuana.
Even worse, I didn't even know if they would care.
This time around, you will hear from the heads of government agencies earnestly sharing their point of view, both Democratic and Republican senators, and even the President of the United States.
Make no mistake, we have plenty of evidence that the approval and support of the federal government can fast track a revolution at a faster pace than we have yet seen.
There are no shortage of examples where the federal government has been a guardian of our public health needs, and you could argue that medical marijuana would also qualify as a worthwhile investment.
