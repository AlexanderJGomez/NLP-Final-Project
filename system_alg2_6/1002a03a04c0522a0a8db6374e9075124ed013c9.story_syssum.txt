Russia agreed to a 30 percent drop in the price of natural gas sold to Ukraine, in exchange for permission to extend Russia's lease of a major naval base in the Black Sea port of Sevastopol, Ukraine, for 25 years.
"The prolongation of the Black Sea Fleet's presence in Sevastopol is essential to Russia," Yanukovych said on Wednesday.
Former President Yuschenko's "Our Ukraine" party said the treaty would lead to the "Russification" of Ukraine.
